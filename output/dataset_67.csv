   1 On the trial date, the offender pleaded guilty to the offence that, on 25 September 2006 at Smithfield, he drove in a manner dangerous and thereby caused the death of another person contrary to s 52A (1)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900.2 The maximum available penalty is ten tears imprisonment.The Accident 3 The offender drove south along the Cumberland Highway, Smithfield, within the speed limit of 60 km per hour. Where the Cumberland Highway intersects with Brennan Street, he drove through a red light without slowing. His vehicle collided with the deceased's vehicle, causing the death of the deceased. In the course of the accident, the offender injured his head. He has no clear recollection of the accident. 4 The parties agree that the offender was “momentarily inattentive” when he failed to observe the amber and red lights. The offender's brother died a couple of months before the accident. The offender had been very close to his brother, who was also his next-door neighbour. The offender had been attempting to reconcile with his estranged wife, who resided in the United States. She died suddenly, two weeks before the accident. I accept that the offender's ""monetary inattention"" was due to distraction associated with these recent tragedies. The Deceased’s Manner Of Driving 5 The Crown submitted that the deceased entered the intersection from Brennan Street, to the offender's right, in accordance with a green light. The offender submitted that the Crown cannot exclude the possibility that the deceased drove north along the Cumberland Highway, attempted an illegal right-hand turn into Brennan Street, and drove across the path of the offender’s vehicle. The offender argued that, on the alternative scenario, his culpability is lower.6 The Cumberland Highway and Brennan Street do not intersect at right angles. An aerial view of the intersection was provided in Exhibit 2, Figure 3.7 A green light for Brennan Street traffic was triggered only by a vehicle or pedestrian. Once the trigger was activated, an amber light was displayed to southbound Cumberland Highway traffic for 4.5 seconds, then a red light was displayed in both directions for two seconds. Thereafter, the light facing the Cumberland Highway remained red for a further five seconds, while the light facing Brennan Street is green for five seconds. 8 The drivers of other southbound vehicles said that, when the impact occurred the Cumberland Highway lights were red and southbound cars were stopped at the lights, four or five cars deep. The witness Mr Berkeley said that the lights turned green approximately five seconds after the impact. The witness Mr Hart was certain that the deceased’s vehicle came from Brennan Street.9 The evidence of the light phasing and the evidence of the other southbound drivers is consistent with the Brennan Street lights having just turned green, permitting the deceased's vehicle to enter the intersection from Brennan Street. The evidence sits poorly with the alternative scenario that the deceased attempted to ""run the red light"". If southbound cars were stationary four or five deep, the Cumberland Highway lights must have been red for two to three seconds and any attempt by the deceased to ""run the red light"" would have been extremely foolish.10 Mr Sculthorpe, a motor vehicle accident reconstructionist called by the prosecution, relied on vehicle damage profiles and post-collision vehicle movements to conclude that the deceased entered the intersection from Brennan Street, as illustrated in Exhibit D, Figure 9.11 The only evidence supporting the alternative scenario was that of Mr Joy, a traffic engineering and road safety consultant called by the offender. He said that the vehicle damage profiles showed an offset head-on impact. The damage profiles, including the damage to the floor rail of the deceased's vehicle made the alternative scenario more likely. Mr Joy opined that the vehicles impacted at a 20° angle, when the offender's vehicle was travelling at 55 km per hour and the deceased’s vehicle was travelling at 9 km per hour.12 Mr Joy agreed that the prosecution scenario was possible. On that scenario, the vehicles impacted head–on at a 40° angle, when the offender's vehicle was travelling at 58 km per hour and the deceased's vehicle was travelling at 17 km per hour. Mr Joy conceded that the post-impact rotation of the deceased's vehicle 270° in a clockwise direction may have been more likely with a 40° collision because that would have involved a greater offset and therefore more rotation.13 Given Mr Joy's concession, and because Mr Sculthorpe's opinion is supported by the evidence of light phasing and the lay evidence, I have no doubt that Mr Sculthorpe's opinion is correct. The deceased entered the intersection from Brennan Street in accordance with a green light.14 The offender’s culpable conduct was ""momentary inattention"" and the resulting failure to observe amber and red lights. That conduct had nothing to do with the deceased. 15 In any event, an offender's culpability under s 52A (1) (c) of the Crimes Act 1900 is to be assessed by reference to his own conduct, not that of the deceased. Section 52A provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A person is guilty of the offence of dangerous driving occasioning death if the vehicle driven by the person is involved in an impact occasioning the death of another person and the driver was, at the time of the impact, driving the vehicle:  
         
        … 
         
        (c ) in a manner dangerous to another person or persons.  
         
        … 
         
        (8) It is a defence to any charge under this section if the death … occasioned by the impact was not in any way attributable …:  
         
        … 
         
        (c) to the manner in which the vehicle was driven.” 
        
       
      
    16 In order to prove the offence, the Crown need only establish that an accused drove a vehicle that was involved in an impact occasioning death and that, at the time of the impact, the accused was driving the vehicle in a manner dangerous to another person. Pursuant to s 52A(8), The accused will be exonerated only if it is established that the death ""was not in any way attributable"" to his/her manner of driving (emphasis added). Under s 52A, there is no scope for apportioning responsibility between an accused and a deceased in the way in which responsibility may be apportioned in civil proceedings.Objective Seriousness of Offence17 The guideline judgements of R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343 and cases such as R v Khatter [2000] NSWCCA 32 refer to the spectrum of culpable conduct ranging from cases involving ""momentary inattention or misjudgement "" at one extreme to cases involving an ""abandonment of responsibility"" at the other. In Whyte, a typical case was identified, as were typical aggravating features. The Court confirmed that a full-time custodial sentence should usually be imposed, unless there is a low level of moral culpability, such as ""momentary inattention or misjudgement"", although the converse does not necessarily apply (at [214]). A sentencing judge must make a clear finding on where on the continuum of culpability an offence lies: R v Samadi [2006] NSWCCA 308, [21].18 In this case, the offender’s culpable conduct had one facet, ""momentary inattention"" and the associated failure to observe amber and red lights. His conduct was inadvertent rather than deliberate. The offender was distracted because of the recent loss of his brother and estranged wife. The failure to observe the lights lasted for five or six seconds. No aggravating feature was present. I find that the offender’s culpability was low. It may not have been at the very lowest end of the spectrum because it lasted for five or six seconds, but was close to that end.19 The case bears the features of the Whyte ""typical case"", except that the offender is not a young offender. In some respects, age tells in his favour. It adds significance to his lack of a prior criminal or traffic history, although persons who commit dangerous driving offences are often of prior good character and that factor may be of less relevance in such cases. In so far as the ""typical case"" contemplates that a plea of guilty was entered at the earliest reasonable opportunity, this case differs because the plea was entered on the day fixed for the trial.20 The Crown concedes that, because of the offender’s low moral culpability, the Court is not bound to impose a sentence of full-time imprisonment.Subjective Circumstances21 The offender is 54 years old. He lives with his teenage son and adult daughter, both of whom are students and financially dependent on the offender. The offender is a forklift driver and storeman. He has no prior criminal or traffic record. The offender is a very experienced driver. He has held a driver's licence for many years. For several years prior to the accident, he drove to and from work, one hour each way. 22 The offender was raised in Vietnam. At the end of the civil war, the offender migrated to the United States as a refugee. The remainder of his family came to Australia. The offender married in the United States. In 2000, the offender separated from his wife and migrated to Australia with his children. He has permanent resident status.23 As a result of injuries that he sustained in the accident, the offender was hospitalised for three days after the accident. He underwent surgery to a broken ankle. The injury has healed well and he is left with minimal disability. He suffers from lower back pain.Other Considerations24 I bear in mind the sentencing objectives set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Of particular importance are the objectives of general deterrence and recognition of harm to the victim, the victim's family and the community.25 I have considered the provisions of s 21A (2) and (3) of the Act. In so far as those provisions are relevant to the present case, they form part of the ""typical case"". I have referred to the offender's prior good character and lack of prior criminal record. It is most unlikely that he will reoffend. The Crown concedes that he has shown remorse within the meaning of s 21A (3).26 I have considered the JIRS statistics.27 The offender's counsel submitted that a suspended sentence under s 12 of the Act was warranted. In my view, such a sentence would be too lenient. Whatever the merits of the offender's subjective case, his conduct was not at the very lowest end of the spectrum of culpability and it must not be forgotten that his conduct resulted in the loss of a life.28 I have considered the contents of the pre-sentence report. Although the offender has been assessed as unsuitable for periodic detention, I consider that such an order should be imposed. I do not accept that his work and family commitments render him unsuitable. The offender's adult daughter and other relatives are able to assist with his teenage son. Work commitments are no reason to exclude the sentencing option of periodic detention. Subject to the offender signing an appropriate undertaking, I am satisfied of the requirements in s 66 of the Act. I intend to impose a non-parole period of 22 months and a balance of term of eight months.

    JUDGMENT1 I am going to refer to you as TM because you are a juvenile and the law says that your name is not to be published outside this court. So if my sentence is published it will not identify you except by initials.2 I am sentencing a young man for a very serious crime. TM is now eighteen but just before Christmas 2008 when he was still seventeen he participated in an armed robbery of a bottle shop at Cherrybrook. It was not an ordinary armed robbery, it was an armed robbery by three young men including TM. In addition, one of the young men was armed with a machete and another young man was armed with a pistol. Hence the kind of armed robbery which TM participated in is called armed robbery with a dangerous weapon under the Crimes Act of New South Wales 1900. Section 92(2) of that Act says that a crime of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon carries a maximum of twenty five years imprisonment. Twenty-five years imprisonment is the longest sentence which the Crimes Act provides for apart from life imprisonment. This crime, in other words, is in the same category as crimes such as manslaughter and sexual intercourse with a child under ten. It is a very serious offence.3 I should start by describing in a little more detail what happened. It was a Saturday night at about 9.30. There was a Liquorland Bottle Shop in a shopping centre in Cherrybrook. The member of staff who worked there that night was himself just nineteen years of age. Three men came into the shop. At the time the assistant was, in fact, talking to one of his customers, a young man aged only twenty. TM was one of the young men who came in. They had dark hoods pulled over their heads and they were wearing black balaclavas which disguised their faces. One of the young men was armed with a 60 centimetre machete. The other had an 8 inch long silver pistol. The young man armed with the machete held it against the customer’s neck. One of the young men said “Do you want blood. This is for real”. 4 The facts which are agreed and are part of exhibit A say that both of the victims were in fear for their life. They thought they would be shot or stabbed. In fact, the young man who was the customer was so frightened he dropped to his knees and put his hand on his head. The robbers knocked over a display. They ordered the attendant to open the safe. One of the men then held the machete to the back of the attendant. They took some money and some cigarettes. The money was a little under nine hundred and fifty dollars. On the way out a security guard was approaching the scene but the young man armed with the pistol pointed it at the security guard who wisely stopped in his progress. Police were alerted. It was obviously regarded as a very serious crime. Anti-theft units attended, the Dog Squad and the police Air Wing were activated.5 The young men including TM were found and arrested. A gym bag was found containing gloves, jackets, balaclavas and the proceeds to the robbery. Police cannot determine which young man had the machete and which young man had the pistol. That does not matter all that much because all three were guilty fully of the same crime and participated obviously in full knowledge of the fact that two of them were armed. 6 It is important in crimes such as this to note the impact which they have on the victims of the crime. The attendant remembered one of the young men saying when he was standing very close “Do you want some blood? This is for real!”. The young men were shouting. The attendant said that during the whole incident he was scared for his life. He was shaking and felt sick. This comes as no surprise. It will, as Mr Singh who appeared for TM correctly acknowledged, be an experience which the bottle shop attendant will never forget, nor will the customer ever forget. He said in his statement that the number one thing that was going through his head was “I’m going to be shot”. In fact, he heard one of the men say “Should I shoot him?”. He also heard “Do you want blood? Is there going to be blood?”. He described the tone of the voices as very aggressive. He said that during the whole episode he felt very unsafe. He felt like he was having an anxiety attack. He felt his life was threatened.7 As I said none of this is surprising. It was a very confronting and violent episode. When I say “violent” I mean violence in the circumstances of the confrontation. I do not mean that actual physical violence was inflicted upon any of the victims.8 The impact on victims of these sorts of crimes is taken into account by Parliament in fixing a maximum of twenty-five years imprisonment. This case does not fall within the category envisaged by s 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 where the emotional harm was substantial. That is not to underrate the effects which the crime had on the young men who were its victims.9 There are a number of aggravating features apart from the ones that I have mentioned about this crime. It is serious enough in itself but, in fact, it was committed by TM when he had been granted liberty by another court. On 25 July 2008 the Parramatta Children’s Court had to deal with him for an offence of aggravated entering a building within intent and in company. That too is a very serious crime. The Children’s Magistrate obviously decided to be lenient to TM. The Magistrate granted him a twelve month good behaviour bond. Instead of using that good behaviour bond to get on with the process of sorting his life out, TM committed this crime only five months or so after getting that bond. When a criminal commits a crime when the criminal is on what is called “conditional liberty” - a bond or bail are examples - that is an aggravating feature of the crime.10 TM has a criminal record. It is short but contains at least one significant entry, that is the one I have already referred to of aggravated entering a building with intent and in company. Additionally, he has been dealt with for possessing a knife in a public place. That is not a good thing to have on his record when I am dealing with him for a crime involving the use of a machete.11 A further aggravating factor of this crime was that it was committed not just by one person but by three. Committing a crime in company with others is regarded by Parliament as more serious because of the threat that the confrontation by a number of people presents to the victims.12 A further aggravating feature of this crime is that it was obviously planned to some extent. The offenders had to obtain the weapons. In addition, they had clothes which I have described in order to disguise themselves and the police found gloves in the bag as well. 13 A further feature which aggravates this crime is that one of the victims, namely the bottle shop attendant, was regarded by Parliament as particularly vulnerable. Section 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act lists aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining an appropriate sentence. Clause (l) is a factor relevantly described as a vulnerable victim, for example, someone who was vulnerable because of the victim’s occupation. Examples are a bank teller or service station attendant. I am satisfied that the bottle shop attendant fell within that category of vulnerable persons which aggravates the offence in this case.14 I have a good amount of material before me about TM’s personal circumstances. Because of his age he has been assessed by the Department of Juvenile Justice and a couple of very helpful reports have been prepared and supplied to me.15 TM comes from a disrupted background in this sense. His father from whom his mother separated some time ago was a former police officer. He was discharged from the Police Force. It seems that at least one reason for the discharge that he was a heroin addict. The history taken by the Juvenile Justice officer also records that there was alcohol abuse by both parents and domestic violence. TM’s mother at least one stage had to seek refuge in a women’s refuge because of the violence going on at home. TM’s mother is in a better position in life now and is able to support him in the circumstances that he now finds himself. In addition, he has a supportive elder brother, Luke.16 The Juvenile Justice officer noted that TM was unable to explain why he committed the robbery adequately. His explanation was that his mother was not able to “buy me stuff”. He was not able to elaborate on what he meant by “buying me stuff”.17 The Juvenile Justice officer noted that to some degree he understood the impact of what he had done on the victims but also noted that “he demonstrated limited insight and remorse for his offending behaviour, yet indicated that it should not have occurred”. 18 TM was interested in joining the Australian Army but was not successful which had an impact on him. He has had very limited experience in employment. There are no issues concerning drug or alcohol so far as he, himself, is concerned.19 He has been in custody since his arrest on 6 December 2008. He seems to be settling in well although once he turned eighteen in January this year he discontinued schooling in custody. 20 In assessing TM the authors of the report - which became exhibit B and was dated 5 March 2009 - noted that it would appear that his attitude to the reasons for committing the offence would need to be addressed. It acknowledged his exposure to violence, abuse of alcohol and other drugs and the obvious impact which this had on TM’s life. TM is also supported by his brother William and by an uncle, David Murchison. The authors of the report sensibly suggested some courses and programs which would be of assistance whilst TM is in custody.21 An up to date custody report dated 3 April 2009 notes that he interacts well with his peers and responds well to staff. It observes that he is polite and respectful and displays mature behaviour complying with directions and the daily routine. He participates in activities that are offered to him and is particularly keen on physical activity.22 He has signed a letter directed to the staff of the Liquorland which he held up at Cherrybrook, apologising for his behaviour and offering no excuses. In fact, he acknowledged that his own mother had had some experience at being held up in the course of her employment at one stage. He said that he had spent a month in custody and had time to reflect on his actions. He repeated his apology. Clearly that letter was written during January this year and Mr Singh who appears for TM informed me that the letter was delivered yesterday afternoon. The delay in the delivery was explained by uncertainty as to the appropriate persons to whom it should be delivered.23 TM’s brother, William, has written a letter about his brother, pointing out the difficulties which both young men confronted in their family with their violent and drug addicted father. William sees his brother a couple of times per week and is encouraging him about the life choices which he now needs to make. He is obviously supportive of his brother and behind efforts which he may make to rehabilitate himself as well as any efforts to secure employment.24 An important feature which I have not mentioned yet is that TM pleaded guilty to this offence and the prosecution accepts that his plea of guilty occurred at the earliest available opportunity. 25 One of the things which I have to decide in a case such as this is provided for by the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. Section 18 provides that I need to decide whether to deal with TM according to law or according to the more limited and lenient options available under the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act in the Children’s Court. What I have to take into account is the seriousness of the offence that he was charged with and how serious an example that kind of offence was committed by TM. In addition, I am able to take into account his age and maturity when he committed the offence and the seriousness and nature of any prior convictions as well as any other relevant matters. 26 Most of those factors are against TM. As I said the crime that he is charged with carries a maximum of twenty five years imprisonment. Only life imprisonment is more serious. The seriousness of the particular crime committed by TM, as I have described it, is aggravated by many features and I regard it as a particularly serious example of that kind of crime. He was nearly eighteen when he committed this crime and has at least one serious item on his criminal record. I regard, taking into account those factors, that it is appropriate that I deal with this matter according to law.27 I need to take into account in reaching a sentence the fact that TM is a young person. The factors which influence a court in sentencing young offenders are additional to the factors which the court takes into account in sentencing an adult offender. For that reason sentences imposed on young offenders will often be significantly lower than those imposed on adults. 28 Another factor which is indirectly relevant is a guideline judgment delivered by the Court of Criminal Appeal concerning the offence of armed robbery. The guideline judgement is R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. That is for what might be described as a straightforward armed robbery against s 97(1) of the Crimes Act. That carries a maximum of twenty years.29 The guideline judgment lists a number of factors which judges take into account which the court described as common to many of these offences. One of those factors is that the offender is young with little or no criminal history. TM was young but had a significant item on his criminal record. Another factor is that the weapon used was like a knife or something capable of inflicting serious injury. The weapons in this case were a machete and a firearm. The firearm is regarded so seriously that it is described by the law as a dangerous weapon. Another factor which the guideline judgment in Henry refers to is the limited degree of planning. There was what I would describe as more than a limited degree of planning in this case. It was probably not planned extensively but it was far from being a spontaneous effort given the weapons which were used and the efforts to disguise the offenders. Other factors are relevant to this case such as no actual violence, a victim being vulnerable such as a shopkeeper and a plea of guilty. One of the factors is the small amount taken. It is difficult to classify this: it does not fall into the category of thousands of dollars, nevertheless it is not far short of one thousand dollars.30 The guideline judgment in Henry’s case suggests that for sentences for offences of the kind containing the sorts of factors referred to generally fall between four and five years of imprisonment for the full term. This case is more serious than the case envisaged by the guideline in Henry. I would regard an appropriate sentence as being in the range of six years imprisonment for an offence such as this. 31 However TM has pleaded guilty. That has saved the resources of the court considerably as acknowledged by Mr Low who appears for the prosecutor. I propose to allow TM the full discount of twenty-five per-cent which the law permits for that plea of guilty. I therefore regard an appropriate sentence in this case as four and a half years which will be the sentence which I will impose shortly. 32 It is normal - and I will in this case - to set a non parole period. That is the period which an offender must remain in prison before being eligible to be released. Normally the non parole period is three-quarters of the full sentence. That ratio can be altered if special circumstances are demonstrated. Mr Singh argues that there are special circumstances in this case. He refers to his client’s age and to the fact that it is his client’s first time in custody. He argues that a longer than usual period on parole would be needed to assist with this young man’s rehabilitation. That submission is not opposed by Mr Low.33 Mr Singh suggested an appropriate sentence would be within the range of three years with eighteen months non parole. I have already determined that three years is an insufficiently heavy sentence for the serious crime which TM committed. In addition, Mr Low argued that a sentence of three years would be erroneously low. I have determined that an appropriate non parole period would be two years which will allow a very generous two and a half years on parole for TM to use the resources which are offered to him to get his life back on to track with the support offered by his family, especially his mother, his older brother and his uncle.34 I am going to sentence you now, if you would stand up. TM for the offence of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon I set a non parole period of two years to commence when you went into custody on 6 December 2008 and to expire on 5 December 2010. The balance of the term will be two and a half years commencing on 6 December 2010 and expiring on 5 June 2013. The overall sentence is, therefore, four and a half years from 6 December 2008 to 5 June 2013.HIS HONOUR: Mr Singh and Mr Low, it is over three years so I do not make an order for parole, am I right? Section 50 does not apply?LOW: Yes, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Section 50 does not apply?SINGH: No.LOW: No, it doesn’t.HIS HONOUR: Now, what other orders do I need to make?LOW: The only other issue would be to where he is to serve the terms of that section.HIS HONOUR: Thank you what is that section?LOW: Section 19 of the Criminal Practice and Procedure Act.HIS HONOUR: The Criminal Practice and Procedure Act or is it the--LOW: It is the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. HIS HONOUR: And it obviously should be served in a detention centre, do you agree Mr Low?LOW: It is well within the period of twenty-one years and six months which he may have to have serve up to your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Yes.35 Under s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 I make an order directing that the whole of the term of the sentence of imprisonment which I have just imposed be served as a juvenile offender.HIS HONOUR: I will explain all that to TM in a moment. Are there any other matters that I need to attend to, Mr Low?LOW: No your Honour.SINGH: Yes your Honour. The plea was entered in the Children’s Court. I wonder if it is on record that he has adhered to his plea in this court, your Honour, because I would say he would adhere and would have adhered if the question was asked.HIS HONOUR: Thank you, that is now on the record that he has adhered to his plea, thank you. I should convict him too.I formally convict him of the offence.HIS HONOUR: Anything else gentlemen?SINGH: That is all.36 TM stand up again. You have four and a half years. You have heard me say why. That is because what you did was a very serious crime. You got yourself into the league of twenty-five years imprisonment, that kind of offence and you have heard me compare it with other sorts of crimes. You did a really bad thing and it was aggravated for a number of reasons, you got yourself into a very bad league. For the reasons that I have given I have decided that four and a half years is the appropriate prison sentence. You will serve that as a juvenile not as an adult. It commences when you went into juvenile detention on 6 December 2008, so the four and a half years finishes on 5 June 2013. But you have a non parole period of two years. So that you are eligible for parole - it is not something I order- you are eligible for parole on 5 December 2010 and that is the first opportunity you will have to go onto parole. Do you understand?OFFENDER: Yes 37 Now use the time. You have been using it well by the sounds of it whilst you were in custody. This is my advice, it is not part of the order. People in juvenile detention are very experienced. They know what they are doing. They are used to helping young men such as you. You are lucky. You have a very supportive family, that is really important in your rehabilitation. Your family and the people in juvenile detention can help you get your life back on track. To your credit you do not have any drug issue. You do not have any alcohol issues, so you have the potential with all that support to get yourself back on track. Use those resources. Let everyone who is prepared to help you, help you because they know what they are doing.Do you understand?OFFENDER: Yes.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: Before the Court are three appeals by the Crown asserting that sentences imposed on the respondents by Ellis DCJ at Parramatta District Court on 22 September 2008 were manifestly inadequate. The principal offence by each respondent was committed when he was involved in an incursion into the premises of the Gladesville Bowling and Sports Club (the Club) on 28 January 2008.  
     
      
    2 The respondents had pleaded guilty in the Local Court to charges which I will later detail and on committals for sentence the facts were put before the District Court by tender of the respective prosecution briefs.  
     
      
    3 At about 10.15 pm on 13 January 2008, a high performance Mitsubishi Lancer vehicle was stolen at Drummoyne from the owner in circumstances commonly referred to as carjacking. The respondents are not charged with any offence in connection with this occurrence, however, at about 10.20 pm on 28 January 2008 the respondent Pettersen drove that vehicle to the club with four passengers, the other two respondents and men named Adler and Hamouzian. At the time the vehicle was displaying false registration plates which had been substituted for the genuine plates which were attached when it had been taken on 13 January. 
     
      
    4 At that hour the Club was not trading but four contract cleaners were working inside the premises. Fell, Bendt, Adler and Hamouzian alighted from the car wearing facial disguises and gloves. Bendt used a hammer to smash a glass doorway at the rear of the Club and the four men entered thereby. Adler produced a silver coloured handgun and pointed it at one of the cleaners saying, “Don’t let me use it, lay down.” The cleaners complied. Bendt was standing next to Adler at the time. Two of the intruders then went to the bar and opened the cash register. Whilst inside the premises Bendt was carrying a scanner.  
     
      
    5 As three of them gathered in the bar area attempting to locate money and control the cleaning staff, they turned their attention to trying to open an automatic teller machine. Hamouzian went outside and returned with a circular concrete saw. 
     
      
    6 Fell took possession of the hammer from Bendt and commenced to use it to smash the front of the ATM. Adler then handed the handgun to Fell and took the saw and tried to use it to cut into the machine. At this point, an alarm was activated and the four intruders retreated into the Lancer vehicle in which Pettersen was waiting. He then drove away from the Club but police had arrived in the vicinity and sighted the departing car. 
     
      
    7 There followed a pursuit from Gladesville through a number of suburbs. The pursuing police vehicle had its warning devices activated. The Lancer continued on, disobeying a number of traffic control signals. It came to a halt in Dulwich Hill when it stalled after colliding with another vehicle being driven by a member of the public. The five occupants abandoned the Lancer and ran on foot from the police who had arrived at the scene. Initially, the five of them ran in the same general direction and Fell was seen to be in possession of the handgun which he pointed in the direction of the pursuing officers. 
     
      
    8 The offenders were able to flee beyond the immediate range of sight of those in pursuit and the police established a containment perimeter and then instituted a search which was aided by dogs, their handlers and the police air wing.  
     
      
    9 Shortly after the search was initiated, Bendt and Pettersen were tracked by a police dog to where they were huddled on the verandah of one of the houses in the area. When the dog approached them they both began to kick and punch the dog and the handler used capsicum spray to subdue them. They were apprehended with the assistance of other police who had arrived. Both Bendt and Pettersen sustained minor cuts and bruising as a result of their scrimmage with the dog. After arrest they were conveyed to Newtown Police Station where they exercised their right to decline to be interviewed. The continuation of the search located Fell in the rear yard of another house. He struggled with police and was handcuffed but was seen to be attempting to use his hands to access the rear pockets of his trousers. It was feared that he may still have been armed with the handgun which he had earlier pointed at police and a dog was commanded to restrain him. The dog seized Fell causing a deep laceration to his arm. After being subdued in this manner Fell was conveyed to Burwood Police Station. Observation of the injury to his arm caused police to take him to Concord Hospital where he was treated. After treatment he was returned to Burwood Police Station where he participated in a recorded interview, during which he admitted his involvement in the offending at the Club, although he made claims which appeared to be directed at minimizing his role. These claims were, to an extent contradicted by the product of CCTV from the club premises as well as by statements of witnesses. In particular, some claims concerning his being in possession of the silver handgun were contradicted. 
     
      
    10 Although not germane to the issues in these appeals, it can be mentioned that the area search did not locate either Adler or Hamouzian. The contents of the Lancer included items worn by the offenders at the Club and a canvass of the area located other material. Some of these items were submitted for scientific testing including DNA sampling and matching. Adler and Hamouzian were arrested and charged in February and March respectively. We were informed that they had not yet been dealt with for their participation in the raid at the Club. 
     
      
    11 An examination of the content of the Lancer located a circular concrete saw, a hammer and two scanners, as well as items of apparel which had been worn by some of the offenders. 
     
      
    12 This recounting of facts has largely been extracted from a statement included in the briefs, which was in greater detail than the summary and much greater detail than his Honour included in his remarks on sentence. 
     
      
    13 I turn to the individual respondents.  
     
      
       
      NEIL ANDREW PETTERSEN 
       
      
    14 Pettersen pleaded guilty to a charge of aggravated breaking and entering with intent to commit a serious indictable offence contrary to s 113 (2) of the Crimes Act 1900. The circumstance of aggravation was that he was in company. The prescribed maximum penalty for this offence is 14 years imprisonment. It was accepted that Pettersen had not been shown to be aware of the use of the handgun by the other offenders. 
     
      
    15 The judge was asked to take into account on a Form 1 an offence of taking and driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner. This offence referred to what occurred on 28 January and not to the carjacking on 13 January. 
     
      
    16 There was also referred to his Honour for sentence by a certificate under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act, an offence of driving in a manner dangerous. This concerned Pettersen’s conduct in the chase from Gladesville to Dulwich Hill on 28 January. 
     
      
    17 His Honour sentenced Pettersen on the committed charge, and taking into account the matter on the Form 1, to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 22 July 2008 and expiring on 21 July 2010 with a balance term of 1 year 9 months. For the offence on the s 166 certificate he sentenced the respondent to a term of imprisonment commencing on 22 September 2008 and expiring on 21 March 2009. He also ordered that the respondent be disqualified from holding a driver’s licence for 12 months from 22 September 2008 until 21 September 2009, during the whole of which I observe he would be in custody for the sentence on the index charge. 
     
      
    18 As the facts above recounted revealed, Pettersen’s essential role was to drive the stolen car. He told the officer preparing the pre—sentence report that he was unaware that a weapon would be used or that there were going to be people in the building. The first of these claims was obviously accepted and reflected in a level of charge against him (in distinction from the charge against Bendt and Fell) and his Honour found that the Crown had not established that the offenders expected the cleaners to be in the building. 
     
      
    19 The respondent was born in 1982 and was approaching twenty six years of age when the offences were committed. Over eight years before sentence in these matters he had accumulated a significant record of offending. He first appeared at Ryde Local Court on 24 July 2000 when he was fined $400 for destroying or damaging property. On 27 June 2002 the particulars of trial noted his appearance at Sydney District Court for breaking and entering a building to steal and a sentence of 14 months imprisonment commencing on 30 October 2001 and expiring on 29 December 2002 (taking into account unspecified matters on a Form 1), for taking and driving a conveyance, to imprisonment for 10 months commencing on 30 December 2002 and expiring on 29 October 2003 suspended pursuant to s 12 of sentencing legislation and, for using an offensive weapon, to imprisonment for 10 months commencing on 30 October 2001 and expiring on 29 August 2002. 
     
      
    20 On 13 August 2002 at Central Local Court, for taking and driving a conveyance he was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 months commencing on 13 August 2002 and expiring on 12 November 2002, for driving in a manner dangerous to imprisonment for 4 months commencing on 13 August 2002 and expiring on 12 December 2002, for larceny to imprisonment for 2 months commencing on 13 August 2002 and expiring on 12 October 2002 and for goods in custody to a fine of $350. At Sydney District Court on 25 February 2003 he was sentenced for robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 29 May 2005 and expiring on 28 May 2007 with a balance term of 2 years 6 months (taking into account unspecified matters on a Form 1), for a second charge of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon to imprisonment for a fixed term of 3 years commencing on 29 November 2002 and expiring on 28 November 2005 and for aggravated breaking and entering with intent to commit a serious offence to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 29 May 2004 and expiring on 28 May 2006 with a balance term of 1 year 6 months. The respondent was therefore on parole when the current offences took place. On 15 February 2008 the Parole Authority revoked his parole and he was required to serve balance of parole from 28 January 2008 (when he was arrested at Dulwich Hill) until 28 November 2009. 
     
      
    21 His Honour made the following remarks concerning the subjective case presented by Pettersen: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the case of Mr Pettersen, the court takes into account the evidence that he gave in this court. In his case the court also takes into account the two references from the Probation and Parole service report, and the report from Anita Duffey. (sic) The court does not propose to extract material from either of those reports but the court indicates it has closely considered all of the material including background material and the material going toward rehabilitation, in terms of his prospects for rehabilitation and his present position and likely position when he is eventually released from custody, in terms of where he will live and his prospects for employment.” 
        
       
      
    22 His Honour later made express reference to the evidence of expressions of remorse, including those made by the respondent during testimony, and found that “his remorse is genuinely stated.” He noted that Pettersen had obtained employment and had family support but he thought he “needed some assistance with life management skills” which he considered was consequent upon the respondent having been in custody essentially from the age of nineteen until the age of twenty four. 
     
      
    23 As above detailed, the sentence for the principal offence amounted to a total term of 3 years 9 months. That assessment was arrived at after a discount of 25 percent on sentence for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity. Undiscounted, the assessment amounted to a head sentence of 5 years against the statutory maximum of 14 years. The submissions by the Crown in relation to this respondent did not seek to impugn the assessment of 5 years imprisonment as such.  
     
      
    24 Two express errors were contended to have occurred, first, a failure by his Honour to have regard to the objective seriousness of the offence under s113 (2) when setting the commencement date and, second, a failure to apply the principle of totality when directing that the sentence for driving in a manner dangerous be served wholly concurrently with the sentence for the aggravated breaking and entering. 
     
      
    25 When sentencing the respondent on 22 September 2008, the judge was inhibited from setting a commencement date later than the day of sentence by reason of the requirement that the respondent serve the balance of the revoked parole: see s 47 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999: English v R [2008] NSWCCA 134. Nevertheless he retained a discretion to set an earlier commencement date: Callaghan v R [2006] NSWCCA 58. He exercised that discretion by fixing a commencement date of 22 July 2008. As the balance of parole is scheduled to expire on 28 November 2009 and the non-parole period for the s113 (2) offence will expire on 21 July 2010 it can be concluded that the minimum custody for the commission of the latter offence, viewed in isolation, amounts to a little over eight months. It is that effective consequence about which the Crown complains in its first submission. Of course, s 47 abovementioned will permit only an addition of about two months for this aspect because neither his Honour nor this Court could specify a date of commencement later than 22 September 2008. 
     
      
    26 The second contention by the Crown focussed upon the sentence of six months commencing on 22 September 2008 for the offence of driving in a manner dangerous. As already observed, this sentence will be served wholly concurrently with the s 113 (2) offence sentence. The presentation of this offence for sentence pursuant to a s 166 certificate made discretion available to order cumulation and it is the failure to order any cumulation which constitutes the thrust of the Crown submission of error. The Crown argued for total cumulation of this sentence, in the alternative, partial cumulation. 
     
      
    27 It was the ultimate submission by the Crown that the total sentence had become manifestly inadequate by reason of the combination of the backdating of the commencement date of the encompassing term together with the failure to cumulate all or any of the sentence for driving in a manner dangerous. 
     
      
    28 In response to the first submission, counsel for the respondent pointed to the fact that the breach of parole was in fact the commission of the index offence. Thus, although it was accepted that commission of an offence whilst on parole is an aggravating factor capable of increasing the assessment of sentence, it was necessary to bear in mind a need to avoid double punishment or the appearance of it: cf R v Kaiva unreported NSWCCA 9 November 1998. 
     
      
    29 The learned sentencing judge did not elaborate his reasons for selecting the commencement date and stated that he would commence the sentence six months after the current custody commenced upon arrest on 21 January 2008 but simply noted that he had exercised his discretion and had considered totality when he arrived at the date he intended to specify. 
     
      
    30 A clue as to his reasons can be derived from an exchange with counsel when he observed that, but for the sentence he was about to impose, there would have been likely to have been reconsiderations by the Parole Authority which possibly may have led to the restoration of parole during the fairly lengthy balance period. 
     
      
    31 It was submitted that it had not been demonstrated that his Honour’s discretion miscarried. Whilst the Crown asserted error, it did not direct attention to either of the matters relied upon in isolation, and the contention was that the ground of manifest inadequacy should be considered in the light of the asserted combined errors in the exercises of discretion in the sentencing exercise.  
     
      
    32 In response to the second complaint by the Crown, it was said that the offence of driving in a manner dangerous would normally be dealt with in the Local Court. That may be accepted, but that would not prevent the charge being dealt with in the District Court either on a Form 1 or by a s 166 certificate. However, it appears from the transcript of an exchange between the solicitor then appearing for the respondent and his Honour that it was thought that the offence of driving in a manner dangerous should not be included on the Form 1 because that procedure would not enable his Honour to order licence disqualification. The representative of the Crown expressed agreement with what his Honour had been told. The information was inaccurate. To the contrary of what his Honour was told he had an express power to make an ancillary order which, by definition specifically includes a power to order licence disqualification: s 34 (1) and (4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
     
      
    33 Because Pettersen had previous convictions of a relevant kind, his offence of driving in a manner dangerous carried a penalty prescribed for a second or subsequent offence, namely, a maximum of 12 months in terms of imprisonment. As noted, his Honour imposed a fixed term of 6 months imprisonment which was to be served wholly concurrently with the non-parole period for the aggravated breaking and entering offence. He disqualified the respondent from holding a driving licence for twelve months and I have already observed the apparent anomaly that this disqualification will run whilst the respondent is in custody. The Crown did not submit that the assessment of 6 months imprisonment was itself tainted by error. 
     
      
    34 It was contended on behalf of the respondent that, as the offence of driving in a manner dangerous was not included on the Form 1 due to a misapprehension as to the existence of power to disqualify, the issue of inadequacy should be addressed by including a consideration of the outcome that would have been if the offence had been included on a Form 1 as appears likely to have happened but for the misapprehension. This exercise would have involved taking the offence into account in the sentence for the principal offence but would not have involved adding a specific period: see AG’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No 1 of 2002) (2002) 56 NSWLR 146. 
     
      
    35 In summary, it was submitted that the adjustment sought by the Crown can be seen to be essentially constituted by two elements of addition to the term of sentence imposed by his Honour. First, an addition of about two months on the basis that the sentence should have commenced on the day of imposition and not backdated, and second, all or part of the six months sentence for driving in a manner dangerous. 
     
      
    36 The Crown recognized this situation in its submission that, if his Honour had followed the course contended by the Crown, “there would have been an additional 8 months which would have reduced the manifest inadequacy of the overall sentence.” 
     
      
    37 However, when attention is directed to the erroneous basis upon which the offence for driving in a manner dangerous was excluded from being taken into account on the Form 1, it is reasonable to conclude that, if it had been dealt with as it could have been, the enhancement of the overall term would have been something significantly less than six months. The consequence of applying that notion would be to bring the reduction sought to be reversed by the Crown to something markedly less than an overall eight months. The backdating of commencement had an available reasonable basis as above discussed and miscarriage of discretion has not been shown.  
     
      
    38 The Crown argument on appeal, as earlier observed, did not challenge the assessment of 5 years as a head sentence. In my view, a difference represented by something less than eight months, would not convert an accepted assessment into one of manifest inadequacy.  
     
      
    39 I would dismiss the Crown appeal in the case of Pettersen. 
     
      
       
      CHRISTOPHER FELL 
       
      
    40 Fell was charged with specially aggravated breaking and entering with intent whilst armed with a dangerous weapon and in company contrary to s 113 (3) of the Crimes Act. The maximum prescribed penalty for this offence is 20 years imprisonment. Taken into account on a Form 1 was an offence of being carried in a conveyance without the consent of the owner contrary to s 154A (1) (b) of that Act. 
     
      
    41 His Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 7 February 2008 and expiring on 6 February 2011 with a balance term of 2 years 3 months and he ordered the respondent referred to the Drug Court. 
     
      
    42 The respondent had a considerable prior record including being sentenced at Central Local Court on 18 July 2002 to terms of imprisonment for offences of breaking entering and stealing, breaking and entering with intent to steal, assaulting an officer in the execution of his duty and goods in custody. 
     
      
    43 At Taree District Court on 25 February 2003 he was sentenced to a fixed term of 18 months for supplying a prohibited drug, to a fixed term of 2 years for inflicting grievous bodily harm on an officer executing his duty (with unspecified matters taken into account on a Form 1) and, for robbery, to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 18 months commencing on 8 August 2004 and expiring on 7 February 2006 with a balance term of 2 years. The overall encompassing term for these sentences expired on 7 February 2008, that is, some ten days after the commission of the index offence in this appeal, thus the offence of 28 January 2008 was committed whilst Fell was on parole but he was almost at the end of it. 
     
      
    44 In his remarks on sentence, the judge noted that he took into account the drug and alcohol report by a Ms Shepherd, a counsellor at Parklea Prison and the documents regarding educational attainment and a letter which had been written by Fell. He accepted that Fell was remorseful. The respondent was born in 1977. The history detailed by Ms Shepherd shows the chaotic circumstances through which he had passed his young life. Despite the existence of immense handicaps, his Honour considered that Fell appeared to have moved a long way towards rehabilitation until the commission of the current offence and he thought that there were reasonable grounds that he might recommence rehabilitation. 
     
      
    45 The Crown relied upon specific errors expressed as “tailoring Fell’s sentence to allow the respondent Bendt to enter a drug corrections programme and in determining that Fell met the general requirements of the drug correction programme.” 
     
      
    46 It is necessary to examine how his Honour came to assess the sentence. He had observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “The court notes that while Mr Bendt is younger, it would appear from the facts that his participation was probably greater than that of Mr Fell. In any event, the court has determined that parity does apply to them as they have not dissimilar criminal histories, not dissimilar substance abuse issues, and a not dissimilar problematic upbringing.” 
        
       
      
    47 His Honour returned to this matter of parity in connection with his concerns arising out of his finding that it was clear that Fell and Bendt had relapsed into illicit substance abuse and that that was the reason for their involvement in the offence. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The original sentence which I indicated I (sic) was considered in order to give the parties an opportunity to address me further, mainly because there is no assistance from the statistical material and this is not necessarily an easy sentencing exercise would have meant that while Mr Fell qualified for the drug corrections program because the balance of his parole as at today, the day of sentence, is less than three years, that was not so for Mr Bendt. 
        
       
       
        
        Having heard further submissions and having regard to his age, to the fact that except for about eight months he has been in custody since he was sixteen, and having re-read the material in relation to his substance abuse issues, his lack of general opportunity but also his stated desire to do something about his drug addiction, the court reviewed its sentence on the basis that to reduce the non-parole period by six months and to increase the additional term by six months would permit Mr Bendt to qualify at this point for the drug corrections program. Clearly it is a balance the court has to take into account. On the one hand, will an additional six months or would three years and six months as distinct from three years make a huge difference in terms of deterrence and punishment and how much difference potentially could it make if he was to be able to enter into the drug corrections program and have a number of years to attempt to more effectively deal with his substance abuse issues and then be eased back into the community under a structured program rather than simply released. All in all it seems to me that having regard to the fact that the total sentence is not changing, that it is appropriate to change what I have indicated because it does seem to me to be in the community’s interest to as it were, sacrifice six months in custody for the potential that the program may well significantly improve this offender’s chances of returning to the community and leading a crime free life.” 
        
       
      
    48 The indication of sentence which his Honour referred to had been made during exchange with counsel in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “For Mr Fell and Mr Bendt a non-parole period in each case of 3 years and 6 months. In the case of Mr Fell it would date from 7 February and would expire on 6 August. It would mean he would have a balance of parole under 3 years and I would recommend that he go into a drug correction centre. For Mr Bendt the 3 years and 6 months would date from 22 July and expire on 21 January 12. Mr Fell and Mr Bendt it’s 5 years and 3 months and then you add 6 months for the extra parole they’ll do, so it’s an effective 5 year and 9 month term.” 
        
       
      
    49 It might also be noted that the Crown representative at that point told his Honour that he did not wish “to say anything about that” although he elsewhere emphasized that what his Honour was proposing was “the bottom of the range.” 
     
      
    50 His Honour was apparently aware that an offender whose non-parole period exceeded three years would not, for that reason, qualify for entry into the programmes at the Drug Court, hence his above remarks. To “qualify” Bendt, he reduced the total term to 5 years 3 months from 5 years 9 months (previously “indicated”) and specified a non-parole period of 3 years. To maintain parity with Bendt, he imposed an identical sentence on Fell. 
     
      
    51 Attention was not then drawn to the circumstance that neither Fell nor Bendt could be “eligible convicted offenders” and admitted to the Drug Court programmes. Fell was not qualified as he had failed to meet two criteria, first, he had been convicted of an offence involving the use of a firearm (Drug Court Act 1998 s 5A (2) (c) ) and second, he had in the preceding five years been convicted of at least two other offences resulting in defined punishment (s 5A (1) (c) ).  
     
      
    52 In short, it was the Crown contention, as had been put at first instance, that the indicated assessment of 5 years 9 months(after discount for plea of guilty) was the bottom of the range and the reduction below that bottom created a manifestly inadequate sentence. The resultant inadequate sentence was imposed directly as a result of a misconception as to eligibility of the offender for the Drug Court programme and the Crown seeks at least the restoration of the sentence to what was contended to be the bottom of the range. 
     
      
    53 On behalf of Fell it was submitted that an adjustment to the extent of six months would amount to “appellate tinkering” with sentences against which Kirby J had observed there was “strong resistance”: Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 341. In the alternative it was submitted that this Court would exercise its discretion to dismiss the Crown appeal. Upon this issue material has been put before the Court manifesting the good use which Fell has been making of his time in custody and his rehabilitative aims. 
     
      
    54 As stated, the discrepancy of which the Crown complains was clearly a direct result of the failure to recognize the ineligibility of the respondent to enter Drug Court programmes. The contention that the assessment before reduction was at the bottom of the range was correct. In this particular case, the consequence of error is revealed with precision and in my view the Crown submission that sentence should be restored to the “bottom of the range” by rectification of the error should be upheld. I would not regard it as “tinkering” to effect an appropriate restoration. The appeal to the exercise of the Court’s residual discretion is substantially founded upon the asserted minor measure of the adjustment to sentence involved. What is sought by the Crown is capable of being perceived in precise measure and the specific reduction was consequent upon an undisputed failure to appreciate the existence of a statutory bar which rendered unachievable what was intended by the reduction. In that circumstance I would not invoke discretion to leave the consequence of that error unrectified. 
     
      
    55 The Crown does not take issue with his Honour’s selection of a commencement date for Fell’s sentence. His Honour found that there were special circumstances and departed from the proportion between the non-parole period and balance term mentioned in the sentencing legislation in favour of the respondent. The non-parole period of 3 years represented approximately 57 percent of the total term of 5 years 3 months. Applying the same proportion to the total term of 5 years 9 months (his Honour’s indication which was categorized as the bottom of the range) can be calculated to produce a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months. Those figures were, of course, calculated after allowance of 25 percent discount for the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    56 I would propose orders to effect the restoration which I have described in the case of Fell. 
     
      
       
      GREGORY BENDT 
       
      
    57 The circumstances in which the sentence indicated by his Honour was reduced to enable Bendt to enter the Drug Court programme have been described in relation to the respondent Fell and need not be repeated. Bendt was ineligible for entry into the programmes by reason of s 5A (2) (c) of the Drug Court Act because his offence involved use of a firearm. 
     
      
    58 His Honour sentenced Bendt (taking into account the offence on the Form 1) to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 22 July 2008 and expiring on 21 July 2011 with a balance term of 2 years and 3 months with a recommendation that he be referred to the Drug Court. 
     
      
    59 Bendt was convicted of the identical offence to Fell as were their matters taken into account on the Form 1. The sentence was also identical as to its length. 
     
      
    60 The respondent was born in 1987. He had a lengthy prior record, most of which arose from findings of guilt in Children’s Courts, however at Parramatta District Court on 10 December 2004 he was sentenced for offences of conspiracy (18 months imprisonment), armed robbery (2 years imprisonment) and robbery with arms and wounding (with unspecified matters on a Form 1) for which he was sentenced to a total of 7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years. The commencement date of the sentences for the first two offences abovementioned was 1 May 2003 and the commencement date for the third was 1 May 2004. The sentences were ordered to be served in a Juvenile Justice institution. His parole eligibility date was 30 April 2007. He was on parole when the index offence was committed. 
     
      
    61 His Honour remarked that the respondent had “an unfortunate history” and observed that at age twenty one he had already been in custody for more than four years. More detail was available from a psychological report which was confirmatory of his Honour’s observations. Testing was reported to show a profile of a high probability of a substance dependence disorder. Clearly it was on the basis of this information that his Honour formed a view that referral to the Drug Court was desirable but the respondent’s ineligibility was overlooked.62 The written submissions by the Crown summarized its contentions by asserting that his Honour erred: 
     
      
       
        
        “- in tailoring the sentence to allow the respondent Bendt to enter a drug corrections program; 
        
       
       
        
        - in determining that the respondent Bendt met the general requirements of the drug corrections program; 
        
       
       
        
        - in failing to have proper regard to the objective seriousness of the offence and to the principle of totality in the setting of the commencement date for the sentence his Honour imposed.” 
        
       
      
    63 The issues raised by the first two contentions were identical to those raised in the case of Fell and for the reasons given in dealing with the challenge to the sentence received by that respondent, those contentions should be upheld. 
     
      
    64 After expiry of the non-parole period for the offence of robbery on 30 April 2007 Bendt was released to parole and was on parole for approximately eight months when he committed the offence at the Club. Revocation of parole left a balance sentence to be served which will not expire until 30 April 2011. Thus, it is calculated that the respondent’s minimum custody which is solely referrable to the offence at the Club would extend from 30 April 2011 until 21 July 2011. 
     
      
    65 As with any inmate who is in custody as a result of parole revocation, the Parole Authority will routinely consider whether parole may not be restored. It is therefore not a certainty that Bendt would have been (absent the index offence) detained for the entire balance of parole. 
     
      
    66 It is accepted that the selection of the commencement date occurred as a result of the exercise of discretion about which it has frequently and accurately been observed, minds might differ. The error contended by the Crown is claimed to be observable from the result that, assuming the respondent served the whole balance of parole, he would only serve about three months for the index offence. 
     
      
    67 His Honour made it clear that he considered that he should apply parity between Bendt and Fell and that conclusion has not been challenged. Nor has the Crown challenged in isolation the assessment of term but rather has contended that the overall effect of the term was inadequacy stemming from the ancillary orders for commencement and concurrency. 
     
      
    68 I am of opinion that the Crown appeal should succeed along the same lines that I have proposed in regard to Fell. It is true that the result is to increase the head sentence by six months and the non-parole period by three months which, in the absence of context, might be categorized as “tinkering”. However, in the cases of Bendt and Fell there is relevant context. The Crown submission at first instance that the indicated sentence was at the bottom of the range was correct. For a misconceived aim to enable the respondents to enter the Drug Court programme, the impositions were reduced. They were for that reason set below the bottom of the range. The Crown should have the consequences of that error rectified and the impositions restored, at least to the level of that bottom of the range. 
     
      
    69 I propose the following: 
     
      
       
      1. In the appeal against sentence imposed on Pettersen, Crown appeal dismissed. 
       
       
      2. In the appeal against sentence imposed on Fell,  
       
       
      (a) Crown appeal allowed.  
       
       (b) Sentence imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
        
        (c) In lieu thereof the respondent sentenced (taking into account the matter on the Form 1) to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years 3 months commencing on 7 February 2008 and expiring on 6 May 2011 with a balance term of 2 years 6 months. 
         
        (d) The earliest date of eligibility for release on parole specified as 6 May 2011. 
        
       
       
      3 In the appeal against sentence imposed upon the respondent Bendt,  
       
       
      (a) Crown appeal allowed. 
       
       (b) Sentence imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
        
        (c) In lieu thereof the respondent be sentenced (taking into account the matter on the Form 1) to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years 3 months commencing on 22 July 2008 and expiring on 21 October 2011 with a balance term of 2 years. 
         
        (d) The earliest date of eligibility for release on parole specified as 21 October 2011.

    2 BLANCH J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    3 HOWIE J: The applicant was sentenced in the District Court by Ashford DCJ (the Judge) for three dishonesty offences arising from the applicant’s employment at the time the offences were committed. The offences were 1 count of using a false instrument contrary to s 300 of the Crimes Act and 2 counts of obtaining a benefit by deception contrary to s 178BA of that Act. The maximum penalty for the s 300 offence is imprisonment for 10 years and for each of the s 178BA offences imprisonment for 5 years. The s 300 offence was committed on 1 May 2007 and the other two offences on 14 July and 11 August 2006. In respect of the s 300 offence there was a matter on a Form 1, being a s 178BA offence committed on 14 July 2006. 
     
      
    4 The applicant was sentenced in total to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months. The applicant is eligible for release to parole on 28 December 2010. 
     
      
    5 The facts can be summarised as follows. On 19 June 2006 the applicant commenced employment with Sanofi-Aventis as payroll manager. She had secured that position through an agency by the use of a false name and false references. 
     
      
    6 On 14 July 2006 the applicant transferred the sum of $105,000 into an account in the name of Anthony Lai. That money was due on his retirement to Mr Cole, one of the employees of the company. He noticed that the money had been transferred into an account that was not connected to him and raised a query about it. The applicant told her superior that it was a mistake. She was able to convince this person that the money had been transferred to Mr Cole’s personal account and not the superannuation fund as he had requested. 
     
      
    7 On 16 August the applicant told her superior that she had received a bank cheque for $100,000 from Cole. She showed her a photocopy of a cheque. These funds were later cleared into the company’s account, but the sum of $5,000 remained outstanding. Inquiries revealed that the $100,000 had been paid out of an account belonging to Tat Hin Lai and Thian Moy Wong. On 22 August 2006 the applicant’s employment was terminated because of unsatisfactory work performance. This matter gave rise to the offence on the Form 1. 
     
      
    8 After the applicant had left that employment, a payroll officer was informed in October 2006 that the company had not paid its payroll tax for the preceding June. Investigations of the company’s records revealed that money had been drawn to pay the tax in the sum of $351,376.04, some $200,000 more than was due and a further sum of $125,387.04. Further inquiries showed that the applicant had contrived to have these amounts paid into an account in the name of Tat Hin Lai and Thian Moy Wong. It is unnecessary to detail the way she achieved this result but it involved her deceiving other employees to authorise the payment into an account that the applicant pretended was that of the NSW Office of State Revenue. This conduct gave rise to the two offences of obtaining a benefit by deception. 
     
      
    9 The company then instructed a firm of solicitors to recover the sum of $481,763.08 plus interest from the accounts of Lai and Wong into which the money had been paid. Orders were made in the Supreme Court to preserve the assets of the account holders. The solicitors engaged the services of a firm of private inquiry agents to serve documents upon Lai and Wong. On 27 October 2006 one of the employees of this firm attended at the new address of these persons. No one was at home but a note was left indicating the attendance of the agent. 
     
      
    10 That afternoon the agent received a phone call from a female person calling herself Marsiana and arrangements were made for them to meet at the address. On 28 October the agent attended the address and spoke to Marsiana who said she was the niece of Wong and Lai. She indicated that they were travelling interstate in Victoria. The agent later identified the person he spoke to as the applicant. 
     
      
    11 On 20 November 2006 the applicant was made a party to the Supreme Court proceedings. 
     
      
    12 On 21 March 2007 the applicant attended at Ryde Police Station and was arrested. When interviewed she stated that it was her half-sister, Bianca, who had committed the offences. Police checked with immigration authorities who had records of the arrival in Australia of the applicant but not of a person named Bianca Kartono. When informed of this, the applicant accused the authorities of falsifying the immigration records. She told the police that Bianca had deposited the funds into the accounts of persons, whom she said were the applicant’s aunt and uncle, without their knowledge. The applicant told police she would try to find Bianca and tell her to contact police. 
     
      
    13 Investigations by police revealed that Wong and Lai were actually the applicant’s parents and Anthony Lai her brother. It was also discovered that a person named Bianca Kangto was aged 11 years old. On 29 June 2007 the applicant was charged with these offences. 
     
      
    14 The charge under s 300(2) of using a false instrument arose from the applicant’s employment with the AIH Group, a company that operated four restaurants in Sydney city. On 8 January 2007 the applicant commenced employment as a payroll officer under the name of Anna Wong after being interviewed by a recruitment agency. She supplied the agency with false information. 
     
      
    15 On 12 January 2007 the Finance Manager of the firm wrote out 17 cheques for superannuation payments for staff members. The cheques were authorised and handed to the applicant to be entered into the records and then sent to the payees. 
     
      
    16 The applicant left this company on 26 February 2007. On 27 March the company became aware that the 17 cheques had not been presented. Inquiries revealed that the payees had not received them. A stop was placed upon the cheques. 
     
      
    17 On 26 April 2007 a solicitor from the firm undertaking action against the applicant contacted her in relation to payment of $614,308.72 as a result of a Supreme Court order. The applicant was informed that action would be taken to recover the debt after 28 April. The applicant said that they had received money from a family friend but declined to name the person. Arrangements were made for the applicant to attend at the solicitors on 30 April with a bank cheque for the amount owed. 
     
      
    18 On 30 April the applicant attended upon the solicitors. She had a St George Bank cheque for an account in the name of the AIH Group and payable to a superannuation fund. That payee had been crossed out and the name of the firm of solicitors inserted. The amount of the cheque had apparently been altered and replaced with a sum of $648,000. The cheque was handed back to the applicant because it was not a bank cheque. The applicant was asked why the cheque was in the name of AIH Group and she stated that had been given by a family friend. The solicitor contacted the AIH Group. 
     
      
    19 On 2 May 2007 a St George cheque was paid into the solicitor’s account. The cheque was in the name of the AIH Group. Inquiries revealed that the cheque was one of the 17 cheques given to the applicant when she worked for that company. The applicant was identified as the employee who had received the cheques and the police were contacted. Investigations revealed that the applicant had deposited the cheque into the solicitor’s account. The cheque had originally been drawn in the sum of $1038.46 and dated 12 January 2007. 
     
      
    20 The applicant was arrested on 29 July 2007 and refused bail. A search warrant was executed at premises where the applicant had been living and another cheque in the name of the AIH Group was located. 
     
      
    21 The applicant was born on 23 October 1973. She had no prior criminal record. There was in evidence a psychologist report. This revealed the following information about the applicant. She was born in Jakarta and came to Australia with her parents when she was aged 8 years. She apparently adjusted well to her new environment but her parents did not. At the date of the report her father was retired but her mother worked in housekeeping. The applicant said that she had accepted the responsibility of assisting her parents whenever possible including caring for her younger brother. The psychologist opined that the applicant had become over-protective of her family and generally lived at home despite attempts at independence. 
     
      
    22 The applicant claimed that the offences were committed because of desperation as a result of financial difficulties at the time associated with purchasing a property for the family. She believed that she felt under pressure to solve the family’s financial problems. She expressed remorse but largely for the impact of the offences upon her family. The applicant claimed that she felt anxiety as a result of the financial pressures but that she had to try to ease the burden of the situation upon her parents. The psychologist believed that she could benefit from treatment to allow her “to manage better emotionally and cope with stressors more appropriately”. 
     
      
    23 There was a pre-sentence report in evidence. It indicated that the applicant disputed the police facts and claimed that the cheques in her possession had been cancelled and were to be destroyed. It summarised the offending as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The offender’s promising career had advanced and she was working long hours. An intended new home purchase was not working out as envisaged, banking finance, built in penalties in a contract and leveraging against her parents’ home had caused unforseen pressure and stress. These events thus gave rise to poor decision making by the offender who did not confide in others. [The applicant’s] family remains close and supportive and they are looking forward to their daughter’s return. 
        
       
      
    24 The Judge noted the importance of general deterrence and that “the community rightfully expect proper punishment for such breaches of trust”. She stated that consideration had to be given to the amount of money defrauded, any degree of planning, “the abuse of trust factors”, whether there has been any restitution and the effect upon the victims. Her Honour found that there was “a serious breach of trust” and noted that the applicant had obtained her employment by the use of false names and references. She also found there was “a large degree of planning”. The Judge assessed the degree of objective criminality as falling “within the mid range of objective seriousness”. The applicant was given the benefit of a discount of 25 per cent for the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    25 The Judge referred to the psychologist report and the pre-sentence report. She stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        It seems that she does have a strong involvement with her family and indeed it was because of such involvement to a degree that she engaged in these offences from the facts before me. 
        
       
       
        
        ………… 
        
       
       
        
        I accept that she did consider there to be some pressing financial need to assist her family in committing these offences. However that does not excuse her behaviour but under the circumstances I am prepared to find special circumstances. 
        
       
      
    26 Her Honour imposed the following sentences: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Count 2 Non-parole period of 18 months from 29 June 2007 balance of sentence of 12 months. 
         
         
        Count 3 Non-parole period 2 years from 29 December 2007 balance of sentence of 12 months. 
         
         
        Count 1 Non-parole period of 2 years 6 months from 29 June 2008 to expire 28 December 2010 with a balance of sentence of 2 years 6 months. 
         
        
       
      
    27 The grounds of appeal relied upon are that the Judge: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “1. Erred in failing to give sufficient weight to the fact that the Appellant (sic) had no prior convictions and that the Applicant had never previously been in custody. 
         
         
        2. Erred in failing to give sufficient weight to the Applicant’s psychological stresses caused by financial difficulties confronting the Applicant’s family as outlined in the Psychologist’s Report tendered on sentence. 
         
         
        3. Erred in failing to properly adjust the non-parole period to reflect the finding of special circumstances. 
         
         
        4. Erred in imposing a sentence in respect of the count of using a false instrument (s 300 of the Crimes Act 1900, NSW) which was excessive in the circumstances. 
         
         
        5. Erred in failing to give sufficient weight to the fact that some reparation had been made by the Appellant.” (sic) 
        
       
       
      The applicant’s counsel’s written and oral submissions on these grounds were very brief. I can, therefore, take the liberty of answering them briefly. 
       
      
    28 Counts 1, 2 and 4 are answered by considering the sentences imposed. Her Honour was correct to partially accumulate the sentences as she did, for to do otherwise would not have resulted in a sentence that reflected the total of the applicant’s criminality. These offences were marked by seriously fraudulent activity in breach of her position of trust which itself was obtained by fraud in each case. They were separate acts of criminality even though they were committed through the same motivation, to address the family’s financial difficulties. The s 300 offence carried a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment and the sentence had to reflect the matter on the Form 1, which was itself serious. 
     
      
    29 The fact that the offences were committed in order to help meet the financial difficulties into which her family fell was of little mitigation. The simple fact is that the family intended to build an investment property even though it was one in which they would live. It was to cost them $1.5 million yet her parent’s existing home was valued at $385,000. In effect they bit off more than they could chew. In any event the motive for such criminal conduct as the applicant committed against her employers is rarely mitigating. Given the planned nature of the offences and the separate and distinct criminality involved, it was of little weight that she had not previously had any criminal convictions. There was little remorse shown for her conduct and she brazenly tried to lie her way out of trouble from first to last. 
     
      
    30 Ground 3 is answered by the fact that the non-parole period is 71 per cent of the total sentence and, therefore, it was reduced from the statutory ratio as a result of the finding of special circumstances. The non-parole period had to reflect the seriousness of the offending, and both general and specific deterrence. No lesser sentence would have achieved that result. In any event 12 months is more than adequate for the applicant to attempt to rehabilitate herself on release from custody. 
     
      
    31 Ground 5 is answered by the fact that the reparation was not voluntary, but was a result of action taken on behalf of the company in the Supreme Court. There is little mitigation in that fact but her Honour took it into account. There was still a considerable amount of money outstanding. 
     
      
    32 I propose that the application for leave be granted but the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 SIMPSON J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    3 HOWIE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court by English DCJ (the Judge). The applicant is unrepresented and did not wish to appear at the hearing of the application. He has however raised, what are in effect, three grounds of appeal in a letter to the Court. 
     
      
    4 The applicant was sentenced for three matters. Two charges arose from the one incident, an altercation with his brother, as a result of which he was charged with malicious damage and assault. The third charge related to a separate incident, a violent attack upon his mother, resulting in a charge of malicious wounding. In addition there was a charge of resist arrest taken into account on a Form 1 in sentencing for the charge of malicious damage. The applicant pleaded guilty to all matters. As a consequence he was sentenced to a total sentence of imprisonment for 5 years 2 months commencing from 1 January 2007 with an overall minimum period of imprisonment of 3 years 6 months. The applicant is eligible to be released to parole on 30 June 2010. 
     
      
    5 It should be noted that the Form 1 erroneously referred to both charges of malicious damage and assault as being the offences to which it applied. Matters can only be taken into account on a Form 1 in accordance with s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in respect of one principal offence. The Judge was either unaware of, or disregarded what is a technical problem with the Form 1 and took the resist arrest offence into account in sentencing for the malicious damage charge. 
     
      
       
        
        Facts 
        
       
      
    6 The malicious damage and the assault offences occurred on 14 September 2005. The applicant and his brother had been drinking together at hotels until about 8pm when the brother returned to his home. The applicant remained at the hotel. At about 11.30pm the brother was awoken by the applicant yelling from outside the house and demanding his one hundred dollars. The brother went to the window and told the applicant he would pay the money the following day. He also told the applicant to go home, as he was drunk. 
     
      
    7 The applicant refused to go and continued yelling out. The brother was going towards the front door, when the applicant smashed the glass panel in the middle of the door. His brother went outside and a scuffle took place. The applicant punched his brother and he fell to the ground. The applicant cut his hand on the broken glass and was taken to hospital for the wound to be stitched. The resist arrest took place following this incident. 
     
      
    8 The charge of malicious damage is an offence contrary to s 195 of the Crimes Act for which there is a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. The assault was an offence contrary to s 61 of that Act for which the maximum penalty is 2 years imprisonment. The applicant was sentenced on the assault to a fixed term of 9 months and for the malicious damage to a fixed term of 1 year 7 months. Those sentences were to be served concurrently and dated from 1 January 2007. 
     
      
    9 The malicious wounding offence occurred on 7 February 2007. The applicant and his mother, who was 60 years of age, attended a funeral on that day. After the service the mother returned to her home and the applicant attended a wake a short distance away. At about 7pm, the applicant, having been asked to leave the wake because of his inebriation, arrived at his mother’s home. She was about to go out and told him he could not remain there because of his intoxicated state. The applicant became angry. He shouted and swore at his mother and punched the wall. 
     
      
    10 His mother told him to stop and that she would drive him to the station. The applicant then grabbed her and pushed her towards the bathroom. There he punched her a number of times to the face and body. He held her in a headlock and continued to punch her. She bit his finger in an attempt to extricate herself. However the applicant pushed her and she fell into the bath. He continued to rain blows on her and kicked her. He interrupted the assault for a short period in order to bite her left finger and shout, “How do you like that?” He then punched and kicked her again. 
     
      
    11 When someone came to the door, she tried to get out of the bath. The applicant then braced himself against the wall so that he could stomp on her face. This caused her head to hit the wall with such force that it broke through the tiled wall. He did this once more, again forcing her head to hit the wall. He then turned on the bath tap causing hot water to splash her. The attack continued until interrupted by a neighbour who took the applicant outside to wait for police. The offender was on bail for the assault on his brother at the time of this offence. 
     
      
    12 As a result of this attack the victim suffered a wound to her left index finger where the applicant bit her, a fracture of her right wrist, bruising and swelling to both eyes, lacerations to her face and pain to the right side of her rib cage. She was admitted to hospital where she remained for 5 days. Her finger was stitched and her wrist placed in a cast. In a victim impact statement she set out the effects upon her of the assault including that she had been robbed of her self-confidence and security. However, she expressed her love for the applicant and the hope that the incident might “help turn him around”. 
     
      
    13 Malicious wounding is an offence contrary to s 35 of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum penalty of 7 years. The Judge sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months to date from 1 January 2008 and expiring on 30 June 2010. There is a balance of term of 20 months. This sentence is cumulative upon 12 months of the sentence for the malicious damage charge. The total minimum period the applicant has to serve is 67 per cent of the total sentence as a result of the Judge finding special circumstances. 
     
      
       
        
        Subjective considerations 
        
       
      
    14 The applicant was born on 28 May 1970. He has a criminal record dating from June 1987 mainly for dishonesty offences. However, there are also offences of assault and malicious damage. In 2000 he was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 months for offences of malicious damage and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In 2001 for offences of assault he received suspended sentences on condition that he place himself in a residential programme for alcohol abuse. In 2004 he received suspended sentences for both assault and malicious damage on an appeal to the District Court against gaol sentences imposed in the Local Court. 
     
      
    15 There was a psychologist report in evidence. The applicant reported that his father abused alcohol and he described a childhood “characterised by domestic violence and occasional physical abuse”. However, following the separation of his parents when he was aged 9 years, he enjoyed a happy childhood with his mother. He was unable to give any explanation for the attack upon his mother. He indicated that he would not approach his family for a “couple of years”. He is single but was in a relationship between 2001 and 2003 that was volatile with alcohol related violence. He began using alcohol at 18 and has difficulty controlling his alcohol intake once he starts drinking. He acknowledged that he had a problem with alcohol and underwent a treatment programme in 2002. The psychologist stated that the applicant needs psychological treatment and relapse prevention support in relation to his alcohol abuse. He would also benefit from an anger management programme and vocational assistance. 
     
      
    16 In the letter the applicant wrote to the Court he refers to courses that he has attended while in custody for these matters and other steps he has taken to rehabilitate himself since he was sentenced. He expresses remorse for the attack upon his mother especially as she sent him a Christmas card telling him that she was thinking of him and loved him dearly. This Court cannot take this material and these sentiments into account unless there is error found in the exercise of the Judge’s sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    17 The applicant has however raised three matters that he wishes the Court to consider. The first is a complaint that the Judge erred when describing the facts of the malicious damage offence. The applicant complains that it was alleged that he had pulled the aluminium screen door off its hinges yet photographs in police possession show that the screen door was intact. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      Malicious damage and assault offences 
      
    18 The facts were handed up to the Judge. The applicant was legally represented and no objection was raised to their contents. The relevant passage is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ……….The accused kicked the aluminium screen door and tore it away from its hinges.  
        Count Two 
        : the accused then smashed the glass panel in the middle of the wooden front door…….. 
        
       
      
    19 The reference to “Count Two” is a reference to the second count on the indictment before the court, being the malicious damage charge. The relevant wording in the charge on the indictment is “did maliciously damage property, namely the front door”. It is clear that the malicious damage charge did not refer to the screen door and so it does not matter whether it was damaged, as stated in the facts, or was not damaged, as the applicant contends. The applicant was only being sentenced for the damage to the wooden door. In any event the court can only act upon the material placed before it, which, so far as this charge was concerned, was only the statement of facts. 
     
      
    20 The applicant asked this Court to consider whether the Judge “has gone outside her range of sentencing on the malicious damage case”. As has been noted, the charge was in relation to the breaking of a glass panel on the wooden door. In sentencing for that matter her Honour observed that both that offence and the assault were “not of the most objectively serious of their kind”. Later she said, “They are offences which fall towards the lower end of the scale constructed for like offences”. The Judge gave the applicant the benefit of a discount of 25 per cent and noted that these charges could have been dealt with in the Local Court. 
     
      
    21 There was a very substantial significance in the fact that these two offences could have been dealt with in the Local Court that her Honour fails to mention. While it is true that the offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years if the offence is dealt with on indictment, there are different maximum penalties prescribed where the matters are dealt with in the Local Court. The only reason that these matters were before the District Court was because the applicant was charged with an offence under s 112(2). This was the first count on the indictment. That was an offence that could not be determined summarily. The malicious damage charge was an alternative to that count and the assault was an additional charge. 
     
      
    22 The Crown eventually did not proceed on the first count. This is unsurprising having regard to the offence that was alleged. Therefore the two matters arising from the incident with his brother were before the District Court only because of the charge in the first count that was not ultimately pursued. Neither the offence of malicious damage or the assault warranted a committal to the District Court. In fact both offences must be dealt with in the Local Court (where the value of the property on the malicious damage charge does not exceed $5,000) unless election is made for trial on indictment: see s 260 of the Criminal Procedure Act and the second schedule to that Act. The election would have been made in this case only because the first count had to be dealt with in the District Court. In these circumstances it is highly relevant that the offences could have, and should have in the normal course of events, been dealt with in the Local Court. 
     
      
    23 The relevance of this fact is more than merely the sentencing limit to which a magistrate is generally restricted. That is the normal consideration given to the fact that an offence could have been dealt with in the Local Court; R v Crombie [1999] NSWCCA 297. However, the maximum penalty for an assault under s 61, when dealt with summarily is relevantly, 12 months imprisonment: s 268 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Here the Judge imposed a sentence of 9 months. Similarly for an offence of malicious damage where the value of the property does not exceed $5,000 the maximum penalty is 12 months. Here the Judge imposed a sentence of a fixed term of 19 months. There is no value stated of the damage but I cannot believe that it would be more than $5,000. 
     
      
    24 A similar situation was considered in R v El Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167. There the applicant had pleaded guilty to a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to s 59 of the Crimes Act after he had been acquitted on a more serious matter. The s 59 offence would normally have been dealt with in the Local Court but was only before the District Court because of the more serious matter of which the applicant had been found not guilty. The applicant argued that in imposing a CSO of 500 hours the judge had given insufficient weight to this fact. Johnson J stated: 
     
      
       
        
        29 It is a well-established sentencing principle that a court dealing on indictment with a matter which was capable of summary disposal may have regard to that fact on sentence:  
        R v Sandford 
         (1994) 72 A Crim R 160 at 195;  
        R v Griggs 
         (1999) 109 A Crim R 484 at 485-6;  
        Crombie 
        , at paragraph 16;  
        Doan 
        , at 123ff (paragraph 35ff);  
        R v LPY 
         (2002) 135 A Crim R 237 at 240. But it is not a universal rule ( 
        Sandford 
        , at 195) nor a factor which operates universally to reduce sentence ( 
        Doan 
        , [[2000] 50 NSWLR 115] at 124). In some circumstances, the Court may conclude that the offender’s criminality was too serious to be dealt with in the Local Court and that the matter was properly before the District Court:  
        R v Hanslow 
         [2004] NSWCCA 163 at paragraph 21. The significance of the loss of a chance to be dealt with in the Local Court will vary from case to case:  
        R v Depoma 
         [2003] NSWCCA 382 at paragraph 13.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        30 The maximum penalty for an offence under s.59(1)  
        Crimes Act 1900 
         is imprisonment for five years. When disposed of summarily in the Local Court, the maximum sentence is imprisonment for two years or a fine of 50 penalty units or both: s.268(2)(a)  
        Criminal Procedure Act 1986 
        . These provisions prescribe the jurisdictional limit of the Local Court and not the maximum penalty for any offence triable within that jurisdiction:  
        Doan 
         at 123 (paragraph 35). Magistrates must not regard the jurisdictional limit as some form of maximum sentence reserved for a worst case:  
        Re Attorney-General’s Application under s.37 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No. 2 of 2002) 
         (2002) 137 A Crim R 196 at 204 (paragraph 27). A judge in the District Court is not bound by the jurisdictional limit imposed on the Local Court when dealing with an offence on indictment which was capable of summary disposal, but may have regard to that limit when the case is one which could appropriately have been disposed of in the Local Court:  
        Crombie 
        , 
          
        at paragraph 16;  
        LPY 
        , 
          
        at 240…………………. 
        
       
       
      The Court allowed the appeal and substituted a CSO of 100 hours as this would have been the sentence imposed in the Local Court had the matter been dealt with in that jurisdiction. 
       
      
    25 The issue was also considered in R v Palmer [2005] NSWCCA 349 where Hall J at [15] summarised the relevant principles as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         
        (a) The first is that a judge in the District Court is not bound by the jurisdictional limit imposed on the Local Court when dealing with an offence on indictment which was capable of summary disposal, but may have regard to that limit when the case is one which could appropriately have been disposed of in the Local Court:  
        Regina v. Crombie 
         [1999] NSWCCA 297 at [16];  
        Regina v. LPY 
         (2002) 136 A. Crim. R. 237 at 240 and  
        Regina v. El Masri 
         [2005] NSWCCA 167 at [30]. 
         
         
        (b) Secondly, the fact that a matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court, had the prosecuting authority not elected otherwise, remains a relevant consideration in the exercise of the discretion reserved to the sentencing judge:  
        Crombie  
        (supra) at [15]. 
         
         
        (c) Thirdly, however, the relevant decisions that establish that principle do not go so far as to require the sentencing judge to proceed upon the basis that the maximum available sentence is that which could have been imposed in the Local Court. At most they establish that the circumstance identified is to be taken into account. Depending upon the objective and the subjective criminality of the offender, it may properly be regarded as calling for some mitigation of the sentence that would otherwise be imposed in the District Court for an offence prosecuted upon indictment. Where it appears that that circumstance has been entirely overlooked by the sentencing judge, it may properly justify the granting of leave to appeal:  
        Crombie 
         (supra) at [16]. 
         
         
        (d) Fourthly, the significance of the loss of the chance of the matter being dealt with in the Local Court varies from case to case. In some cases it would contribute to mitigation of sentence. It is a matter to be taken into account, but is not a universal factor for the reduction of sentence:  
        Regina v. Doan 
         (2000) 50 NSWLR 115. 
         
         
        (e) Fifthly, the failure by a sentencing judge to mention the matter in his or her remarks on sentence and the length of the sentence does not necessarily establish that the sentencing judge failed to have regard to the matter. In some circumstances the length of the sentence may not suggest that the matter was overlooked:  
        Regina v. Depoma 
         [2003] NSWCCA 382 at [17]. 
         
         
        (f) Finally, in circumstances where a sentencing judge has made no reference to the summary disposal argument in his or her remarks on sentence, it is necessary to consider whether that omission is indicative of error. One way of testing that proposition is to consider whether the sentence itself appears manifestly excessive in all the circumstances of the case – if the factor had been taken into account and given appropriate weight, a substantially lesser sentence was appropriate in the case:  
        El Masri 
         (supra) at [45] per Johnson, J. (with whom Hunt, AJA. and Hulme, J. agreed). 
         
        
       
      
    26 Although, unlike the situation in El Masri, the Judge in this case did indicate that the two offences could have been dealt with in the Local Court, there needed, in my opinion, to be a closer analysis of the situation because of the reduced maximum penalties that would apply, they being less than the normal jurisdictional limit in the Local Court of 2 years imprisonment. As her Honour noted, both these offences were to the lower end of the scale of seriousness. In my opinion the sentence for the malicious damage was excessive having regard to the nature of the offence and in light of the fact that it exceeded the sentence that the Local Court could lawfully have imposed had it been dealt with in that jurisdiction. The sentence for the assault was also manifestly excessive. The applicant should be re-sentenced for these two offences. 
     
      
    27 This criticism cannot be applied to the Judge’s consideration of the malicious wounding offence. It was clearly appropriate for that offence to be before the District Court, and the applicant’s representative did not suggest otherwise. On its face the appropriate sentence for that offence given its seriousness was more than the magistrate could have imposed. Although the Judge did not refer to the fact that this offence could, at least notionally, have been dealt with in the Local Court, there was no error in failing to refer to that fact.  
     
      
       
      Gratuitous cruelty 
      
    28 The applicant questions whether the Judge was right to find that the wounding of the mother involved gratuitous cruelty: see s 21A(2)(f) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. He draws the Court’s attention to the definition of “gratuitous” in the Macquarie Dictionary as being “without reason”. What the Judge said in her sentencing remarks was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The Crown submits that the offender’s actions on this day amount to gratuitous cruelty. The Macquarie Dictionary defines “gratuitous” interalia as “being without reason, cause or justification”. The same dictionary defines “cruelty” as “causing or marked by great pain or distress”. There can be no doubt that what this offender did amounts to gratuitous cruelty towards an innocent victim. There is simply no justification for what he did to his mother in punching her repeatedly which resulted in significant pain and distress, both at the time and of an ongoing nature. Clearly she was a woman who did not deserve such treatment at the hands of her son. 
        
       
      
    29 With respect, I have difficulty with her Honour’s reasoning for finding that the offence involved gratuitous cruelty. In dealing with an aggravating factor under s 21A(2) it is not a case of just defining the words and seeing whether that definition applies to the facts of the case. I would have thought it was quite unnecessary to go to a dictionary to understand what was intended by Parliament in enacting this particular aggravating factor. If her Honour were correct as to the meaning of the term as used in s 21A, the aggravating factor would be present in any offence that is committed without justification and causes the victim great pain. It would be difficult to find that such a factor would not be present in almost every case of malicious wounding as the word “malice” provides that the wounding is without justification. Nor is the factor made out because the victim “did not deserve such treatment” at the hands of the offender, whatever be their relationship. 
     
      
    30 Gratuitous cruelty seems to me to suggest that the infliction of pain is an end in itself. It is needless yet intentional violence committed simply to make the victim suffer. It might be found, for example, where a robber inflicts pain upon an already compliant victim who was willing to part with the property demanded or in a case of a sexual offence where the victim is assaulted even though he or she is not resisting the offender. But in offences which are of their nature violent, such as wounding or the infliction of grievous bodily harm, where the purpose of the offence is to cause pain and suffering to the victim there needs to be something more for the factor to be present than merely that the offender had no justification for causing the victim pain. 
     
      
    31 There may be cases of malicious wounding where the factor is present because of the nature or purpose of the wounding, for example where it involved a type of torture. In TMTW v R [2008] NSWCCA 50 the applicant inflicted pain on the victim by the use of a pair of pliers applied to the victim’s penis and scrotum. It was held that the judge was correct to find that offence was committed with gratuitous violence. In R v Olsen [2005] NSWCCA 243 gratuitous cruelty was found by reason of the infliction of a very large number of injuries to a very young child. But there was nothing in the present case that gave rise to this factor of aggravation in the nature of the attack upon the victim. 
     
      
    32 There may have been one fact that might have given rise to the aggravating factor. This is that the applicant turned on the hot water tap and splashed his mother. But there was no evidence that this caused her any pain. There is nothing in the medical reports to suggest that she suffered scalding or even redness to any part of her body that could be attributed to the effects of hot water upon her. In that circumstance the Crown could not rely upon this aggravating factor. 
     
      
    33 Her Honour was in my opinion in error in finding as an aggravating factor that the offender was acting with gratuitous cruelty. Certainly he was acting with gratuitous violence and causing his mother painful injuries as a result, but that did not give rise to an aggravating factor under s 21A(2). Further, it was completely unnecessary in order to form a proper assessment of the seriousness of the assaults upon his mother to introduce the concept of gratuitous cruelty. It really added nothing to the description of what was a prolonged and unprovoked assault upon a vulnerable woman in her own home by her own son. Depending upon the injury or injuries sustained by the victim that description was enough to bring the objective seriousness of the offending above the mid range. 
     
      
       
        
        Nature of the injuries 
        
       
      
    34 However, there is a more fundamental difficulty with the sentencing exercise undertaken by her Honour. And this difficulty is a direct result of the nature of the charge and the facts placed before the Judge. 
     
      
    35 The offence charged was malicious wounding. It was not the malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm. At the time of the commission of the offence s 35(1) contained two offences: s 35(1)(a) malicious wounding and s 35(1)(b) malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm. A wounding does not necessarily amount to grievous bodily harm and grievous bodily harm does not necessarily include a wounding. The two offences were included in the one section and carried the same penalty but they were distinct offences. 
     
      
    36 The applicant was charged under s 35(1)(a). A wound is the penetration of the internal layer of the skin. In this case there were a number of wounds. There was a bite to the finger that required three sutures. There were also very minor lacerations of the head that did not require suturing. The medical report does not number or describe these lacerations so minor were they. Arguably the most severe injury was the fracture of the wrist and there was very severe bruising around the eyes. The pictures of the victim are truly pitiable. Although she spent five days in hospital, obviously it was not a result of the wounds. 
     
      
    37 Malicious wounding is principally a result offence. Generally speaking the seriousness of the offence will significantly depend upon the seriousness of the wounding. That is not to say that the manner in which the wound was inflicted, the reason for the infliction of the wound and the circumstances surrounding the wounding are irrelevant. The same can be said for an offence involving the infliction of grievous bodily harm: the more serious the harm inflicted the more serious the offence: see R v Mitchell and Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296; 177 A Crim R 94 at [27]. 
     
      
    38 The Judge was clearly entitled to take into account the nature of the assaults that gave rise to, or surrounded, the wounding. She was also entitled to take into account other injuries inflicted in the course of conduct resulting in the wounding that were less serious than the wounding. In my opinion her Honour was not, however, entitled to take into account other injuries inflicted upon the victim that were not wounds and were more serious than the wounds. A broken wrist is not encompassed in a charge of wounding and, particularly in the case of a 60 year old, was considerably more serious than the wounds. I do not believe that the Judge could take into account that the victim spent five days in hospital because that was not identified as being a result of the wounding or of injuries that were less serious than the wounding. 
     
      
    39 The Crown argued that the Judge was entitled to take into account all of the injuries inflicted because to do so was not in breach of the De Simoni principle. This, it was argued, was because the same penalty applied for both malicious wounding and malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm. But, as I have indicated, there are two separate offences depending upon the type of injury inflicted. It does not seem to me to be permissible to sentence an offender for injuries not charged where those injuries are more serious. Had the applicant been charged with maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, I have no doubt that the Judge could have taken into account all the injuries, whatever their nature, because together they amounted to grievous bodily harm, or because they were less serious than the injury that was grievous bodily harm. To sentence for the infliction of grievous bodily harm on a charge of wounding, seems to me to eradicate the difference between the two offences. The Crown submissions suggest, that, if there was any error, it was because of a “faulty averment” as to the nature of the injuries. But this is to blur the fact that there are two separate offences contained in s 35. 
     
      
    40 It is interesting to note that s 35 in the Crimes Act was recently amended. There are still two categories of offences depending upon the type of injury inflicted even though the section has been redrafted to remove the concept of malice and to include an aggravating feature of being in company. Further, recklessly causing grievous bodily harm under s 35(2) carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment, whereas recklessly wounding under s 35(4) carries a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    41 Here the principal wounding was the bite to the mother’s finger that needed three sutures. The other wounds were minor although they appear to have produced a great deal of blood. The nature of the wound was, therefore, at the low end of the scale of seriousness for this offence. However, the circumstances in which the wound was occasioned increased its seriousness considerably. As I have already described, the wounding occurred in the course of a prolonged and unprovoked assault upon a vulnerable woman in her own home by her own son. The only explanation for the assault was that the applicant was drunk. He has a history of violent offences and was on bail for the offences against his brother at the time. The applicant has been shown considerable leniency by the courts in an endeavour to assist him overcome his problems with alcohol in the past. The sentence now must reflect a very significant degree of personal deterrence. 
     
      
    42 In any event a sentence before discount of 5½ years for the malicious wounding offence as against a maximum penalty of 7 years was manifestly excessive whatever injuries were taken into account by her Honour. Notwithstanding the seriousness of the conduct, as against the type of wounding or injuries in the nature of grievous bodily harm covered by the section this offence was no more than midrange notwithstanding its aggravating features. No weapon was used, the offence was unplanned and the injuries were not permanent. Unlike many wounding offences there is no evidence of any significant scarring. The applicant was truly remorseful. The sentence before discount should be 4 years. 
     
      
    43 The Judge allowed the respondent a discount of 25 per cent in respect of all matters. This was overly generous in respect of the assault and malicious damage charges but was a result of a submission made by the prosecutor that the pleas were made at the first opportunity. That statement was plainly wrong. The respondent had been charged by the police with both of these offences and could have indicated a preparedness to plead guilty to them at any time irrespective of the committal charge. In fact the assault charge was independent of the committal charge. The discount should have been no more than 15 per cent. 
     
      
    44 There were a number of matters before the District Court pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act. No order was made in respect of these matters and none was sought by the prosecutor. In fact there is no mention made of them in the proceedings before her Honour at all. These need to be addressed in the District Court as they represent outstanding charges against the respondent. 
     
      
       
       
       
        
        The prosecution conduct 
        
       
      
    45 In fairness to her Honour, it should be noted that the difficulties arising in this matter and the specific errors that have been identified should be attributed almost entirely to the conduct of the prosecution. They were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1 The charge laid in respect of the respondent’s mother was clearly inappropriate to reflect all her injuries. Although that was the charge laid by the police, the prosecutor had a duty to review it or to ensure that the statement of facts was consistent with it. 
         
         
        2. The main charge on the indictment was obviously excessive to reflect the respondent’s conduct at his brother’s house and realistically it was never going to be the subject of a trial. It was a s 112(2) offence carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 5 years. Yet, as her Honour found, the criminality on that occasion was a minor malicious damage and assault. It was an example of gross overcharging. But the result was that charges that should have been dealt with in the Local Court were before the District Court. 
         
         
        3. In light of the fact that the prosecution was responsible for the change of jurisdiction of these charges, the prosecutor had a duty to advise the Judge of the applicable penalties in the Local Court in respect of the two matters on the indictment to which the respondent pleaded guilty. They were lower than the general limitation that applied to a magistrate’s sentencing power and, therefore, were of particular relevance. Rather the prosecutor submitted that the offences were “somewhere around the middle of the range”. For offences in the District Court, they were clearly not of that seriousness. 
         
         
        4. It was at the prosecutor’s urging that the judge found gratuitous cruelty. That submission was erroneous and unnecessary. But it was not the only one. The prosecutor submitted that the victim was vulnerable because she had just returned from a funeral and that the respondent, as her son, was in a position of trust to her. Neither of those submissions was remotely tenable and should not have been made. 
         
         
        5. The whole of the prosecutor’s submissions on sentence were unduly inflammatory and irresponsible. They were calculated to lead the Judge to impose a sentence that could never withstand scrutiny. That is not the role of a prosecutor. For example, a submission that the seriousness of the malicious wounding offence “falls very much towards the top” was insupportable. It is clear that the prosecutor appearing before her Honour fell short of maintaining objectivity. As a result she not only failed to assist the court from falling into appealable error but actively, although innocently, promoted a sentencing result that was unreasonable. 
        
       
      
    46 I propose that the following orders be made: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The application for leave to appeal be granted and the appeal allowed. 
         
         
        2. The sentences imposed in the District Court be quashed. 
         
         
        3. In lieu the applicant is sentenced as follows: 
         
          
           
          (i) on Count 3 the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 3 months to date from 1 January 2007 and expire on 31 March 2007. 
           
           
          (ii) on Count 2 and the Form 1 matter the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 9 months to date from 1 January 2007 and expire on 30 September 2007. 
           
           
          (iii) on the charge of malicious wounding the applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 20 months from 1 September 2007 and a balance of term of 12 months. The applicant is to be released to parole on 30 April 2009. It is to be a condition of his parole that he undertake such alcohol and anger management courses as directed by the Probation Service.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant was tried and found guilty of two offences. The first offence was that of concealing a serious indictable offence contrary to s 316 of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for that offence is two years imprisonment. She was also convicted of doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice contrary to s 319 of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is 14 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    2 The sentencing judge sentenced the applicant in relation to the s 316 offence to a non-parole period of 12 months imprisonment with a balance of term of 12 months. In relation to the s 319 offence the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 12 months with a balance of term of 18 months. The sentence for the offence contrary to s 316 was made wholly concurrent with that in relation to the s 319 offence. The sentences commenced on 18 December 2007 and accordingly the non-parole period has now expired. Her Honour found special circumstances having regard to the applicant’s need for a lengthy period of supervision. 
     
      
    3 The sentencing judge summarised the relevant facts. The applicant is the mother of Jason and Aiden Podesta. She was the partner of Stephen Bannister, the deceased. The body of the deceased was discovered in the early hours of the morning on 22 November 2006. He was found lying on the footpath on the Hume Highway at Casula. He had numerous stab wounds. 
     
      
    4 His body was found adjacent to the Pop-in Motel. Room 30 in the motel was occupied by the applicant and her son Aiden. The deceased had stayed there.  
     
      
    5 On the evening before Mr Bannister’s death the applicant had received prank phone calls suggesting that Mr Bannister was suffering from AIDS. The applicant had previously been concerned about this possibility and had asked the deceased to have a test. The call distressed her. It also caused concern to other members of her family. Jason Podesta became angry and was heard to say: “I’ll stab him through the heart.” He said this to Warren Grey who persuaded him that he should make sure whether the deceased had AIDS and rather than kill him “just give him a bashing.” However, Jason Podesta was not diverted and took a kitchen knife and together with the others returned to the Pop-in Motel. Jason Podesta intended to confront the deceased about the phone calls. After the group had returned there was an argument inside room 30 which continued into the motel car park. The applicant later informed the police that she observed Jason to be in possession of the knife at the motel. 
     
      
    6 During the arguments in the car park the deceased left the group a number of times. He was distressed at being unable to persuade the group that he did not have AIDS. The final time he left the group he was followed by both Aiden and Jason Podesta. He did not return. It was the Crown case that the deceased was stabbed to death by Jason Podesta. 
     
      
    7 After the deceased had left the group a scream was heard and Jason and Aiden Podesta returned to the vicinity of room 30. Jason said “Let’s go.” There was evidence that Aiden Podesta “appeared devastated” and that Jason looked and spoke angrily and walked “very solid.” 
     
      
    8 In her third interview with the police the applicant admitted hearing someone saying that the deceased was dead. 
     
      
    9 The applicant left the scene in a vehicle driven by Jason Podesta. When they arrived at their destination the applicant realised she still possessed the deceased’s key cards. She started to panic and said “Oh my god, I still have Steven’s cards, I’m going to get rid of them, I’m going to throw them into the drain.” She was observed to take steps to throw them away. Between 2.00 and 3.00 am the applicant and Aiden left the premises. Before they did those present agreed on a “story” which involved an outline or framework of events which left out certain incriminating facts.  
     
      
    10 On 22 November 2006 the applicant was interviewed by the police. It was during this interview that she gave false information. She was asked whether she had any knowledge of the incident and said “I don’t know anything about him being – something happened to him or that – no.” When giving an account of her movements she deliberately left out significant information. She gave an account of events which suggested that the deceased was still alive when she left the motel premises with the others. She told the police “no-one followed Steven when he left.” In particular she said that “Jason didn’t follow Steven” at any time and that “Aiden didn’t follow Steven at any time.” She was asked whether she could tell the police anything about the circumstances of the murder of Steven Bannister. She answered “No”, which the Crown alleged was a deliberately false answer.  
     
      
    11 It was the Crown case that at her first interview the applicant concealed the murder by omitting some important facts and at the second interview concealed the offence by providing the police with deliberately false information to cast suspicion on someone other than her son. 
     
      
    12 On 24 November 2006 the applicant telephoned the police and said that she wanted to provide additional information. She was reinterviewed during which she said that Warren Grey had said “I’ll stab him through the heart” and that her son Jason did not say those words. She repeated this allegation a number of times. She also gave the police false information about the movements of her son. 
     
      
    13 The applicant gave her third interview to the police on 28 August 2007. By this time she had been arrested and charged. On this occasion she provided the police with a mixture of admissions and further untruths in an attempt to shield Aiden and to a lesser extent Jason. In her evidence she said she was threatened by police before and after she gave her interview but this was clearly rejected by the jury. 
     
      
    14 The trial judge found that the applicant had in all three interviews attempted to conceal the offence from the police. Her conduct had extended over a lengthy period of time and showed a consistency of purpose and firm resolve to conceal any involvement of her son Jason in the killing. In the course of the investigation the applicant’s telephone had been lawfully intercepted and she was recorded as having attempted to influence Natalie Gajdos, who was a witness to the events. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Applicant: Don’t say anything more Luv.” 
        
       
       
        
        NG: Because when he left he went to the car. When they went that way they went to the car. They went to get the car. 
        
       
       
        
        Applicant: Remember. 
        
       
       
        
        NG: No, remember what? 
        
       
       
        
        Applicant: Just don’t say anything else and ask for a solicitor if anything happens.” 
        
       
      
    15 The applicant was aged 45 years when sentenced. Although an adopted child she was raised in a supportive family environment. She lived with the father of her sons, Jason and Aiden, for 17 years but that relationship ended. Aiden suffers from bipolar disorder and border-line schizophrenia. Jason has not suffered from any form of mental health issues but began exhibiting anti-social tendencies at about age 17. 
     
      
    16 The applicant has had problems with both heroin and amphetamines. She was also placed at one stage on a methadone program. Although she has been employed, her employment record is intermittent and has been affected by her drug use. She has at times turned to crime to finance her drug habits.  
     
      
    17 The applicant’s criminal history was described in terms which were not disputed by her counsel in the appeal. Her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender is no stranger to the criminal justice system. She has convictions for larceny; failing to appear; break, enter and steal; attempted break and enter; break and enter with intent; accessory after the fact to break, enter and steal; receiving; drug offences; harbouring an escapee; goods in custody; resisting arrest; escaping lawful custody; stealing from a dwelling; obtaining property by deception; assaulting police; using offensive language and making a false representation resulting in a police investigation. It is a record which disentitles her to leniency, It is littered with convictions for offences against law enforcement either by escaping lawful custody; harbouring an escapee; resisting arrest; assaulting police and making a false representation resulting in a police investigation.” 
        
       
      
    18 The sentencing judge was not satisfied that the applicant has good prospects for rehabilitation. However, because of the identified need for counselling and supervision she made a finding of special circumstances. Her Honour was satisfied that sentences of full time custody were necessary to satisfy the requirements of general and specific deterrence and the protection of the public. 
     
      
    19 The applicant submitted that by imposing the maximum term of imprisonment for the offence against s 316 her Honour far exceeded the appropriate range. In response the Crown accepted that the offence was not in the worst category and could not have justified the maximum term of imprisonment.  
     
      
    20 To my mind the circumstances of the offence would have placed this offence within the mid range of objective seriousness. Having regard to the fact that the applicant would be sentenced for the more serious s 319 offence, a sentence which provided a fixed term of 12 months for the s 316 offence was appropriate. Although it is of no practical effect I propose that this Court should intervene and vary the sentence accordingly. 
     
      
    21 With respect to the offence contrary to s 319 the situation is different. The maximum penalty for this offence was 14 years imprisonment. Her Honour imposed a non-parole period of 12 months with a total term of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months. The applicant’s motivation was to assist her son and her Honour had regard to this matter when imposing sentence. This Court has accepted that the fact that a person is protecting a family member is a relevant consideration when sentencing for this offence. However, as the Chief Justice made plain in Nguyen (2004) NSWCCA 332; 149 A Crim R 343 at [55] the “protection of the system of criminal justice should not be significantly less vigilant where its diversion is attempted for reason of family ties, rather than the expectation of monetary gain.” Furthermore as Howie J said in R v Mitchell and Gallager [2007] 11 A Crim R 94 at [31]-[32] “the more serious the offence committed the less weight that can be given to motive as a mitigating factor.” 
     
      
    22 In the present case the offence which had been committed was serious and the applicant continued in her offending for a significant period of time. The applicant engaged in conduct designed to ensure that the police were not able to successfully investigate and prosecute her son. Although she did not act for the purpose of personal gain and her actions did not involve any threat of violence she knowingly suggested that Ms Gajdos should give a false account of the events to the police.  
     
      
    23 The sentence imposed was also required to reflect the applicant’s personal circumstances. She did not plead guilty and accordingly was not entitled to any discount. As I have earlier related the applicant has a serious and lengthy criminal history involving public justice offences. As a consequence her Honour was required to impose a sentence which reflected the applicant’s continuing disobedience of the law and provide a more significant component for personal deterrence Veen v The Queen [No 2] (1987-1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477-8. 
     
      
    24 Any offence against s 319 has a tendency to seriously impact upon the order of our society. Unless members of the community cooperate with the authorities in the investigation of crime, particularly major criminal offences, the rule of law maybe undermined. Given the serious nature of the offence and after giving consideration to the applicant’s personal situation I am not persuaded that the sentence for the s 319 offence was manifestly excessive. The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      1. Application for leave to appeal granted. 
       
      2. Appeal in relation to the sentence for the offence of concealing a serious indictable offence contrary to s 316 of the  
      Crimes Act  
      is upheld and the sentence quashed. The applicant is sentenced to fixed term of 12 months imprisonment commencing 18 December 2007 and expiring on 17 December 2008. 
       
      3. Otherwise the appeal is dismissed. 
       
      
    25 BUDDIN J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
    26 ROTHMAN J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant was acquitted of two offences under the Crimes Act 1900; driving in a manner dangerous causing death (52A(1)(c) Crimes Act) and driving in a manner dangerous causing grievous bodily harm s 52A(3)(c) Crimes Act). Following the acquittals, the applicant was summarily convicted of two offences under the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999; negligent driving occasioning death (s 42(1)(a)) and negligent driving occasioning grievous bodily harm (s 42(1)(b)). 
     
      
    2 The maximum penalties for the offences are imprisonment for 18 months and/or 30 penalty units and imprisonment for 9 months and/or 20 penalty units respectively. For the offence of negligent driving causing death the sentencing judge imposed a sentence of 300 hours of community service. For the offence of negligent driving causing grievous bodily harm he imposed a sentence of 200 hours community service making a total of 500 hours community service. As a result of the convictions the applicant was automatically disqualified from holding a driver’s licence for a period of three years (s 188(2)(d)(i) Road Transport (General) Act 2005). However, by s 188(2)(d)(ii), the court, if it thinks fit to do so, may order a shorter (but not shorter than 12 months) or longer, period of disqualification. 
     
      
    3 The applicant originally lodged an appeal against his conviction but that has been withdrawn. However, he has pursued an application for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed, confined to a complaint about the loss of his driver’s licence for the period of three years, being the automatic period of disqualification. He claims that the discretion conferred by s 188(2)(d)(ii) ought to have been exercised in his favour, in order to reduce the period of disqualification. 
     
      
    4 In his reasons for judgment with respect to the conviction the trial judge recorded the relevant facts. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The matter concerns a collision between the truck driven by the accused and an F250 utility which is parked on the roadside on the Mid-Western Highway at Kings Plains at about 7.30 am on 17 June 2006. Ms Deborah Maher and Mr Neil Wylie were standing near to the utility at the time. Ms Maher was found a short time later to be deceased. Mr Wylie suffered quite catastrophic injuries. 
        
       
       
        
        It was undisputed that the prime mover with a B-double configuration of trailers in tow had a gross weight of 55 tonnes. The accused was travelling at a speed of at least 80 kilometres per hour and he had the sun, which was in low in the sky, it being just after dawn, impairing his vision. 
        
       
       
        
        He conceded in the evidence he gave before the jury that he had forward vision of only perhaps a couple of metres. He said that the steps he took to counter these difficulties were to have put on his sunglasses a few moments before and to have averted his eyes to the fog line. He was alternating his view from the fog line, directly to the fog line as it appeared in his near side external rear vision mirror, and occasionally forward. But as I just said, he conceded he could only see a couple of metres in front. 
        
       
       
        
        I am satisfied that the accused had forewarning of this impending danger because it was apparent to him as he came around the sweeping left-hand bend that preceded the straight that he was coming to an area where the sun would be directly facing him low in the sky. From the end of this sweeping bend he then travelled some 280 metres, which would have taken him about 12 seconds until the point of collision. 
        
       
       
        
        He was unfamiliar with the road and really did not know for how long he would be driving under such conditions. However, he did nothing effective to deal with the dangerous situation when there were things that he could and should have done; by adjusting the sun visors and perhaps if necessary his seat, and certainly by reducing his speed. 
        
       
       
        
        I do not accept that he might have been expected to bring his vehicle to an immediate halt but prudence as a driver of such a vehicle would have it that he should have reduced his speed significantly. 
        
       
       
        
        He should have been taking these steps as the danger must have become apparent as he preceded (sic) through the left-hand bend with the oncoming sun become (sic) more and more directly in his line of sight. What he did was entirely ineffective. 
        
       
       
        
        There was a dispute at the trial as to precisely where the F250 utility was parked in relation to the fog line. The accused claimed that it was on the fog line whereas the prosecution evidence was that it was just to the left of it. 
        
       
       
        
        I accept the evidence of Detective Keogh and Plain Clothes Senior Constable Hadley which was to the effect that the point of impact indicated that the F250 was parked with its driver’s side extremity just to the left of the fog line. 
        
       
       
        
        I might add, although it is unnecessary given the finding I have just indicated, that I would still be satisfied that the accused’s driving was negligent and that this negligence caused the death and the grievous bodily harm, if the utility was slightly over onto the road side of the fog line. It was stationary and, even on the accused’s case, only marginally intruding onto the roadway. Any driver with a modicum of forward vision would have been able to see it and avoid it. 
        
       
       
        
        The problem, however, was not where the F250 was parked. It was that the accused was driving with virtually no forward vision at all with no effective attempts being made to deal with that situation. It is all the worse that he was driving such a potentially lethal weapon as a 55 tonne B-double where there is clearly a greater duty of care called for. 
        
       
       
        
        I find that this was driving in a fashion that was negligent. I find that it was driving in this fashion that caused the collision with the F250 utility and thereby caused, or to use the language of the legislation, ‘occasioned’ the death of Ms Deborah Maher and grievous bodily harm to Mr Neil Wylie.” 
        
       
      
    5 In his remarks on sentence his Honour, correctly in my view, described the offences as serious. The applicant was driving a prime mover with a B-double trailer configuration of which the gross laden weight was 55 tonnes. He entered upon a section of road where because of the sun he could not see more than about 2 metres in front of him. Notwithstanding the danger inherent in these circumstances he did not reduce his speed and came into collision with Ms Maher and Mr Wylie. Ms Maher was killed and Mr Wylie suffered what the sentencing judge described as “catastrophic injuries.” His Honour concluded that the driving of a heavy vehicle of this type required a significantly greater level of responsibility than was exhibited by the applicant. 
     
      
    6 His Honour was of the opinion that the seriousness of the offences justified a sentence of full time imprisonment. However, his Honour was also satisfied, particularly having regard to the exemplary prior record of the offender, including a lack of motor traffic infringements, that the matter could be “best dealt with by the imposition of a community service order.”  
     
      
    7 As I have indicated before this Court the applicant’s challenge to the sentencing judge’s decision was confined to the period of disqualification. His Honour declined to exercise his discretion to order a shorter period of disqualification. He said that he saw no reason why the automatic period ought not to apply. For the applicant to succeed it is therefore necessary to establish, on the principles stated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499, that the exercise of discretion miscarried. His counsel emphasised that the appellant had no previous traffic violations and had served the community as a volunteer in the Rural Fire Service. It was submitted that disqualification for a three year period, which would preclude him from driving a fire truck, would impose a penalty on the applicant and also upon the community. Although the loss of his licence has no impact upon his employment it was submitted that it had a social impact upon him, arising in particular from the fact that he could not drive his teenage daughter to events where she rode her horse. 
     
      
    8 In my opinion the applicant’s submission must be rejected. The offence which he committed was serious and led to the death of one person and very serious injury to another. Being the driver of a heavy vehicle configured as a B-double trailer he had an obligation to other users of the road to ensure that he responded appropriately where, for any reason, the driving conditions were compromised. As the sentencing judge emphasised if the driver’s visibility had been restricted because of heavy rain he was obliged to slow to a speed which would enable him to bring his vehicle to a halt without injuring others in the event of an emergency. When his vision was impaired by the sun he had a similar obligation to slow his vehicle to a speed which would allow him to stop or manoeuvre his vehicle to avoid a collision.  
     
      
    9 Every person who uses the road accepts a risk of injury even when other users drive appropriately. However, they are entitled to expect that the law will operate to punish those who by negligence cause serious injury to others.  
     
      
    10 As the Parliament has made plain an important component of the punishment for the instant offence is the suspension of the offender’s licence to drive. It is a salutary reminder that a licence to drive a vehicle is a privilege which will be removed when negligence occasions the death of another. The Parliament intended that when a licence holder breached the section disqualification from driving for a three year period would normally occur. There will be occasions when the circumstances of the offender or of the particular offence justify a lesser period of disqualification. However, the reasons identified by the applicant are not sufficient in my opinion to displace the automatic period. At the very least the Parliament anticipated that the suspension of a driver’s licence would have social consequences for an offender. Furthermore, I do not doubt that there will be others prepared and able to drive a fire truck. In the meantime the applicant can, when the occasion arises, carry out other duties. No error in the exercise of discretion is demonstrated. 
     
      
    11 Although I would grant leave to appeal the appeal should be dismissed.

     Headnote 
    The respondent, a Canadian national in Australia on a 6 month visa, pleaded guilty to attempting to possess 3.877 kg of pure cocaine and possessing 8.080 kg of pure cocaine, contrary to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (the Code), ss 307.5(1) and 11.1. The offences related to the importation of 10 shipments of cocaine. The respondent was arrested after a controlled Australian Federal Police operation. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 9 years, with a non-parole period of 5 years for each offence. The sentences were ordered to be served concurrently. In sentencing the respondent, the trial judge likened the respondent’s role in the drug importation to that of a “storeman”. He found that the respondent was not to be treated as “a major criminal” for the purpose of sentencing. His Honour took into consideration the respondent’s claim that he did not receive any financial benefit for his participation in the importation but that he had only agreed to become involved following threats he had received from persons in Canada.The Crown appealed against sentence on the ground that the sentences imposed were “manifestly inadequate”. The Crown also relied on the following express errors by the trial judge in the sentencing process: (1) his assessment of the criminality of the respondent’s conduct; (2) his order that the sentences be served concurrently; (3) his failure to adequately reflect the element of general deterrence; and (4) his placement of undue weight on matters personal to the respondent. Held Per Beazley JA (Blanch and Howie JJ agreeing):Did the trial judge err in his approach to the sentencing process?(1) The questions whether an error has been made in making sentences concurrent and whether a trial judge has correctly assessed an accused person’s criminality will affect the question whether the sentences imposed, in totality, were manifestly inadequate: [30].

    (2) Labels such as “courier”, “storeman” and “front” are not necessarily critical when characterising the accused person’s role in a crime for the purpose of imposing sentence. Rather, it is the objective features of the activities undertaken by the accused person, including the position of authority that person held in the organisational hierarchy, that is relevant to the sentencing process: [40]

    (3) An accused person’s engagement in criminal activity under duress does not negate the need to impose a sentence that reflects general deterrence: [84]

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: On 23 April 2008, Ryan Riddell (the respondent) pleaded guilty to the following two offences: 
     
      
       
      (1) Attempting to possess cocaine: on 15 June 2007 he attempted to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, a border controlled drug contrary to the  
      Criminal Code Act 
       1995 (Cth) (the  
      Code 
      ), ss 307.5(1) and 11.1; and  
       
       
      (2) Possessed cocaine: between 20 March 2007 and 16 June 2007 he possessed a commercial quantity of cocaine contrary to the  
      Code 
      , s 307.5(1).  
       
      
    2 The maximum penalty prescribed for each offence is life imprisonment. In this regard the Code, s 11.1 provides that an attempt to commit an offence is punishable as if the offence attempted had been committed.  
     
      
    3 In relation to the first count, the pure quantity of cocaine seized was 3.877 kg. The street value of this quantity was estimated to be between $2,215,527 and $3,101,738. The wholesale value was estimated to be $1,705,360.  
     
      
    4 In relation to the second count, the pure quantity of cocaine was 8.080 kg. That quantity of cocaine had an estimated street value of between $4,615,641 and $6,461,898. The wholesale value was estimated to be $2,163,420.  
     
      
    5 A commercial quantity of cocaine is 2 kg: the Code, s 314.4.  
     
      
    6 The respondent was sentenced by Finnane DCJ on 26 September 2008. In respect of each count, his Honour imposed a term of imprisonment of 9 years, with a non-parole period of 5 years. His Honour ordered that the sentences be served concurrently, to date from 16 June 2007, being the date the respondent first went into custody, and to expire on 15 June 2016. 
     
      
    7 The Crown appealed against the sentences imposed. 
     
      
       
      Facts of the offences 
       
      
    8 The respondent is a Canadian national, who arrived in Australia on 10 March 2007 on a six month visa. On 4 June 2007, three consignments of goods were sent from Canada to Australia using the consignment agency UPS. Each consignment was addressed to “R RIDDELL, Riddell Motorsports”. A mobile phone number and an address in Cronulla were specified. The Consignor was from British Columbia. 
     
      
    9 “Riddell Motorsports” was a non-existent entity and the mobile telephone number was a pre-paid number which was subscribed through Vodafone on 22 April 2001 to a person likely to be a non-existent person. 
     
      
    10 On 8 June 2007, a UPS delivery driver attempted to deliver the three consignments to the given address at Cronulla, by pressing the security intercom. The driver was not a regular delivery driver. No one responded and the driver returned to the UPS depot with the consignments.  
     
      
    11 The consignments were subsequently seized by the Australian Federal Police (the AFP). On examination, each consignment contained cocaine secreted into a car ballast pit. The cocaine was removed by the AFP and replaced by a substitute substance. On 15 June 2007, pursuant to a controlled operation order, an AFP officer, posing as a UPS delivery driver, telephoned the mobile number specified as part of the consignee’s address and spoke to the respondent. Arrangements were made between the AFP officer and the respondent for delivery of the three parcels to the respondent in the car park at the Cronulla address. The respondent accepted delivery of the consignments, signed a receipt for them and loaded the packages into his motor vehicle. Later that morning, the respondent placed the three packages in a Kennards Self Storage Facility at Moore Park. The respondent had rented that storage facility in his own name, but had provided a non-existent address.  
     
      
    12 Shortly thereafter, the respondent travelled to Sydney International Airport, to change his return air ticket to Canada, which was ticketed for 5 September 2007, to a ticket on the next available flight. His flight was changed to the following morning, that is 16 June 2007, at 7.35 am. The respondent was arrested as he attempted to depart Sydney on that flight. 
     
      
    13 At the time of the respondent’s arrest, a mobile telephone with the same number as the consignment; $AUD6,500; the keys to access the Cronulla unit; and a padlock key to another storage unit at Kennards Self Storage, Tempe, were found on him. 
     
      
    14 The AFP conducted a search of the Cronulla unit, the motor vehicle the respondent had hired and the Moore Park storage unit. They found the three consignments delivered to him by the AFP on 15 June 2007 within the storage unit, and in the boot of his motor vehicle found styrofoam packing identical to that used in the consignments.  
     
      
    15 On 3 July 2007, the AFP conducted a search of the Kennards storage unit at Tempe, where they located, relevantly, the following items: 
     
      
       
      (1) a padlock securing the storage unit, the key to which was in the respondent’s possession at the time of his arrest; 
       
      (2) twelve 1 kg compressed blocks of white powder in a blue sports bag; 
       
      (3) a number of empty identical sports bags; 
       
      (4) seventy two dismantled car ballast bars; 
       
      (5) three garbage bags containing styrofoam packing identical to that used in the consignments and the rear boot of the respondent’s motor vehicle; 
       
      (6) nine white cardboard boxes, some of which contained the consignments, with the exception of an area on the boxes the approximate size of the airway bill and shipping sticker, which had been cut and torn away; 
       
      (7) four UPS shipping stickers showing signs of being torn from the white cardboard backings all addressed to “ 
      R RIDDELL, Riddell Motorsports 
      ”; 
       
      (8) tools consistent with those required to dismantle the consignments and retrieve the drugs; 
       
      (9) a Kennards’ lease agreement signed in the name of Ryan Riddell, with a false address; 
       
      (10) a set of electronic scales; and 
       
      (11) cocaine on all surfaces throughout the premises. 
       
      
    16 A forensic examination of the contents of the Kennards storage unit at Tempe revealed the presence of the respondent’s fingerprints on the external parts of some of the packaging.  
     
      
    17 The Tempe Kennards’ vehicle gate log revealed that the unique gate access security pin code allocated to the respondent at the time of leasing the facility was used between 20 March 2007 and 7 June 2007, on most days, on multiple occasions. This use included the following:  
     
      
       
      a) entry, exit, then entry to the facility within only four or five minutes of the first entry; 
       
      b) multiple entries within one or two minutes of each other without exit, suggesting multiple persons were using the same security pin code to enter the facility; 
       
      c) an exit from the facility after multiple entries, suggesting multiple persons who entered separately exited at the same time; and 
       
      d) entry to the facility late at night, with a corresponding exit from the facility a number of hours later at about midnight. 
       
       
      The trial judge’s sentencing remarks 
       
      
    18 In his remarks on sentence, Finnane DCJ characterised the respondent’s role in Australia as being: 
     
      
       
        
        “… to receive consignments of goods coming from Canada to Australia and to ensure that they were placed in a safe place.”  
        
       
       
      His Honour gave definition to that classification in the following terms: 
       
       
        
        “… he was not an importer. Rather he was a person who was in this country arranging to have the goods that were sent here, taken from point of delivery to a storage facility, in fact as it turned out, to two storage facilities. He cannot be regarded as being a courier because he did not carry anything neither can he be regarded as a principal in the operation or even a manager. He can be regarded as  
        something akin to a storeman 
        , a person who moves goods from one place to another and keeps them safe in a store.” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    19 Later, his Honour posed the question: 
     
      
       
        
        “… what should I do with someone who comes here to act as a storeman and a front?”  
        
       
      
    20 His Honour found that the respondent was not involved in the packing or unpacking of any of the cocaine and the first time he became aware that the packages contained cocaine was when he saw some powder that had been apparently spilled in the storage facility in Tempe. The respondent had, however, always understood that the consignments were to contain drugs, although it was his belief that it would probably be some form of hydroponic marijuana. 
     
      
    21 His Honour accepted that the respondent only agreed to become involved in the drug importation as a result of threats he received from persons in Canada who had lost money as a result of investing in a supposed land development scheme to which they had been introduced by the respondent. The respondent also lost money. It appears the scheme was being conducted by a fraudulent mortgage broker. At least some of the persons the respondent introduced to the scheme looked to him to repay the losses they incurred as a result of the broker’s disappearance. When he was unable to do so, these persons made threats against him and his family, unless he cooperated with the drug importation. The threats included death threats.  
     
      
    22 The respondent said that he did not receive any financial benefit from the importation, other than payment for his expenses (but not including personal living expenses) whilst he was in Australia. He used his own VISA card for his personal living expenses.  
     
      
    23 The respondent’s claim that he had been threatened over the mortgage broker’s default was supported by the affidavit of a Canadian lawyer, L Dale Marshall. Mr Marshall, a lawyer practising in Victoria, British Columbia, deposed that he was “a member in good standing with the Law Society of British Columbia”, of which he had been a member since 1989. He said he had been acquainted with the respondent since June 2004. The respondent consulted Mr Marshall in early 2007 about threats he had received from individuals whose names he did not reveal to Mr Marshall. Mr Marshall said that at that time, the respondent expressed concerns for his safety. Mr Marshall said that although he did not make detailed notes of the consultation at the time, the respondent had advised him about the investment with the mortgage broker and of the involvement of other individuals who were now looking to the respondent for compensation. Mr Marshall advised the respondent to report the threats to the police. Mr Marshall said that it was apparent to him at the time that the respondent was worried about the repercussions that such action might have on his family.  
     
      
    24 The respondent is from a small town in British Columbia and in his evidence before Finnane DCJ, he said that this increased his concerns about the threats made against him and his family.  
     
      
    25 Finnane DCJ approached his sentencing task on the basis that, notwithstanding the limited role the respondent played, the importation of cocaine is “a major crime”. His Honour noted, however, that the respondent was not to be treated as “a major criminal” for the purposes of sentencing, because he was not one. In this regard, apart from an assault charge in Canada, the respondent had no prior criminal history and had been gainfully occupied as a self-employed landscape gardener for six years prior to the commission of the offence. The assault charge itself was of a relatively minor nature.  
     
      
    26 His Honour made the sentences concurrent, stating that the reason for doing so was because the offences “really arise out of the same set of transactions”.  
     
      
       
      The Crown appeal 
       
      
    27 The Crown contended that the sentences imposed upon the respondent were manifestly inadequate such that this Court ought to intervene so as to maintain adequate standards of punishment for offences of this nature. In addition, the Crown contended that his Honour erred: 
     
      
       
      (1) in his assessment of the criminality of the respondent’s conduct; 
       
      (2) by ordering the sentences that he imposed be served concurrently; 
       
      (3) in failing to adequately reflect the element of general deterrence; and 
       
      (4) by placing undue weight on matters personal to the respondent. 
       
      
    28 Before turning to these specific grounds, it is convenient to review the principles governing Crown appeals. It is not necessary to do this in great detail, as those principles are well traversed in the authorities. Nonetheless, they set the framework within which this sentence is to be reviewed. It is sufficient for the purposes of setting that framework to refer to the decision of R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 where the principles were conveniently summarised in the following terms by Wood CJ at CL (Meagher JA and Bell J agreeing), at [70]: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) The normal restriction upon appellate review of the exercise of a discretion, as set out in  
        House v The King 
         (1936) 55 CLR 499, applies to Crown appeals against sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen 
         (2000) 202 CLR 321; with the result that this Court cannot merely substitute its opinion, as to the appropriate sentence, for that of the sentencing judge:  
        Lowndes v The Queen 
         (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 671; rather, it may interfere only where error either latent or patent is shown;  
        R v Tait 
         (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 388; and  
        Wong and Leung v The Queen 
         (2001) 76 ALJR 79 at para 58 and 109. 
         
         
        (b) Appeals by the Crown should generally be rare;  
        Malvaso v The Queen 
         (1989) 168 CLR 227 at 234, and unless there is a clear error of principle identified, it would be exceptional for the Court to interfere:  
        R v Baker 
         [2000] NSWCCA 85. 
         
         
        (c) A Crown appeal against sentence is concerned with establishing matters of principle “ 
        for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons 
        ”: per Barwick CJ in  
        Griffiths v The Queen  
        (1977) 137 CLR 293 but this power extends to doing what is necessary to avoid manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing, that is, where the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range for the case in hand:  
        Everett v The Queen 
         (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299;  
        Dinsdale v The Queen  
        (2000) 202 CLR 32, at paras 61 and 62, and  
        Wong & Leung v The Queen 
         at para 109. 
         
         
        (d) The Court has a lively discretion to refuse to intervene even if error has been shown, and in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, it should have regard to the double jeopardy that a convicted person faces as a result of a Crown appeal:  
        R v Allpass 
         (1993) 72 A Crim R 561,  
        R v Papazis 
         (1991) 51 A Crim R 242 at 247, and  
        Wong and Leung v The Queen 
         at para 110. 
         
         
        (e) A sentence which is imposed as a consequence of a successful Crown appeal will generally be less than that which should have been imposed by the sentencing court:  
        R v Holder and Johnston 
         (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 256, and will generally be towards the lower end of the available range of sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen 
         at para 62.” 
        
       
       
      These principles have been reaffirmed many times in this Court: see for example  
      R v MD, BM, NA, JT 
       [2005] NSWCCA 342; 156 A Crim R 372;  
      R v To Si Thanh 
       [2007] NSWCCA 200; 172 A Crim R 121 and  
      Tyler v Regina; Regina v Chalmers 
       [2007] NSWCCA 247; 173 A Crim 458. 
       
      
    29 Although there was no challenge to the correctness of this summary, senior counsel for the respondent drew the Court’s attention to the statement by Hunt AJA in R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 288 at [25], where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… The mere demonstration by the Crown of legal error by the sentencing judge in this case does not throw the sentence open for redetermination unless the sentence he imposed is itself objectively manifestly inadequate.” 
        
       
      
    30 Hunt AJA also pointed out, at [25], that the question whether a sentence was manifestly inadequate is properly left for consideration after the other grounds of appeal have been determined. This approach is particularly apt in this case, especially in relation to the challenge to the respondent’s sentences being made concurrent. The question whether there was an error in making the sentences concurrent will have an effect upon the question whether the sentences imposed, in totality, were manifestly inadequate. The question whether his Honour’s assessment of the criminality of the respondent’s conduct is also of particular relevance to the assessment of the manifest inadequacy of the total sentence imposed. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: did the trial judge err in his assessment of the criminality of the defendant’s conduct? 
       
      
    31 I have already set out the trial judge’s characterisation of the respondent’s role in the importations, to which should be added his Honour’s finding in respect of the extent of that role, that: 
     
      
       
        
        “[the respondent] was not involved in any way in dealing with the cocaine apart from the limited way in which I mentioned.”  
        
       
      
    32 The Crown contended that in order to properly assess the role the respondent played in these importations, account needed to be taken of the following matters, which his Honour failed to do, or failed to do so adequately: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) the [r]espondent came to Australia on a 6 month visa with travel arrangements in place to return at the end of that 6 months; 
         
         
        (2) he organised accommodation and transportation for that 6 month period; 
         
         
        (3) he rented a storage facility to securely store the ongoing consignments of drugs which were delivered to him from Canada; 
         
         
        (4) [i]n Australia he liaised with ‘ 
        Geoff 
        ’ as to these deliveries. Geoff provided him with the finances necessary. He told Geoff how much he needed. All expenses (with the exception of food and alcohol) were paid by Geoff;  
         
         
        (5) the [r]espondent, over a three month period, accepted each of the consignments of drugs, signed for them and then transported them to the secure facility which he had rented for that purpose; 
         
         
        (6) he, at the very least, made arrangements to enable those who were to unpack the drugs access to the storage facilities. Access required his security code and a key. He had unrestricted access to the facility. He retained access to the facility; and 
         
         
        (7) on his own volition, on 15 June 2007 he rented a second secure storage unit in which to store further consignments.”  
        
       
      
    33 The Crown emphasised that this was a well-planned and ongoing scheme involving the importation of large quantities of cocaine into Australia. The respondent’s conduct did not involve merely the storage of one consignment, but many consignments and the facilitation of access by others to the storage facilities for the purpose of retrieving the drugs. The Crown accepted that the respondent was told by others what to do. The Crown emphasised, however, that he was not supervised in any way, but rather was left alone with millions of dollars worth of cocaine. It followed on this submission that he was a ‘trusted’ member of the organisation involved in the drug importation. It was submitted that having regard to all of these factors, the sentence imposed failed to reflect: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) the degree of autonomy with which the [r]espondent acted in fulfilling his responsibilities; 
         
         
        (2) the critical nature of the [r]espondent’s role to the success of the ongoing drug importation scheme which involved many millions of dollars worth of cocaine; and 
         
         
        (3) the degree of trust reposed in him by those who sent the consignments.”  
        
       
      
    34 The Crown contended that even accepting the respondent acted out of fear, he knew what he was doing and agreed to undertake the activity. 
     
      
    35 Senior counsel for the respondent submitted that there was no error in the trial judge’s characterisation of the respondent’s role. He submitted that the trial judge took into account all of the factors identified by the Crown as being relevant to the sentencing process. However, the respondent challenged the Crown’s assertion that the respondent made arrangements enabling others to unpack the drugs or access the storage facilities. I do not agree with this last submission. 
     
      
    36 The respondent further contended there was no basis for the Crown’s criticisms that the trial judge’s remarks failed to reflect the autonomy with which the respondent acted, the critical nature of his role and the degree of trust reposed in him. In particular, it was submitted that the respondent’s role as a “front” was typical of the role allocated to persons lower in the hierarchy of criminal activity and, in particular, the activity associated with commercial drug dealing. As senior counsel for the respondent pointed out, criminals higher in the hierarchy in the organisation and management of drug importation often cleverly distance themselves from direct involvement and use “fronts” such as the respondent, to make it difficult for the criminal activity to be traced back or linked to them. This is a well known phenomenon of this type of criminal activity: see Tyler v Regina; Regina v Chalmers per Simpson J (Spigelman CJ and Harrison J agreeing) at [82].  
     
      
    37 In Tyler v Regina; Regina v Chalmers, Simpson J quoted extensively from the discussion of this topic in R G Fox and A Freiberg, “Sentencing: State and Federal Law in Victoria”, (1999) Oxford University Press. The following passage, taken from pp 1012 to 1015 of the book, is worthy of repetition:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Role of the offender 
         
         
        12.916 The courts have noted that the organisation of the importation, manufacture, or cultivation of drugs and their distribution and sale takes on the features of a hierarchical commercial enterprise [ 
        R v Chaplin 
         (1991) 58 A Crim R 194]: 
         
         
          
          ‘At the top of the distribution chain monopoly of power is high, risk of detection low (but the consequences if detected are very severe) and addiction rare. Profits at that level are very high. Further down the line monopoly of power evaporates and the risk of detection rises as the number of separate transactions increases … Generally manufacturers (or importers), and wholesalers handle much larger quantities of the drug than middlemen, retailers or consumers. The level of operation within the distribution chain, the scale of operation and the quantities of drugs, all correlate reasonably closely, but it is by no means a perfect relationship.’ 
          
         
         
        The level of sentences will generally reflect the level of the offender in the hierarchy, whether he is an importer/producer, a courier, a medium scale distributor, or a low level distributor/consumer …  
        However, the fact that an offender is a mere retailer does not necessarily entail a lenient sentence, only one lower than would have been earned had the person been a principal. 
         
         
        12.917 The severest of penalties will be reserved for offenders who have taken ‘a leading or executive part in the crime’, … the ‘masterminds or controlling agents’ … who often finance the entire venture. Large quantities are often involved, … and the schemes are usually carefully planned as commercial operations for personal financial gain …” (Emphasis added)  
        
       
      
    38 Senior counsel for the respondent contended that his Honour’s characterisation of the respondent as a “front” was well based, particularly having regard to the fact that the respondent used his own name and identity documents. It was submitted that this reflected how low the respondent’s position was in the hierarchy and contra-indicated the likelihood the respondent was in a position of trust. It was submitted that had he been trusted, it was more likely that he would not have used his personal identification documents. 
     
      
    39 Senior counsel for the respondent also relied upon the fact that the respondent had not received any money or benefit from the importation, other than perhaps being “relieved” of the responsibility to make good the losses of those whom he had introduced to the Canadian mortgage scheme. Senior counsel for the respondent also argued that the respondent’s role was not critical to the success of the ongoing drug importation in the same sense as the role of a principal manager and financier. 
     
      
    40 In my opinion, there was no error in the description or characterisation that the sentencing judge gave to the respondent’s role in the drug importation. The evidence permitted of a finding that the respondent was a “storeman” or a “front”. Indeed, the evidence did not support a finding of any different, or, more particularly, any higher role. However, participating in a drug importation in that role does not render the criminality minor. As his Honour remarked, the crimes were serious.  
     
      
    41 More relevantly, as both the Crown and senior counsel for the respondent acknowledged, labels such as “courier”, “storeman” and “front” are not critical in a case such as this. Rather, it is the objective features of the activities undertaken by the accused person, including the position of authority that person held in the organisational hierarchy, that is relevant to the sentencing process: see R v Wong & Leung [1999] NSWCCA 420; 48 NSWLR 340; 108 A Crim R 531. 
     
      
    42 Having reached that common position, the Crown and the respondent thereafter parted company.  
     
      
    43 The Crown submitted that the respondent was in a ‘position of trust’ and that it is apparent from the sentence imposed that his Honour failed to give sufficient weight, both to the autonomy with which he acted and the critical nature of his role. That the respondent was in a position of trust was apparent, on the Crown’s submission, from the fact he was unsupervised in his handling of up to ten shipments of cocaine and, in particular, in having access at any time to the place where the drugs were stored. Further, he was not accountable to anyone locally, his only contact being with the person known as “Geoff”, who provided him with money to pay the rent on the unit in Cronulla, the hire of the car and the Kennards storage units.  
     
      
    44 The Crown also placed some emphasis upon the fact that when the respondent tried to leave Australia, he did so without informing Geoff either that he was leaving, or that he had obtained alternate storage space. In this regard, the respondent’s evidence was that he had intended to tell those with whom he had been dealing in Canada of the alternate storage space when he arrived back in Canada. He also said he intended to give those persons the key for the Moore Park storage unit. The respondent explained that he had obtained the alternate storage facility because Geoff had told him not to go back to the unit at Tempe. He said that when he was given that information, he thought that “the other storage was gone, like, closed down”.  
     
      
    45 There are certain aspects of this part of the respondent’s evidence which are curious. The respondent said that Geoff telephoned him before each delivery and that this had happened on the occasion of the delivery on 15 June. He said it was Geoff who told him not to use the Tempe storage facility any longer. The inference to be drawn from his evidence was that he was not given any instructions in respect of alternate storage. Nonetheless, the respondent took it upon himself to open a new storage facility and not to inform Geoff that he had done so. 
     
      
    46 I have not been able to reach any conclusion as to what this evidence demonstrates, as it leaves too many questions unanswered. That is sufficient to reject the Crown’s submissions that the evidence demonstrated the respondent was in a position of trust. I should add, however, that I consider there was merit in the respondent’s submission that his actions and explanations as to why he acted as he did in relation to the storage unit at Moore Park are explained by his fear. It is at least equally possible that his actions, in particular his loyalty to those to whom he was answerable in Canada, arose out of his fear of those persons, rather than his loyalty being indicative of any position of trust. 
     
      
    47 The Crown relied upon the same factual matters as demonstrating that the respondent was acting autonomously, so that he should have been sentenced on the basis that his role was higher in the organisational hierarchy than his Honour considered was the case. I do not see any error in the trial judge’s approach in this regard. The evidence did not support a finding that the respondent’s role in the organisation was other than performing the task of taking delivery of the goods, storing them and facilitating access to the storage unit.  
     
      
    48 That does not mean, however, that the role played by the respondent was not an essential part of the drug importation. The goods had to be received and stored for the purposes of distribution, presumably, in this case, to “middlemen” who would then on-sell the drugs for their ultimate dissemination into the community. The distribution of drugs is the step that brings in the profits to those organising the importation. It is also the step that wreaks the harm to the community and to the individual drug takers. It is that step which makes the importation and possession of significant quantities of drugs such serious offences. The Legislature has seen fit to reflect its abhorrence of the crimes of which the respondent was convicted with maximum penalies of life imprisonment.  
     
      
    49 In Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 215 ALR 213 the High Court, in the judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ, said, at [30], that maximum penalties are not enacted by legislatures as “mere formalities” and that “[j]udges need sentencing yardsticks”. The Court then explained, at [31]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… careful attention to maximum penalties will almost always be required, first because the legislature has legislated for them; secondly, because they invite comparison between the worst possible case and the case before the court at the time; and thirdly, because in that regard they do provide, taken and balanced with all of the other relevant factors, a yardstick.” 
        
       
      
    50 The respondent is only to be sentenced for his actual criminality. The question for the trial judge was what was the appropriate sentence to impose, having regard to the criminal conduct in which the respondent engaged. The question for this Court is whether his Honour erred in the sentencing process: see House v R [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499, and in particular, whether the sentences imposed in totality were manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    51 Although there was no error in his Honour’s characterisation of the respondent as a “storeman”, it is necessary to have regard to the essential aspects of that role. The question whether his Honour had sufficient regard to the importance of that role cannot be determined in isolation. Relevantly, for the purposes of the present case, the Crown relied upon two further matters within the combination of factors relevant to determining an appropriate sentence, which it contended were not appropriately reflected in the sentences imposed.  
     
      
    52 The Crown contended that there was another consideration to which his Honour failed to have regard in sentencing, namely, the need for general deterrence. It was submitted that that failure was also reflected in the manifest inadequacy of the sentences. The Crown further contended that his Honour placed too much emphasis on the appellant’s personal circumstances, and in particular on the duress under which he was acting. It was submitted that this also led him into error in imposing a total sentence that did not adequately reflect the totality of the respondent’s offending. These two issues became linked in that the respondent submitted that this case was not an appropriate one to give full force to general deterrence in circumstances where the respondent was acting under duress. 
     
      
    53 It is convenient to consider these matters, which are encompassed in grounds 3 and 4, before considering whether his Honour erred, both in the sentences he imposed and in making those sentences concurrent.  
     
      
       
      Ground 3: failure to impose a sentence that reflected general deterrence. 
       
       
      Ground 4: overemphasis on personal circumstances of the respondent  
       
      
    54 In the manner in which ground 3 was argued in the course of the appeal, the Crown contended that as the trial judge made no reference to general deterrence in his remarks on sentence it was apparent that he had overlooked it. However, it is clear that his Honour was aware of the need for general deterrence, given his comment that the drug trade causes illnesses and crimes in society. The question is whether his Honour gave sufficient attention to general deterrence and what role it should play in the sentencing of the respondent.  
     
      
    55 General deterrence is one of the fundamental considerations to be taken into account in determining the sentence to impose on a guilty offender: see, for example, DPP (Cth) v El Karhani (1990) 97 ALR 373 at 380; (1990) 21 NSWLR 370 at 377; (1990) 51 A Crim R 123 at 130; R v Muanchukingkan (1990) 52 A Crim R 354 at 359; Budiman v R (1998) 102 A Crim R 411 at 416 and R v Klein [2001] NSWCCA 120 at [14]; (2001) 121 A Crim R 90 at 93.  
     
      
    56 El Karhani involved an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions (Commonwealth) against a sentence imposed on an elderly Lebanese national for importing 447.6 g of pure heroin into Australia on a flight from Abu Dhabi to Sydney. At 380, the Court cited the following passage from Radich [1954] NZLR 86 at 87, which the Court noted had already been cited and applied in numerous cases (see, for example, Cooke (1955) 72 WN (NSW) 132 at 135; R v Herring (1956) 73 WN (NSW) 203 at 205; R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594 at 597-598; Davey (1980) 2 A Crim R 254 at 260 and Hogan (1987) 30 A Crim R 399 per Rice J at 412): 
     
      
       
        
        “One of the main purposes of punishment ... is to protect the public from the commission of such crimes by making it clear to the offender and to other persons with similar impulses that, if they yield to them, they will meet with severe punishment …The fact that punishment does not entirely prevent all similar crimes should not obscure the cogent fact that the fear of severe punishment does, and will, prevent the commission of many that would have been committed if it was thought that the offender could escape without punishment, or with only a light punishment.” 
        
       
      
    57 Courts have also long recognised the importance of general deterrence in sentencing in respect of drug importation offences. In R v Cheung Wai Man & Ors (Supreme Court of New South Wales, 22 March 1991, unreported) Sully J said:  
     
      
       
        
        “The importation of heroin into this country in any amount and at any time constitutes a deliberate threat to the well being of the Australian community …The importation or the attempted importation of, and the trafficking or attempted trafficking [of heroin] … is in a very real sense a declaration of war upon this community. It is a distinct challenge both to concepts of human dignity and to moral values otherwise which are fundamental to our way of life. It is no less a challenge to the rule of law which is in the end the ultimate guarantor of the personal freedoms and of the social stability which all of us Australians take for granted … In the face of such challenges each of the institutional supports of our society has a role to play. That of the Courts is to punish and deter according to law. Obviously, the Courts alone cannot meet adequately, let alone defeat, the challenge of which I have been speaking. What the Courts can do is to punish drug-related crime in a way which signals plainly to drug traffickers, especially foreign drug traffickers, that the Courts are both able and willing to calibrate their sentences until a point is reached at which, to a significant extent even if never perfectly, fear of punishment risked will neutralise the greed which is the only possible motive of those who … engage in drug-related crime when they are themselves not drug dependent."" 
        
       
      
    58 This passage has been cited with approval on numerous occasions. Its relevance is not restricted to the importation of the particular drug in that case. It is an important statement of principle relating to the importation of any illegal drug. Sully J reiterated his comments in Regina v Thanh Hai Nguyen Regina v Van Hau Pham Regina v Kam Pui To Regina v Huy Quang Vu [2004] NSWSC 144 at [53], which involved the importation of ecstasy. See also R v Chen & Ors [2002] NSWCCA 174 at [286]; (2002) 130 A Crim R 300 at 382; R v Chun Hing Law [2002] NSWSC 952 at [24] and R v Stanbouli [2003] NSWCCA 355 at [14] per Hulme J (with whom Spigelman CJ and Carruthers AJ agreed on this point).  
     
      
    59 Senior counsel for the respondent did not contest that general deterrence was relevant to the sentencing process. Rather, he contended that in circumstances where the offender was acting under duress, the objective seriousness of the offence was less than would be the case if the offender was acting out of motives of greed or financial benefit. He submitted that where duress and fear were the motivating forces behind the offending, general deterrence does not have a significant role to play in the sentencing process. Rather, the position is more akin to where an offender was suffering a mental illness. In the case where the mental illness is not of such a nature to constitute a defence to the charge, it remains relevant in the sentencing process, particularly in respect of the emphasis that is given to both general and specific deterrence: see R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255, in which Spigelman CJ noted, at [18] and [23], that mental illness may mean that a court will place less emphasis on both specific and general deterrence. The reason that is so was explained by his Honour, at [23], in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “To the extent that mental illness explains the offence … then an offender’s inability to understand the wrongfulness of his actions, or to make reasonable judgments, or to control his or her faculties and emotions, will impact on the level of culpability of the offender, even where the illness does not amount to an excuse at law.” 
        
       
      
    60 Senior counsel for the respondent submitted that the position was no different for a person who was acting under a threat of death, as the respondent in this case was. He said that such a person had no real choice but to accede to the ‘request’ that he assist in the criminal enterprise. It was submitted there is no point when sentencing an offender in that position to place any emphasis on general deterrence.  
     
      
    61 The Courts have not taken that view. The relevance of duress to the sentencing process in a drug importation was considered by this Court in R v Liu [2005] NSWCCA 378. The duress in that case was significant. Ms Liu and her boyfriend had agreed to travel to Europe to obtain “water goods” for a third party. Ms Liu had understood that to mean the purchase of handbags and watches, to be sold at a cheaper price in Hong Kong, without the involvement of any illegal conduct. However, when they were informed that they were to take white powder, which Ms Liu and her boyfriend understood to be drugs, into Australia, her boyfriend resisted. He was beaten in her presence and she was threatened with rape and dreadful consequences to her family. Ms Liu was pregnant at the time. There was no question of any financial reward for Ms Liu participating. Ms Liu was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years for one count of importing 1.582 kg of pure heroin. She appealed against the severity of sentence.  
     
      
    62 In relation to the duress to which Ms Liu was subject McClellan CJ at CL (Hoeben J agreeing) stated, at [34]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The circumstances in which the applicant committed the offence, her own personal circumstances, including her pregnancy and submissive personality, the difficulties which she faced during imprisonment, the problems of giving birth to a child and the nurturing of that child during her prison term were all matters which required careful consideration when imposing a sentence. An examination of the sentencing judge’s remarks reveals a thorough and careful assessment of all these matters and an ultimate amelioration of the sentence by a shortening of the non-parole period. To my mind, her Honour did not commit any error. The offence committed by the applicant was of the greatest degree of seriousness carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The abhorrence of the community and the determination of the legislature to deter others from the importation of narcotics is apparent.  
        Whatever be the circumstances of an individual who imports a commercial quantity of heroin, the offender must expect a significant period of imprisonment. Although, as the evidence suggests, it is unlikely that the applicant will re-offend, the sentence which she receives must be sufficient to remind others considering similar criminal activity that, if caught, a lengthy prison term will almost certainly follow. 
        ”  
          
        (Emphasis added) 
        
       
       
      Those comments are particularly apt in this case.  
       
      
    63 In my opinion, the totality of the sentences imposed in this case were so inadequate that it likely that his Honour failed to give appropriate weight to the need for general deterrence and gave undue weight to the fact that the respondent was acting under duress. It is also likely that he gave undue weight to the respondent’s subjective circumstances. This conclusion, in effect, is determinative of the appeal. However, because of the otherwise strong subjective case of the respondent, it is appropriate that I deal with the remaining ground of appeal, and in particular explain why I consider that his Honour erred in ordering that the sentences imposed be served concurrently.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2: did the trial judge err in ordering the sentences be served concurrently? 
       
      
    64 The first consideration in respect of this ground of appeal is that the respondent was charged with two specific offences. The first offence was attempting to possess cocaine. That offence was committed on 15 June 2007 and related to the 3.877 kg of drugs received on that day. The second offence was possessing cocaine between 20 March and 16 June 2007. The quantity of drug involved in that offence was 8.080 kg.  
     
      
    65 In determining the appropriate sentence, the trial judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no doubt that the drug trade is the cause of other illnesses in society and many other crimes. I am required to impose a sentence that takes into account; his background, all the principles set out in the  
        Commonwealth Crimes Act 
        , his plea of guilty. I have to consider whether there is any possibility of imposing a non custodial sentence. I have considered that and I do not think there is, but I do not approach this merely by weighing up the value of the amount ultimately found and trying to compute a sentence by working out what other people who were found in possession of similar quantities got. Much more is required than that. One has to look at the entire circumstances and how someone became involved, not merely the quantum of the drugs involved. The High Court exposed the error of the Court of Criminal Appeal’s approach in this regard some years ago.”  
        
       
      
    66 His Honour considered that the same sentence should be imposed for each offence and that those sentences should be served concurrently. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I make both sentences concurrent because they really arise out of the same set of transactions. [The respondent] should spend time in custody that reflects his involvement in the overall matter.”  
        
       
      
    67 The Crown contended that notwithstanding that the consignments on 15 June 2007 were part of an ongoing scheme to import drugs into Australia, this did not lead to the conclusion that the sentence for one offence would suffice for both. The Crown submitted that the sentence for the offence in count 1 could not comprehend the criminality of the offence in count 2 and that each was, and therefore should be treated as, a discrete act of criminality.  
     
      
    68 Senior counsel for the respondent contended that the sentence imposed in respect of each offence was appropriate. He submitted that the Court ought not be swayed by the obvious numerical difference between an importation of 3.877 kg and an importation of 8.080 kg. He submitted that there was not a great difference in the quantity of drug in each offence and that in accordance with the principles in R v Wong & Leung, it was necessary not to give too much emphasis to the weight of the drugs the subject of the charges. He submitted that if the objective criminality in the two offences were the same, then that would lead to the same sentence. He submitted this was the case here. 
     
      
    69 Senior counsel for the respondent also submitted that the reason the respondent was charged with two offences and not one was because the controlled delivery of the substituted substance could not have been the subject of a possession charge. Rather, taking delivery of that consignment could, as a matter of law, only amount to the offence charged in count 1. Had there been no substitution of the drugs, the delivery of the 3.877 kg on 15 June 2007 would, or could, have been treated as part of a single ongoing importation. Accordingly, on this submission, the sentencing judge was correct in treating the two offences as part of one transaction and, it followed, there was no error in his Honour making the sentences for the two offences concurrent. 
     
      
    70 The respective positions of the Crown and the respondent on this ground raise fundamental and well-known principles. The fact that they were in significant contest as to the correctness of his Honour’s approach means that a brief review of those principles is warranted to determine whether his Honour erred in the sentence he imposed for each offence and in making the sentences concurrent.  
     
      
       
      Sentencing for individual offences, concurrency and totality  
       
      
    71 In Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said at [45]: 
     
      
       
        
        “A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality (Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59).” 
        
       
      
    72 Notwithstanding this clear statement of the correct approach to sentencing, it is accepted that Pearce does not prescribe a mandatory approach to sentencing, although it reflects the usual, or preferred approach, as is apparent from Johnson v R [2004] HCA 15; (2004) 205 ALR 346. In Johnson, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ said at [26]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the joint judgment in  
        Pearce 
         recognises the currency of [ 
        Mill v The Queen 
        ] by referring to the principle of totality which it reiterates. The joint judgment in  
        Mill 
         expresses a preference for what should be regarded as the orthodox, but not necessarily immutable, practice of fixing a sentence for each offence and aggregating them before taking the next step of determining concurrency.  
        Pearce 
         does not decree that a sentencing judge may never lower each sentence and then aggregate them for determining the time to be served. To do that, is not to do what the joint judgment in  
        Pearce 
         holds to be undesirable, that is, to have regard  
        only 
         to the total effective sentence to be imposed on an offender. The preferable course will usually be the one which both cases commend but neither absolutely commands. Judges of first instance should be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime under which the sentencing is effected.” (Original emphasis) (Footnote omitted) 
        
       
      
    73 The underlying role of the principal of totality in determining whether sentences should be imposed concurrently or not was considered by this Court in Cahyadi v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41. There, Howie J (Adams and Price JJ agreeing) stated, at [27]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality:  
        can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence?  
        If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences.  
        If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. 
         Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    74 Before considering whether his Honour erred in the application of those principles, there is another issue which is relevant in this case, namely, the relevance that should be attached to the weight or quantity of the drug imported.  
     
      
    75 In Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ rejected the notion that usually, the weight of the drugs imported was the chief factor to be taken into account in fixing a sentence. Their Honours’ focus upon that question arose having regard to the issue on the appeal to the High Court. Wong was an appeal from a “guideline judgment” of this Court where the Court had determined that the weight of the narcotic imported was the chief factor to be taken into account in fixing the sentence to be imposed on a person knowingly participating in the importation: see R v Wong & Leung [1999] NSWCCA 420; 48 NSWLR 340; 108 A Crim R 531. The High Court rejected that proposition. The High Court did not, however, relegate the weight of the narcotic to an irrelevancy. Senior counsel for the respondent acknowledged this, but in his submission, weight was only relevant when there was a significant discrepancy, for example, between 1 kg and 100 kg. He submitted that there was no relevance so far as the sentencing process was concerned between an importation of approximately 4 kg and an importation of approximately 8 kg, as was the case here. Accordingly, the same sentence for each offence was appropriate. Since there was, in reality, only one ongoing transaction, the concurrency of those sentences was also appropriate. 
     
      
    76 In Wong, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ observed, at [64] that there are a whole range of matters relevant to the sentencing process, including the quantity of the drug involved, the offender’s knowledge of what was being imported, the offender’s role in the importation and the reward the offender hoped to gain. Their Honours stated:  
     
      
       
        
        “In general, however, the larger the importation, the higher the offender's level of participation, the greater the offender's knowledge, the greater the reward the offender hoped to receive, the heavier the punishment that would ordinarily be exacted. It is by these kinds of criteria that comparisons are to be made between examples of the offence and the sentences that are or were imposed.” 
        
       
      
    77 Their Honours commented that in some cases factors other than the quantity of the drug will be of greater significance in the sentencing process. Their Honours stated, at [68]-[69]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It must be recognised that not all offenders will know or even suspect how much pure narcotic is to be imported. Apart from the extent to which the pure narcotic is diluted or cut (a matter about which those involved in the importation may know little or nothing), it is by no means uncommon for many of those involved in an importation of narcotics to know nothing at all about what they are dealing with, except that it is a quantity of narcotic.  
         
         
        It follows that there will be many cases in which a sentencing judge will be more concerned to identify the level of the offender's criminality by looking to the state of the offender's knowledge about the importation in which he or she was involved. Often enough, information about the kind and size of reward given or promised to the offender for involvement in the importation will be seen as important in fixing a sentence and distinguishing between offenders.” 
        
       
      
    78 In this case, the respondent did not become aware of the type of drug being imported until sometime after he commenced taking delivery of the consignments. Nevertheless, he must have recognised that a significant quantity of drug was involved and that he was involved in an ongoing drug importation exercise. He had come to Australia for the specific purpose of taking delivery of consignments of drugs over a six month period. In the period of three months to 15 June, he had already taken delivery of about 10 consignments, almost one a week.  
     
      
    79 In my opinion, the flaw in the respondent’s suggested approach in this case is the proposition that this offender, who was involved in an ongoing importation over a period of three months, admittedly acting under duress, should receive the same sentence for the importation of approximately 4 kg as he should for the total importation of approximately 12 kg. On this approach, the same sentence would be appropriate for three times the quantity of drugs being distributed into the community. The wholesale and retail value of these drugs was large. The rewards for those who were to be the ultimate financial recipients of the transactions would have been substantially greater. The harm to the community was correspondingly greater. Nonetheless, the respondent contended that the total sentence for the possession of approximately 4 kg was an appropriate sentence for the possession of the whole. In my opinion, there is such a disparity between 4 kg and 8 kg that a greater sentence for count 2 ought to have been imposed. I am also of the opinion that there should have been some accumulation of the sentences so as to reflect the total criminality involved.  
     
      
    80 My view that these sentences were manifestly inadequate is reinforced by the review undertaken by Hulme J in R v Kevenaar [2004] NSWCCA 210; 148 A Crim R 155 (Simpson and Howie JJ agreeing) of the range of sentences that the courts have imposed on persons involved in drug importations, at the lower end of the hierarchy. His Honour observed, at [82], that head sentences of between 7 and 10 years have been the general range for couriers involved in importations of between 500 g and 2 kg. In one of the cases reviewed, R v Studenikin [2004] NSWCCA 164; (2004) 60 NSWLR 1; 147 A Crim R 1, his Honour, at [102], noted that the Court had reduced a sentence of 12 years to 10.5 years for an importation of 3.2786 kg (pure weight) of ecstasy tablets for a person who had pleaded guilty at a very early stage. In Studenikin the Court made no change to the non-parole period of 7 years, which the Court described, at [76], as “lenient”.  
     
      
    81 In Kevenaar Hulme J, at [104], summarised the conclusions to be drawn from the cases he had reviewed in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “What conclusions should be drawn from the above? Firstly, that the sentences imposed on couriers involved with trafficable quantities have generally been 6 or 7 years. Secondly, having regard to the fact that a higher maximum penalty is prescribed for commercial quantities, viz. 500 grams or more, one would expect that as quantity increased and particularly the further it moved away from 500 grams, so penalties could be expected to increase. Thirdly, the general pattern of sentences for commercial quantities show that that has occurred. Fourthly, there is in the decisions of  
        Budiman, Macgregor  
        [[2000] NSWCCA 552; (2000) 120 A Crim R 24], 
         Bowers  
        [(1997) 97 A Crim R 461] 
          
        and 
         Amran Efendi 
         [[2001] NSWCCA 391] strong support for the view that, in the case of offenders who had pleaded guilty, a head sentence of 8 to 10 years imprisonment is appropriate in the case of quantities appreciably above 500 grams but under 1 kilogram and a clear indication in  
        Bowers  
        that the sentences should not be less than 8 years. Fifthly,  
        Behar  
        [(Court of Criminal Appeal, Spigelman CJ, McInerney and Sperling JJ, 14 October 1998, unreported)] provides support for this view.” 
        
       
      
    82 A consideration of cases in the last 12 months in this Court confirms that sentences for offences similar to those for which the respondent was convicted continue in the same range as identified by Hulme J in Kevenaar. Late last year, Hulme J again undertook a review of cases in Nguyen v R [2008] NSWCCA 280. His Honour’s review in that case, which considers some of the cases to which I have had regard, also confirms that this is so.  
     
      
    83 It is apparent from the above that the non-parole period to which the respondent was sentenced in respect of count 1, which involved a quantity of 3.877 kg, was lenient. The Crown conceded that this sentence taken in isolation was not manifestly inadequate so as to require appellate intervention. However, both the head sentence and the non-parole period for count 2 were, in my opinion, manifestly inadequate and this Court should re-sentence the respondent. 
     
      
    84 Before proceeding to re-sentence the respondent, I should say something further about the role that the respondent performed. The cases reviewed in Kevenaar involved persons who were couriers, many of them “mules”, carrying the drugs on or in their person. In this case, the nature and scale of the importation was such that there were no couriers. In other words, the use of couriers was not part of the modus operandi of getting the goods into the country. Rather, the goods were consigned to Australia disguised in heavy metal car parts. Whilst it is likely, from the evidence, that a driver within UPS was involved in the delivery of the drugs to the respondent, the respondent was the only effective operative in receiving the goods and placing them into storage for the purposes of onward collection and distribution. The essentiality of that role is significant.  
     
      
    85 In re-sentencing, the respondent has the benefit of the favourable findings made by the sentencing judge and appropriate weight should be given to those matters. Likewise, it is relevant that the respondent engaged in this criminal activity under duress. Whilst this does not negative the need to impose a sentence that reflects general deterrence, the trial judge accepted that the respondent did not receive any financial reward, other than payment of his rent and the like, for his participation. This is a relevant factor in determining the sentence that ought to be imposed. If the respondent had engaged in the importation for his own financial gain, that would have reflected adversely on him. In re-sentencing, I have also taken into account that the respondent will substantially spend his period of imprisonment without the benefit of familial support or the support of close friends.  
     
      
    86 I also take into account that the respondent pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. The respondent should have the benefit of his pleas of guilty and in the sentences I propose I have allowed a substantial discount (25 per cent) from the sentences that would otherwise have been imposed but for those pleas: see Cameron v R [2002] HCA 6; (2002) 209 CLR 339; (2002) 187 ALR 65. Finally, I should add that in setting the non-parole period, I have applied the proportion usually set for Commonwealth offences: see, for example, James v Regina [2009] NSWCCA 62 at [15].  
     
      
    87 The sentences that this Court may impose are constrained by the principles that govern Crown appeals. Having regard to those principles I would propose the following orders:  
     
      
       
      Orders 
      : 
       
       
      1. Leave to appeal granted; 
       
       
      2. Appeal allowed; 
       
       
      3. Set aside the orders made by Finnane DCJ on 26 September 2009 and impose the following sentences: 
       
       
        
        Count 1: A non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 16 June 2007 and expiring on 15 June 2012 with a balance of term of 4 years commencing on 16 June 2012 and expiring on 15 June 2016; 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2. A non-parole period of 6 years 6 months commencing on 16 December 2007 and expiring on 15 June 2014 with a balance of term of 4 years commencing on 16 June 2014 and expiring on 15 June 2018.  
        
       
       
        
        The total effective sentence imposed on the respondent is 11 years with a non-parole period of 7 years.  
        
       
      
    88 BLANCH J: I agree with Beazley JA. 
     
      
    89 HOWIE J: I agree with Beazley JA.  
     
      
    90 THE COURT: Since the orders were pronounced, it was noted that they did not comply with Pt 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). The orders are varied as follows: 
     
      
       
      1 Appeal allowed; 
       
       
      2. Set aside the orders made by Finnane DCJ on 26 September 2009 and impose the following sentences: 
       
       
        
        Count 1: A sentence of 9 years commencing on 16 June 2007 and expiring on 15 June 2016; 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2. A sentence of 10 years 6 months commencing on 16 December 2007 and expiring on 15 June 2018. 
        
       
       
      Specify a non-parole period of 7 years to date from 16 June 2007 and to expire on 15 June 2014. 
       
       
      The Court notes that leave is not required for an appeal under s 5D of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 
      .

      Friday 3 June 2009 
       
       
       
      2008/1454 R v Daniela Beltrame 
       
       
       
      REASONS FOR SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 2 February 2009 Daniela Beltrame was arraigned on the following charges: 
     
      
    1. that on or about 26 April 2001 at Canley Heights in the State of New South Wales she murdered Ederino Beltrame. 2. that between 24 October 2000 and 30 April 2001, she forged a will purporting to be the last will of Ederino Beltrame, with intent to defraud. 3. that on 11 January 2007, at Narellan Vale she gave Loretta Appleyard a document containing reasons why she, Loretta Appleyard, should not give evidence adverse to Daniela Beltrame, with intent to persuade Loretta Appleyard, a witness in a Coronial Inquest into the death of Ederino Beltrame, to give false evidence. 
     
      
    2 The offender pleaded guilty to the second charge of forgery and not guilty to the first and third charges. A jury trial then proceeded. On Monday 2 March 2009 the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of the first charge and guilty of the third charge. 
     
      
    3 The offender therefore comes to be sentenced in relation to the second and third charges in the indictment. 
     
      
    4 The background of the matter is as follows. In April 2001 the offender was living in a house in Canley Heights with her father, Ederino Beltrame, her daughter, Romina, and her son, Fabio. Her older daughter, Loretta, had previously lived there until she got married on 8 April 2001, at which time she took her husband’s surname of Appleyard. 
     
      
    5 There were significant tensions in the relationship between the offender and her father. The offender had a younger brother John, who had been adopted by her parents when he was very young. Her father had always seemed to prefer John, and this was a source of friction between them. Mr Beltrame had routinely made provision for John in his wills, notwithstanding that John had been convicted of manslaughter and was serving a lengthy prison sentence. 
     
      
    6 On the morning of 26 April 2001, Mr Beltrame was found dead in his bed at home. He had suffered ill health for some time, and it was assumed by all concerned, including his general practitioners, that he had died of natural causes. In due course, the offender, through her solicitor, sought and was granted probate of Mr Beltrame’s estate. For this purpose she presented a will dated 7 April 2001, apparently signed by Ederino Beltrame and witnessed by the offender’s daughter, Loretta, and by a family friend, Giovanni Rossi. The will was written on a standard form, without the direct involvement of a lawyer. The will appointed Daniela Beltrame executrix and trustee and made her the sole beneficiary of the estate. 
     
      
    7 As we now know, the will was not signed by Mr Beltrame on 7 April 2001. Rather, the offender forged her father’s signature on the will. A few days after his death she presented it to Loretta and asked her to sign it as a witness, which she did. Loretta did not know at the time that the will had been forged. She said that the signature appeared similar to her grandfather’s. 
     
      
    8 Later in 2001 significant questions emerged as to the authenticity of this will. Mr Beltrame had from time to time changed his will over the years. However, he had always done so through a solicitor and had always made provision for his son John. 
     
      
    9 Pursuant to these suspicions, listening devices and telephone intercepts were installed and the offender’s conversations with her two daughters were recorded. No seriously incriminating statements were recorded. 
     
      
    10 In February 2002 the offender went to Italy where she remained for about four years. She returned to Australia in 2006. After her return the suspicions as to the circumstances of her father’s death and the authenticity of his will were revived. An inquest into the death of Mr Beltrame was scheduled to take place early in February 2007. 
     
      
    11 In December 2006 the offender’s daughter Loretta received a subpoena to give evidence at the inquest. At Christmas she visited her mother and told her that she was proposing to tell the truth about the will at the inquest. 
     
      
    12 On 11 January 2007 Loretta was at her home at Narellan Vale when her mother arrived, having, unusually, parked her car some distance away. The offender presented her daughter with a lengthy document which she asked her to read immediately. That document was later extracted from the offender’s computer, and became an exhibit at the trial. It is a long document, comprising more than four pages of tightly spaced typing. As Loretta herself described it, it contained a considerable amount of emotional blackmail, warning Loretta of the dire consequences to herself, the offender and to other family members if she proceeded to do as she threatened. It was an extremely self-involved and self-pitying missive. In addition to the dire emotional consequences to family members, the document threatened serious legal consequences to Loretta, should she continue her planned course. These consequences were said to include extensive cross-examination as well as the real possibility that she herself would be arrested. Ultimately, the document pleaded with Loretta to remain silent. It was giving Loretta this document which founded the charge of doing an act with intent to persuade her to give false evidence. 
     
      
    13 After reading this document Loretta repeated to her mother that she was going to tell the truth at the inquest. Her mother then presented her with another document, which she asked her to sign. At that point Loretta asked her mother to leave, which she eventually did. 
     
      
    14 Subsequently, both Loretta and her sister Romina made statements to the police. Loretta’s statement related to the signing of the purported will, Romina’s to the circumstances of her grandfather’s death. In early February, shortly before the inquest was due to commence, the offender went to Queensland. She was arrested there on 8 February 2007 and brought back to New South Wales. She has been in custody ever since. 
     
      
    15 By far the more serious of the two offences committed by the offender is the forgery of her father’s will. For that offence a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment is stipulated. The offence of doing an act with the intention of persuading someone to give false evidence carries a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. The offence of forgery is aggravated in this case by the fact that it was part of a planned criminal activity and that it was committed entirely for financial gain. The attempt to persuade Loretta to give false evidence at the inquest was also aggravated by being part of a planned criminal activity. 
     
      
    16 It is relevant here to mention the financial consequences to the offender of the forgery of her father’s will. The last genuine will written by Mr Beltrame was in October 2000. In that will, Mr Beltrame left his son John the sum of $30,000 and the remainder of his estate to the offender. Accordingly, the amount in fact gained by the offender as a result of this forgery was $30,000, hardly a huge amount of money. The house at Canley Heights constituted virtually the only asset in the estate. This had been sold and the proceeds spent by the offender before the offence came to light. 
     
      
    17 The offence of “persuasion” to give false evidence is a lesser offence in the eyes of the law, but is still a serious offence, involving the attempted subversion of the course of justice. The offender’s daughter, Loretta, suffered significant emotional distress after reading the letter handed to her by her mother. I do not want to belittle the extent of her distress when I say that no other harm was done to any other person as a result of this offence. Loretta, to her credit, proceeded to give evidence against her mother – no easy feat – which directly led to the offender pleading guilty to the more serious forgery charge. 
     
      
    18 Mitigating factors on sentence are that the offender has no record of previous convictions and therefore comes before the court as a person of good character. She is now 55 years old, and at this stage it must be assumed that she will be unlikely to re-offend. A significant mitigating factor in relation to the forgery offence arises from her plea of guilty. It was a relatively late plea, and considerable evidence relevant to this charge was in any event given during the offender’s murder trial. Nevertheless, she must be given some discount for the utility value of her plea. In the circumstances I propose to deduct 10% from the sentence I would otherwise have imposed for this offence. 
     
      
    19 Psychiatric reports were tendered on sentence from Dr Westmore, on behalf of the Crown, and Dr Nielssen on behalf of the offender. Dr Westmore examined the offender in July 2008. He also had access to Dr Nielssen’s report of August 2007 relating to the offender. Dr Westmore’s “provisional diagnosis” was that the offender had suffered episodes of depression in the past. He had not obtained sufficient history to enable him to diagnose a bi-polar affective disorder, but said that she was not suffering from that condition at the time he saw her. She had an adjustment disorder with symptoms of depression and anxiety. As to the offender’s personality profile, Dr Westmore considered that feelings of insecurity and probably low levels of self esteem were likely to be features of her general characteristics. 
     
      
    20 Dr Nielssen’s report, dated 24 March 2009, followed interviews with the offender in June 2007 and again in June 2008. Dr Nielssen considered that the offender suffered from both bi-polar mood disorder and from a personality disorder. The offender had been taking anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medication whilst in custody. Dr Nielssen concluded that what he described as her “abnormal personality style”, which remained evident after this treatment, was due to “enduring abnormal personality traits”. Dr Nielssen also made the following observation: 
     
      
       
        
        “A sense of entitlement and loss of a capacity for empathy with the needs of her children arising from the manic phase of a bi-polar disorder in a person with an underlying personality disorder is likely to have been a factor contributing to Ms Beltrame’s actions in forging her father’s will.” 
        
       
       
      A little later he said: 
       
       
        
        “Her written communications with her daughter around the time of the coronial inquiry also show signs of having been in a manic state. Hence her judgment and capacity to appreciate the consequences of her actions at that time may have been affected by the presence of an untreated bi-polar disorder.” 
        
       
      
    21 I should emphasise here that the offender through her counsel is not relying upon Dr Nielssen’s diagnosis or comments as mitigating factors on sentence. Rather, they provide some explanation for conduct which would otherwise appear inexplicable, particularly as they were committed by a person of prior good character. 
     
      
    22 The offender has expressed no remorse for these offences. I suspect that she still does not appreciate the extent of her moral culpability, particularly in relation to the forgery offence. 
     
      
    23 Taking all these matters into consideration, I would place both offences slightly, but not significantly, below the mid-line of objective seriousness. 
     
      
    24 As to the general purposes of sentencing, I consider that personal deterrence and the protection of the community can probably be put to one side. General deterrence remains a significant factor, particularly in relation to the forgery offence, as is the denunciation of the offender’s conduct. 
     
      
    25 The two offences are connected, in that the second offence was committed in an endeavour to escape apprehension for the first offence. However, it was committed many years later and it is of an entirely different nature. Accordingly, both counsel agree that the sentences for the two offences should be partially concurrent and partially cumulative. 
     
      
    26 Dr Nielssen recommended that the offender should continue treatment with mood stabilising medication under the supervision of a psychiatrist after her release from custody. In my view she will benefit significantly from a longer term of supervision than would normally attend the sentences I am about to impose. For this reason I consider that special circumstances exist which justify a departure from the statutory nexus between the non-parole period and the total sentence. 
     
      
    27 In order to achieve the appropriate level of accumulation of sentence, I propose to impose a fixed term in relation to the “persuasion” to give false evidence charge. I will then partially accumulate the sentence for the forgery charge. I believe that the final sentences reflect the overall criminality involved in these offences, having regard to all the relevant factors. 
     
      
    28 Daniela Beltrame, for the offence of doing an act with intent to persuade Loretta Appleyard to give false evidence, I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of one year, commencing on 8 February 2007 and expiring on 7 February 2008. 
     
      
    29 For the offence of forgery, I sentence you to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of two years and four months, commencing on 8 August 2007 and expiring on 7 December 2009, with an additional term of two years and two months, expiring on 7 February 2012. 
     
      
    30 The total sentence for the two offences will therefore be five years, with a non-parole period of two years and ten months. The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 7 December 2009.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: In this matter I agree that the sentence should be reduced. For the reasons given by Hall J I am satisfied that the starting point for the sentence adopted by the sentencing judge was excessive. However, it is important to appreciate that the evidence disclosed a series of offences committed by the applicant. The investigating police lawfully intercepted her phone calls and found that she was using five mobile phones. During the period 10 May 2007 to 24 July 2007, when the applicant was arrested, some 4,000 telephone calls were intercepted. This is indicative of her significant involvement in the drug trade.  
     
      
    2 In Van Can HA v R [2008] NSWCCA 141 this Court considered the circumstances of an offender who was convicted of a number of supplying drug offences. Hulme J with the agreement of Grove and Simpson JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""While the applicant fell to be sentenced for only the offences charged it was relevant for his Honour to consider whether they were isolated events, for perhaps casual profit or serious premeditated business-like criminality. Although such further attributes render the applicant liable to greater punishment as demonstrating greater criminality, they do not constitute some other offence … "" 
        
       
      
    3 Hulme J's remarks are apt to the present case.  
     
      
    4 The offender in Braithwaite v R [2005] NSWCCA 451 was sentenced for two offences in circumstances where a finding of ""planned criminal activity"" was made. In this case it would be appropriate to describe the applicant's criminality in the words of Hulme J in Van Can HA as ""premeditated business-like criminality"" and of a higher order than the criminality in Braithwaite. However, even after giving consideration to that aspect of the matter I agree that the sentence should be reduced.  
     
      
    5 I agree with the orders proposed by Harrison J. 
     
      
    6 HALL J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal in respect of sentences imposed upon her by the Gosford District Court on 11 June 2008. 
     
      
    7 On 18 September 2008, the applicant applied for leave to appeal and in the Grounds of Appeal contended that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. Two grounds were set out as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""1. His Honour's starting point was too high. 
         
         
        2. His Honour failed to give adequate recognition to the applicant's subjective case."" 
        
       
      
    8 The applicant was charged on indictment dated 6 February 2008 in respect of the following offences: 
     
      
       
        
        ""1. On 7 June 2007 at Chullora in the State of New South Wales did supply a prohibited drug, namely, 5.96 g of 3,4-Methylenedioxymethylamphetamine. 
         
         
        2. On 5 July 2007 at Greenacre in the State of New South Wales did supply a prohibited drug, namely, 2.88 g of 3,4-Methylenedioxymethylamphetamine. 
         
         
        3. On 5 July 2007 at Greenacre in the State of New South Wales did offer to supply a prohibited drug, namely, 3.5 g of Methylamphetamine. 
         
         
        4. On 21 June 2007 at Marrickville in the State of New South Wales did knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug, namely, 454 g cannabis leaf."" 
        
       
      
    9 There were three matters on a Form 1, particulars of which are discussed below (par [35]). 
     
      
    10 The applicant is 36 years of age and on 6 November 2007 she entered a guilty plea to each of the charges in Counts 1 to 4. 
     
      
    11 At the sentencing hearing, a statement of facts was admitted into evidence (Exhibit A) together with the following documents: 
     
      
      1. Transcript of telecommunications intercepts (Exhibit B). 
       
       
      2. Analysts' certificates dated 15 June 2007, 22 June 2007, 10 July 2007 and 27 July 2007 (Exhibits C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 respectively). 
       
       
      3. Extract from criminal history (Exhibit D). 
       
       
      4. Pre-sentence report dated 25 January 2008 (Exhibit E). 
       
       
      5. Psychologist's report (Katie Seidler) dated 29 February 2008 (Exhibit 1A). 
       
       
      6. Psychologist's report (Katie Seidler) dated 4 March 2008 (Exhibit 1B). 
       
       
      7. Employer's reference (Exhibit 2). 
       
       
      8. Reference dated 29 February 2008 (Exhibit 3). 
       
      
    12 At the hearing on 8 May 2008, evidence was given by Senior Constable Richard Howe in relation to the question of assistance and the applicant also gave evidence. There was no cross-examination of her by the Crown. 
     
      
    Remarks on sentence 
     
      
    13 The applicant was sentenced to an overall non-parole period of 3 years and a balance of term of 2 years, the overall sentence therefore being one of 5 years. 
     
      
    14 The remarks on sentence set out the relevant facts and the sentencing judge considered a number of matters relevant to both the objective and the subjective circumstances of the case. 
     
      
    15 The sentencing judge determined that the applicant was entitled to a 25 per cent discount in respect of an early plea and a further discount of 25 per cent in respect of assistance, making a total discount on sentence of 50 per cent. 
     
      
    16 The sentencing judge determined, pursuant to s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 that the offences were part of an organised and planned criminal activity. The mitigating factors determined in the applicant's favour were, taken as a whole, substantial. They were: 
     
      
      1. That the applicant did not have a significant record of previous convictions. 
       
       
      2. That she was regarded as a woman of good character. 
       
       
      3. That she was unlikely to re-offend. 
       
       
      4. That she had good prospects for rehabilitation. 
       
       
      5. That she was remorseful for her conduct. 
       
       
      6. That she had pleaded guilty to the offences. 
       
       
      7. That she had given valuable assistance to law enforcement agencies. 
       
      
    17 In the course of the remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge recorded in par 10 that whilst the applicant did not have an entirely unblemished character, the only offence against her name was ""… a minor offence and pales into insignificance when compared with the subject offences. I disregard this offence in the determination of an appropriate sentence for each of the offence [sic] to which she has pleaded guilty and I regard her as a woman of good character …"". 
     
      
    18 The sentencing judge also observed: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is difficult to understand why it was that she became involved in the commission of the subject offences. I suppose that her previous use of prohibited drugs and her need for extra money to support her use of those drugs was the motiving factor."" 
        
       
      
    19 In the pre-sentence report there is a history that the applicant was one of two daughters born in Darwin. Her mother was an alcoholic and was physically abusive. As at 25 January 2008 (the date of the pre-sentence report), she had three children aged 11, 14 and 17. 
     
      
    20 The applicant had left school at age 17 and thereafter held a number of unskilled positions. 
     
      
    21 In the pre-sentence report it is recorded that the applicant reported nine years of chronic daily cannabis use commencing at 26 years of age. In addition, between the age of 27 and 28, she used ecstasy on weekends. In the three months leading up to her arrest, the applicant was also using methamphetamine on a daily basis. The pre-sentence report records (at p 2): 
     
      
       
        
        ""… It appears she opportunistically became involved in supplying drugs mostly for financial benefit, and then found she was under pressure to continue and feared for her life if she was to stop …""  
        
       
      
    22 A similar history is to be found in the report of Ms Seidler dated 29 February 2008 (p 6). In par 30 of that report, the applicant reported: 
     
      
       
        
        ""… that she was exposed to crystal methamphetamine use in 2007 through her current boyfriend and the person she was living with at the time. As a function of this negative influence, (she) also began using crystal methamphetamine and she described smoking this drug several times each day for a four month period up until her arrest and incarceration for the present offences. (She) acknowledged being somewhat scattered and delusional cognitively as a result of heavy crystal methamphetamine use and she stated that she has been abstinent of this drug since July 2007."" 
        
       
      
    23 Ms Seidler further reports in her report (par 32): 
     
      
       
        
        ""[She] reported that her use of illicit drugs was prompted by negative peer influence, such that drug use was normalised within her lift style and peer network. She had limited insight in to the psychological aspects of her drug use … [She] stated she was able to develop abstinence of illicit drugs independently and she has reported maintained this abstinence since July 2007 without any professional intervention."" 
        
       
      
    24 In par 35 of the report, Ms Seidler recorded: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[She] stated that she became involved in the supply of illicit drugs for financial reasons, given her personal difficulties and drug use. However, she found herself becoming increasingly involved in an antisocial network that she could then not extricate herself from, such that her continued offending was, in part, motivated by pressure from others."" 
        
       
      
    25 The applicant was not challenged on the above histories and, indeed, there was no cross-examination of her by the Crown. 
     
      
    26 The sentencing judge's finding that the applicant had, for some time, been involved in the activity of supplying drugs and that her offences were part of a planned or organised criminal activity were well supported by the evidence. However, given the unchallenged history recorded in the abovementioned reports, the sentencing judge's observation to which I have referred in par [18] above, should, in my opinion, be taken as a finding that her previous use of prohibited drugs and her need for extra money to support her use of those drugs were the motivating factors. In addition, her account that she had been under the negative influence of others in relation to her activities in trafficking in drugs (including her then boyfriend) were not, as I have earlier stated, challenged in any way. That is an additional factor to be taken into account. 
     
      
    27 The fact that the applicant's activities were undertaken to support her drug habit is not, of course, a mitigating circumstance. It does, however, provide a factual explanation for having become involved in them and as such is to be taken into account in assessing the overall objective criminality of the offences. 
     
      
    28 The sentencing judge set out in his remarks on sentence (p.29) the details concerning the prohibited drugs involved in each of the offences and the quantities of drugs. However, he did not address the quantities of drugs as having any particular relevance or weight in evaluating the objective seriousness of the offences. There is no doubt that the offences were serious but the amounts or quantities of drugs are to be taken into account in a proper assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences. I will return to this aspect below. 
     
      
    29 At the sentencing hearing, counsel for the applicant drew the Court's attention to the judgment of this Court in Braithwaite v R [2005] NSWCCA 451. However, his Honour's reasons did not indicate that he gave any particular attention to the quantities of drugs involved in the offences. The decision of this Court in Braithwaite (supra), however, does provide some general guidance against which the criminality in the present case may usefully be assessed. 
     
      
    30 In Braithwaite (supra), the offender was only 21 years of age and he had entered a plea of guilty to two offences. The first charged him with the supply of a prohibited drug (in fact, methylamphetamine, not amphetamine, as stated in the indictment). The amount of drugs was 20.89 grams which was four times the indictable quantity under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (5 grams). 
     
      
    31 The second charge related to the supply of MDMA or ecstasy in tablet form. The total weight involved in the supply was 17.78 grams. The indictable quantity specified in Schedule 1 for that drug was 1.25 grams. Accordingly, the quantity of MDMA supplied was 14 times the indictable quantity. 
     
      
    32 In the course of his judgment in Braithwaite (supra), Hodgson JA observed, McClellan CJ at CL and myself agreeing: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[23] In my opinion also, there was no error in the sentencing judge's comments about the purity and quantity of the drugs.  
        It was relevant that the quantity of methylamphetamine was about four times the indictable quantity, and that the quantity of MDMA was about fourteen times the indictable quantity. 
         Quantity alone does not determine the seriousness of an offence, but in respect of offences that are otherwise similar,  
        a greater quantity of drugs relative to the amount selected by the legislature as an indictable quantity can justify treating an offence as more serious. 
        "" (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    33 Notwithstanding the importance of the offender's age in Braithwaite (supra) (discussed below), it is, in my opinion, relevant to consider the much greater quantities involved in that case than those involved in the first three of the four offences with which the applicant was charged in the present case (it being noted that in Braithwaite and in the present case there were matters on a Form 1). I set out in the table below and in the paragraph that follows it the quantities of drugs involved respectively in Braithwaite and in the present case.

    34 In the present proceedings, the quantities of prohibited drugs supplied by the applicant were as follows: 
     
      
      1.  
      Count 1 
      : Supply MDMA (7 June 2007) – an undercover operative paid $500 for 20 MDMA (ecstasy) tablets (weight 5.96 grams). 
       
       
      2.  
      Counts 2 
      : Supply MDMA (5 July 2007) – an undercover operative paid $200 for 10 MDMA (ecstasy) tablets (weight 2.88 grams). 
       
       
      3.  
      Count 3 
      : Offer to supply methylamphetamine (5 July 2007) – the undercover operative and the applicant discussed and agreed on the supply of 3.5 grams of methylamphetamine, however, the actual supply did not occur. 
       
       
      4.  
      Count 4 
      : Knowingly take part in supply of cannabis (21 June 2007) – McGlashan (a co-offender) was supplied cannabis by the applicant and another co-offender, Najjarin (weight 454 grams of cannabis leaf). 
       
      
    35 The particulars of quantities of prohibited drugs in relation to the Form 1 matters are as follows: 
     
      
      1. Supply MDMA on 31 May 2007 – an undercover operative attended the address of the applicant and paid $200 for eight MDMA (ecstasy) tablets (weight 1.41 grams). 
       
       
      2. Supply methylamphetamine on 7 June 2007 – an undercover operative paid $150 for methylamphetamine (0.19 grams). 
       
       
      3. Supply MDMA on 14 June 2007 – an undercover operative paid $250 for 10 MDMA (ecstasy) tablets (weight 1.75 grams). 
       
      
    36 It is, of course, necessary for the Form 1 matters to be taken into account in accordance with relevant principle: Attorney-General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No 1) of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146, paragraphs [40] to [42] per Spigelman CJ. 
     
      
    37 In Braithwaite (supra), the offence in respect of the supply of methylamphetamine being 20.89 grams (as noted above, being four times the indictable quantity) was considerably greater than the supply of methylamphetamine, the subject of Count 3 in the present case (namely, 3.5 grams). I note that the total of the methylamphetamine in the present case in respect of the Form 1 matters was 6.85 grams. 
     
      
    38 Similarly, in Braithwaite (supra), the total weight of the MDMA, as noted above, was 17.78 grams in contrast to the present case in which Count 1 involved 5.96 grams of MDMA and Count 2 involved 2.88 grams of MDMA totalling 8.84 grams of MDMA. The additional matters in this case on the Form 1 in respect of MDMA was 3.16 grams. 
     
      
    39 Accordingly, the quantities of the prohibited substances in Braithwaite (supra) were considerably higher and of a different order to those involved in Counts 1, 2 and 3 in the present application. 
     
      
    40 In Braithwaite (supra), this Court held that allowance ought to have been made for the applicant's age and immaturity. However, other subjective aspects of Braithwaite are similar to those in the present case. In the former, the following circumstances were noted: 
     
      
      1. The limited duration of the applicant's criminal behaviour. 
       
       
      2. The early plea of guilty. 
       
       
      3. The great strides he had made towards rehabilitation. 
       
       
      4. That the applicant had previously led a crime-free life. 
       
       
      5. A degree of planning that accompanied the offences and it was found by the sentencing judge to have been an aggravating factor. 
       
       
      6. The applicant's previous good character. 
       
       
      7. The fact that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend and had good prospects of rehabilitation. 
       
      
    41 On the appeal in Braithwaite (supra), this Court determined that the appeal against severity of sentence should be upheld and the applicant be sentenced to a non-parole period of 6 months and an additional term of 12 months on Count 1 and a non-parole period of 8 months with an additional term of 16 months in respect of Count 2. 
     
      
    42 Accordingly, on appeal the effective sentence imposed on the applicant in Braithwaite was a non-parole period of 8 months with a total term of 2 years. This contrasts with the aggregate sentence in the present case of an overall period of 3 years and a non-parole period of 2 years, an overall sentence of 5 years. 
     
      
    43 The mitigating factors in the present case (other than age) as set out in paragraph [16] above are similar to those in Braithwaite (supra): paragraph [32]. In the present case, the subjective factors, including the applicant's severely deprived upbringing, offset, at least to an extent, the age factor in Braithwaite. However, notwithstanding the much greater quantities of drugs in Braithwaite, the offender there received sentences less than 50 per cent of those imposed on the applicant. 
     
      
    44 In the present proceedings, due regard must, of course, be given to the finding made, supported by the evidence, that the number of intercepted telephone conversations on telephone services used by the applicant was relevant as indicating the extent of the applicant's involvement in the supply of prohibited drugs. That said, the sentences to be imposed in this case were, of course, sentences to be determined in respect of the particular offences charged only and not other unknown or unspecified matters apart from those the subject of Counts 1, 2 and 3 and the matters listed on the Form 1. 
     
      
    45 On the sentencing judge's findings, the mitigating factors to which I have referred reveal a powerful subjective case. 
     
      
    46 The sentences imposed in the present case are not, of course, to be measured or determined by reference to sentences in other cases but decisions of this Court, such as Braithwaite (supra), are relevant in determining the appropriate range for the offences for which the applicant was sentenced.  
     
      
    47 I am of the opinion, particularly having regard to the quantities of drugs supplied, that the sentencing judge's starting points for the determination of each offence as recorded in paragraph 47 of the remarks on sentence were too high. That is particularly so in respect of the supply on 7 June 2007 of MDMA, the starting point for which was expressed to be 5 years and in respect of the supply of MDMA on 5 July 2007, the starting point of for which was 3 years and 6 months. I accept as valid the submission made on behalf of the applicant that the effect of such high starting points was to significantly erode the discount of 50 per cent to which the applicant was held to be entitled. 
     
      
    48 Taking into account the objective and subjective factors to which I have referred, I have concluded that the effective aggregate non-parole period of 3 years with a parole period of 2 years was excessive. I have read the judgment of Harrison J and I agree with the sentences proposed by his Honour. 
     
      
    49 Accordingly, in accordance with the sentences to be imposed, the applicant is to be sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 8 June 2008 and to expire on 7 June 2010 with a balance of sentence of 2 years to expire on 7 June 2012. 
     
      
    50 Accordingly, the earliest date upon which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole will be 7 June 2010. 
     
      
    51 HARRISON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentences imposed by his Honour Nield DCJ on 11 June 2008. The applicant had pleaded guilty in the District Court at Gosford to four counts as follows:  
     
      
      Count 1 
      : Supplying a prohibited drug, namely MDMA, on or about 7 June 2007 contrary to the provisions of s 25(1) of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act  
      1985.  
      The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 15 years and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units. 
       
       
      Count 2 
      : Supplying a prohibited drug, namely MDMA, on or about 5 July 2007 contrary to the provisions of s 25(1) of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act  
      1985.  
      The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 15 years and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units. 
       
       
      Count 3 
      : Offering to supply a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, on or about 5 July 2007 contrary to the provisions of s 25(1) of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act  
      1985.  
      The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 15 years and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units. 
       
       
      Count 4 
      : Knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug, namely cannabis leaf, on or about 21 June 2007 contrary to the provisions of s 25(1) of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act  
      1985.  
      The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 10 years and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units. 
       
      
    52 The applicant asked for three additional offences of supplying MDMA to be taken into account on a Form 1. 
     
      
    53 The applicant was sentenced as follows:  
     
      
      On Count 4 
      : To imprisonment for 1 year with a non-parole period of 8 months from 8 June 2008 to 7 February 2009 with a balance of term of 4 months from 8 February 2009 to 7 June 2009. 
       
       
      On Count 
        
      2 
      : To imprisonment for 1 year and 9 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 1 month from 8 December 2008 to 7 January 2010 with a balance of term of 8 months from 8 January 2010 to 7 September 2010. 
       
       
      On Count 3 
      : To imprisonment for 1 year and 9 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 1 month from 8 November 2009 to 7 December 2010 with a balance of term of 8 months from 8 December 2010 to 7 August 2011. 
       
       
      On Count 1 
      : To imprisonment for 2 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 6 months from 8 December 2010 to 7 June 2011 with a balance of term of 2 years from 8 June 2011 to 7 June 2013. In sentencing the applicant for this offence his Honour took into account the three additional offences on the Form 1. 
       
      
    54 The aggregate sentence imposed was an overall non-parole period of three years and a parole period of two years constituting an overall sentence of five years. 
     
      
    Background 
     
      
    55 The facts were not the subject of dispute before his Honour. The applicant was the subject of a controlled operation involving the use of listening device and telecommunication interception warrants. The applicant had five mobile telephone services registered in her name. From 10 May 2007, when the police were first authorised to intercept telephone calls on these phones, until the applicant was arrested on 24 July 2007, there were more than 4000 calls recorded. The conversations revealed that the applicant was actively and extensively involved in the supply of prohibited drugs. Transcripts of some of these conversations were in evidence before his Honour. 
     
      
    56 The Crown contended before his Honour that although the applicant had been charged with having committed seven offences they were not isolated offences but were rather seven offences in a large number of other offences that demonstrated that the applicant was trafficking in prohibited drugs to a substantial degree. That contention was not the subject of dispute before his Honour. The applicant admitted to supplying prohibited drugs often and regularly between September 2006 and July 2007. His Honour found that the applicant's activities were committed as part of an organised and planned criminal enterprise. 
     
      
    Grounds of appeal 
     
      
    57 The applicant sought leave to appeal to this Court upon the single ground that the sentences imposed by his Honour were manifestly excessive. In particular the applicant contended that his Honour's starting point for the sentences was too high and that he failed to give adequate recognition to the applicant's subjective case. It is convenient to deal first with those subjective factors. 
     
      
    The applicant's subjective case 
     
      
    58 The applicant was 36 years of age at the time of sentence. She had had a difficult upbringing in that she had been physically and emotionally abused by her alcoholic mother and sexually abused by various males. She managed to obtain her School Certificate. His Honour dealt with the applicant as a woman of good character and properly disregarded an irrelevant minor criminal history. He considered that her expressions of remorse were genuine and that she had taken positive steps towards rehabilitation. His Honour expressed the view that ""there is a reasonable chance that the [applicant] will not re-offend"". 
     
      
    59 The applicant had been born in Darwin and is the elder of her parents' two children. Her parents are still alive but have separated. Her sister is alive. The applicant was cared for by her parents until their separation when she was aged about three and thereafter by her mother and her new partner until their separation. The applicant is of Aboriginal descent. 
     
      
    60 His Honour described the applicant's upbringing as unstable, dysfunctional and less than happy. Her mother would appear clearly to have been an alcoholic and was unable to care properly for her children. His Honour was in no doubt that the applicant's upbringing had shaped the way that she has lived her life. 
     
      
    61 The applicant enjoyed school and did well. After leaving school she gained unskilled employment in which type of work she has worked from time to time. Although physically well, the applicant suffers from depression for which she is being treated. The applicant has three children of her own who are aged 18, 15 and 11 years. Her two elder children live with her family and her youngest child lives with her former boyfriend who is the child's father. 
     
      
    62 His Honour expressed the opinion that it was difficult to understand why the applicant became involved in the commission of these offences. He surmised that it might have been as the result of a need for extra money to support her use of drugs. 
     
      
    Aspects of the sentences 
     
      
    63 His Honour accepted that the applicant pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity and discounted the sentences accordingly by 25 per cent. On 8 May 2008 the applicant signed an undertaking to give evidence for the Crown at the trial of a co-offender. His Honour therefore considered that the applicant was entitled to a further discount of 25 per cent. Although the evidence was silent on the question of whether or not the applicant would be classified as a prisoner on protection as the result of her undertaking, his Honour accepted that it was likely that she would be so classified for her own safety ""because it is well known that prison inmates do not take kindly to another inmate who has given evidence against a co-offender or other offender and that being on protection will make prison life more harsh or onerous than it should be"". His Honour expressly took that factor into account in the applicant's favour. 
     
      
    64 His Honour specifically referred to the question of special circumstances. In this respect he took into account the applicant's previous good character, her prospects for rehabilitation and the likelihood of re-offending. The ratio of the aggregate non-parole period and the head sentence is 60 per cent. This was clearly generous but significantly was not the subject of complaint by the Crown in this Court. 
     
      
    65 The applicant contended that whereas his Honour accurately chronologued the favourable subjective aspects of the applicant's case in his remarks on sentence, the ultimate result does not give proper or adequate effect to these factors in the final result. In the applicant's submission, favourable findings about the applicant's criminal history, her low likelihood of re-offending, her previous good character, her good prospects of rehabilitation, her remorse, her early plea and her offer to assist the authorities should have produced an overall sentence that was significantly more favourable to the applicant than the sentence that was imposed in fact. 
     
      
    66 Because of the way in which his Honour structured his remarks on sentence it is apparent that he adverted to all relevant matters that were favourable to the applicant. The essential burden of the applicant's submissions is therefore necessarily that the starting point from which his Honour reasoned, and to which he would appear otherwise to have applied generous and appropriate discounts, was too high in all of the circumstances. The matters that were favourable to the applicant were in effect cancelled or neutralised by the imposition of too severe a sentence in the first place. 
     
      
    67 The applicant reasoned that her sentences were excessive by reference to comparable decisions and statistics produced by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales. For all offenders dealt with in the District Court of New South Wales for the supply of MDMA for less than the commercial quantity full-time prison sentences were imposed in only 106 out of 402 cases. Of those that received prison sentences, only one percent received a sentence higher than the applicant. The applicant's non-parole period is beyond the range of the statistics. Statistics for the supply of MDMA for offenders with multiple counts for less than the commercial quantity reveal that full time prison sentences were imposed in only 18 out of 65 cases. Of those that received prison sentences, no one received a sentence as high as the applicant. The applicant's non-parole period is again beyond the range of the available statistics. In oral submissions it was emphasised on behalf of the applicant ""that the sentence is quite clearly and quite profoundly outside the range"". These submissions must be treated with some caution, however, having regard to the distinction between statistics dealing with single offences and those dealing with multiple offences, as in this case. 
     
      
    68 The Crown contended that the offences warranted the imposition of a substantial period of imprisonment by reason particularly of the repetitive nature of the offences. Further, whereas the applicant asked for further offences of supplying prohibited drugs to be taken in account, an additional penalty had to be imposed. Greater attention had to be given to the need for personal deterrence and society's entitlement to extract retribution for offences for which no punishment had been imposed: Attorney-General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (supra) at [40] – [42] per Spigelman CJ. 
     
      
    69 The Crown submitted that the statistics upon which the applicant relied did not show that the sentences imposed by his Honour were excessive or beyond a proper exercise of his Honour's sentencing discretion. In particular it was contended that it was not appropriate to compare sentences for single offences with the aggregate of sentences imposed by his Honour for four offences. The latter contention is undoubtedly correct. 
     
      
    70 To the extent that the applicant sought to draw upon sentences imposed in comparable cases, the Crown relied upon the remarks of Hunt CJ at CL in Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is quite wrong to compare the sentence under challenge directly with that imposed upon another offender (who is not a co-offender) simply because the two offenders may have similar characteristics and may have committed similar crimes. What must be looked at is whether the challenged sentence is within the  
        range 
         appropriate to the objective gravity of the particular offence and to the subjective circumstances of the particular offender, and not whether it is more severe or more lenient than some other sentence (other than that of a co-offender) which merely forms part of that range."" 
        
       
      
    71 The Crown emphasised that his Honour was required to impose a sentence that properly reflected the objective seriousness of the offences: see R v Hayes [2001] NSWCCA 358 at [51] per Sully J and R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594 and to fix sentences that would ensure that the time that the applicant must spend in prison reflected all of the circumstances of the offences including their objective seriousness and the need for general deterrence: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [65] per Spigelman CJ. 
     
      
    Consideration 
     
      
    72 There is in my view only one matter that would warrant the intervention of this Court. I consider that the original starting point of 10 years was certainly high, even harsh, but it is difficult to come to a conclusion that it was thereby infected with error. The individual sentences imposed by his Honour, including the sentence for Count 1 that factored in the offences on the Form 1, are clearly within a range of sentences for offences of this type and comparable seriousness. The degree of objective seriousness of all of the offences, particularly having regard to the level of planning and organisation that was involved, called for sentences for the individual offences charged of the order of those imposed by his Honour. 
     
      
    73 However, although not in terms argued in this fashion on behalf of the applicant, there is considerable scope for finding that the degree of accumulation of the individual sentences was in all of the circumstances of the case too great and the degree of concurrence correspondingly inadequate. There are compelling reasons why this appears to be so. 
     
      
    74 First, despite a reasonably long involvement with drug use, the applicant had never been arrested or convicted for any similar offences and indeed had no relevant criminal conviction of any kind. In this respect there is some doubt on the material available to this Court that the applicant was ever convicted of anything. A printout from the police criminal history section reveals only that the applicant was charged in August 2001 with aiding and abetting a disqualified driver but the document records that the charge was dismissed. His Honour does not specify what was the minor offence to which he refers, or whether it was that offence, but he does make it clear that it formed no part of his decision. In any event, it is evident that the applicant's incarceration on the present charges is her first time in custody. This is a quite remarkable fact in the circumstances of this case having regard to the applicant's significantly troubled past and deprived upbringing. It is a factor that ought to have been specifically dealt with and considered by his Honour as part of the sentencing exercise. 
     
      
    75 Secondly, the evidence reveals that the applicant had very good prospects for rehabilitation. As already noted, this was an aspect of the applicant's case to which his Honour specifically adverted. However, there is to my mind a certain tension between a formal recognition of such prospects on the one hand and the imposition of a significant prison sentence on a first offender on the other hand. In McDonald v R [1994] FCA 956; (1994) 71 A Crim R 370, in the context of a gaol sentence imposed in relation to fraud offences, Burchett and Higgins JJ observed at 379 ""[in] a case of this kind, a first incarceration may have a very salutary effect, and the prospect that it may do so should not be left out of account when its length is fixed"". Although the applicant's submissions in this Court did not in terms advert to the notion, it seems to me that there is a real danger that the sentences imposed by his Honour could have a potentially crushing effect upon the applicant and interfere substantially with the hopeful prospects that have been recognised. 
     
      
    76 The applicant sought to rely upon an affidavit she had sworn in the event that this Court was minded to re-sentence. It is appropriate to observe that the material to which the applicant deposes is redolent of the prospects for rehabilitation that his Honour recognised. Part of that affidavit is as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        ""5. I have worked in the kitchen since moving to Berrima. I started as a kitchen assistant and now work as the head chef. This involves training inmates, doing daily meals, storage control and other daily duties. 
         
         
        6. While at Berrima I have completed two training courses: Hospitality Operating Skills and Workplace Safety Procedures and gained employment. The certificates of attainment for each of these courses are attached. 
         
         
        7. During this sentence I have not incurred any disciplinary charges and I have not used drugs. I keep to myself and am known to be quiet and a hard worker. 
         
         
        8. When I am released I will live with my father in Bowral and help him run his small business. At a later stage I would like to move to the Gold Coast to be near my sister and far away from adverse influences. My goal is to work and also to do some volunteer work within the community. 
         
         
        9. Being in Berrima has been good for me. It has helped me to be a better person and not reoffend."" 
        
       
      
    Conclusion 
     
      
    77 In my opinion his Honour's choice of each of the separate terms of imprisonment should remain unaltered but the sentences should be ordered to commence upon dates that to an extent increase their concurrence and reduce the aggregate effective non-parole period. I consider that an effective non-parole period of 2 years is appropriate, arrived at in the following way:  
     
      
      On Count 4 
      : To imprisonment for 1 year with a non-parole period of 8 months from 8 June 2008 to 7 February 2009 with a balance of term of 4 months from 8 February 2009 to 7 June 2009. 
       
       
      On Count 
        
      2 
      : To imprisonment for 1 year and 9 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 1 month from 8 December 2008 to 7 January 2010 with a balance of term of 8 months from 8 January 2010 to 7 September 2010. 
       
       
      On Count 3 
      : To imprisonment for 1 year and 9 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 1 month from 8 March 2009 to 7 April 2010 with a balance of term of 8 months from 8 April 2010 to 7 December 2010. 
       
       
      On Count 1 
      : To imprisonment for 2 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 6 months from 8 December 2009 to 7 June 2010 with a balance of term of 2 years from 8 June 2010 to 7 June 2012.  
       
      
    78 The effect of sentences formulated in this way would accordingly be an overall effective sentence of 4 years from 8 June 2008 until 7 June 2012 with a non-parole period of 2 years from 8 June 2008 until 7 June 2010 and a balance of term of 2 years from 8 June 2010 until 7 June 2012. In my view his Honour erroneously accumulated the sentences and a lesser sentence is warranted in law. I consider that the applicant should be re-sentenced in accordance with the regime I have proposed. Accordingly I would make the following orders:  
     
      
      1. Grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. 
       
       
      2. Quash the sentences imposed upon the applicant by Nield DCJ on 11 June 2008. 
       
       
      3. In lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced to the following terms of imprisonment:  
       
        
         
        (a)  
        On Count 4 
        : To imprisonment for 1 year with a non-parole period of 8 months from 8 June 2008 to 7 February 2009 with a balance of term of 4 months from 8 February 2009 to 7 June 2009. 
         
          
         
         
        (b) 
         On Count 
          
        2 
        : To imprisonment for 1 year and 9 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 1 month from 8 December 2008 to 7 January 2010 with a balance of term of 8 months from 8 January 2010 to 7 September 2010. 
         
          
         
         
        (c)  
        On Count 3 
        : To imprisonment for 1 year and 9 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 1 month from 8 March 2009 to 7 April 2010 with a balance of term of 8 months from 8 April 2010 to 7 December 2010. 
         
          
         
         
        (d)  
        On Count 1 
        : To imprisonment for 2 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 6 months from 8 December 2009 to 7 June 2010 with a balance of term of 2 years from 8 June 2010 to 7 June 2012. The sentence for this offence takes into account the three additional offences on the Form 1.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was arraigned on an indictment containing two counts as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “That he between about 23 February 2007 and about 22 April 2007 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did import a substance, the substance being a border controlled drug namely 3,4 methylenedioxmethylamphetamine (MDMA) and the quantity imported being a commercial quantity.” 
        
       
      
    2 In the alternative it was pleaded that: 
     
      
       
        
        “He between about 23 February 2007 and about 22 April 2007 at Sydney in the state of New South Wales, did attempt to possess a substance, being a substance that is reasonably suspected of having been unlawfully imported, the substance being a border controlled drug namely 3,4 methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA) and the quantity attempted to be possessed being a commercial quantity.” 
        
       
      
    3 The appellant pleaded not guilty. The jury returned a guilty verdict in relation to the first count. The appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for 21 years with a non-parole period of 13 years.  
     
      
    4 There is one ground of appeal being that the trial judge erred in failing to correctly direct the jury in relation to the mental element of the offence. 
     
      
    5 The charge in respect of which the appellant was convicted is provided by s 307.1 of the Criminal Code (Cth). That section is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A person commits an offence if: 
         
         (a) the person imports or exports a substance; and 
         
          
          (b) the substance is a border controlled drug or border controlled plant; and 
           
          (c) the quantity imported or exported is a commercial quantity. 
          
         
        (2) The fault element for paragraph (1)(b) is recklessness. 
         
        (3) Absolute liability applies to paragraph (1)(c).” 
        
       
      
    6 As I relate below the complexities of the manner of drafting of the offence occasioned difficulty when the trial judge gave directions to the jury. However, in resolving the challenge now made to his Honour’s directions it is necessary to appreciate that the issues at the trial were confined. In essence there was only one issue, being whether the appellant knew that the hot water systems he was importing had MDMA secreted inside some of them. The appellant’s counsel accepted that it was the issue of the appellant’s alleged knowledge which the jury was required to resolve. 
     
      
    7 The Crown case was that the appellant imported into Australia over 90 kilograms of MDMA inside a number of solar hot water tanks. On 11 February 2007 the appellant was in Israel where he collected, amongst other items six hot water storage tanks. The invoice for the tanks was issued to Sunways Solar (Aust) Pty Ltd located at 995 Waterfall Way, Bellingen in New South Wales. Sunways Solar (Aust) Pty Limited was a business operated by the appellant in partnership with Mr Eric Fuller. 
     
      
    8 After collecting the goods they were loaded into a truck which had been rented by the appellant and taken to his unit in Netanya where they were left overnight. The following day he took the water tanks to the port of Haifa in Israel where they were loaded into a shipping container. The container was sealed and placed on a ship for shipping to Sydney. 
     
      
    9 The consignee of the container was recorded on the Bill of Lading as Sunways Solar (Aust) Pty Ltd. The container was originally loaded aboard the “William Mitchell” and was subsequently transferred to the “Wana Bhum” and transported to Sydney. It arrived at Port Botany on about 29 March 2007. 
     
      
    10 On 30 March 2007 the appellant sent an email using the address “Sunways heating [sunways@walla.com]” to John Iskander of Evolve International using the address john.iskander@evolveinternational.com.au attaching the arrival note for the container. The purpose of this email was to arrange for Mr Iskander to act as the freight forwarding agent in having the container cleared through Customs. In the email he advised Mr Iskander that he would be in Sydney by 15 April 2007 and that “I must get this container aut [sic] from the port asap just to save on storage costs.” The email was signed “Ben.” 
     
      
    11 On the same day the appellant corresponded with Mr Iskander in relation to the documentation required to have the container cleared. 
     
      
    12 On 31 March 2007 officers of the Customs Service x-rayed the container. It was identified as requiring further examination. Accordingly the seal, which was confirmed as being intact, was broken and the contents of the container examined. When the top of a water storage tank was removed the officers found a number of cylindrical shaped canisters wrapped in brown adhesive tape. The canisters were found to contain MDMA. In all 172 canisters were removed from three water tanks. 
     
      
    13 On 2 April 2007 Mr Iskander’s company Evolve International Pty Ltd requested the Customs broker to clear the container from the wharf and store it at premises at Condell Park. The container was delayed in its release and Mr Iskander advised the appellant that he had been notified that the container had been held for x-ray and would be delayed in its clearance. After removing the containers containing MDMA Customs Officers substituted a similar number of packages consisting of tennis ball canisters filled with an inert powder. They were inserted into the tanks in the same manner as the original canisters. A listening and tracking device was installed in the tank. The container was subsequently collected and taken to the Condell Park premises where it was unpacked. 
     
      
    14 On 16 April 2007 the appellant arrived in Sydney from Bangkok. He telephoned Mr Iskander and arranged to meet him that afternoon. During the afternoon the appellant met Mr Iskander at his premises. They discussed the whereabouts of the goods and the appellant advised that he was in the process of looking for self-storage for the containers. Subsequently he advised Mr Iskander that the containers should be delivered to Storage King at Artarmon.  
     
      
    15 During the morning of 17 April 2007 the appellant was observed entering a Bunnings Warehouse in Artarmon where he purchased a screw driver and a spanner at a total cost of $1.50. Later that day he entered an agreement for the self-storage facility at Storage King. He was then told in a telephone call with Mr Iskander that the container was “on the way.” Within a short time a truck arrived and the appellant, assisted by the truck driver and an employee of Storage King unloaded four pallets. The appellant then commenced to unscrew the top of the water tanks, so the Crown alleged, for the purpose of accessing the canisters hidden inside. In his evidence the appellant accepted that noises recorded by the listening device which had been installed were consistent with him unscrewing certain of the hot water tanks and accessing the packages hidden inside the canisters.  
     
      
    16 A short time later the appellant left the storage premises and within minutes used a public telephone. The appellant gave evidence that the phone call was made to a person in Israel in order to arrange contact with a person by the name of Barlev Arik Cagan. The appellant arranged with Mr Cagan to meet the next morning in a park next to the Lane Cove Plaza. 
     
      
    17 On 18 April the appellant met with Mr Cagan at the prearranged location. They went to the boot of the appellant’s vehicle where the appellant was observed to hand Mr Cagan a white plastic bag which he agreed in evidence contained one of the packages he had taken from a hot water tank the previous day. Mr Cagan then left the area taking the white plastic bag with him. 
     
      
    18 He was later observed to return to the Lane Cove Council car park where he handed the appellant the white plastic bag and its cylindrical shaped contents. Mr Cagan and the appellant were observed to engage in conversation before they parted. 
     
      
    19 On 19 April 2007 the appellant was observed to walk from unit 23 of the Comfort Inn North Shore carrying two large black plastic suitcases and a white plastic bag. He placed the suitcases on the ground near a vehicle and then placed the white plastic bag in the passenger side of that vehicle. He put the suitcases in the boot. 
     
      
    20 A short time thereafter he was observed entering Bunnings Warehouse in Artarmon where he purchased spanners at a total cost of $1.00. Shortly thereafter he went to the Storage King premises and entered a storage unit. He placed the white plastic bag containing the cylindrical shaped canister in a cardboard box which was lying on the floor of the storage unit. He then secured and left the unit. 
     
      
    21 Later that day he travelled to Waterfall Way at Bellingen. 
     
      
    22 The appellant gave evidence at his trial. He denied that he had intentionally imported MDMA and denied any knowledge of the contents of the water tank. He said that he had opened the tank because the packaging appeared to have been tampered with. His case was that unbeknown to him somebody else had put 90 kgs of MDMA into the tanks that he was importing. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    23 The charge in respect of which the appellant was convicted is comprised of three physical elements. The first element relates to the importation of a substance for which the fault element is intention (s 5.6(1) and s 5.2 of the Code). The second element is that the substance is a border controlled drug for which the fault element is recklessness (s 307.1(2) and s 5.4 of the Code). Finally, the third element is that the quantity is a commercial quantity. For this element there is absolute liability. 
     
      
    24 The issue raised by the appellant was whether the jury were adequately directed in relation to the fault element for the first physical element. 
     
      
    25 As I have previously indicated it is important to appreciate the nature of the issues at the trial. The appellant gave evidence that he intended to import the water tanks but denied any knowledge of the drugs located within them. Accordingly, the only issue at the trial was whether he intended to import the drugs. This was the basis upon which the case was presented to the jury. The addresses of counsel focused on this issue. It was also emphasised by the trial judge that if the jury was satisfied that the appellant intended to import the drugs in the tanks it followed inevitably that they would be satisfied of the other elements of the offence. 
     
      
    26 Early in his summing up the trial judge directed the jury in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Those essential elements, if you look at the indictment, firstly refer to dates. They are essential elements. Secondly, to importing or did import a substance. Importing is an essential element of the offence. Secondly, the substance being a border controlled drug, and that has to be found as fact, that it is a substance being a border controlled drug MDMA or as commonly referred to, ecstasy. And the quantity being imported being a commercial quantity. All those essential elements have to be found by you to have been proved by the Crown beyond a reasonable doubt.” 
        
       
      
    27 In these remarks his Honour was referring to the physical elements of the offence. With respect to the first element his Honour had this to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “In considering the journey between Israel and Port Botany, the essential elements of the charge, both the primary and the alternative, but certainly in relation to primary charge first, you have to determine firstly whether or not the accused intended or meant to bring into Australia the border controlled drug MDMA or as commonly known as ecstasy. As I have previously stated, the evidence of the accused is that he did not intend to do anything other than bring into Australia these sample hot water solar system tanks, and he had no knowledge of any prohibited substance.” 
        
       
      
    28 The trial judge directed the jury on the meaning of intention and during the course of his summing up repeated on a number of occasions that the Crown had to prove intention.  
     
      
    29 With respect to the second element the trial judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is another essential element in the charge in considering the criminal liability of the accused as to the bringing into Australia of this substance which was in the hot water tank. The Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt not only intention, which is an essential element, but that the accused was reckless in bringing the substance into Australia. So there is the first the essential element did he intend to bring into Australia? Do the circumstances allow only for that explanation? And as I again stated to you and is also relevant in relation to this second question of recklessness.” 
        
       
      
    30 Later his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The second element is whether he was reckless. The Commonwealth legislation has brought in an Act which is called The Commonwealth Criminal Code Act. It defines what is meant by recklessness and it defines that a person is reckless if he or she is aware of a substantial risk that prohibited substance will come into Australia; and having regard to the circumstances known to him or her is unjustifiable to take that risk. That is what the Act says. 
        
       
       
        
        Members of the jury, to put it hopefully for your assistance in terms which you can readily understand the Crown has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that that accused was aware of a substantial risk that prohibited substance will be bought into Australia, and not withstanding that awareness, took that risk. It is for you to determine whether or not firstly he was aware of the substantial risk, and whether or not, if he was, he was unjustified to take the risk.” 
        
       
      
    31 And later his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown has put to you that when you look at the circumstances, the only logical explanation is that the accused intended, or meant the prohibited substance to come into Australia, and was aware of a real risk of [the] substance that there was a prohibited substance in the tank. It is for you to consider then whether he was unjustified in taking that risk. If you considered that he was aware, did intend and was aware, then that may not trouble you, but that is nevertheless a matter which you would also have to find. 
        
       
       
        
        The real issue as counsel have stated in their addresses to you comes down to those matters. That is intention and knowledge. If you found that either he did not intend, or if he did, was not aware of the real risk of substance that the border controlled drugs or prohibited substance would come into Australia, then the Crown would not have proved that charge, the primary charge against the accused.” 
        
       
      
    32 At the conclusion of the summing up trial counsel sought a redirection. The redirection which was sought was to address the possibility that the jury may have been confused as to what the appellant must have intended to import, either a water tank or the substance inside. 
     
      
    33 The following exchange occurred between defence counsel and his Honour in the presence of the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “McClintock: Your Honour again without – I just spoke to my friend. Your Honour in respect to that first element the importation, I would ask your Honour to direct that it’s the importation of a substance, just to avoid the confusion of the importation of hot water systems if I can put it that way. It has to be the importation of a substance that is intended. 
        
       
       
        
        His Honour: Yes, well I thought that was clear. 
        
       
       
        
        McClintock: It may have been. 
        
       
       
        
        His Honour: It is the importation of a substance that has to be intended. But the recklessness that is involved is an awareness of the substantial risk that the substance is a prohibited substance. Is that right Mr Crown? 
        
       
       
        
        Crown Prosecutor: Yes your Honour and your Honour was intending to do likewise for the alternative charge.” 
        
       
      
    34 No further direction was sought. It is plain that his Honour emphasised to the jury that it was the importation of a substance that has to be intended by the person who commits the offence. The further direction made plain that recklessness related to whether that substance was a prohibited substance. 
     
      
    35 The appellant submitted that the directions which the trial judge gave to the jury were confusing and ultimately incorrect. It was submitted that all that was required on the facts of the case was that the jury be instructed that the Crown must prove that: 
     
      
       
      1. The appellant intended to import the powdered substance contained in the canisters (as opposed to an intention to import the hot water systems themselves); 
       
       
      2. If he intended to import the substance, was he at least reckless as to whether it was a border controlled drug. This would be established if the Crown proved either that the appellant: 
       
       
       (a) knew it was a border controlled drug; or 
       
       
        
        (b) was aware of a substantial risk that the substance was a border controlled drug and having regard to the circumstances known to him it was unjustifiable to take that risk. 
        
       
      
    36 The appellant emphasised that there was in reality no issue as to (2) above. The case was fought on the basis that the appellant did not know of the existence of the powder. Accordingly, the reference to and focus upon the issue of recklessness was suggested to have diverted the jury so that they may have understood that recklessness was relevant to whether or not the appellant intended to import the powdered substance and was not confined to the question of whether it was a border controlled substance. 
     
      
    37 The appellant referred to the following directions given during the middle portion of the summing up: 
     
      
       
        
        “I repeat what I stated on Friday that whilst circumstantial evidence may be as convincing as direct evidence [w]hen the Crown relies on circumstantial evidence it must be the only inference that can be drawn. And they must prove, that is the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused intended to bring into Australia the substance. They do not have to prove that he knew the substance was ecstasy. They have to prove however that he knew or was aware or it was likely that there was a prohibited substance in the tank and that he, the accused, intended to bring that prohibited substance into Australia. So that is the first matter that the Crown must prove. That is an essential element that he must prove.” 
        
       
      
    38 Later the jury was directed: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown has to prove the case but the real matter, the ultimate question, is whether or not the accused did intend or was aware of the substantial risk, and has the Crown proved those matters beyond reasonable doubt. That is the ultimate question and the ultimate question for your determination.” 
        
       
      
    39 The appellant emphasised that this direction introduced the concept of substantial risk in relation to the question of whether or not the appellant was importing a border controlled drug. It was submitted that this direction was reinforced by the following direction: 
     
      
       
        
        “Just because I have referred to evidence does not mean that there is [not] other evidence which may be equally of importance in relation to those ultimate questions of whether … he intended or meant to bring into Australia a substance which he knew or believed was likely to be a prohibited substance, or whether or not the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt he was reckless and that he was aware of a real risk of substance that there was a prohibited substance in the tanks and being so aware, was he justified in bringing it in.” 
        
       
      
    40 I accept that to a limited degree the direction in [39] above may have been confusing. Recklessness was left at large and not confined to knowledge of the nature of the substance in the canister. However, these directions were preceded by the directions to which I have earlier referred and followed by the later exchange with counsel and the ultimate direction to the jury. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the jury were appropriately directed in this matter. 
     
      
    41 The appellant’s counsel put a submission during oral argument which had not been developed in the written submissions. The undisputed evidence was that three of the packages, each containing a water tank appeared to have been disturbed and repackaged using different tape. The Crown case was that this had been done by the appellant, or with his knowledge, so that he could insert the packages containing MDMA. The appellant said that he only became aware of the different packaging when he opened the container in Sydney. His defence was that some person unknown had opened the packages and placed the MDMA within them. Accordingly it was submitted that if the appellant was disbelieved and the jury concluded that he was aware that the packages had been disturbed before being loaded in Israel they may have understood that recklessness related to his knowledge of the inclusion of MDMA within the packages. 
     
      
    42 The appellant gave evidence that he was not aware until Sydney of the repackaging. This was consistent with his defence that he was entirely unaware of the presence of MDMA within the packages. Accordingly, recklessness was not a relevant issue. Although the judge spoke in relation to recklessness in the manner I have indicated I do not believe this would have caused the confusion which the appellant suggests. 
     
      
    43 The appellant’s submissions emphasised the confined nature of the issues in this trial. That was plain. In circumstances where only limited matters are in dispute it is appropriate, and trial judges should be assisted by counsel, to confine the issues which the jury must resolve to those which are in issue. In the present case the jury could have been, and in my judgment, should have been told that the Crown put its case on the basis that the appellant knew that MDMA was contained within the water tanks he was importing. An examination of other matters, not relevant to the issues requiring resolution, but requiring an explanation of the complexities of the relevant legislation was unnecessary. 
     
      
       
      The proviso 
       
      
    44 In my judgment this was an overwhelming Crown case. Even if I was persuaded that the judge erred in his directions I am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. This was not a case, as sometimes occurs, where the offender was a courier who had been asked by another person to bring goods into Australia. The appellant gave evidence that he was responsible for the loading of the packages containing the hot water tanks into a container in Israel and their importation into Australia. He gave evidence that he observed the packages being loaded and the containers sealed. The evidence was that the seal was intact when the container was opened by the authorities in Australia.  
     
      
    45 Once the container had arrived in Australia the appellant made arrangements as soon as he could to access the water tanks. Having purchased appropriate tools he accessed the packages and opened a tank to examine its contents. He removed a canister and made contact with Mr Cagan. He did not go to the authorities and complain that there was foreign matter within his hot water systems. None of his actions were consistent with him innocently happening upon drugs inserted by others. All of his actions in Australia were consistent with him being aware that the packages which he had imported contained the MDMA. The evidence which supported his conviction was overwhelming. 
     
      
       
      Order 
       
      
    46 In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.

   The Alleged Offences1 The accused stands indicted on 11 counts involving five complainants (D, G, M, J & B) and three types of conduct: 
     
      
      (1) Encouraging boys to run naked around a particular tree in the accused’s backyard in return for money (""the tree run game ""). 
       
      (2) While watching pornographic video material, masturbating in front of a group of boys and encouraging the boys to masturbate ("" the group masturbation game""). 
       
      (3) Watching naked boys take a cold shower. The boy who endured the cold shower for the longest period would receive payment (""the cold shower game "").  
      
    2 The alleged offences were perpetrated in about 2003/2004 at the accused’s South Coast residence. They involved a particular group of friends. Members of the group attended the accused’s home, where he supplied them with alcohol, cannabis and pornography and paid them to participate in the ""games"". The Contentions about Tendency Evidence and Separation of Trials3 Initially, the accused sought a stay of the proceedings on the basis that the Crown had not adequately particularised the charges. 4 Following clarification of the evidence on a voir dire inter alia to determine whether tendency evidence should be admitted, the Crown particularised the charges by alleging that counts one and two (tree run and group masturbation involving M.), counts three and four (tree run and group masturbation involving B) and counts 10 and 11 (tree run and group masturbation involving D) occurred on the same occasion. 5 The Crown contended that, as counts 1 to 4, 10 and 11, related to the one occasion and each complainant is a witness in the trials involving the other two complainants, the six counts should be heard together. The accused accepted that submission.6 The Crown contended that, as to the remaining five counts, evidence of each count should be admitted as tendency evidence in relation to each of the other 10 counts. In addition, the Crown sought to adduce tendency evidence from C and DB.7 The accused accepted that, in so far as evidence concerning a count was to be admitted as tendency evidence on another count, the counts would generally be tried together. However, the accused submitted that evidence concerning one type of conduct was not tendency evidence in relation to the other two types of conduct. Further, any tendency evidence should be rejected because it lacked significant probative value as there was a reasonable possibility of concoction. The accused contended that the Court would not be satisfied that the probative value of the tendency evidence substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect on the accused. Consequently, there should be a total of four trials. In addition to the trial for counts one to 4, 10 and 11, there should be separate trials for count five (group masturbation involving J), counts six, seven and eight (tree run and two cold showers involving G) and count nine (group masturbation involving D).Admissibility of Tendency Evidence8 Evidence that a person tends to act in a particular way is only admissible if: 
     
      
      (1) Reasonable written notice has been given in accordance with section 97(1)(a) of the  
      Evidence Act 
       1995, the court has dispensed with written notice pursuant to s100, or the evidence is called to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by another party: s 97(2)(b). 
       
      (2) The evidence is relevant in that it is capable of rationally affecting a fact in issue: s 55. 
       
      (3) The court determines that the evidence will have significant probative value: s 97 (1)(b). 
       
      (4) As to evidence tendered by the prosecution, the court is satisfied that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused: s 101(2). 
      
    Notice and Identification of the Tendency9 In relation to the counts involving a "" tree run"" or ""group masturbation"", in a notice under s 97, the Crown nominated the following tendency: 
     
      
      ""2. The tendency sought to be proved is (the tendency of the accused) to act in a particular way, namely to supply alcohol and/or marijuana to teenage boys and to engage in and/or incite teenage boys to run around a tree whilst naked; and to engage in and/or incite teenage boys to participate in a group masturbation activity."" 
      
    10 Although the ""cold shower"" evidence was not the subject of a tendency notice, the Crown sought to rely upon each of the ""cold shower"" counts (counts seven and eight, involving G) as tendency evidence in relation to each of the other counts and vice versa. In addition, the Crown sought to adduce ""cold shower"" tendency evidence from C and J. Although the Crown had not given written notice of its intention to adduce ""cold shower"" tendency evidence, the accused had been advised of the Crown's intention and raised no objection based on lack of notice. Pursuant to s 100, I dispense with the requirement of written notice.11 The Crown sought to rely on evidence about a particular ""game"" to establish a tendency to engage in all three ""games"" or, alternatively, to establish a tendency to engage in the particular ""game"".Probative Value12 When assessing the probative value of tendency evidence, the task of the trial judge involves a two-step process: R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338 at [33]. First, the judge must assess whether the evidence has the capacity to rationally affect the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. Second, the judge must assess the probative value that the jury might ascribe to the evidence and determine whether it has significant probative value.13 In this trial, as to each count the ultimate fact in issue is whether the accused actually conducted himself in the manner alleged by each complainant by engaging in the relevant ""game"". 14 The conduct comprising the ""tree run game"" was very distinctive and probably unique. 15 The circumstances of each of the ""games"" were distinctive in that each involved members of a particular group of boys who were of a similar age attending the accused’s residence, being supplied with alcohol and/or illicit drugs, (in the case of group masturbation) viewing pornography in the lounge room, engaging in group conduct and generally speaking, receiving payment. As to the accused’s conduct, in each of the ""games"" he observed boys in a sexual context, but did not touch them.16 In relation to each ""game"", the similarity of conduct and circumstances is such that the playing of the ""game"" on one occasion undoubtedly has the capacity to rationally affect an assessment of whether the accused engaged in that ""game"" on another occasion. Further, in relation to all ""games"", the similarity of circumstance and the general similarity of conduct is such that I am satisfied that the evidence in relation to each ""game"" is probative in that it has the capacity to rationally affect an assessment of whether the accused engaged in each other ""game"".Whether the Probative Value is Significant17 Evidence has ""significant"" probative value if it is not merely relevant but also ""meaningful"", "" important"" or ""of consequence"" in establishing an issue in contest: R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457, AW v R [2009] NSWCCA 1. In this case, the evidence has ""significant"" probative value if it is important to establishing whether the accused engaged in the ""game"" the subject of a particular charge in the manner alleged by the relevant complainant.18 The tendency evidence refers to events that were relatively contemporaneous with the events the subject of the indictment in that all alleged events occurred in about 2003 /2004.19 The events the subject of the tendency evidence occurred in very similar circumstances: see [15] above.20 As to each alleged ""tree run game"", the conduct was very similar and the nature of the ""game"" was probably unique. As to the ""group masturbation game"", the conduct on each alleged occasion was very similar and the nature of the ""game"" was distinctive. The same observation applies to the ""cold shower game "". As between the ""games"", the conduct was dissimilar except that each involved the accused observing more than one boy in a sexual context, but not touching any boy.21 Most of the tendency evidence has a reasonable but not high level of particularity.22 All the tendency evidence is disputed. Qualitative aspects of tendency evidence are to be considered when determining whether the evidence has significant probative value: AW v R at [47]. 23 Although the High Court decision in Hoch v The Queen (1988) 165 CLR 292 predates the Evidence Act 1995, the procedural approach adopted in Hoch should be applied to trials conducted in accordance with the Act: R v Colby [1999] NSWCCA 261, R v OGD No2 [2000] NSWCCA 404 at [77] and [129]. In Hoch at page 297, Mason C.J., Wilson J. and Gaudron J. stated: 
     
      
      "" Thus, in our view, the admissibility of similar fact evidence in cases such as the present depends on that evidence having the quality that is not reasonably explicable on the basis of concoction. That is a matter to be determined, as in all cases of circumstantial evidence, in the light of common sense and experience … if the depositions or the statements indicate that the complainants have a sufficient relationship to each other and had opportunity and motive for concoction then, as a matter of commonsense and experience, the evidence will lack the degree of probative value necessary to render it admissible. Of course, there may be cases where an examination on the voir dire is necessary, but that will be for the purpose of ascertaining the facts relevant to the circumstances of the witnesses to permit an assessment of the probative value of the evidence by reference to the consideration whether, in the light of common sense and experience, it is capable of reasonable explanation on the basis of concoction. It will not be for the purpose of the trial judge making a preliminary finding whether there was or was not concoction."" 
      
    Brennan and Dawson JJ held that similar fact evidence should be excluded unless the court was satisfied that there was ""no real chance"" that it was the product of concoction by the witnesses: page 304.24 In Colby at [109] – [111], the Court referred to Robertson (1997) 91 A Crim R 388, in which Ambrose J. reviewed the post-Hoch English decisions and concluded that the ""possibility of concoction” test required by Hoch referred to ""a reasonable possibility as distinct from a speculative or conjectural one”. That approach was endorsed in R v OGD No2 at [77] and [129].25 The approach is consistent with that of the minority in Hoch. At 304, Brennanand Dawson JJ noted: 
     
      
      ""That is not to say that a trial judge should lightly conclude that there is a ""real chance"" of conspiracy among complainants in sexual cases, whether children or adults. Contact or antecedent friendship between complainants may be quite insufficient to found such a conclusion. But the circumstances of their contact or friendship may warrant an enquiry whether there was a real chance that they had agreed to concoct their allegations. When such circumstances appear, the judge must enquire."" 
      
    26 I accept the accused’s submission that, when determining whether there is a reasonable possibility of concoction between tendency evidence witnesses, a court is not constrained to consider only relationship, opportunity and motive. For example, voir dire evidence may suggest an absence of motive but peculiar similarities between the evidence of witnesses may suggest that they have ""put their heads together"".27 In this case, the tendency witnesses gave evidence on the voir dire. With the exception of DB, who had only a very passing acquaintance with all but one of the other witnesses, the witnesses were part of the same group of friends. They had attended the same high school and most were in the same school year. Members of the group attended the accused’s residence in the company of other members of the group, although some members attended much more frequently than others. Since the group left school, there has been some contact between some members of the group, but most have gone their own way and had little contact with other members. I accept that the relationship between the witnesses (with the possible exception of DB) is such that they may have communicated in relation to the accused. I accept that there was an opportunity to do so. Indeed, some witnesses agreed that they had discussed the matter with another witness, although only in general terms.28 I accept the accused’s submission that there is no onus upon him to reveal a motive. However it is relevant to consider whether any possible motive is disclosed. In this case no motive to lie has been revealed. The community no longer regards allegations such as those here in question to be inherently unreliable. Indeed, the contrary is true. Nowadays, common sense and experience suggest that young men (generally, these witnesses are about 19 years old) are extremely unlikely to fabricate a scenario whereby, when they were adolescent boys, they and their friends accepted drugs, alcohol and money to engage in unsavoury sexual ""games"" in which they were observed by an older man. 29 In my view, the possibility of concoction is purely speculative or conjectural. There is no evidence of motive and there is no other evidence suggesting a reasonable possibility of concoction. The accused conceded that, given the age of the witnesses in 2003/2004 and the nature of their evidence, no issue of unconscious infection/contamination arises.Prejudice30 Pursuant to section 101 (2), the Court is required to evaluate the evidence in the particular case, weighing its probative value against its prejudicial effect: R v Ellis (2003) 58 NSWLR 700, R v Harker [2004] NSWCCA 427, particularly per Howie J at [58], R v RN [2005] NSWCCA 413 at [9].31 In this case, the tendency evidence regarding each ""game"" is of high probative value in relation to the counts concerning that ""game"". The evidence concerns reasonably contemporaneous events involving distinctive conduct and distinctive circumstances. The evidence has a reasonable degree of particularity. There is no ""reasonable possibility"" of concoction. Undoubtedly, the accused will be exposed to possible prejudice in the sense that, where witnesses refer to a number of occasions involving distinctive conduct, the jury may be inclined to reason that, if the accused committed the conduct on the occasion the subject of a particular charge, then he committed it on another occasion. However, that prejudice can be addressed by an appropriate direction. I am well satisfied that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect that it may have on the accused.32 As to the probative value that evidence of one ""game"" has in relation to a charge alleging another ""game"", the s 101 balancing exercise is difficult. Although the circumstances of each ""game"" are very similar, the conduct is not. With some hesitation, I have concluded that the s 101(2) test is not satisfied. Evidence of one ""game"" will not be admitted as tendency evidence in relation to a charge alleging another ""game"".Separation of the Trials33 Pursuant to s 29 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, all charges may be heard together. Generally, where a complainant alleges that an accused committed a series of offences against the complainant, the charges will be heard together. Further, where evidence concerning one charge is to be admitted as tendency evidence on another charge, the charges will be heard together: R v Milton [2004] NSWCCA 195. 34 The question is whether, in this case, the application of that practice would result in unfairness to the accused. Unfairness may arise because, where evidence of one charge is not admissible towards proof of guilt on another charge, the jury may disregard a direction that they may not reason that, because an accused has committed one offence, he or she is more likely to have committed another offence. In De Jesus (1986) 22 A Crim R 375 at 378 Gibbs CJ observed that sexual cases were peculiarly likely to arouse prejudice against which a direction to the jury was unlikely to guard. Although I do not understand the rationale for that approach and question its validity, I accept that it has been applied by superior courts in many cases. Nevertheless, I am confident that, in the present case, potential unfairness can be neutralised by an appropriate direction.35 The application to separate the trials is refused.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On their arraignment on 5 December 2008 Frances Megan Jeffrey and Raelene Erica Mealey entered pleas of guilty to an indictment charging them jointly with one count of causing the death of Joseph Kelly in circumstances amounting to manslaughter and a second count of robbery in company contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The first count carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and the second a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.  
     
      
    2 The deceased was the victim of the robbery. The proceeds of the robbery totalled $700. The offences were committed on 23 October 2006 after the offenders forced entry into the deceased’s home with the intention of robbing him of whatever money he had in order to buy drugs. He was aged 87. He lived alone in a Housing Commission unit at 808/23 Pyrmont Bridge Road, Camperdown. Ms Jeffrey lived in the same complex. Ms Mealey had slept there for a few nights before the robbery. At that time she had no fixed address of her own. After the robbery they left the unit, effectively locking the door behind them by pulling it shut. They left the deceased lying on the floor. Some hours later a neighbour was alerted by the deceased’s cries of pain and distress and a locksmith and ambulance were called. The deceased was transported to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.3 On 24 October 2006 he underwent surgery to treat a hip fracture. A dynamic screw was surgically inserted. Thereafter he contracted a bowel infection causally related to the antibiotics prescribed to promote healing and guard against infection. He also contracted right lower lobe pneumonia and deep vein thrombosis in both calves. Within ten days the deceased’s condition deteriorated. He subsequently lapsed into a coma and eventually died on 29 November 2006. 
     
      
      The plea of guilty in the Local Court 
      
    4 Ms Mealey entered pleas of guilty in the Local Court on 16 October 2008 to the charges upon which she stands to be sentenced. Ms Jeffrey entered pleas of guilty on 6 November 2008. At this time the prosecution withdrew charges of murder, aggravated break and enter with intent to commit a serious indictable offence in company, and special aggravated break and enter inflicting grievous bodily harm, originally laid against both offenders.  
     
      
    5 On 13 February 2009 the offenders came before me for sentence. 
     
      
    6 Despite the fact that the pleas of guilty were entered over twelve months after the offenders were arrested, the Crown accepted that both were entitled to the 25 per cent discount that attaches to the utilitarian value of an early plea (see R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383) given that from both a forensic and legal perspective there was a considerable difference of expert opinion as to whether the Crown could establish to the necessary criminal standard that the offenders’ conduct materially contributed to the death of the deceased.  
     
      
    7 The issue was ultimately settled after a report from Dr Duflou was served by the Crown in August 2008. This was in response to a report from Associate Professor Hilton served by Ms Mealey’s legal representatives in July 2008. It was Associate Professor Hilton’s view that although there was a clear temporal nexus between the fractured femur, surgery, anaesthesia and the medical deterioration culminating in death, the extent to which the forced entry to Mr Kelly’s home contributed to his death was at best speculative given the presentation and complexity of the surrounding medical issues. Dr Duflou, on the other hand, considered that there was a clear and unbroken progression between the injuries the deceased sustained on 23 October 2006 and his eventual death on 29 November 2006 from the complications that arose directly from those injuries.  
     
      
      The Crown case on sentence 
      
    8 The Crown relied upon a statement of facts, drawn in identical terms, in the sentencing proceedings for both offenders. It was compiled from the results of the police investigation that culminated in the arrest of both offenders in August 2007, ten months after Mr Kelly died and eleven months after the robbery. The Crown also tendered various scientific and medical reports together with the criminal records of both offenders. In so far as the circumstances of the robbery are concerned the statement of facts draws exclusively from a statement the deceased provided to the police at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital on 6 November 2006. (I note he was first spoken to by police on 25 October 2006 when a notebook entry of his account of the robbery was recorded. That was not in evidence.)  9 Ms Jeffrey confirmed her agreement with the statement of facts by formally adopting it in accordance with s 191 of the Evidence Act 1995. In so doing she adopted the deceased’s account of how she and Ms Mealey gained entry to the unit which was, in summary, that Ms Mealey knocked at Mr Kelly’s door, that he resisted her efforts at forcing entry and that it was only then that Ms Jeffrey lent her weight to push at the open door in the course of which Mr Kelly fell and fatally injured his hip. Ms Jeffrey accepted that she took the money from Mr Kelly’s wallet. 
     
      
    10 The statement of facts tendered by the Crown in Ms Mealey’s sentence proceedings was amended to reflect the fact that she took issue with the account given by the deceased implicating her in the mechanism by which entry was forced into the deceased’s unit. She gave evidence that although she opened the outer screen door and knocked on the wooden door (and that she was standing at the door when Mr Kelly opened it), it was Ms Jeffrey, who was crouched down to her left and out of sight, who barged at and through the door in the course of which Mr Kelly fell. Ms Mealey gave evidence that she did not push on the wooden door at all. She also gave evidence that the robbery was solely Ms Jeffrey’s idea, as was the plan to execute it. She said that Ms Jeffrey woke her on the morning of the robbery and asked her to knock on the door of a unit upstairs with a view to getting some money for drugs from the man who lived there. (Although she didn’t say so expressly her plea reflects the fact that she knew that the money would be taken from the man against his will, as distinct from it being given by way of a gift or a loan, and knew of the reasonable possibility that entry would be forced.) She said that although she initially refused to assist she agreed when Ms Jeffrey persisted. Ms Jeffrey did not give evidence.  
     
      
    11 Neither Mr Young of senior counsel who appeared for Ms Jeffrey, nor the Crown Prosecutor challenged Ms Mealey’s account of the circumstances in which she became involved in the robbery. I am satisfied that for this reason, together with the interplay of relevant subjective features of Ms Mealey’s case to which I will later refer, she was vulnerable to Ms Jeffrey’s influence, and this operates in mitigation of sentence to be imposed on the robbery count. In addition, since I am satisfied that Ms Mealey would not have been involved in the incident which resulted in Mr Kelly’s death at all but for Ms Jeffrey’s insistence, her sentence on the manslaughter count will also reflect that fact.  
     
      
    12 Both the Crown and Mr Young did however seek to persuade me to reject Ms Mealey’s account of what happened at the door of Mr Kelly’s unit as untrue. Mr Ierace submitted that I should accept Ms Mealey’s account as both accurate and truthful and that her sentence on the manslaughter count should be further reduced as a result. He did not submit that this aspect of her evidence had any impact on the sentence to be imposed on the robbery count since the robbery was committed as part of a joint criminal enterprise and, that as a matter of law, both offenders were responsible for the acts of each other in carrying out that enterprise. As I understand it, the point of distinction so far as concerns the manslaughter count is that since the Crown could not establish to the criminal standard that the serious injury Mr Kelly suffered in the robbery was seen by Ms Mealey as a possible incident of the joint enterprise to rob him (see R v Taufahema [2007] HCA 11; 228 CLR 232) as distinct from a reasonable person in her position realising that their conduct exposed the deceased to an appreciable risk of serious injury (as to which see Wilson v R (1992) 174 CLR 313), it is not open to view his death as an extension of any common purpose. For this reason, so it is submitted, the nature and quality of the offenders’ separate and unlawful and dangerous acts from which death resulted is material to the imposition of sentence on the manslaughter count for each of them.  13 Mr Ierace conceded however that even were I satisfied that doubt attended the question whether Ms Mealey actually pushed at or through the door under the force of which Mr Kelly fell and sustained the injuries from which he died, she is nevertheless liable to be sentenced as an accessory on the manslaughter count by being present at the time Ms Jeffrey forced her way through the door (knowing in advance that was how entry was likely to be effected) and by her presence providing Ms Jeffrey with intentional assistance and encouragement (see Giorgianni v R (1985) 156 CLR 473 at 506). The question that then arises is whether, despite the fact that the only physical act she performed was knocking on the door, Ms Mealey’s role as an aider and abettor in the particular circumstances of this case has anything other than a marginal impact on the sentence for manslaughter. The Crown submitted it did not. In GAS v R; SJK v R [2004] HCA 22; 217 CLR 198 at 209 the High Court noted that it is not a universal principle that the culpability of an aider and abettor is less than a principal offender, and that in the context of the offence of manslaughter, much will depend on the objective circumstances of the unlawful killing. In GAS the Court was satisfied that the margin of difference was properly regarded as relatively small. The same cannot be said of this case. 
     
      
       
      Resolving the dispute between the deceased’s account of the robbery and the evidence of Ms Mealey 
       
      
    14 Mr Kelly told police that he was alone in his unit when at about 8.30am he responded to a knock at his door. He said that he opened the door less than a foot when he saw a woman who pushed her shoulder against the door attempting to force her way in. (By his description this person could only have been Ms Mealey.) He said he resisted by trying to shut the door. He claimed that the woman kept pushing at the door at which point Ms Jeffrey, a woman Mr Kelly recognised as residing in his unit block, also pushed against the door which forced the door open. According to the deceased it was the force accompanying the combined efforts of both women to gain entry against his resistance that ultimately forced the door open causing him to fall to the ground. He said he experienced immediate pain in his left hip. Upon gaining entry he said Ms Jeffrey went to a dresser in the lounge room and removed a number of $50 notes, totalling about $700, after which both offenders left the unit without rendering him any assistance. 
     
      
    15 Although Ms Jeffrey accepted Mr Kelly’s version of events and invited me to sentence her on the basis that she only joined in pushing at the door when Ms Mealey was unsuccessful in gaining entry (this being the basis upon which Mr Young cross-examined her), in accepting Ms Mealey’s account I cannot be satisfied that Ms Jeffrey should be sentenced on that basis.16 As I have already noted, Ms Mealey gave evidence that she agreed to knock on the door at Ms Jeffrey’s request while Ms Jeffrey crouched against the wall to her left so as to remain out of the deceased’s sight. I am satisfied that this was because Ms Jeffrey was concerned that the deceased would recognise her and may not have opened the door. Ms Mealey said that the deceased opened the door by a modest measure whereupon, without warning, Ms Jeffrey leapt from the side, pushed the door open and barged into the unit knocking the deceased to the ground. She said she understood why Mr Kelly might have thought that they both pushed at the door given that the force with which Ms Jeffrey hit the door was, as she described it, like the strength of a man.  
     
      
    17 Having heard from Ms Mealey and taking into account both her demeanour under cross-examination, and the detail of her evidence, I am satisfied that she has given truthful evidence. Her account is entirely consistent with the dominant role of Ms Jeffrey as the instigator and the primary perpetrator of the robbery. That is not to say that I regard Mr Kelly’s account to police as untrue. I do not make that finding. Rather I am satisfied that there is a real risk that his nomination of both offenders as applying force to the door is unreliable given the situation he was confronted with, his age and the injuries he sustained. For that reason I disregard his identification of Ms Mealey as being one of the women who pushed at the door causing him to fall. 
     
      
    18 Having made that finding of fact in Ms Mealey’s favour I am satisfied that it reduces by a margin the sentence to be imposed on the manslaughter count in her sentence proceedings, since her unlawful act must be confined to her conduct as an aider and abettor, together with her failure to provide Mr Kelly with any assistance when she knew he was seriously injured. I am however satisfied that when Ms Mealey knocked at the door she knew that it was Ms Jeffrey’s intention to rob the deceased once he opened the door and that she agreed to participate with her with that objective in mind with a view to sharing the proceeds of the robbery. I note in that connection she was ultimately given only $50 while Ms Jeffrey retained the balance of the stolen money.  
     
      
      The police investigation into the robbery and subsequently into Mr Kelly’s death 
       
      
    19 Until the death of the deceased on 29 November 2006 the police investigation focused on what was at that time thought to be limited to a robbery in company.  
     
      
    20 A neighbour of the deceased identified Ms Jeffrey as one of the robbers from the description the deceased supplied to the police. On 27 October 2006 detectives attended Ms Jeffrey’s premises and offered her the opportunity to participate in an identification parade. She declined. At that stage the police were only investigating the robbery in the course of which Mr Kelly was injured, but not fatally.  
     
      
    21 On 6 November 2006 detectives again attended Ms Jeffrey’s premises at which time she formally refused to participate in an identification parade. Whilst at the premises Ms Jeffrey informed police that she was at a friend’s premises on the morning of the robbery. She supplied the name Darryl McCann and where police could find him. The following day detectives returned to Ms Jeffrey’s premises and enquired whether she would be willing to participate in a formal interview. She again declined.  
     
      
    22 The detectives subsequently visited Mr McCann’s premises. He provided them with a statement in which he said that although he could not confirm that Ms Jeffrey was with him on the morning of the robbery, that it was possible, and that if that were the case she left around 9.30am. Mr McCann also informed the detectives that Ms Jeffrey had a friend named Raelene staying with her.  
     
      
    23 The detectives returned to Ms Jeffrey’s residence on 7 November 2006. On that occasion she provided them with a handwritten note together with diary entries in which she gave the deliberately false impression that her movements on the morning of 23 October 2006 could be accounted for. It would appear that the police were of the view that in these circumstances there was insufficient evidence upon which to charge her at that time. 24 On 4 January 2007 an eyewitness informed police that he saw Ms Jeffrey and another female on the day of the robbery on the same landing as the deceased’s unit. He subsequently identified Ms Jeffrey from a photo identification board.  
     
      
    25 Police were not able to renew contact with Ms Jeffrey until April 2007 when she was located as a resident of a caravan park on the mid north coast of New South Wales.  
     
      
    26 In July 2007, pursuant to warrants issued under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) (New South Wales) Act 1987 and the Listening Devices Act 1984, police recorded a number of conversations between Ms Jeffrey and Mr McCann where they discussed the death of the deceased.  
     
      
    27 On 2 August 2007 Mr McCann gave an induced statement to the police where he admitted that Ms Jeffrey approached him and asked him to provide her with a false alibi. He also claimed that a woman he knew as Raelene said she was involved in the robbery. There was no suggestion however that she asked him to provide a false alibi on her behalf.  
     
      
    28 Later that day, and at the invitation of the police, Mr McCann telephoned Ms Jeffrey and informed her that he had been speaking to the police at which point she became agitated and ordered Mr McCann to “stick to our story”. She was recorded saying:  
     
      
       
        
        “…they’re just graspin’ at straws, Darryl, they want someone to hang this on and they’re gunna try and do it to me…”. 
        
       
      
    In a later conversation when he told Ms Jeffrey that he had given a statement to police she was recorded as saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “…so you just fuckin’ played into their hands. Don’t be sorry, I’m not sorry. I’m … amazed that you could … let this … happen. All you had to do was say to them go away…”. 
        
       
      
    29 On 6 August 2007 police located Ms Mealey. After initially denying any involvement in the robbery she admitted to knowing Ms Jeffrey and to staying at her unit at the time of the offence. On 7 August 2007 she was placed under arrest. On legal advice she declined to be interviewed but she did adopt the record of conversation with police the previous day. On the same day police arrested Ms Jeffrey. She declined to be interviewed. Both women have been in custody since the date of their arrest. 
     
      
       
      The objective criminality inherent in the offending  
       
      
    30 Although the crimes of robbery and manslaughter are different in character and attract different maximum terms of imprisonment, given the intrinsic link between the two offences in the unusual circumstances of this case, the level of objective criminality inherent in each offence is relatively similar. In accordance with Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 it will be necessary to impose separate sentences, however it was the view of all counsel that the sentence on the robbery in company count should be ordered to be served concurrently with the sentence on the manslaughter count, the criminality in the robbery count being wholly subsumed by the manslaughter as the more serious offence. In imposing sentence on the robbery in company count I have considered the guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 but distinguish its application in the circumstances of this case.31 It is well established that of all the offences in the criminal calendar the offence of manslaughter produces the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability and attracting, for that reason, a wide range of sentences including, in some circumstances, nominal sentences (see R v Lavender [2005] HCA 37; 222 CLR 67 per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ at 77). In addition, and in recognition of the fact that manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act of itself admits a wide range of conduct calling for a wide range of penal consequences, it is necessary that I identify with precision the act that caused Mr Kelly’s death in order to make an assessment of its objective gravity in the sentence proceedings of each offender (see R v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377; 160 A Crim R 1 at [133]-[134]). 32 In resolving the dispute between Mr Kelly’s account and Ms Mealey’s evidence I expressed the view that the act causing death is best described as a sequence of related acts. In Ms Jeffrey’s case those acts are constituted initially by forcing her way into the deceased’s premises through the partially opened door when she must have known that Mr Kelly was behind the door and was resisting entry and therefore at risk of being seriously hurt in the process. Self evidently, her actions in that regard were both unlawful and dangerous as were Ms Mealey’s as her accessory. I have already referred to the basis of Ms Mealey’s liability as an accessory. Their individual acts were then accompanied by their joint decision to leave Mr Kelly behind a locked door, aware that he was seriously hurt, and their failure thereafter to do anything to bring his condition to the attention of the ambulance service. Despite the fact that I am satisfied that neither of the offenders intended to harm the deceased, much less that they contemplated that he might die, and further that the injury he suffered was not a result of the intentional application of direct force by either of them, by their pleas of guilty they must be taken to have accepted that a reasonable person in their position would have realised that their conduct exposed the deceased to an appreciable risk of serious injury (see Wilson v R (1992) 174 CLR 313 at 333). 33 The Crown submitted that the facts in the case of R v Sandness [2000] NSWSC 821 are sufficiently similar to the facts in this case to warrant my finding, as Dunford J did in that case, a very high degree of objective criminality. While it is true that in both cases robbery was the motive (and in both cases to feed a drug habit) and that the victim in both cases was a man in his 80’s in his own home, the cause of death in Sandness was as a result of the deceased sustaining multiple fractures to the skull, extreme facial contusions and a subdural haematoma delivered by the application of blunt force, most likely by the use of a house brick. I regard that as a critical point of distinction to the cause of death in this case.  
     
      
    34 I was also taken to the case of R v Wheatley [2007] NSWSC 1182 where Bell J described the act of the offender in pushing the elderly deceased out of his way on a pedestrian crossing and into the path of oncoming traffic as impulsive and loutish and, as such, was an offence at the lower end of the range of objective seriousness for manslaughter offences by unlawful and dangerous act. That case, and the other cases to which her Honour and I were referred where death resulted from a single blow often delivered in spontaneous reaction to conflict of one sort or another, whether alcohol-fuelled or not, also do not seem to me to be directly analogous to this case, at least in so far as Ms Jeffrey is concerned. Her actions were not on any view spontaneous but the result of premeditation and planning however unsophisticated. On the other hand, Ms Mealey’s participation was impulsive, a matter fairly conceded by the Crown. I propose to have regard to that matter in mitigation of the sentence to be imposed on Ms Mealey.  
     
      
    35 In the result, I am satisfied that the serious injury the deceased suffered to his hip by the mechanism of the forced entry to his home motivated by theft, coupled with the offenders’ blatant disregard for his obvious pain and distress, is such as to warrant a finding that the offence of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act cannot be fairly described as at the lower end of the range of objective seriousness. I do consider however that the level of seriousness in this case is moderated, to an extent, by the extended chain of causation leading to Mr Kelly’s death. I have already made clear that I regard the level of objective seriousness in Ms Mealey’s offending as less than that of Ms Jeffrey’s. In coming to that view I do not for one moment lose sight of the fact that a life has been lost and that death by any unlawful killing is one of the gravest offences against an ordered society (see R v Bolt [2001] NSWCCA 487; 126 A Crim R 284 at 293)  
     
      
      Features of aggravation 
      
    36 The Crown submitted, and I accept, that the objective criminality inherent in both counts and against both offenders is aggravated by the fact that the deceased was an elderly man living alone and who was entitled to expect that in his home he would be protected from risk to his physical health and safety as comprehended by s 21A(2)(l) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Act”). Unlike the situation in Towers v R [2008] NSWCCA 283, where the Court of Criminal Appeal emphasised that the age of the victims of an aggravated break and enter offence being 60 and 62 did not aggravate that offending since it appeared that their house was chosen at random and for reasons unrelated to the characteristics of the occupants, here I am satisfied that Ms Jeffrey targeted Mr Kelly because of the very fact that he was elderly and lived alone. Although I accept that Ms Mealey did not plan the offence, and in that sense was not party to targeting Mr Kelly, she was aware of the fact that the person to be robbed was an elderly man (she admitted in her evidence that she had seen him feeding birds in the park) and that the robbery would very probably mean his home would be invaded as proved to be the case. 37 The fact that the offenders acted in company is an element of the robbery offence and, accordingly, is not available as an aggravating factor when assessing the objective seriousness of that offending. By contrast, the fact that the two offenders acted in company in committing the offence of manslaughter has some bearing on the assessment of the objective seriousness of that criminality as provided for in s 21A(2)(e) of the Sentencing Act, although in the circumstances of this case, I do not regard it as aggravating an already serious offence of manslaughter to any significant degree.  
     
      
    38 The Crown also submitted that I should regard the failure of the offenders to take any steps to assist the deceased as constituting gratuitous cruelty and, as such, a further feature of aggravation as provided for in s 21A(2)(f) of the Sentencing Act. Quite apart from the fact that I doubt that their conduct, however heartless, satisfies the descriptor of gratuitous cruelty (as to which see for example R v King [2004] NSWCCA 444; 150 A Crim R 409 when a pregnant female victim of a malicious wounding was kicked; see also R v Hoeler [2004] NSWCCA 184; 147 A Crim R 520 at [43], [64] and [80]), given that I regard this aspect of their conduct as intrinsically linked to the act causing death I do not take it into account as a feature of aggravation (see Elyard v R [2006] NSWCCA 43). That said, I consider their failure to render assistance, either at the time they entered the unit or later by placing an anonymous call to the ambulance service, as conduct reflecting a callous lack of empathy for an old and injured man. The fact that their conscience in the moment may have been anaesthetised by drugs, or an appetite for them, does nothing to diminish the condemnation their conduct properly deserves.39 The features of aggravation to which I have referred were common (or potentially common) to both offenders. In Ms Jeffrey’s case I accept the Crown’s submission that s 21A(2)(d) of the Sentencing Act also operates adversely to her in the imposition of sentence. That section provides that a record of previous convictions (particularly if the offender is being sentenced for a serious personal violence offence and has a record of previous convictions for serious personal violence offences) operates as an aggravating feature. I note that while her record does not register a conviction for an offence in either category it does record an offence of a relevantly aggravating kind given the strikingly similar circumstances in which it was committed. 
     
      
      Ms Jeffrey’s previous record 
       
        
       
      
    40 Ms Jeffrey’s prior record does not commence until 2002 when she was charged with a minor offence of dishonesty. She was at that time 40 years of age. I accept that her offending at that time was commensurate with the time she commenced using heroin, and that her addiction thereafter became increasingly entrenched up to and including her arrest in August 2007. 41 In July 2003 she was charged with a series of offences when she broke into the residence of another elderly man, assaulted him and searched through his property with the intention of robbing him. I am satisfied that on that occasion, as with the matter for which she stands to be sentenced before me, she knew the victim as a neighbour, knew that he was alone inside the premises and that he was unlikely to be able to resist her intentions to rob him. In respect of the most objectively serious of the charges for which she faced sentence in the District Court in August 2004 as a consequence of that incident, namely aggravated break, enter and steal pursuant to s 113(2) of the Crimes Act (aggravated by reason of her knowing that the victim was within the dwelling), she was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 months with a non-parole period of 9 months suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Sentencing Act on condition that she be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months. I note that in the same proceedings a charge of assault with intention to rob the same victim was dealt with under s 9 of the Sentencing Act. As those matters were en route to the District Court she was arrested on fresh charges, none of which involved violence. They were dealt with in the Local Court by way of non-custodial penalties of various kinds. Although at the time of the robbery of the deceased she was no longer subject to the bonds imposed in the District Court in August 2004, in May 2006 she was the subject of a fresh bond imposed pursuant to s 9 of the Sentencing Act for drug offences. This operates as an additional and independent feature of aggravation in her case.42 I approach an assessment of the extent to which Ms Jeffrey’s prior offending impacts adversely on the sentence to be imposed conscious of what the Court of Criminal Appeal held in R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 163 A Crim R 381 as the correct approach to the operation of s 21A(2)(d) in the context of s 21A(4) and the common law. Accordingly, I do not regard her prior record, per se, as aggravating the seriousness of the offending inherent in either offence beyond that which is proportionate to the gravity of that offending viewed objectively. I do however have regard to the fact that she used the same modus operandi in 2003 as she employed in the present case, and that on both occasions she effected a robbery on an elderly victim in his own home where he was unlikely to be able to defend himself. In the present case of course the consequences for the victim were fatal. Irrespective of the fact that I accept that she was driven by her addiction on both occasions, her conduct in the present case does not simply manifest a deliberate and continuing disobedience of the law, it resonates with a lack of regard for those in the community who are most in need of protection. It calls for deterrence and denunciation and warrants a heavier sentence than might otherwise be the case (see Veen v R (1979) 143 CLR 458).  
     
      
       
      The subjective circumstances of Ms Mealey  
       
      
    43 Ms Cieplucha, a forensic psychologist, interviewed Ms Mealey at Silverwater Women’s Correctional Complex on 15 December 2008 for a period of two hours. What follows is drawn from her report, together with a report from Ms Heyes, a drug and alcohol clinician within Drug Health Services at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. I also take into account Ms Mealey’s evidence before me.  
     
      
       
      Family/Social History  
       
      
    44 Ms Mealey was aged 34 when she committed the present offences and was 36 at the time of sentence. She was abandoned by her mother at the age of four months and left in the care of her father and her paternal grandparents. Her mother is Aboriginal and her father is of Irish descent. Her father has remarried twice. His first remarriage was also to an Aboriginal woman. They had two children. Ms Mealey’s stepmother was highly critical of her and frequently excluded her from the family unit. When that marriage broke down, instead of residing with her father and her father’s second wife and their six children, Ms Mealey chose to remain in the care of her paternal grandparents. As a consequence her relationship with her immediate family became increasingly distant. Upon entering custody Ms Mealey reported that her contact with her father and her siblings has become more regular. Ms Mealey stated that during her childhood she suffered no sexual abuse and no serious physical harm at the hands of either her father or her grandparents. I am satisfied that she was however sexually abused from the age of five by an extended family member over a number of years. Neither her father nor her grandparents were aware of the abuse. She did not reveal it until she was 21. 
     
      
    45 Ms Mealey left school in Year 8 and did not participate in any further education until entering custody in August 2007. She has not been employed since the age of 16 when she worked in a local shop. She has been in receipt of Centrelink benefits since the age of 23. She is currently undertaking Literacy, Computer, Art and Koori classes. 46 Ms Mealey reported that after her grandparents passed away when she was in her early twenties she began experiencing difficulties securing stable accommodation. Her grandparents had, in effect, been her primary caregivers until that time. At first she resided with her then boyfriend at his aunt’s house after which they squatted in various vacant premises. It was at this time that she went in search of her biological mother in Redfern. She was bitterly disappointed to find her mother severely addicted to alcohol and unresponsive to her approach and desire for contact.47 Despite the fact that her relationship with her boyfriend extended over a period of years it offered her little by way of stability or security. It was marked by extreme violence and substance abuse. She variously suffered punches with a closed fist and being hit with an open hand. She also suffered kicks to the head resulting in repeated losses of consciousness, a broken jaw and short-term memory difficulties. Ms Mealey rarely sought medical attention for her injuries, and although she considered applying for an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order on one occasion, she decided against it in order to avoid trouble. Ms Mealey also reported being verbally abused, threatened and belittled by her boyfriend. Although she endeavoured to provide support and refuge for her younger siblings after the death of her grandparents, she progressively separated herself from them for their protection due to her boyfriend’s physically abusive behaviour and substance abuse.  
     
      
    48 She said that her boyfriend coerced her into stealing with him in order to support his drug addiction. This is consistent with the first entry on her criminal record in 1992 when she was aged 20. Thereafter and over successive years she has been convicted of a range of property offences (of which only one involved a break and enter of premises committed in 1999) and summary drug offences of self-administration and possession. She has served two short periods of imprisonment for larceny. Notably, save for a charge of common assault dealt with in the Children’s Court, she has never been charged or convicted of an offence of violence.  
     
      
    49 I am satisfied that at the time of the offending Ms Mealey had a limited social network and was living a largely transient lifestyle consequent first upon the death of her grandparents and then as a direct result of leaving the abusive relationship with her former boyfriend. It would appear that it was in these circumstances that she accepted an offer of shelter from Ms Jeffrey in the days leading up to 23 October 2006.  
     
      
       
      Psychological assessment 
       
      
    50 Ms Cieplucha assessed Ms Mealey’s personality functioning using the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory 3rd Edition (MCMI-III), a psychometric instrument aimed at developing a diagnostic profile of an individual in relation to both personality disorders and clinical syndromes. Ms Mealey’s profile is suggestive of someone experiencing feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem, worthlessness and vulnerability in addition to sadness, pessimism and apathy which reflect her reported feelings of depression. On assessment Ms Cieplucha also reported, and I accept, that Ms Mealey is socially naïve and is likely to be easily influenced by others. I am satisfied that she was subject to the influence of Ms Jeffrey when she agreed to join with her to rob the deceased.  
     
      
    51 Ms Cieplucha also administered the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence in order to provide a general estimate of Ms Mealey’s intellectual capacity. The results of this test highlighted Ms Mealey’s reduced verbal skills with a demonstrated limited word knowledge and poor verbal abstract reasoning which, according to Ms Cieplucha, are often associated with impulsivity, limited insight and poor self-monitoring. Ms Mealey’s overall level of intellectual functioning which was assessed as being extremely low to borderline in terms of verbal skills, and borderline to average in terms of performance intelligence, is also of significance in mitigation of sentence.  
     
      
       
      Drug and alcohol history 
       
      
    52 Ms Mealey reported to Ms Cieplucha that she started smoking cannabis at the age of 14. She also started smoking heroin on a daily basis at the age of 20 and progressed to intravenous use at the age of 21 by which time she was drug dependent. She also admitted to using cocaine on a daily basis when she was 22 which persisted until she was 27. I accept that she likely used drugs as a means of self-medication in order to cope with issues of abandonment, sexual abuse and homelessness. She has made two attempts at rehabilitation in the past, through Odyssey House in 1995 and the MERIT program in 2003. Both were unsuccessful. I am satisfied this was due in part at least to the fact that her social dislocation rendered her vulnerable to relapse. 
     
      
    53 Although Ms Cieplucha’s report briefly mentions the Koori women’s counselling program administered by the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, it would appear that she was unaware of Ms Mealey’s progress through that program. Ms Heyes, a clinician and counsellor, reported that in November 2006, upon referral from the Aboriginal Medical Service, Ms Mealey became a regular weekly attendee of the Aboriginal Women’s Support Group. It is significant that her involvement with the group commenced after the robbery and continued up until the time of her arrest. In February 2007 she requested weekly individual counselling sessions which continued until she was arrested. I am satisfied that prior to her arrest Ms Mealey was actively engaged in the treatment offered to her and that her punctuality and commitment evidenced a keen desire to change her behaviour. The goals of her treatment at that time involved:  
     
      
       
        
        “i) Stable accommodation. 
         
        ii) Maintaining her abstinence from heroin and refraining from abusing or misusing other substances. 
         
        iii) Introducing positive social supports. 
         
        iv) Long term goals involving further education and employment.” 
        
       
      
    54 Ms Heyes reports that over the course of her treatment Ms Mealey has managed to make behavioural changes and, in particular, she has improved her interpersonal skills becoming less sensitive and reactionary and more able to control her tendency to be easily led or influenced by others. In so far as her goal of obtaining stable accommodation is concerned I note that she obtained housing with Dolores Single Women’s Refuge from 3 April 2007 until the time of her arrest. Ms Mealey’s case worker at the Refuge, Ms Reynaud, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The staff at the Refuge were very pleased with Raelene to the extent that when one of our exit houses became available we did not hesitate to give Raelene the opportunity to reside in the premises for a period of a year with outreach support from our service. 
        
       
       
        
        Whilst residing at our Refuge Raelene followed all of our rules and was a role model client. Raelene was very courteous to staff and was happy to follow a case plan as well as continuing her other support outside of the Refuge.” 
        
       
      
    55 Ms Heyes reported that while Ms Mealey occasionally used cocaine, cannabis, alcohol and benzodiazepines in the course of her participation in the program at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, as revealed by urine analysis as well as clinical observations and reports, she abstained entirely from heroin for nine months prior to her arrest. Further, and to her credit, she was not only committed to her own abstinence from heroin but also tried to encourage other users to do the same. In addition, Ms Heyes reported (and I accept) that Ms Mealey’s lapses into drug use were occasional and in response to adverse social or emotional stimuli as distinct from indicating a resurgence of dependent drug use. Of crucial significance on sentence Ms Mealey was abstinent from all drugs, apart from nicotine, for four months prior to her arrest. I am satisfied that Ms Mealey appreciated well before her arrest the adverse impact of drugs on her behaviour and has a demonstrated insight into the connection between her drug abuse and her past offending. This is amply demonstrated by her determined effort to change her life circumstances after the robbery and Mr Kelly’s death. She has expressed a desire to abstain from drugs and an appreciation of the need to continue drug and alcohol intervention and recovery programs in prison and upon her release. I consider her desire to be genuine.  
     
      
      The subjective circumstances of Ms Jeffrey 
       
      
    56 Mr Watson-Munro, a forensic psychologist, interviewed Ms Jeffrey at the Long Pay Prison Complex on 17 December 2008. What follows is drawn from that report and the evidence of her sister, Ms Christine Jeffrey. 
     
      
       
      Family/Social History  
      
    57 Ms Christine Jeffrey gave evidence that she was the eldest of four children and the older sister of the offender. She described a close family relationship. She said that despite her sister’s criminal behaviour, her mother and father maintain a close connection with her sister. Were it not for the fact that Ms Jeffrey’s father is currently hospitalised having been diagnosed with prostate cancer and that his wife was assisting him I accept that they would have been in attendance during the sentencing proceedings. I note that Mr and Mrs Jeffrey have the care of the two remaining children, both of whom suffer disabilities.  
     
      
    58 Despite the fact that the family moved frequently during the children’s high school years, which in Mr Watson-Munro’s view limited Ms Jeffrey’s ability to maintain meaningful peer group relationships, she achieved well and graduated from high school with high academic and sporting achievements. She had some success as an amateur actor with the Ensemble Theatre before she married. Her sister assessed the marriage as an unhappy one. She said that Ms Jeffrey did not share her predicament with her wider family. She also has a work history in hospitality although from what I was able to glean from the tendered report she has not worked in paid employment for some time.  
     
      
    59 Ms Jeffrey described her former partner as an exceptionally controlling individual who manipulated her through the management of family finances, which in turn impacted upon her self-esteem and contributed to a form of learned helplessness. In the absence of professional intervention Ms Jeffrey reportedly turned to drug abuse as a means of self-medication. The relationship dissolved by a separation in 2000 after which Ms Jeffrey suffered an emotional breakdown accompanied with a suicide attempt. She has three sons who remained in the care of their father when she left the family home although I note that they have each suffered the social and emotional consequences of a fractured family life as a result of the breakdown in the family and their mother’s addiction. Her children are now aged 22, 17 and 14. 
     
      
    60 Christine Jeffrey confirmed that her sister started abusing drugs in the last six months of her marriage and that this rapidly escalated into a chronic heroin addiction. She apparently dissipated the $130,000 she obtained in a divorce settlement on heroin after which she resorted to prostitution to support her drug habit. I have already noted the nexus between her drug addiction and her pattern of criminality which culminated in the offences for which she stands to be sentenced. Christine Jeffrey has been aware of her sister’s psychosocial decline over many years. She said that her sister’s physical health and appearance has suffered to the extent that she was barely recognisable at the time of her arrest. With family support she made various attempts at rehabilitation over the passage of five or six years, all of which were largely unsuccessful. The latest attempt was after the robbery. She apparently relapsed into drug use on that occasion after her boyfriend was released from custody.  
     
      
    61 Christine Jeffrey acknowledged her awareness of the circumstances giving rise to her sister’s conviction and that her sister attempted to avoid responsibility in her various dealings with police. She said that to her own observation her sister was acting strangely in the months prior to her arrest. She described her as “angry, vicious and shifty”. 62 Despite the considerable pain Ms Jeffrey has put her family members through for some years, to their credit they remain unstintingly supportive of her. In one sense this augers well for her rehabilitation. Since her sister’s arrest and remand Christine Jeffrey has observed a physical and psychological shift in her sister’s attitude and outlook. Christine Jeffrey said:  
     
      
       
        
        “I know Frances holds life sacred because of the way we were raised and other things that occurred in her life and I think she has a deep horror of what happened to Mr Kelly and her involvement in it to the point that…she finds it very difficult to even discuss it with me or other members of the family…I just feel that the person she is, she would have a lot of difficulty coming to terms with herself and she would suffer”.  
        
       
      
    63 She has spoken to her sister about her plans upon release and confirmed that her intentions are to remain drug-free although, as both Christine Jeffrey and Mr Watson-Munro note, Ms Jeffrey requires ongoing assistance in order to address the underlying and complex causes of her drug use. As Mr Watson-Munro reports: 
     
      
       
        
        “…(Ms Jeffrey) requires consistent treatment whilst in custody and beyond. She has now been drug-free for some significant period of time and reflective of her improved state of health she has gained 20kg in weight. She also appears to be more insightful to her problems… She has not as yet however embarked upon a regular course of psychotherapy which is indicated. This needs to be complemented with specific skills training focussed on relapse prevention. Attendant to this a cessation of contact with potentially adverse influences in her life is essential and in the absence of these considerations being attended to her prognosis in my view is exceptionally bleak.” 
        
       
      
    64 Ms Jeffrey is also hopeful of resuming a relationship with her three sons and, in particular, that she will be able to resume the care of her youngest son who is thought to be at risk in circumstances where the relationship with his father and his father’s new partner is fractured and unstable.  
     
      
      Mitigating factors 
      
     
     
      
      Ms Mealey 
      
    65 Mr Ierace relied upon a number of mitigating matters under s 21A of the Sentencing Act which, in addition to what he submitted was the secondary role Ms Mealey assumed at Ms Jeffrey’s direction on the morning of the robbery, and her subjective circumstances, operate to result in a sentence significantly less than the sentence that might be imposed on her co-offender.  
     
      
    66 He first emphasised, as I have already noted, that the Crown prosecutor conceded in written submissions that s 21A(3)(b) was invoked in her favour in that the commission of the offence was impulsive. I am also satisfied that her level of intellectual functioning and her personality profile rendered her vulnerable to Ms Jeffrey’s influence. Mr Ierace also emphasised that despite the fact that Ms Mealey has an antecedent criminal record, it is comprised primarily of property offences with no offences of violence of any kind. I am invited to conclude from that fact, together with the other material placed before me, that there is no basis upon which I could form the view that she has any propensity to violence. I accept that submission. I also accept that Ms Mealey is genuinely remorseful and has expressed that remorse both to the reporting psychologist and, in a compelling way, in her evidence before me. I accept that not only is she deeply regretful that she was responsible for the death of an elderly man but that since her grandparents were the only adults to whom she could refer for mentorship or guidance in her childhood, she strongly identifies with the injury and pain that Mr Kelly suffered as an elderly person at the time of the robbery and in the days before he died. Her determined efforts prior to her to arrest both to address her addiction and to gain a foothold in the wider community against considerable personal adversity are impressive. They encourage me to the view that the recidivism that has marked her as an adult offender over many years will be unlikely to be repeated on her release and that she has positive prospects of rehabilitation.  
     
      
       
      Ms Jeffrey 
       
      
    67 Ms Jeffrey’s attempts to construct a false alibi and her concerted efforts over a period of months to avoid responsibility for her conduct do not operate to aggravate her offending. They do not however reflect favourably on her when I am invited to consider what is said to be evidence of her remorse and contrition in mitigation of her sentence. Mr Young submitted that whilst her conduct from 23 October 2006 to her arrest does not stand to her credit, her addiction throughout that period of time should be viewed as overwhelming a genuine and empathetic concern for the deceased that has surfaced since her arrest. Given her sister’s somewhat guarded evidence as set out in paragraph 62 above the only other source of evidence that Ms Jeffrey has accepted responsibility for her actions (such as to permit me to have regard to remorse as a mitigating factor as provided for in the amended terms of s 21A(3)(i)-(ii) of the Sentencing Act) is found in that part of Mr Watson-Munro’s report where he says Ms Jeffrey expressed remorse for her actions which appeared genuine. Although I do not disregard his opinion I do not regard it as compelling a finding in her favour in the absence of having heard from her in evidence or there being other evidence of her contrition. I do however give it some weight.  
     
      
    68 I also regard Ms Jeffrey’s prospects of rehabilitation as guarded. That is not to say that I discount entirely her desire to rebuild her life, even to the extent of resuming tertiary studies. I am simply mindful of the evidence of her sister and Mr Watson-Munro and the fact that her attempts at addressing her addiction in the period after the robbery and leading up to arrest were short-lived when she resumed drug use on her boyfriend’s release from prison. I cannot overlook the fact that there are multiple entries in her custodial report indicating that she has not been drug-free whilst in custody although it would appear that the most recent adverse notation was in November 2008.  
     
      
      Sentence  
      
    69 I am satisfied that nothing other than terms of imprisonment will suffice in this case to meet the objectives of sentencing as provided for in s 3A of the Sentencing Act. Neither Mr Ierace nor Mr Young sought to persuade me to a contrary view. However, as I have sought to make clear, the sentences to be imposed on each offender differ both because of the view I have taken as to their level of culpability, the different features of aggravation and mitigation, and because of material differences in their subjective circumstances.  
     
      
    70 In so far as the question of special circumstances is concerned I am satisfied that the statutory ratio under s 44 of the Sentencing Act should be varied in the sentences to be imposed on both offenders, and in different ways, so as to give appropriate account to the need for them both to receive ongoing treatment and assistance in dealing with issues of addiction on their eventual release (albeit in different ways given Ms Mealey’s successful steps already to remain drug-free) and because it is in the community’s interest that they both participate actively in programs designed to achieve that objective. An extended period on parole will also ensure that they are supported in community-based services under the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service with a view to securing work and accommodation on their release and to promote their adaptation to community and family life. In Ms Mealey’s case I also recommend that Justice Health and the Probation and Parole Service be provided with a copy of Ms Cieplucha’s report with a view to ensuring that she is given access to educational and vocational programs appropriate to her level of intellectual functioning.

      2008/5371 REGINA v Michael John JACKSON 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender pleaded guilty to manslaughter arising from the death of Mohammed Kader on 28 January 2007 during the course of an armed robbery committed on an Indian restaurant in Petersham. The deceased was an employee of the restaurant. The deceased was actually killed by a co-offender, Webb, who has been sentenced for his murder: see [2008] NSWSC 1351. 
     
      
    2 It is unnecessary to set out the facts in any great detail. The offender and Webb agreed to commit an armed robbery and for that purpose stole a motor vehicle. Webb armed himself with a “club lock” taken from the vehicle and went into the restaurant. The offender waited in the vehicle initially. Webb walked to the far end where the deceased was washing up in a sink. An altercation occurred between the two during which Webb picked up a knife and stabbed the deceased. While this was taking place the offender entered the restaurant and stole the cash register. The two men fled to the motor vehicle and made their escape. Later the stolen car was located and the empty cash register found near by. 
     
      
    3 There was fingerprint and DNA evidence at the scene and telephone intercepts that linked the offender with Webb and the commission of the offence. The offender was arrested on 30 May 2007. While in custody he spoke by telephone to his de facto and police lawfully intercepted those calls. They contained material that indicated the offender’s involvement in the robbery. Webb was arrested on 4 June 2007. 
     
      
    4 The offender’s liability for manslaughter is based upon an agreement with Webb to rob the restaurant, Webb’s role being to threaten the occupants with a weapon while the offender took the cash register. The agreement did not include the offender foreseeing the possibility that Webb would use a knife to kill any person being robbed but he did appreciate the possibility that Webb would use a weapon to inflict injury upon some person during the course of the robbery but not with the intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm or death. It is a form of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. 
     
      
    5 It is clearly a serious offence, as it would have been even had no person been seriously injured. Persons working in shops, restaurants and such like are vulnerable to robbery offences because they are places where money could be expected to be present. Fortunately we have not yet reached the state of affairs where those types of persons are armed to protect themselves. The courts, therefore, must seek to protect them by sentences of sufficient severity to act as a real deterrent. Of course even though the offender believed that no one might be hurt and may have even hoped there would be no actual violence, he must accept both moral and criminal responsibility for the death of the deceased who was a victim of the robbery in which he was engaged. 
     
      
    6 The offender is aged 31 and is the father of 7 children. Two of those live with his one-time partner but that relationship no longer exists. He had a deprived upbringing and has suffered from drug dependency most of his life. He was using drugs at the time of this offence. He is of the aboriginal race. He has had little in the way of employment during his life. He told a psychologist that he wanted to avoid offending in the future and give up a life ruled by drugs. But so far that has not occurred notwithstanding attempts at drug rehabilitation courses. One of the problems has been that his ex-partner was also drug addicted and he fell back into that lifestyle whenever he lived with her. His real hope of reform apparently lies in moving away from Sydney. 
     
      
    7 He has a criminal record dating back to the Childrens Court for dishonesty offences. He has as a juvenile been subject to bonds, community service and a control order. There has been some minor violence in his record. In 1998 he was sentenced to imprisonment for stealing from the person. In 1999 a term of imprisonment was imposed for break and enter. He was given the opportunity of a bond in 2001 together with a short sentence for break and enter offences. In 2003 he was sentenced for aggravated break, enter and steal. He was imprisoned again in 2004 for burglary type offences. 
     
      
    8 A major aggravating factor in the present offending is that he was released to parole on 1 November 2006. Four days after this present offence he was arrested on other matters and returned to custody. He was sentenced on 22 March 2007 to a sentence including a non-parole period of 9 months to expire on 31 October 2007. His parole was revoked and he was to serve the balance of his term until 1 May 2008. He has been in custody at some stage in every year between 1998 and 2009. 
     
      
    9 The offender is a talented artist and some of his work is on display at a public school. He has completed a TAFE course in this regard. He has at various times while in custody completed trade and life-style courses. The offender gave evidence before me and described growing up in Redfern with alcoholic parents. He started abusing drugs from the age of 13 and by age 18 was using cocaine and heroin. He said that he started thieving in order to help support the family. 
     
      
    10 He is on protection while in prison as a result of giving evidence against the Fernando cousins many years ago. He was then aged 16 and since that time has always been placed on protection whenever he is in custody. There is no real hardship caused by his current protection although it does make it more difficult for him to participate in education courses. He reiterated what he had told the psychologist that he wanted to make a change to his lifestyle and believes that will be easier if he remains separated from his partner. I could not form any view about his prospects of rehabilitation at this time despite his hopes and intentions on release. The simple fact is that he is probably already institutionalised. 
     
      
    11 I accept that he is not normally of a violent disposition and perhaps even has an aversion to violence. That probably accounts for his giving evidence against the Fernando cousins who stabbed a young lady to death many years ago. I accept, therefore, that he is genuinely remorseful for the death of the victim in this matter. He is entitled to a discount for his plea of about 15 per cent. He was not the person who caused the death of the victim and his criminality is derivative.  
     
      
    12 One of the difficulties with manslaughter sentences is that they seem now to be out of kilter with sentences for other offences. The simple fact is that by parliamentary intervention and a reappraisal of sentences for murder by the courts, sentences for that offence have dramatically increased from those imposed before 2000. Yet by and large sentences for manslaughter have not increased in the same proportion. I mentioned this problem in R v Frazer and Spencer [2007] NSWSC 1449 when sentencing offenders who had participated in a serious home invasion. There was a valid argument that they would have been liable for a heavier sentence had the victim not been killed given the increased maximum penalty for aggravated break and enter offences and the applicable standard non-parole period. 
     
      
    13 Similarly in the present case the sentence for manslaughter has to be seen against the guideline judgment in Henry dealing with armed robbery offences. This offender would be liable under that guideline for a sentence well above 5 years simply for the armed robbery offence alone. It seems to me that a time must come when the range of sentences for manslaughter need to be reconsidered. But it is not appropriate to do so in this case. 
     
      
    14 Frazer and Spencer was a more serious case than this, notwithstanding that Spencer was not even present when the robbery occurred. He had been the instigator. That case involved entering a private home in the early hours of the morning while one of the robbers was armed with a loaded firearm. I noted in that case that I would have imposed heavier sentences but for what I perceived to be the range for similar manslaughter offences. 
     
      
    15 As I have already noted the offender was on parole at the time and this is a seriously aggravating feature of the offence. The Crown conceded that I should back-date the sentence to the date upon which his non-parole period expired being 31 October 2007. The offender did not suggest an earlier date. I pointed out to the Crown that I would be entitled to date the sentence from the expiration of the sentences he was serving having regard to the fact that his parole was not revoked by reason of this offence. However I will give him the benefit of the back-date suggested by the Crown on the basis of the application of the totality principle and to some extent as an act of leniency. 
     
      
    16 Unconstrained by what I perceive to be the range, I would have started with a sentence of 12 years imprisonment. But it seems to me that the appropriate starting point is 9½ years. There is to be a discount of 15 per cent that results in a total term of about 8 years. There are no special circumstances other than arise from the fact that he will be serving this sentence cumulatively upon other sentences. This is notwithstanding the offender’s need for assistance to overcome his drug dependency. As I stated during the hearing, the difficulty for the offender will be to convince the Parole Board that he should be released at the expiration of the non-parole period. The offender will have been in continuous custody from 1 February 2007. 
     
      
       
       
       
      
    17 The offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 5½ years to date from 31 October 2007 with a balance of term of 2½ years from 1 May 2013. The offender is eligible to be released to parole on 30 April 2013.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BUDDIN J: The appellant challenges his convictions in respect of three counts of sexual intercourse with a child aged between 14 and 16 years of age. The maximum penalty provided by s 66C(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 for that offence is imprisonment for 10 years. The appellant pleaded guilty to the offences and was sentenced to terms of imprisonment which were ordered to be served concurrently with one another. Those sentences were entirely subsumed within a sentence which was imposed upon him for an unrelated offence of armed robbery. The applicant is still in custody serving that sentence although the sentences for the sexual offences have now expired. 
     
      
    2 The sole ground of appeal is that the appellant has suffered a miscarriage of justice. Since the Crown has quite properly conceded that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, I can refer briefly to the somewhat unusual background circumstances of the case. 
     
      
    3 An agreed statement of facts was placed before the sentencing judge to which it will be necessary to make some reference. At the time of the incident the complainant, MJW, was aged 14 whilst the appellant was 23. Between 8 pm on Saturday 27 November and 6 am on Sunday 28 November 2004, the appellant, MJW and a number of other people (including “JB”, a friend of MJW’s) sat in a park in Mittagong drinking alcohol and socialising. The appellant and MJW were unknown to each other prior to this night. At one point in the evening, the appellant and MJW walked away from the group to a darkened area of the park. As they left the group, JB asked MJW if she wanted JB to accompany them but MJW replied that she did not. JB later approached the appellant and MJW in the darkened area of the park and enquired as to whether MJW was “alright”. MJW said that she was “fine” and JB returned to the group. A short time later the appellant and MJW also returned to the group. 
     
      
    4 The group went to the Mittagong RSL club at around 11.30 pm and purchased more alcohol. They then returned to the park where they continued to drink. Some time after midnight the appellant asked MJW to again accompany him away from the group. MJW agreed and they walked to a secluded area of the park. There, the appellant put his jumper on the ground so that MJW could lie down on it. The appellant lifted MJW’s skirt and removed her underwear before performing cunnilingus on her (Count 1). MJW then fellated the appellant (Count 2) following which the appellant and MJW had penile vaginal intercourse (Count 3). At about 3 am the appellant left the park with a friend of his (AE). At about 5.30 am MJW awoke and discovered that cash and JB’s mobile phone had been taken from her bag. The bag had been left with AE whilst MJW and the appellant had gone to the secluded area of the park. MJW and JB went looking for AE’s house in an endeavour to retrieve the missing property. Another friend of theirs talked them out of doing so. It was against that background that MJW told JB that “I’ll just charge him with rape”. She then reported the matter to police. Semen was located on a vaginal swab taken from MJW. DNA analysis of the sample matched the appellant’s DNA profile. 
     
      
    5 The Agreed Facts contained the following paragraph: 
     
      
       
        
        About 8.40 am on 14 December 2005 [the appellant] was arrested at his home in Mittagong. At Bowral Police Station he agreed to be interviewed. During the interview he admitted the 3 episodes of sexual intercourse with [MJW]. He stated that [MJW] was a consenting and willing participant, and he was unaware she was under the age of 16 years. He claimed [MJW] talked about driving on a learner’s permit and he, therefore, thought she was 16 years old. 
        
       
      
    6 The appellant also gave evidence during the course of the sentence proceedings wherein he reiterated his belief as to MJW’s age. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        She, during the night, multiple times she’d told me how, well told everyone how excited she was about driving her Mum’s car and everything like that. Said that she’d had a learner’s permit…In my eyes you have to be 16 to get your licence. Like she didn’t look under the age of 16 either … 
        
       
      
    7 He also gave evidence, which the sentencing judge accepted, that the sole basis upon which he had pleaded guilty was because of legal advice which he had received, to the effect that his state of belief as to MJW’s age was no defence to the charges. He was not cross-examined about his state of belief. The sentencing judge proceeded to sentence him upon the basis that the acts of intercourse were consensual. 
     
      
    8 As I have said, the incident which gave rise to the charges being laid against the appellant occurred on 28 November 2004. As has also been indicated, the appellant was charged with these offences on 14 December 2005. He initially entered pleas of not guilty. However, on 24 May 2007 this Court delivered judgment in CTM v R (2007) 171 A Crim R 371. It was held that the common law “defence” of honest and reasonable mistake of fact as to the child’s age was not available as a defence to a charge brought pursuant to s 66C(3) of the Crimes Act. On 13 August 2007 having received the legal advice to which I referred earlier about the significance of that decision, the appellant entered pleas of guilty to the three counts in question. The sentencing judge was informed that the matter had been adjourned on several occasions to abide the outcome of the decision in CTM (supra). On 27 February 2008 the appellant was sentenced in the District Court. On 11 June 2008 the High Court, having earlier granted special leave, delivered judgment in CTM v The Queen (2008) 247 ALR 1. The High Court held, by a majority of 6 to 1, that the common law “defence” of honest and reasonable mistake of fact was available as a defence to a charge under s 66C(3). Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Crennan and Kiefel JJ, in a joint judgment said: 
     
      
       
        
        The common law principle in question reflects fundamental values as to criminal responsibility. The courts should expect that, if Parliament intends to abrogate that principle, it will make its intention plain by express language or necessary implication. We would, therefore, construe the legislation in the light of the principle of criminal responsibility stated at the outset of these reasons. An honest and reasonable belief that the other party to sexual activity is above the age of 16 years is an answer to a charge of a contravention of  
        s 66C(3). 
         The evidential burden of establishing such a belief is in the first place upon an accused. If that evidential burden is satisfied, then ultimately it is for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not honestly believe, on reasonable grounds, that the other party was above the age of 16 years. The outcome of the present appeal turns upon what is involved in the concept of evidential burden in the context of the particular offence, and the particular ground of exculpation. (at par 35) 
        
       
       
      
    9 The relevant principles which govern a case such as this have been stated in a number of cases. In Hura v R (2001) 121 A Crim R 472, Spigelman CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        The second ground of appeal alleges a miscarriage of justice. There are exceptional cases in which this Court will set aside a conviction following a plea. The relevant authorities have recently been considered in this Court in Toro-Martinez (2000)  
        114 ACrimR 533 
        . A number of circumstances have been identified when this Court will act, notwithstanding a plea of guilty:  
         
        . where the appellant ""did not appreciate the nature of the charge to which the plea was entered"": Ferrer-Esis (1991)  
        55 ACrimR 231 
         at 233.  
         
        . where the plea was not ""a free and voluntary confession"": Chiron (at 220 D-E).  
         
        . the ""plea was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt"": Murphy [1965] VR 187 at 191.  
         
        . where there was ""mistake or other circumstances affecting the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt"": Sagiv (1986)  
        22 ACrimR 73 
         at 80.  
         
        . where the ""plea was induced by threats or other impropriety when the applicant would not otherwise have pleaded guilty ... some circumstance which indicates that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt"": Cincotta (Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, No 60472 of 1995, 1 November 1995).

        Particularly pertinent for the present case is a frequently cited passage in the judgment of Badgery-Parker J in Davies where his Honour said:  
         
          
          ""If the plea was not entered into with full knowledge of the facts and as a genuine recognition of guilt, and if the material before the court of Criminal Appeal shows that there is a real question about the guilt of the accused, then the proper course must be to set aside the plea of guilty, to quash the conviction and to order a new trial.""

    10 It is common ground that, in the circumstances, the integrity of the appellant’s pleas of guilty must be called into question. In placing reliance upon authority of this court which was subsequently overturned, the appellant lost the opportunity of defending the charges which were brought against him upon the basis of his belief as to the complainant’s age. In so doing, he lost a reasonable chance of being acquitted of these charges. 
     
      
    11 I propose that the appeal against the convictions in respect of the three counts brought pursuant to s 66C(3) of the Crimes Act be allowed, that the convictions be quashed and that the matter should be remitted to the District Court for trial.

   SENTENCE 1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Steven Thomas Fox Ross, appears for sentence today request by way of video link (at his request) having pleaded guilty to three offences involving child pornography. They are; possessing child pornography, using a carriage service to access child pornography and using a carriage service to transmit child pornography. 2 On 15 May 2008 police went to the offender’s premises. They discovered a computer in the offender’s bedroom. It contained child pornography stored on its hard drive. A further search of the offender’s bedroom located four compact disks and thirty-eight floppy disks, also containing child pornography. The various items were seized and later examined by experts. The hard drive, compact disks, and floppy disks contained more than eight thousand images and videos of child pornography. 3 On the hard drive there were images and videos, ranging from children posing erotically with no sexual activity through to penetrative sexual activity between children and adults, sadism and bestiality. As well as tendering a statement of facts describing the contents of the hard drive in words, the Crown also tendered, and asked that I view, a compact disk containing a number of samples of the images and videos. Quite why the Crown did this is not easy to determine. It was not suggested that the descriptions were inaccurate nor was it suggested that I needed to view the images and videos in order to appreciate the gravity of the material. By publishing the material to me, the Crown perpetuates, arguably for no good reason, one of the harms involved in offences of this type, namely the publication of images of innocent children engaged in what I am sure they would prefer to have been kept private. 4 I viewed the images but was unable, for technical reasons, to view the videos. When I advised the Crown of this technical problem no effort was made to rectify the technical difficulties so I was left to wonder why the Crown thought it important enough to tender the CD in the first place.5 Many of the videos (which I did not see), and photographs, (some of which I did see), are clearly of a most disturbing nature. I take the following summary of the material from the statement of facts. One of the videos lasts for a full fifty-three minutes and shows six girls aged approximately twelve or thirteen years of age masturbating themselves, masturbating each other, kissing each other, urinating, wiping themselves after going to the toilet, dancing, and drinking what appeared to be alcohol and stripping. 6 On the hard drive there was also a ten second video showing an adult male ejaculating on a one year old boy, and a much longer video, fifty-two minutes, showing an adult male giving oral sex to a girl of about three years of age. Oral sex between a girl of six or seven years of age and an adult male was depicted on a seven minute video. There was a seventeen second video showing a young girl, about six years of age, being vaginally penetrated from behind by an adult male, and a two minute video showing a girl about five years of age being vaginally penetrated by an adult male. The title of this video says something about the sort of person who would view it. The title was “PTHC-Rape-pased-out 5yo gets raped.” 7 Also on the hard disk was a three minute video of a young girl about nine years of age who was blindfolded, bound by rope at her hands and feet, and made to give oral sex to an adult male. There were still images of a young girl about seven years of age performing oral sex on some type of animal. 8 As I have mentioned, I have taken these descriptions from the statement of facts admitted without objection. I have largely referred to the videos but there were many still images showing activity of the kind depicted in the videos. 9 The material found on the offender’s hard drive was disgusting, perverted and most importantly of all grossly harmful to the children involved in its production. There is one qualification to what I have just said. One of the videos on the hard drive was a cartoon. It depicted a young girl masturbating an adult male. Material of that type, although criminal, is of course not as serious as material which displays actual children. There is no specific child harmed by production created not from reality but from a perverted imagination.10 The material on the compact disks and floppy disks was broadly similar to that which I have described on the hard drive. Images showing children in sexual poses, masturbation by children on adults, vaginal, anal and digital penetration of children were all contained on the floppy and compact disks. Also depicted was an adult female performing oral sex on a male toddler about three years of age and children performing oral sex on each other. As with material on the hard drive, children as young as one year of age were shown. It is difficult to understand how anyone could desire to possess material showing the sexual abuse of children as young as one year of age. The fact that this offender did so is deeply disturbing. 11 As well as images, the offender also possessed stories in word form. The documents included titles such as “Perverts R Us” and “Stories Pre-Teen.” The material described sexual acts between adults and children but once again no specific child was harmed such as would have been the case if the material was in picture or video format. 12 The forensic examination of the hard drive enabled investigators to determine which websites the offender had visited. For obvious reasons I will not set out their names in these publicly available remarks on sentence. The Crown tendered the home pages of the websites and it is clear from that evidence that it was obviously made known to anyone who visited the websites that contained deeper within those websites was child pornography. The history file revealed when the offender had access to those websites via the internet. 13 The forensic examination also revealed evidence relating to the offence of transmitting child pornography using a carriage service. A peer to peer file sharing program was discovered on the offender’s computer and an examination of the cache of that program showed that the offender had transmitted 243 images of child pornography to other internet users. 14 The authorities are replete with statements of principle concerning the gravity of offences of this kind. The harm that these offences cause to individual children involved in the production of photographs and videos is enormous. So too is the harm to the community. General deterrence is of particular importance when sentencing for offences of this kind. 15 In this case, too, personal deterrence is of added significance. At the time of these offences the offender was on a bond. In 2006 the offender had been convicted of committing an act of indecency with a person under the age of sixteen and was put on a s 9 bond for two years. That circumstance is a significantly aggravating feature of the present matter. 16 The offender is thirty years of age. He was working as a car park attendant before his arrest. He lived with his mother in whose house he committed the present offences. The offender in evidence blames his father for his present predicament. He said he was abused by him physically, sexually and emotionally and that this has made him how he is today. The offender said that he began to view child pornography, downloading it from the internet in the following way. He said he was looking at internet pornography involving adults and saw an opportunity to visit websites concerned with child modelling. He said that out of curiosity he viewed that site and found himself going further and further into child pornography.17 However, he knew what he was heading for and he knew full well what he was doing. He explained that the reason there was some material on storage media other than his hard drive - that is the compact and floppy disks -was because he had managed to fill his hard drive. His evidence was that he started committing these offences out of curiosity but that it developed into a compulsion and he could not stop himself from accessing child pornography.18 It should not be thought, however, that the offender was powerless to do anything about his behaviour. It would have been a very simple matter for him to have taken steps to have prevented himself from committing such offences. He could, perhaps, have severed the internet connection to his computer, leaving the internet connection available to other computers in his mother’s house. That would probably have made it impossible for him to view and download child pornography given that he would no longer be able to do so in the privacy of his own bedroom. In fact, what has occurred in this case is that the offender fully realised and recognised the wrongfulness of his behaviour but chose - and I emphasise the word “chose” - not to discontinue it.19 The offender is a diabetic. It is important that he eat regularly in order to keep his blood sugars balanced. If his blood sugars are not controlled he risks both short term harm and even death as well as likely long term damage. The offender gave evidence without challenge from the Crown of the difficulties he has had with meals. For him, not getting a dessert is not a matter for disappointment but of potential significant harm to his health. It is not part of the punishment the offender must receive for his significant crimes that his health be endangered. It is a specific recommendation of mine therefore that he be placed immediately in a prison where his food intake will be regular and reliable. I ask that that condition be attached to the warrant in this matter.20 The offender pleaded guilty at an early stage and so he is entitled to a significant discount to reflect the utilitarian value of his plea to the State matter, and to reflect his willingness to assist in the criminal justice process in relation to the Commonwealth matters. For all offences I will reduce the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by twenty-five per cent. 21 It is remarkable, but accurate, to say that, seriously criminal as the offender’s conduct was, the offences committed were, as Mr Koznicki submitted, in the middle of the range for offences of this type. I make that finding having regard particularly to the nature and number of items the subject of the three charges. 22 It is unusual to see an offender prosecuted for the offence of transmitting child pornography. Downloading and viewing pornography of this type is bad enough but then to take active steps to republish some of that child pornography is in a very real way to become involved in the production of that material. 23 There is a significant overlap between the offences of possession and access, such that the extra punishment for the second of those offences does not need to be significant. However the extra punishment for transmitting some of that material will involve the offender in a significantly longer period of overall custody than otherwise would be the case.24 There is something of a technical difficulty which arises when sentencing for Commonwealth and State offences together. The statutory ratio of non-parole period to head sentence for the State offences is seventy-five per cent but in the case of Commonwealth offences the usual ratio is between sixty and sixty-six per cent. In this case I find special circumstances in relation to the State offence, such that the overall non-parole period bears a relationship to the overall head sentence as if the three offences were all Commonwealth matters. I do this not only because of the fact of the Commonwealth offences, but also because of the need for the offender to be closely supervised upon his release from custody if there is to be any hope for the offender avoiding any future sexual misconduct involving children.25 The sentences I impose are as follows: for the offence of possessing child pornography the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of two and a half years to date from 15 May 2008. That sentence is a fixed term because of the sentences I will now impose on the Commonwealth matters. For the offence of accessing child pornography using a carriage service the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for two and a half years to date from 15 November 2008. For the offence of transmitting child pornography using a carriage service the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for two years to date from 15 May 2010. 26 I set a non-parole period for the Commonwealth offences of two years, to date from 15 November 2008, which means that the offender’s non-parole period as well as the fixed term for the State offences expire on 14 November 2010 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.27 Now Mr Ross I will explain to you what I have just done. I have imposed sentences on you for those three offences. The first of those offences is the offence of possessing child pornography and I have sentenced you to two and a half years from 15 May 2008. For the other two sentences I have imposed those sentences mentioned earlier. What that means is that all of the non-parole periods expire on 14 November 2010 and that is the same day as your sentence for the State matter expires. That means, as far as you are concerned, that you will be in custody until 14 November 2010 and that you are eligible to be released to parole on that day, 14 November 2010. Whether you are released or not depends on the parole authorities.

      2008/12420 R v JEAN CLAUDE MAISSIN 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 11 March 2008, after a number of patients from the Rozelle Hospital raised the alarm, the deceased, David Zidansek, was found by staff seriously injured having sustained multiple stab wounds. Jean Claude Maissin was charged with his murder on that day.  
     
      
    2 On 6 February 2009 Mr Maissin was arraigned before Barr J and pleaded not guilty after which, with the consent of the Crown, his trial was set down without a jury pursuant to s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.  
     
      
    3 On 20 February 2009 Mr Maissin was re-arraigned before me and pleaded not guilty to the murder of David Zidansek on the ground of mental illness as provided for in s 22 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (“the Act”). 
     
      
    4 The sole issue in the trial was whether I was satisfied Mr Maissin should be acquitted of murder on the grounds of mental illness pursuant to the provisions of s 38 of the Act. Although at the time of the attack that resulted in the death of the deceased Mr Maissin acknowledged some appreciation that he had done the wrong thing, the Crown did not seek to persuade me that a special verdict ought not be entered in this case. No oral evidence was called in the proceedings either by the Crown or Mr Maissin.  
     
      
    5 By consent, and without objection, the Crown tendered a bundle of material containing a number of witness statements, a transcript of an interview between police and Mr Maissin and medical reports. Given the nature of the proceedings, however, the critical documents were the report of Dr Olav Nielssen dated 21 November 2008, tendered on behalf of Mr Maissin, and the report of Dr Rosalie Wilcox dated 22 January 2009, tendered by the Crown. 
     
      
    6 The reports reflect a uniformity of opinion to the effect that at the time of the fatal stabbing Mr Maissin was suffering from a mental illness that deprived him of the capacity to consider the moral or legal consequences of his behaviour.  
     
      
    7 Accordingly, as provided for in s 38 of the Act, I found Mr Maissin not guilty of the murder of David Zidansek by reason of mental illness and ordered his detention in accordance with s 39 of the Act until released by due process of law.  
     
      
    8 After entering the verdict I indicated that I would publish reasons in support of that finding. The balance of this judgment constitutes those reasons. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    9 Mr Maissin and the deceased were both involuntary psychiatric patients at the Rozelle Hospital. Hospital patients were housed either in wards or one of five self-contained cottages. Mr Maissin and the deceased shared a cottage with two other patients. According to Mr Maissin’s statements to the police and the interviewing psychiatrists, the deceased and he were friends. The two men spent each day together, walking, weight training, playing pool, attending various group therapy sessions and taking care of the household they shared. This evidence was corroborated by a number of other patients.  
     
      
    10 On the day of the killing Mr Maissin had breakfast and then asked the deceased to accompany him on a walk. They walked around the hospital grounds together after which they attended a group therapy session. The session lasted for about an hour. They then returned to their cottage to commence weight training.  
     
      
    11 Mr Maissin told the police in his record of interview that soon after commencing training he began to have negative thoughts about the deceased and started to feel anxious and paranoid. He said that he observed another housemate repeatedly glancing at him, and then over at the deceased, in a manner which suggested to him that his housemate wanted him to kill the deceased.  
     
      
    12 As soon as the training session concluded, Mr Maissin went to Ward 28 of the Rozelle Hospital where he informed the nurse in charge that he was feeling anxious and paranoid and requested medication. He was provided with 150mg of Seroquel, an anti-psychotic medication. He went back to the cottage and retired to his bedroom. He told the police that he was trembling and lay down in order to try and relax. He said the medication made him feel a little drowsy at first but that subsequently his adrenalin surged and he heard voices telling him to kill the deceased. He remained in his bedroom in this state for an hour and a half. He then decided to attend another group meeting hoping that this would help him to calm down. Instead Mr Maissin reported that he was “receiving signals” from other members of this group which he again interpreted to mean that he should kill the deceased.  
     
      
    13 After returning from this meeting Mr Maissin went straight to his bedroom where he watched television. He said he received messages from the television telling him to harm the deceased.  
     
      
    14 Mr Maissin said that when he eventually came out of his bedroom the deceased was preparing dinner for himself which he ate in the kitchen. When the deceased came into the lounge room Mr Maissin immediately got up and went to the kitchen where he prepared and ate his own evening meal. The deceased then went into the yard where a number of other patients were socialising. Mr Maissin could see them through the kitchen window. Mr Maissin said that he observed the other patients looking at him and then at the deceased in a manner that suggested to him that he should harm the deceased. While Mr Maissin was in the kitchen eating his dinner one of the housemates walked in and said something which Mr Maissin could not understand. He said that he then saw his housemate glancing from the kitchen knife, which was on the bench, over towards him.  
     
      
    15 Shortly afterwards the deceased came into the lounge room and sat down to watch the television. Mr Maissin remained in the kitchen by which time he had picked up the knife from the bench. He recalled thinking that he did not want to harm the deceased, however he thought that the other patients were signalling to him through the window to kill the deceased. Mr Maissin walked out of the kitchen, holding the knife in his hand, into the lounge room and then out into the yard past the other patients. He said that they must have seen him holding the knife and that he took their indifference to mean that he should kill the deceased and that he should do it that day. He then walked back into the lounge room and attacked the deceased. 
     
      
    16 Mr Maissin recalled that he and the deceased wrestled during which time he repeatedly stabbed the deceased who fell to the ground. He said the handle of the knife broke so he went into the kitchen and grabbed another knife and resumed stabbing the deceased. He said he was hearing voices throughout telling him to kill the deceased. He said the voice was his own telling him that if he did not kill the deceased the deceased would kill him. 
     
      
    17 After the stabbing, Mr Maissin then went into his bedroom to put some clothes on at which time hospital security officers arrived, having been alerted to the incident by the other patients. He was asked to take a seat in the kitchen while a number of nursing staff and a doctor attended to the deceased. He complied. When the hospital staff first reached the deceased he was still alive. They administered CPR which was ultimately unsuccessful. The deceased was pronounced dead at the scene shortly thereafter. At 7.30pm the police arrived and placed Mr Maissin under arrest. On autopsy, multiple stab wounds to the back and chest were cited as the cause of death.18 In order to determine whether Mr Maissin was fit to enter a plea and to stand trial on a charge of murder, he was interviewed by Drs Nielssen and Wilcox. He provided both doctors with essentially identical accounts of what occurred on the day of the offence together with information about his personal circumstances both prior to the offence and following his incarceration. Both doctors considered he was fit to plead to the charge. Both considered, however, that his capacity to reason about his actions with composure was grossly impaired, due to a belief that his actions were justified by self-protection and that he was relevantly unaware of the wrongfulness of his actions.

    19 Mr Maissin was born in 1972 and is currently 37 years of age. He moved to Australia from New Zealand with his mother and two older sisters when he was 14, following his parents’ separation. He left school at the end of Year 10 and took up an apprenticeship as a motor mechanic. He was in continuous employment until his first offence in late 2004. He also reported to both doctors that he began consuming alcohol when he was about 8 or 9. By the age of 11 he was consuming spirits and smoking cannabis. During his teenage years he also experimented with hallucinogenic “trips”. His drug use escalated in his early twenties when he began using anabolic steroids whilst engaging in body building, as well as amphetamines, cocaine and MDMA. Mr Maissin also recalled being admitted to hospital following a seizure which he was told was the result of a heroin overdose. 
     
      
       
      Mental health 
       
      
    20 Mr Maissin reported that he began experiencing symptoms about seven years prior to the death of the deceased which the doctors regarded as consistent with schizophrenia. He reported believing then that other people could read his thoughts and that someone was attempting to murder him. He said he felt compelled to harm others before they got a chance to harm him, which led him to start fights or arguments, eventually leading to the wounding of a friend, as a result of which he was hospitalised at Rozelle in 2004. He further said that because he felt threatened he frequently moved home and withdrew from social interaction. 21 Mr Maissin also suffers from epilepsy with generalised seizures. He had his first seizure when he was 27 years of age. At first his seizures were treated as drug-related until a diagnosis of epilepsy was made. Dr Wilcox noted that Mr Maissin had two epileptic seizures in the immediate period following his arrest and admission to Long Bay Hospital. She also noted that after these seizures Mr Maissin would often display aggressive behaviour which led on one occasion to an unprovoked attack upon one of the prison guards.  
     
      
      Prior offence  
       
      
    22 Mr Maissin gave an account to both doctors of the circumstances which led him to become a forensic patient at the Rozelle Hospital. He reported that in December 2004, following a week of continuous amphetamine use, he experienced frightening auditory hallucinations, which in turn caused him to develop persecutory beliefs about a friend as a result of which he attacked and wounded him. Within a few days he was arrested and committed to the Rozelle Hospital.  
     
      
    23 He was granted conditional release in March 2006. Despite the conditions of his release however he resumed taking illicit drugs and ceased taking his prescribed medication. As a consequence, he experienced previous symptoms consistent with his mental illness.  
     
      
    24 On 19 April 2006 he was readmitted to Rozelle Hospital after his father noticed that he was acting strangely. Within a month of being readmitted Mr Maissin left the hospital without permission and went to a friend’s house. He said that he again felt under threat from his friend, as a consequence of which they had an argument and he was taken back to the hospital.  
     
      
    25 The hospital notes also indicated that in May 2006 Mr Maissin reported receiving messages from his television and radio.  
     
      
    26 Mr Maissin told Dr Wilcox that three weeks prior to the fatal attack upon the deceased he had a visit from a former girlfriend. He had not seen her for six months prior to her visit. He said that while she was with him some distressing memories were triggered and he formed the belief that she had tried to kill him. He then believed he saw her smiling at the deceased in a “knowing way”. He formed a belief that the deceased and his ex-girlfriend had known each other previously and were perhaps conspiring against him. After she left he spoke to a doctor from the Rozelle Hospital about his thoughts and was prescribed 100mg of Seroquel which Mr Maissin was able obtain on request. He reported to the police and Drs Nielssen and Wilcox that he requested the medication on four consecutive days after that and that his negative thoughts about the deceased and his former girlfriend ceased.  
     
      
      Psychiatric evaluation 
       
      
    27 Mr Maissin presented to both doctors with unimpaired intellectual functioning and was able to maintain concentration and engage with them in a meaningful dialogue. While he did not exhibit all of the symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia, namely disordered speech or restricted emotion or amotivation, they noted other symptoms typical of that illness, particularly the existence of persecutory and delusional beliefs.  
     
      
    28 In light of the information Mr Maissin gave to the doctors and the information contained in his hospital records, both doctors were of the view that he currently suffers from an underlying psychotic condition, namely schizophrenia, which although exacerbated by drug use, was not causally dependent upon it. This is a diagnosis which is confirmed by Mr Maissin’s behaviour since his incarceration. It is the considered view of the doctors that anti-psychotic medication prescribed while he was an inmate of the Rozelle Hospital at the time of the killing was not sufficient to control his symptoms and, further, that because the treating doctors at Rozelle Hospital regarded his symptoms as primarily drug-induced, his sudden request for medication on the day of the stabbing was not recognised as a sign of relapse or a reason to review his risk status.  
     
      
    29 Dr Wilcox added a differential diagnosis of a delusional disorder of a persecutory type. According to Dr Wilcox: 
     
      
       
        
        “The reason for considering such a diagnosis is that there has been an absence of the typical deterioration of cognitive, affective or social functioning usually associated with schizophrenia.” 
        
       
      
    30 The doctors were also of the opinion that Mr Maissin suffers from a substance abuse disorder currently in remission. Finally, Dr Wilcox also noted that Mr Maissin suffers from generalised epilepsy. 
     
      
    31 So far as Mr Maissin’s future prospects are concerned both doctors were of the view that he should be maintained on anti-psychotic medication indefinitely and that caution must be exercised when reviewing his security needs at any time in the future. Dr Wilcox observed that an attempt to remove his anti-psychotic and anti-epileptic medications for diagnostic purposes resulted in several unprovoked violent incidents directed at staff and other inmates.  
     
      
    32 I note that Mr Maissin is on a management program that is aimed at his gradual reintegration into the ward population but that he should be closely monitored with regular risk assessments. 
     
      
    33 I accept Mr Maissin’s deep regret at having killed his friend as genuine. The tragedy in this case is compounded by the fact that the deceased was himself detained, being in need of psychiatric care, in the interests of the protection of the wider community. I understand that the deceased has family that survive him. The Court extends its sympathy to them.

   JUDGMENT1. Anthony Barrie was thirty-four years old when he first had penile/vaginal sexual intercourse with EF, then almost twenty years his junior; that was on 26 February 2006. Between that day and 14 April 2009 he had penile/vaginal sexual intercourse on seven other occasions. During EF’s absence in Brisbane he used the Internet to proposition EF’s fourteen-year-old friend TW. 2. Today he is to be held accountable for his criminal conduct, that conduct is encapsulated in an indictment charging two counts of sexual intercourse with EF, she then being between the ages of fourteen and sixteen years. He is further charged with using a carriage service to transmit a communication with TW with the intention of procuring her to engage in sexual activity with him at a time when he believed her to be under the age of sixteen years.3. When sentencing for the first offence I have been asked to take into account six further occasions of sexual intercourse between this offender and EF. As sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for these offences before this court committed by this offender harming these victims in the Newcastle community; R v Gladue [1999] 1SCR 688 [80].4. My initial task requires an assessment of what is called the objective criminality of the offences before the court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender known as subjective matters. The starting point for such assessments requires a sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the court relating to the offence and to the offender. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed, even if looking through a glass darkly.5. There is an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth. Section 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cwth) requires a sentencing court to take into account a number of specific matters. These s 16A matters have the advantage of providing a useful checklist of matters relevant to sentencing. Where a term of imprisonment greater than three years is to be imposed, as indeed must be in this case, the length of the non-parole period must also be determined. 6. Before any sentence in respect of State matters can be determined there are likely to be technical questions relating to; deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found, the Form 1 matters that I have just referred to and finally of course the ultimate length of the term of imprisonment or other penalty to be imposed. None of these things can be commenced until the primary facts are determined. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus, the protection of the community will also need to be determined, see R v Cuthbert (1967) 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby (1977) NSWLR 597, R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740.Facts7. A statement of facts has been prepared by the Crown. The defence does not contest any of the allegations made in the document. In those circumstances I am prepared to accept it as fairly setting out the facts and circumstances of the offence. In early 2006 the offender began to contact EF, then aged fifteen years, by means of the Internet. He was a member of the Internet café and gaming centre in Hamilton and another business known as “The Battleground Newcastle Internet Café”. He talked to EF online and later by contacting her on her mobile phone. He told EF that he was twenty-five years old, when in fact he was thirty-four years old. On 22 February the two met and he drove her to Blackbutt Reserve near New Lambton. There he began to talk about sex, asking her, “Are you looking for a boyfriend or sex at all?” She asked him how old he was. And he replied, “Twenty-five years old.” She told him she was fifteen.8. I turn now to the facts and circumstances supporting the first count on the indictment. On 26 February 2006 he again met her and drove to Mount Sugarloaf. After talking in the car for a short time he said, “Do you want to lay down on the grass or the blanket I bought? I’ve brought condoms and lubricant.” He led his victim to a secluded area where they had penile/vaginal intercourse. She experienced pain, he ejaculated into the condom. She bled from her vagina and remained sore for four to five days. She continued to meet him and they began an ongoing sexual relationship.9. The facts and circumstances supporting the second count, which is to be remembered comes towards the end of their relationship. During a night in March 2006 he and she visited a friend of his. While at the house she learnt his real age when another resident asked her what she was doing going out with a thirty-five year old man. That night EF drank alcohol and later had penile/vaginal intercourse with him. While in bed he said to her, “If I told you my real age on the Internet would you have met up with me?” And she answered, “Probably not.” The words “probably not” end these facts and circumstances relating to the second count.10. The other offences are more summarily summarised, they are to be found on the Form 1 document. Between 26 February and 14 April they had penile/vaginal intercourse late at night in the back seat of a white Daihatsu Charade while parked in the beach area of Memorial Drive at Bar Beach. The second of the matters to be taken into account is his having penile/vaginal intercourse with her late at night inside public toilets located in a public park in Ulrick Street, Merewether.11. The third matter to be taken into account occurs on 29 March 2006. He drove her to his home. Police as it happened attended having received information from a neighbour that he had a young person in his premises. He denied to police access to the premises, but they did note that he had red marks on his neck, no doubt consistent with what are commonly known as love bites. Police left the premises. The complainant says that when police attended she and he were engaged in penile/vaginal intercourse. Once police left he told her to get into the boot of his car - remember it is a Daihatsu Charade - and drove her from his premises.12. The fourth matter on the schedule is she and he had penile/vaginal intercourse on tables near a basketball court at Kotara High School during a weekend. The fifth matter on the schedule also occurs between 26 February and 14 April where they had penile/vaginal intercourse in his vehicle parked on this occasion outside his home. And the final matter on the schedule is between those dates he and she had penile/vaginal intercourse in the mining display area of the Newcastle Regional Museum. 13. On 14 April she went to Brisbane to stay with her father for a period of time. While in Brisbane she learnt that he had commenced phoning and emailing other girls. After learning this she ceased all contact with the offender and reported the matter to police. On 16 June 2006 police executed a search warrant at his home. There they located a letter in his bedroom written by EF detailing sexual acts that had occurred between he and her. At the time he claimed that the letter was from an ex-girlfriend aged eighteen.14. I come now to the third count. In March of 2006 TW was fourteen years old and in Year 9 at Kotara High School. Around March of 2006 TW was aware that her friend EF was involved in a relationship with this offender. One Wednesday afternoon TW and a friend of hers were walking home from school. They were both wearing school uniforms. EF alighted from a small white car that had pulled up beside them. She then introduced the offender, who was seated in the car, to TW. He later asked her, that is EF, how old TW was and she told him, fourteen.15. On 3 April 2006, and I note that is, I understand it, eleven days before EF travelled to Brisbane, TW received an email addressed to her. The email subject heading had “SX"". The text read, “Was wondering now that I’m single you interested in some casual sex?” It was of course sent by the offender to TW. TW did not know how it came to be that the offender had her email address. She printed out the email and later handed it to police. From April 2006 the offender made telephone calls to TW inviting her to his home for alcohol and sex. She had a caller identification facility on her phone and was able to recognise who it was that was calling her.16. On one occasion she recorded a portion of that conversation on her mobile phone, the reason for that may become apparent later. On every occasion she declined the offender’s invitation to meet him. On 29 May 2006 TW attended Newcastle Police Station with her uncle to report what was happening to the station officer. She made a statement on 25 July that year. On 18 October 2007 police went to the offender’s home, he was arrested in relation to the complaint made by EF, taken to the police station, thereafter he remained in custody. On 2 November 2007 police attended Silverwater in relation to the complaint by TW. He has subsequently been charged with matters that are before the court. 17. Consent is not an element of these sexual intercourse offences, that is because of a power imbalance in favour of the offender arising from his maturity, adult status and twenty-year age advantage. That is to say consent from young girls in those circumstances very frequently is very easy to obtain. Nonetheless it would appear the complainant was aware from the outset of the accused’s predatory interests in her. While it is unlikely she saw it as a predatory, and again that will become apparent later, he was forcing his sexual intentions upon her openly from the outset.18. She did not appear to be unwilling or even reluctant to engage in the activity he was proposing, that situation only highlights her need for protection intended by the law. In October 2006 this offender was charged with possession of child pornography, that of course has no bearing upon the criminality I am dealing with, but it does bear upon a finding in relation to rehabilitation prospects.19. In early 2007 he decided, in respect of that charge, to seek help from a forensic psychologist, Rhonda Murray. Prior to being sentenced for the child pornography offence he had seen her on some six occasions. He also indicated a willingness to engage in a CUBIT program, an intensive sex offenders’ program designed for prisoners serving a sentence. I will return to the question of rehabilitation prospects later in these remarks.Objective criminality20. From the facts as he finds them to be the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offences as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of this offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in these cases with the criminality of offences of similar kinds. It is in that way that some estimate of the objective seriousness of the criminality of these offences can be evaluated. Objective criminality has an important impact on the overall sentencing outcome. 21. I turn firstly to the Commonwealth offence using the Internet and phone, both of which are carriage services, for the purposes of procuring TW to engage in sexual activity with him. The circumstances of the initial contact between EF and TW on the one hand and the offender on the other, clearly demonstrate a predatory interest by this offender in girls barely past or perhaps not yet through puberty. The use of the carriage service, while it may be the first time he has been charged with this offence, does not represent an isolated incident. Indeed his first contact with EF had been via the carriage service. 22. Thus it is not an isolated incident of this form of abhorrent behaviour being engaged in by him for predatory purposes. His predatory intentions initially revealed in his sending TW an unsolicited email was further demonstrated by telephone calls commencing after 3 April and continuing a number of times. It is not clear from the facts the number of occasions he used the phone, but both use of the phone and email constitute use of a carriage service. In that sense this offence becomes an ongoing offence. The ongoing persistent nature of the offence, the offender’s predatory demeanour both are aggravating features of the offending.23. On the other hand the calls do not appear to be lurid or punctuated with offensive language or offensive imagery. He was known to the victim as being associated with her friend, EF. The gravamen of this offence is conduct by an adult directed at children under sixteen undertaken with the specific state of mind by way of encouraging, enticing, recruiting or inducing a child under sixteen whether by threats, promises or otherwise to engage in sexual activity; Tector v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 151 [90].24. The nature of the sexual activity should it be disclosed may reveal a more specific intent that may increase the criminality. Against that background the following may be noted:· There is no suggestion the length of any one communication or its tone was in any way overbearing, arduous or prolonged or contained threats.· In this case, however, the offence was ongoing in that there were numerous communications.· There was no threat made or money offered. However, there was a promise of alcohol extended.· The approach by the offender was speculative and predatory.· The age gap, and hence the power imbalance, was one of twenty years.· The recipient of the communications was fourteen years. The level of maturity and psychosexual maturity between a fourteen-year-old girl and one close to sixteen is substantial. On the other hand his victim was not in the tender age below, say, twelve years.· There was no attempt by the offender to hide his identity, cover his tracks or avoid detection.· The period of ongoing criminality in respect of this offence is to be measured in weeks rather than some greater measure.25. The objective criminality on the two indicted and 6 matters of sexual intercourse on the Form 1, involves recognising the criminal features associated with what is euphemistically called “underage sex”. Foundational to any argument is an understanding that children, including those between fourteen and sixteen, are psychosexually, physically, emotionally and in every other way immature. Related to this is the absence of experience in judgment making and understanding what will damage their psyche, body and mental and sexual health in the long term. Hence the protection offered by the legislation is not lost or vitiated by issues relating to consent.26. Sexual conduct, particularly predatory sexual conduct, that takes advantage of the range of immaturities for the sexual gratification of the offender is antisocial and hence criminal conduct of a high order.27. Also foundational to any assessment of criminality is the power imbalance that necessarily must exist between a mature, experienced thirty-four year old male and an immature, still developing, insecure fifteen-year-old girl. For a male in such a position to take advantage of such a girl for his own sexual gratification is antisocial conduct of a high order. It is for that reason that it also constitutes criminal conduct of a high order.28. In the first offence the sexual intercourse pursued was penile/vaginal intercourse. Notwithstanding the use of lubricant the complainant experienced pain, the intrusion of a fully adult male penis entering her caused her to bleed from her vagina, pain during the intercourse and soreness for four to five days. These are consistent with EF being a virgin when the intercourse occurred. The injury, pain, soreness and loss of virginity all constitute aggravating features of this first offence. His use of deceit with an immature and apparently gullible girl by lying about his age to reduce the age gap and increase his chances of enticing her to intercourse also constitutes an aggravating feature of his criminality.29. His taking advantage of her in circumstances where she has used alcohol in at least two counts is a further aggravation of the criminality I am dealing with overall in this offence. The offender’s denial of police access to premises in circumstances where they had come to rescue the complainant from him notwithstanding that he had the right to do so, nonetheless constitutes a feature of aggravation. See Form 1 item 3 of that offence; his humiliation of her by requiring her to hide in the boot of his car as they left the premises together with his concealing evidence from police I also regard as aggravating the criminality of the offence.30. His having intercourse with the complainant in public places where there were prospects of her being discovered during the act of intercourse are matters that no doubt were thrilling for him but aggravate the criminality of the conduct nonetheless. That occurs in five of the six Form 1 charges. There is only one reported occasion on which it is said he has worn a condom. The proved absence of a condom would constitute a serious matter of aggravation. It would constitute a threat against public health. Who is to know what diseases would be conveyed by him to her in the absence of a condom. The condom worn in the first count is mentioned. The facts on each other occasion are silent. My own view is it is likely he did not wear a condom. Failure to offer the victim protection must constitute an aggravating feature that needs to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In these circumstances of this case, because in the first offence one was worn, I cannot be so satisfied. My own view is it was likely he was grooming her to taking him without the condom.31. “Sexual intercourse” in the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) takes a number of forms. Some of those forms are more intrusive and invasive than other forms. In the circumstances of this case I regard penile/vaginal intercourse as constituting the second most serious of the potential forms of sexual intercourse known to the Crimes Act, all other things being equal. 32. While I reviewed the criminality associated with all eight episodes of the sexual intercourse, I remind myself six of them are to be taken into account when I sentence for the first offence. It is important that I acknowledge I am not sentencing for all seven offences, only for the first offence, but taking into account the criminality of the other ones. The sentence I set cannot be beyond what is available for the first offence standing on its own. Nonetheless the effect of taking all six matters into account will drive upwards the sentence for the first offence.33. The Chief Justice speaking for the Court of Criminal Appeal in a recent guideline judgment on the proper approach to Form 1 matters made clear the rationale for the increase in penalty. He said, the court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which an accused has engaged. The second is the community’s entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences, which are offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. Attorney General’s application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (2004) 61 NSWLR 305. 34. I regard the criminality of the six offences such that I will be sentencing this offender towards the top of the range I regard as being available for the first offence standing on its own. The second offence is not incumbered as is the first. The criminality of this offence stands to be assessed on its own. Nonetheless there will be an accumulation between the second and first offence to comply with R v Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610. Victim Impact Statement 35. I have received a victim impact statement. The material contained in the statement is not sworn evidence and has not been subject to cross-examination. To the extent that opinions are expressed in the statement I recognise they are not those of a qualified expert. The victim impact statement is not to be taken into account until the offender has been convicted. For the purposes of the exercise I regard the offender - although I will formally do so shortly - I regard him as though convicted.36. The victim impact statement comes from the primary victim of the first two offences. And I may, if I accept it as reliable, provide unsworn evidence as to the facts of the offences and their effect upon her. The function of statements such as this one is firstly to give victims the opportunity of being heard in sentencing proceedings by publicly identifying the impact of trauma visited on them by the actions of an offender. Secondly, it enables the sentencing proceedings to assist victims as they move towards some closure of grief, resentment and brooding arising from the criminal conduct of an offender. Thirdly, the victim impact statement contributes to an offender at least hearing first hand and perhaps gaining an insight into the impact his offending conduct has had upon the victim. And finally, it gives to the court some continuing reference of the impact crime has upon the ordinary men and women who are its victims.37. The statement commences with her giving her name, which is not a name that is to be published, and she says:  
     
      
      “I am here today” - and she is here by virtue of her statement rather than I think in person - “to give my victim impact statement. I am eighteen years old now but at the time of the crime that Anthony James Barrie committed I was fifteen years old. I believe I am a victim due to the fact that Tony knew I was only fifteen at the time and he still wanted to have sex with me. 
       
       
      I did want to lose my virginity to someone due to personal reasons and I was willing to lose my virginity to Tony, that was before I found out that he was thirty-four at the time. He had told me he was only twenty-five. By the time I had found out his real age we had slept together many times. 
       
       
      At the time I hadn’t really cared because I thought I loved him. Thinking back now I am still hurt to think that I trusted him to take something special and in the end he broke that trust by not telling me how old he really was and I can never get my virginity back. 
       
       
      When I moved to Brisbane to live with dad, Tony and I were still together and I found out from TW that Tony had been ringing her and trying to meet up with her and trying to have sex with her.” 
       
      
    If I can just interpolate, I have already exposed the unreality that the girl was experiencing because he was already contacting TW eleven days before she left. 
     
      
      “I felt very betrayed and hurt, every night I cried myself to sleep. I had accused Tony of cheating on me but he had denied it. I stopped believing TW until I heard a voice recording of him talking to her.” 
       
      
    And that may well explain the voice recording I earlier referred to. That night, that is the night she heard the voice recording, she had some alcohol and marijuana and cut her wrists. 
     
      
      “I still have the marks. I felt so betrayed by Tony, I trusted him. After that night I was doing pot every day and night. For weeks I couldn’t concentrate at school and ended up dropping out.” 
       
      
    The understatement, “I don’t think it’s right what Tony did to me. I hope he gets some help to stop from happening to any other young girls.”Subjective Matters38. I turn now to the subjective matters. As I said at the outset I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence but I am also sentencing this offender for it. Each offender coming before the court varies from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to the offender may offer to the court some explanation and insight into the commission of these offences by this offender or some reason why a more or a less sentencing outcome is appropriate.Background, family dynamics, relationship39. The offender is a single man, childless, aged thirty-seven. Since October 2007 he has been in continuous custody. He is the elder of two boys, his father works as a printer in Newcastle, his mother a sale consultant at a local shopping centre. The relationship with his father is distant, but otherwise the family environment during his upbringing was stable. He was a “loner” during childhood both at school and likely at home. The offender is close to his mother, who is caring and supportive and he regards her as “awesome”. The brother is also supportive. The offender was forced to leave home at eighteen when he was incarcerated for eight years; I will come to those circumstances shortly. There was a long term relationship between he and a mature lady between 2001 and 2005. Training, Education and Skills40. During his community based schooling he said he experienced severe bullying at school from the age of nine. Nonetheless he claims to have achieved a reasonable standard. He focused on studies and his life was books. His behavioural problems commenced during high school years. He was suspended in Year 10 for truancy. He did, however, obtain a school certificate although he was on “sick leave” during the last period so that he could sit the exams. He was advised not to continue after Year 10, not, I suspect, because of his intelligence but rather because of behavioural issues.41. In custody he completed courses in anger management, stress management, landscaping, computers and hospitality. On release from custody in 1997 he enrolled in TAFE doing vocational courses and volunteered as the TAFE newspaper editor during 1998. The courses were not completed, although as I understand it he intends to resume them or some of them during his time in incarceration for these matters. He has held a number of unskilled positions but never for longer than six months, although I thought I saw a twelve month period somewhere in there.42. Around the time of this incarceration he held two part time positions, that of bartending and working at a newsagency selling and delivering. He has been terminated from employment for occasions of drinking at work, rudeness and aggressiveness towards work colleagues.General Health43. He presents in court as somewhat overweight. He told Kate Seilder, a psychologist retained by the defence, he enjoyed good health. There is an absence of medical events, major illness or serious injury. There is nothing in his general health profile suggesting he should have any difficulties with rehabilitation.Psychosexual History44. Since childhood years the offender has had trouble connecting with others on an emotional or intimate level. He found his father difficult to communicate or connect with. He has used prostitutes for sexual gratification rather than seeking intimacy with a sexual partner. He has worked as security in the sex industry, which is more about sexual prowess than connection with others. There were other early signs his sexual development was not pursuing normal paths. At fourteen he was breaking into homes seeking out women’s lingerie for masturbatory purposes. He would wear women’s underwear for sexual gratification. He viewed pornography in substantial quantities, he was into voyeurism in his adolescent years, he used “glory holes” for anonymous oral sex from males, he was into casual sex and one night stands with women. He used prostitutes and sought impersonal sex with women.45. He has experimented with bondage and sadomasochism. So much of his sexual history is about sexual climax without connection, commitment or communication. For him sex is not about social or personal connection, it is about the experience of the orgasm. At the time of his arrest he was often spending several hours daily accessing a range of pornography. This included; child pornography, bestiality, “snuff” movies, homosexual material, but particularly young adult women engaging in lesbian or heterosexual sex.46. He claims a sexual interest in women over a wide range from older adults to post pubertal adolescents. Despite these charges and his past practices he claims not to endorse paedophilic sexual interests or homosexual attraction. Kate Seilder opined: 
     
      
      “Mr Barrie demonstrated a satisfactory understanding of consensual and sexual boundaries and he did not endorse attitudes consistent with sexual abuse. Mr Barrie also demonstrated some albeit limited?, understanding of victim impact, consistent with the fact that he has not engaged in offence specific treatment to date. 
       
       
      In summary Mr Barrie’s psychosexual history is indicative of someone who is socially isolated and awkward, emotionally needy, with poor intimacy skills and who suffers from intense emotional loneliness. His sexual interests and experiences are to some extent indiscriminate and there is strong flavour of sexual curiosity and experimentation in his history.” 
       
       
      While there is no evidence of hypo-sexuality per se, Mr Barrie appears to have a high sex drive, although it is suggested that this is associated with the use of sex to meet emotional needs. In other words Mr Barrie appears to use sex as a means of emotional coping, providing him perceived emotional connections and intimacy, which he craves. 
       
       
      There is evidence of Mr Barrie having engaged in deviant sexual behaviours, including; transvestism and voyeurism. And this has brought him into contact with the law on a number of occasions. Moreover Mr Barrie’s sexual history has involved violent and coercive sex, which has resulted in criminal charges being used. 
       
      
    47. I should indicate the source of that is Dr Seilder 29 June 2008 paras 28 and 29. From my remarks thus far it would be seen that I do not agree entirely with Dr Seilder’s conclusion. Further material of Dr Seilder that is worth citing, came as a consequence of a letter from defence solicitors to Dr Seilder, para 6, terms of reference: 
     
      
      “You requested that the following terms of references be addressed specifically in this report; 
       
      
    · Is there any significance in the fact that whilst Mr Barrie has committed further offences, he is no longer acting violently to obtain sexual gratification?  
     
      
      This is certainly positive, however, the reasons for this are somewhat unclear. For example, it may be that Mr Barrie has had regular access to sex through prostitutes and other casual acquaintances, that he has needed less violence to meet his needs. 
       
       
      Moreover it is unclear how much violence Mr Barrie has engaged in with his consensual sexual encounters. The fact remains that Mr Barrie has continued to engaged in inappropriate sexual behaviour that is indicative of problematic intimacy and social skills. 
       
       
      Moreover some of the pornography he has accessed has been of a violent nature. Therefore although positive I would not be confident that Mr Barrie would not escalate the violence in his sexual behaviour if situational environment or psychological factors encouraged. 
       
      
    · Is there any significance in the fact that between 1998 and 2006 there was no offending then  - “than” I think it should be -  the more“‘passive’”  offence of possessing child pornography? 
     
      
      Again this is positive and highlights that with age, maturity and reflection Mr Barrie has gained skills in controlling his behaviour and regulating his psychosexual state. However, as stated above his sexual functioning and social relationships are still disturbed and many of his risk factors remained unaddressed. 
       
      
    · Do you still recommend CUBIT program? 
     
      
      Mr Barrie requires intensive and offence focused treatment in order to address his criminogenic needs and to ameliorate his risk to the community. 
       
      
    I also note that Mr Barrie himself has expressed a motivation for change and he requires the need for treatment. Therefore I will still recommend Mr Barrie participate in the CUBIT program in order to address his sexual offending behaviour.· Would the recommendation of Dr Chenowith still be applicable? 
     
      
       
      It is appropriate that Mr Barrie access anti-androgen medication in order to reduce his sex drive. This in and of itself will not treat sexual offending behaviour, however, it will reduce the intense sexual drive that Mr Barrie may experience, which in turn will make it easier for him to engage in treatment and utilise the skills that he gains through this process.” 
       
      
    When before the court in May 1990 a report was tendered from Dr Bruce Chenowith, psychiatrist, that may establish the psychosexual profile I have been referring to is long established and of concern: 
     
      
      “He does not suffer from any mental illness. In all ways he is competent and responsible for his actions. He does, however, suffer from a personality disorders with features of low impulse control, particularly in the arena of his sexual desires, an inability to learn from past experiences and a need for fairly instance gratification where this is possible. 
       
      
    · Personality. Specifically compliant, polite and courteous he is basically a loner with a great fear of intimacy and close contact. Although he craves affection and a social network, he is quite unable to sustain the demands of such a relationship. He has no social skills with regards to the opposite sex and finds even talking with them very hard. It is an act of great courage for him to talk to a girl despite the fact that he has been in the Baptist Church Youth Group for two years meeting twice a week.” 
     
      
    I should interpolate here that this report was written when he was eighteen years old. 
     
      
      “He has never had a girlfriend and yet has taken enormous risks in obtaining sexual gratification from women’s underwear in houses he has broken into. It appears in sexual matters he prefers generally a voyeuristic solitary method of gratification through peeping and an underwear fetish. 
       
       
      I have never had any confidence that he could acquire a sensitivity to the feelings of women he may shock, offend or distress. Nor do I think that the consequences of his actions are at all a concern to him as a deterrent. 
       
       
      Unfortunately as time has gone by his trend is to physically attack individuals rather than move to solitary gratification of his needs. In other words he is becoming more of a threat to individual women, not less. He certainly does not appear to learn from previous experience but continues to act in a planned, premeditated way. 
       
       
      The other possibility that I am concerned with is that instead of doing violence he may be doing underage girls.” 
       
      
    Dr Chenowith’s remarks it must be remembered relate to events pre May 1990. While the violence may now be satisfied by his selection of Internet pornography there still appears to be a residual interest in violence. Presumably he is still being sexually stimulated in some ways or other by the violence he sees in the suspended reality of the Internet pornography.48. The offender’s evidence was that he stopped himself from offending for some more than ten years. For the last eight to ten years he has tried to better himself doing programs especially inside gaol.Alcohol and Drugs49. The offender first consumed alcohol socially with his father when aged thirteen. After release from gaol it would appear his drinking was within modest bounds. After the breakdown of his relationship in 2005 he returned to the parents’ home. He claims depression as a result of this breakdown. His consumption of alcohol increased between 2005 and his arrest. He would drink to intoxication initially each weekend. Before his arrest though he was drinking to the point of intoxication daily. There is evidence he has been dismissed from employment because of drinking at work. These are all clear signs his alcohol raises issues needing attention.Character and Criminal History50. The offender is a repeat offender. But given the fifteen year gap between offending it may be premature to describe him as a recidivist offender. He is a single man, unskilled in the workplace but on occasions willing to work. He appears to have led a life in recent times obsessed with sexual gratification. It would appear other interests have been sacrificed to this cause.51. His first court appearance appears to have been in 1987 before the Children's Court for assault. Since then he has answered to the court for; threaten to inflict actual bodily harm, act of indecency, entering enclosed lands, break, enter and steal (1988), escape custody, stealing (1989), break, enter and steal, break enter with intent to commit felony, malicious inflict actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse, common assault (1990) and use carriage service to access pornography (2007). As I said earlier this last conviction is only of relevance on the question of contrition and rehabilitation. I have also mentioned that for the 1990 offences he received an effective minimum term of seven or eight years.Attitude to the Offence52. The offender claims regret. The professionals who have seen him say his attitude is appropriate. My own view may be thought to be more cynical. It may be he is gaining some insight, but like the professionals I wonder if his all consuming interest in sexual gratification allows room for understanding the abuse of power and legacy of regret and damage he has left behind, particularly in the case of EF.Rehabilitation Prospects53. They are possibly better than they have been in the past. He has expressed a willingness to be involved in the CUBIT program; that program has a reasonably high success rate. I notice in the past he has agreed to participate in a prison based program notwithstanding his evidence to the contrary, but was placed out of that group and did not complete the course after some six weeks.54. The sentence he is receiving leaves the question of parole to the Parole Council. Parole will not be automatic. He will need to persuade the parole authorities he is safe to release to the community. His chances of doing it without completing CUBIT must be virtually slim if not nonexistent. His failure to cooperate in the program will see him excluded from it. The choices are now for him to make rather than the Parole Board. He has good family support, he has good health. While he has an alcohol problem there are courses he can attend to address that. Thus far his conduct in custody is without blemish. On the other hand there are, as I have noted throughout these remarks, real risks of recidivism.Custody55. He has been in custody on my score since 18 October 2007. There is evidence his custody is not mainstream. His custody is PRLA, which I take to be some level of protective custody with limited association. Placed in mainstream gaol because of his offences, he would be a prime candidate for assault. In his present custody there are limited programs for him, limited access to the library, only weekly access to the oval and the gymnasium. He says that he is anxious in this custody. Some allowance needs to be made for these matters but in respect of the first offence and the criminality to be considered there the allowance cannot be great, in respect of the other offences the allowance may be more weighted.Plea of Guilty56. The plea of guilty appears to have been entered on arraignment or shortly after arraignment. The plea to these matters was not early entered. But I have indicated that I will give a discount of fifteen per cent in respect of the pleas to the State matters. I have also taken into account the assistance given to the administration of justice to the Commonwealth in fixing the sentence that I fix. The State matters57. The maximum penalty for those is ten years for each offence. The Commonwealth offence: the maximum for that, that is the use of the carriage service, is fifteen years. In respect of the State matters I find special circumstances based upon his need to do the CUBIT program and the accumulation of sentences as I have determined. I intend to sentence for the Commonwealth matter first. I should indicate that matters such as deterrence I have given weight to as will be seen in the sentence that I have set.Formal Sentencing58. Would you stand up Mr Barrie? Mr Barrie for the offence that you between 1 March 2006 and 31 May 2006 at Eleebana in the State of New South Wales being yourself over the age of eighteen years used a carriage service to transmit a communication to one TW with the intention of procuring her to engage in sexual activity with you at a time when you believed her to be under the age of sixteen years, you are convicted. In respect of that offence you are sentenced to four and a half years imprisonment to date from 18 October 2007 and to expire on 17 April 2012. I set a non-parole period for that offence of two and a half years to expire on 17 April 2010.59. I am now sentencing you for the second matter. That you between 26 February and 16 April at Newcastle in the State of New South Wales had sexual intercourse with EF, a child then above the age of fourteen years and under the age sixteen years, for that matter you will be sentenced. But for the plea of guilty I would have set a sentence of four years imprisonment. When that is discounted it becomes a sentence of three years and five months imprisonment. I set a minimum term of two years to commence on 17 April 2009 and to expire on 16 April 2011. I set a balance of term of one year and five months to expire on 16 September 2012.60. I come now to the first offence. I convict you that you on 26 February at Mount Sugarloaf in the State of New South Wales had sexual intercourse with EF, a child then aged above fourteen years but under sixteen years. I take into account the six matters on the Form 1. For that offence but for your plea of guilty I would have set a sentence of six years imprisonment. That sentence is discounted by fifteen per cent and on my calculation that becomes ten months discount, which makes it a sentence of five years and two months. I find special circumstances for the reason I have given. The minimum term will be one of two and a half years to date from 18 October 2010 and to expire on 17 April 2013. The balance of term of two years and eight months will expire on 17 December 2015.. 61. The effect of the sentences that I am seeking to impose, just to make it clear for him, is five and a half years minimum term with a two year eight month additional term. 62. I recommend that he be accepted into the CUBIT program.

    3 HOWIE J: After trial by jury the appellant was convicted of a charge that between 1 January and 27 February 2006 she solicited the murder of [BB]. This is an offence contrary to s 26 of the Crimes Act 1900. It carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years and there is a prescribed standard non-parole period of 10 years. On 25 September 2008 Woods DCJ (the Judge) sentenced the appellant to a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 6 years and a balance of term of 4 years. The appellant has appealed against her conviction and the Crown has appealed against the sentence imposed. 
     
      
    4 The name of the victim should be suppressed because publishing it might identify the appellant’s children who are minors. One child, who gave evidence at the trial, will be referred to in this judgment by initials.  
     
      
    5 There were originally three grounds of appeal relied upon and in respect of which written submissions were filed. A fourth ground of appeal was added shortly before the hearing. One of the original grounds of appeal was abandoned at the hearing. Therefore the following are the grounds upon which the appeal was argued: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. Evidence of telephone intercepts (exhibit “F” at trial) was wrongly admitted. 
         
         
        2. The trial judge erred in law in failing to give the jury a Jones v Dunkel direction in relation to the Crown’s failure to call a material witness (Tammy Gumb) who could give relevant evidence in the case. 
         
         
        3. The verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        The evidence at trial 
        
       
      
    6 BB, the victim, was the former husband of the appellant. There were three children of the marriage. The appellant and the victim had separated in 2001 and there had been an ongoing custody dispute in the Family Court. As at February 2006 there was an interim custody order in favour of the appellant. However the eldest child, KB aged 13, was voluntarily living with the victim. The victim had weekend access to the two younger children. There was a further hearing in the Family Court listed for 22 October 2006. 
     
      
    7 On Monday 27 February 2006, the victim left home in his Landcruiser at about 3 am to attend his place of employment. He came across a number of wheelie bins placed across his driveway. He stopped the vehicle and alighted to remove the bins. As he was about to move the second bin, a man armed with a knife attacked him. The victim tried to enter his vehicle but was stabbed to the stomach. He was stabbed a number of times after he fell from the vehicle onto the roadway. The assailant entered the victim’s Landcruiser and it was driven away. It was later found burned out. The victim was left for dead but regained consciousness in hospital. The appellant and their son visited him there. KB went to live with the appellant shortly after the stabbing. 
     
      
    8 There was no dispute at the trial that the man responsible for the stabbing was Morgan Denning. He was unknown to both the victim and the appellant. Denning had been engaged to attack the victim by Chad Williams. There was also no dispute that Leigh Moyes acted as a get away driver and had been engaged by Williams to carry out that role. 
     
      
    9 The chief Crown witness was Williams. According to his evidence the appellant asked him to kill the victim and she was party to the planning of the attempt on the victim’s life. By the time he gave evidence against the appellant he had been convicted of an offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm arising from the stabbing and sentenced to a prison term for that offence. He had been given the benefit of a 45 per cent discount for the assistance he had provided to the investigating police including giving evidence against the appellant at the trial. 
     
      
    10 Williams lived at the Wyoming Caravan Camp that was owned by the appellant and her second husband. Williams had three children from a previous relationship who were living with foster parents. He was at the time of the offending living with a partner who was pregnant with their first child. Williams was employed as caretaker of the caravan park. His duties involved cleaning toilets, general maintenance and attending the office when the appellant and other staff were unavailable. After the birth of their child, Williams and his partner moved into a house adjoining the office rent-free. He was attempting to regain custody of his children and was keen to have stable employment and accommodation. 
     
      
    11 It was Williams’ evidence that in January 2006 the appellant asked him whether he was interested in “knocking off” her ex-husband. He declined to do it himself but said that he knew some people who might be interested. He agreed to make inquiries. Thereafter the appellant frequently spoke to him about whether these persons would carry out the murder. She told Williams that it was the only way she would get custody of the children. Eventually Williams decided that Denning would do the killing and the appellant agreed that he was to be paid $2000. Williams approached Denning in mid-January 2006 and asked if he was prepared to earn some money. He told Denning that the victim had molested a child whom Denning knew. Denning agreed to carry out the killing. 
     
      
    12 According to Williams, in February 2006 the appellant drove him in her vehicle to show him where the victim lived. She drove to the vicinity of the victim’s home but did not want to be seen by him. She gave Williams the registration number of the victim’s vehicle and told him what time the victim left for work. She showed him a photograph of the victim. 
     
      
    13 Williams gave evidence as to the circumstances surrounding the stabbing of the victim at which he was present. After the attack Williams assisted in burning the victim’s motor vehicle. He then returned to the caravan park and fell asleep. He woke up and saw the appellant entering the house. She said that her husband was in hospital. Some time later she asked him why the victim was not dead. 
     
      
    14 Some weeks after the stabbing the appellant’s husband told Williams to leave the caravan park for supplying drugs. He ultimately moved to a caravan park at Coolah near Dubbo where he was arrested on 6 September 2006. Police had identified Moyes as being involved in the stabbing and arrested him at the appellant’s caravan park. Williams learned that Moyes had implicated him in the stabbing and thereafter agreed to assist police. As part of that assistance Williams agreed to take part in telephone calls with the appellant that were to be recorded by police. As there is a ground of appeal in respect of the admissibility of these calls, they shall be detailed later. 
     
      
    15 On 27 February 2006 police took a statement from the appellant in which she said nothing that implicated her in the stabbing. During a conversation with police the appellant asked whether they knew who had stabbed the victim. When police asked her whether she knew, she replied, “No, its terrible”. 
     
      
    16 The appellant’s son, KB, gave evidence. He was aged 16 at the time of the trial. He said that he had met Williams when he was staying at the caravan park. He had made a statement to the appellant’s solicitor on 22 May 2008 in which he said that he had taken Williams to show him where his father lived. The Crown, with leave under s 38 of the Evidence Act, put to him that this was untrue and that he was lying to assist his mother, but he denied these allegations. He agreed that in June 2005 he had said that he was going to live with his father whatever happened, but that in the weeks before the stabbing he was thinking of returning to live with his mother. 
     
      
    17 The appellant gave evidence. She confirmed that there was a Family Court hearing in October 2006. She denied ever having approached Williams in relation to killing her former husband and was not involved in an agreement with him for an attack on the victim. She stated that she had no desire to seek his death. She said that at Christmas 2005 KB said that he was coming back to live with her. She claimed that after the stabbing she went with her son to the victim’s premises and he had shown her the way because she had never been there before. 
     
      
    18 A former police officer, now a private investigator, gave evidence as to his involvement in taking the statement from KB. 
     
      
       
        
        Granting a certificate. 
        
       
      
    19 In respect of two grounds of appeal, that relating to the admissibility of the telephone intercepts and the unreasonable verdict ground, the trial judge gave a certificate under s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. I do not understand why his Honour did so.  
     
      
    20 A certificate relieves the appellant of obtaining leave from this Court to argue a ground of appeal that raises a question of fact or of mixed fact and law. As a matter of practice this Court never enforces the requirement of seeking leave to argue a ground of appeal unless r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. 
     
      
    21 In Pellegrino v DPP [2008] NSWCCA 17; 243 ALR 556, Basten JA, with whom other members of the Court agreed, stressed the significance of the issuing of a certificate, because in effect it interferes with this Court’s jurisdiction to refuse leave. His Honour stated that such a course should only be adopted where the appropriateness of the appeal was not in doubt or where the judge feels that he or she has gained particular insight into the proceedings that may not be apparent to this Court. That was an application for leave under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act, but it seems to me that the same considerations apply in granting a certificate in respect of a conviction appeal. If a certificate is to be given in such cases as identified by Basten JA, it would be expected that the trial judge would indicate, either by reasons given in open court when granting the certificate or by a report to this Court, the reasons why the certificate was given. 
     
      
    22 In the present case the granting of the certificate in respect of the admissibility of the telephone intercepts does not seem to fall within either of the circumstances stated by Basten JA as justifying such action. The evidence was important but not crucial to the Crown case, despite what was said about the evidence in the summing up, to which I shall turn later. In my opinion neither of the bases upon which it was argued before the trial judge that the evidence should be rejected was of such significance that a certificate was warranted. One of the grounds involved a pure question of law, depending as it did upon an interpretation of the provisions of the relevant Commonwealth legislation. Leave was not required for this ground to be relied upon in this Court. 
     
      
    23 The other basis upon which the trial judge was asked to exclude the evidence was under s 137 of the Evidence Act. I have difficulty in envisaging any case in which a refusal to reject evidence under that section would justify the issuing of a certificate. That section requires the judge to perform a balancing exercise and this Court has pointed out that minds might reasonably differ in determining that balance: R v Harker [2004] NSWCCA 427. This Court would only reach a different conclusion from the trial judge if it came to the view that the decision was unreasonable or otherwise clearly in error within the principles in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499: see R v SJRC [2007] NSWCCA 142.  
     
      
    24 The Judge also granted a certificate in respect of the unreasonable verdict ground. If the certificate was granted because the judge believed that the verdict was unreasonable, this Court would be assisted by the reasons for that opinion having regard to any insight or advantage that the trial judge might have gained and that might be lost to this Court when reviewing the evidence on the papers. However, without reasons little regard can be had to a bald expression of opinion by a trial judge that the verdict was unreasonable or against the weight of the evidence. If the granting of the certificate does not mean that the judge considered the verdict unreasonable, there is no purpose in it. 
     
      
       
        
        Admissibility of telephone intercepts 
        
       
      The evidence 
      
    25 As indicated above, there were two bases upon which it was argued before the trial judge that the evidence of the telephone intercepts were inadmissible. Before this Court, Senior Counsel for the appellant sought to argue additionally that the evidence should have been rejected under s 138 and s 90 of the Evidence Act. When it was pointed out from the Bench that neither of these bases for rejecting the evidence was raised before the trial judge or investigated by evidence on a voir dire, they were abandoned. 
     
      
    26 Police had sought and been granted a warrant on 20 August 2006 to intercept calls made to and from the office of the appellant’s caravan park. On 30 August 2006 an article appeared in a local newspaper based upon an earlier police press release which referred to police investigations centring upon a person described as “a man of white European appearance, 1.83m tall and of thin build”. 
     
      
    27 Williams made three telephone calls to the appellant at the instigation of police after he and Moyes had been arrested. The first two were made on 7 September 2006 the day after Williams’ arrest and the third on 20 September 2006. Det Milton suggested that Williams should speak to the appellant in the conversation “as if you knew that [Moyes] had rolled”. In respect of the third of the calls the detective suggested that Williams should tell the appellant that he had been in custody for traffic matters. 
     
      
    28 An employee of the caravan park answered the first call from Williams and he asked her to pass on an urgent message to the appellant that “Leigh [Moyes] had rolled”. A few minutes later the appellant rang Williams. That conversation, included the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Williams: Um, I’ve just found out that Lee’s (sic) rolled on us. 
         
        Appellant: Yeah. 
         
        Williams: I've got coppers all over town fuckin’ chasin’ me. 
         
        Appellant: Huh uh. Why you? 
         
        Williams: Um… 
         
        Appellant: Why you? 
         
        Williams: Why me? Because I was involved in it, Freda. 
         
        Appellant: Listen, let me say… 
         
        Williams: Lee’s told ‘em 
         
        Appellant:… let me say something to ya. 
         
        Williams: Yeah. 
         
        Appellant: You keep your mouth shut, no one else will talk. 
         
         
        …………… 
         
         
        Appellant: All I can say to you is, you keep your mouth shut, they’ve got no DNA, they’ve got no nothing. 
         
        Williams: Mm hm. 
         
        Appellant: They’ve got no fingerprints. They’ve got…… 
         
        Williams: Yep. 
         
        Appellant: …nothing. The car was sold, the car's gone. 
         
        Williams: Yep, yep. Righto. Ah…. 
         
        Appellant: He can't ID. In the paper apparently they’re looking for a white European looking male. 
         
        Williams: Yep, all right. 
         
        Appellant: So does that fit your description?  
         
        Williams: No it doesn't. 
         
        Appellant: Right 
         
         
        …………. 
         
         
        Williams: …[Moyes] said that you paid some money….. 
         
        Appellant: Well I paid nothing. 
         
        Williams: ..he said – well, that’s what he said. He said that you’ve paid money, he said that fuckin’ I went out there and fuckin’ me and Morgan done the fuckin’ job. 
         
        Appellant: Well you, keep your mouth shut…. 
         
         
        …………… 
         
         
        Appellant: Um, anyway, like I said to you before, you can be guaranteed it’s all tight this end, mate. 
         
        Williams: Yep, yep, all right. So just keep me mouth…... 
         
        Appellant: Yeah. 
         
        Williams: …shut and….. 
         
        Appellant: Keep your… 
         
        Williams:…I should be right. 
         
        Appellant: Deny the whole thing. 
         
        Williams: Yep, deny it? 
         
        Appellant: Because there’s nothing on you. 
         
         
        ………… 
         
         
        Appellant: But if they do, if they grab ya… 
         
        Williams: You know what I’m like, I’ve done nothing anyway, Freda. Fuck you know what I mean? It’s all Morgan. 
         
        Appellant: You weren’t there, mate. 
         
        Williams: Fuck, I was only up the road, Freda, so it doesn’t fuckin’ matter, like for me. 
         
        Appellant: You don’t know nothing about it. 
        
       
       
      This was the conversation that the Crown chiefly relied upon to support the evidence of Williams. 
       
      
    29 The third conversation contained some material that revealed knowledge by the appellant of the role of Moyes and his connection with Williams when she referred to him as “your other mate” and when Williams said, “the one with the car that your talking about?” she replied, “Yes”. 
     
      
       
      Evidence inadmissible? 
      
    30 It was argued that the evidence was inadmissible by reason of s 55 of the Evidence Act. The contention is that the evidence was irrelevant as the conversations could not amount to an admission by the appellant of her involvement in the attack upon the victim. The argument before the trial judge and repeated before this Court was that the statements might only reveal knowledge by the appellant of facts that she learned after the attack. In effect the argument was that it was merely speculation that the conversations revealed the appellant’s involvement in the offence. 
     
      
    31 It was a matter for the jury to determine what the conversations meant by a consideration of not only what the appellant said but also the way it was said. Simply because there might be two competing interpretations of a conversation open to a jury, it does not follow that the evidence of the conversation is rendered irrelevant and hence inadmissible. Further, relevance is not determined by considering the particular piece of evidence in isolation from the evidence otherwise before the jury. It was open to the jury to conclude on all the evidence, including the evidence of Williams, that the conversations implicated the appellant in the commission of the attack upon the deceased. 
     
      
    32 The conversations, particularly that in the second call, were clearly relevant in that, in the terms of s 55, they “could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding”, being the appellant’s knowledge of, and involvement in, the attack upon the victim. Whether they would do so was a matter for the jury. His Honour, with respect, correctly determined that the evidence was relevant and therefore, prima facie admissible. Although, as the trial judge directed the jury, the statements made by the appellant in the conversations did not amount to an admission, in the sense that she directly acknowledged that she had solicited Williams, it did not follow that they could not be inculpatory of her involvement in the attack upon the victim and hence give support to the evidence of Williams. 
     
      
    33 It was next argued that the evidence was rendered inadmissible by s 137 of the Act. It was submitted that, because the evidence might be open to more than one interpretation, its probative value was outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice. This contention must be rejected. 
     
      
    34 In R v SJRC, referred to above, James J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        36 As I have already indicated, Judge Goldring held that evidence “must be unambiguous, if it is to satisfy the tests in s 137” and applying this principle and his view that the evidence was not free from ambiguity, he held there was a danger of unfair prejudice to the respondent which outweighed any probative value the evidence had.  
         
         
        37 In my opinion, in directing himself that evidence “must be unambiguous, if it is to satisfy the tests in s 137” his Honour was “acting upon a wrong principle” within the statement of principles in  
        House v The King 
        .  
         
         
        38 It not infrequently happens that evidence sought to be relied on by the Crown in a criminal trial is open to more than one interpretation or is capable of giving rise to more than one inference. However, provided that the evidence is capable of bearing the interpretation or of giving rise to the interference contended for by the Crown, the fact that the defence can suggest some other interpretation or inference which would be consistent with the innocence of the accused does not, of itself, show that any probative value the evidence has is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.  
         
         
        39 It is part of the function of the jury as the judges of the facts to determine what interpretation should be given to evidence they accept and to determine what inferences should be drawn from evidence they accept. It is frequently part of the function of the jury to determine which, if any, of a number of competing inferences should be drawn.  
         
         
        40 Some remarks made by McPherson J of the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal in  
        R v Berrill 
         [1982] Qd R 508, which were quoted with approval by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in  
        R v Kalajzich 
         (1989) 39 A Crim R 415 at 430 were directed to evidence relied on by the Crown as corroboration but are of general application. McPherson J said in part:-  
         
         
          
          “Whether it (the evidence in question) in fact bears the interpretation placed upon it by the prosecution is a matter of inference, and as such, a matter of fact for the jury to whose decision it should ordinarily be left…For the judge to withdraw it from the jury simply because some possible alternative inference is open involves a usurpation of the jury’s function 
          …” 
          
         
        
       
      
    35 Even if the probative value of the evidence was reduced because there might have been an alternative construction of the conversations available to the jury inconsistent with the Crown case, it did not follow that the evidence should have been rejected. This was because there was no unfair prejudice occasioned by the admission of the evidence. There was no basis upon which the jury could have misused the evidence or given it more weight than it deserved. Either the jury accepted that the conversations supported the evidence of Williams as to the appellant’s involvement in the offence or they did not. 
     
      
    36 In determining to admit the evidence, the Judge held that the evidence was “significantly probative” in that it could confirm the evidence of Williams. His Honour also found that there was no “realistic basis that the jury would misuse the evidence”. With respect, he was correct to make both those findings. But in any case there is no warrant for this Court to determine that it was not open to his Honour to reach those conclusions. 
     
      
    37 It must be noted that the Judge did not direct the jury appropriately in respect of these conversations but what he said very much favoured the appellant. In effect the trial judge directed the jury that they could not convict the accused unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the conversations pointed to her prior complicity in the attack upon the victim. After giving other possible explanations for the conversations and warning the jury to give careful consideration to these explanations, his Honour said to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ……………If you conclude beyond reasonable doubt the language of the accused in exhibit F can only point to prior complicity by her in arranging the hit on her ex-husband, this could assist you to conclude that she did utter the words of solicitation to Williams as he claims. However, if there is some reasonable explanation of exhibit F consistent with innocence, which you cannot rule out beyond reasonable doubt, you must find the accused not guilty. 
        
       
      
    38 I will return to the summing up when considering the unreasonable ground, but this direction elevated proof of the meaning of the conversations in effect to proof of the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. This was erroneous. The jury could have convicted the appellant by accepting the evidence of Williams beyond reasonable doubt without coming to any view about the meaning of the conversations. Clearly the Crown relied upon the conversations to support the evidence of Williams but it was not essential that they did and certainly not to the extent of proof beyond reasonable doubt. Such a direction was only warranted if the jury were being asked to convict on the conversations alone and independent from the evidence of Williams: that is on the basis that they amounted to a confession of her guilt. But that was not the basis upon which the evidence was placed before the jury. Despite the warning given to the jury about the danger of relying upon the evidence of Williams, it was open to the jury to convict on his evidence alone even without any support for his testimony. Had the trial judge rejected the evidence of the conversations, he could not then have withdrawn the case from the jury or directed the jury that they could not convict the appellant on the evidence of Williams. 
     
      
    39 I mention the directions given to the jury about the conversations at this stage because a complaint about the failure to reject evidence under s 137 cannot be considered without regard to what the trial judge said about the evidence in the summing up. That is because in the usual case appropriate directions to the jury can eliminate the risk of unfairness arising from the admission of the evidence. In the present case the direction did more than simply reduce the risk of any possible prejudice, it placed an unwarranted burden on the Crown to satisfy the jury of the overwhelming probative value of the evidence. 
     
      
       
      Breach of the statute? 
      
    40 The telephone calls were intercepted by the authority of a warrant issued under the provisions of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (Cth). For reasons that are not presently relevant the police suspended the monitoring of telephone calls under the warrant for a period of four days; the police referred to this as the intercepts being “red flagged”. The telephone calls between Williams and the appellant occurred after monitoring had been resumed. 
     
      
    41 The submission for the appellant is that the suspension of monitoring was a breach of the terms upon which the warrants were issued and rendered the intercepts, conducted after monitoring was resumed, illegal. It was conceded that there was no provision in the Act that explicitly requires that monitoring of calls take place over the whole period of the warrant without interruption or that prohibits the suspension of monitoring during the period of the warrant’s operation. But it was argued that such limitations upon the power of the police should be inferred by reason of the provisions of the Act and for policy considerations. 
     
      
    42 In my opinion there is no reason to read into the legislation any requirement or prohibition as contended for by the appellant. There is nothing in sections 7, 57 or 77 of the Act, the provisions of the Act which the appellant relied upon in support of this ground, that either individually or when read together, justify finding that it was illegal for the police to monitor further calls after suspending the monitoring of calls for a period during the operation of the warrant. 
     
      
    43 It was conceded by counsel for the appellant under pressure of argument in this Court that there could be no requirement placed on police to monitor telephone calls from the very moment that the warrant is granted. Obviously there may be a period of not insignificant delay following the issuing of the warrant until the opportunity arises to install the interception devices. The monitoring of calls may not be able to take place immediately because the target of the calls is not present at the place where the calls are to be intercepted or because some other factual circumstance has arisen which makes a delay in monitoring calls a reasonable course of action. It would be improper for police to commence to monitor telephone calls under a warrant when there is no possibility of any evidence being obtained. 
     
      
    44 Section 57 of the Act is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        57 Revocation of warrant by chief officer  
         
        (1) The chief officer of an agency must, on being satisfied that the grounds on which a warrant was issued to the agency have ceased to exist: 
         
          
          (b) cause the chief officer of any other agency that is exercising authority under the warrant to be informed forthwith of the proposed revocation of the warrant; and 
           
          (c) by writing signed by him or her, revoke the warrant. 
          
         
         
        (2) The chief officer of an agency may at any time, by writing signed by him or her, revoke a warrant issued to the agency after causing the chief officer of any other agency that is exercising authority under the warrant to be informed forthwith that the chief officer proposes to revoke the warrant. 
         
         
        (3) A chief officer of an agency who revokes a warrant shall cause: 
         
          
          (a) the chief officer of any other agency that is exercising authority under the warrant to be informed forthwith of the revocation; and 
           
          (b) a copy of the instrument of revocation to be given as soon as practicable to the Secretary of the Department. 
          
         
         
        (4) The chief officer of an agency may delegate his or her power under subsection (2) to a certifying officer of the agency. 
         
         
        (5) This section does not apply in relation to a warrant that has ceased to be in force. 
         
        
       
      
    45 The argument was maintained that, where monitoring is ceased for any period of time, “the grounds on which a warrant was issued …have ceased to exist”: see s 57(1). Accordingly, so the argument ran, the provisions of that section are then engaged to require the immediate revocation of the warrant under s 57(1)(c). This argument should be rejected as a general proposition. In a particular case the suspension of monitoring for a significant period of time might give rise to an inference that the circumstances upon which the warrant had been granted had so changed that the grounds upon which the warrant had been issued cease to exist. But such an inference does not arise simply because there has been a suspension of monitoring for any period however brief. There may be good reasons why the police should suspend monitoring temporarily even though in a general sense the grounds upon which the warrant was issued are still present. For example, the target may have left the place where the calls are being monitored for a brief period. There is every reason to encourage the police and other investigating agencies to suspend monitoring telephone calls during the period of the warrant when there is no reasonable possibility of evidence being obtained, but to permit the resumption of monitoring when the situation returns to that as it was when the warrant was issued. 
     
      
    46 The appellant argues that Parliament should be taken to have intended that all calls be monitored and recorded from the telephone in respect of which a warrant is issued over the whole period of the warrant. I am not prepared to make that finding. To the contrary, the interception and recording of private telephone conversations is such a very significant intrusion on the rights of a private individual, that I am not prepared to infer that Parliament intended that the monitoring and recording of calls would continue despite the fact that for some period during the course of the warrant there was no reasonable prospect of any evidence being obtained. It seems to me that, because the circumstances surrounding the monitoring of telephone calls can change from day to day and yet generally the grounds upon which the warrant was issued remain, the provisions of the Act should be read to allow some flexibility in the manner in which the police or other agency exercises the power to intercept telephone calls. 
     
      
    47 It may be that an argument could be mounted in a specific case that the police had acted unfairly in the monitoring and recording of calls under the warrant or that the suspension of monitoring may have worked a possible injustice to the accused. Such an argument would be considered on its merits by the trial court in the particular case. If some unfairness may possibly have arisen, it could be raised before the jury in the way that any other suggested unfairness in police investigation is raised; by evidence, addresses and, if necessary, comment from the trial judge during the summing up. It should be noted that there was no claim in the present case that the suspension of monitoring calls gave rise to any unfairness to the appellant. 
     
      
    48 This ground of appeal should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Failure to give a Jones v Dunkel direction 
      
    49 Shortly before counsel’s final addresses began and after discussions between the Judge and counsel as to matters to be addressed in the summing up, the following took place: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Defence counsel 
        : This is one of those cases where perhaps some particular caution needs to be expressed in directing the jury about the burden of proof. I’ll have a bit to say about that it in my closing address early on and Tammy Gumb hasn’t been called so a little bit of Jones v Dunkel there I think. 
         
         
        His Honour 
        : She’s the wife of? 
         
         
        DEFENCE COUNSEL: De-facto wife of Williams. Williams was cross-examined about her presence on the Monday morning when he says that Tammy Gumb was present in the house. I went back to the committal transcript where he was asked can anyone verify that [the appellant] visited and he gave her name. 
         
         
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: The only thing your Honour is this, Jones v Dunkel doesn’t actually apply in criminal cases any more. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: It doesn’t strictly necessarily arise. 
         
         
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: I mean we have pared back the volume of the witnesses to be called. If her evidence became a particular relevant issue then the Crown would [not?] have discharged its obligations by not [sic] calling the witness. I don’t mind one way or the other what the jury make of the evidence. The only thing is as a matter of law Jones v Dunkel at least in terms of Crown cases doesn’t seem to apply because of the Crown’s obligation to call all available witnesses. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: I think the notion that Jones v Dunkel doesn’t apply to the Crown is a different concept. I will have a look at that. 
         
         
        DEFENCE COUNSEL: Perhaps we can defer that to some point before your Honour’s summing up. 
         
        
       
      
    50 The cross-examination of Williams, to which defence counsel referred in that passage, was as follows:  
     
      
       
        
         
        Q. On the Monday morning, you have told us that [the appellant] came briefly to the caravan park and you saw her and spoke to her? 
         
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. Tammy was there as well wasn’t she? 
         
         
        A. In bed, yes. 
         
         
        Q. You were asked on an earlier occasion whether there was anyone, other than yourself, who could verify that [the appellant] had come to the caravan park early on the Monday morning; do you recall that? 
         
         
        A. Yes 
         
         
        Q. The question was this: 
         
         
         Q. Was anyone there who could verify that? 
         
         A. Yeah. Tammy was in the bedroom. 
         
         
        A. Yes 
         
         
        Q. Tammy, therefore, is able to verify what you say about that visit and its timing? 
         
         
        A. She knows that [the appellant] came to the house that morning. 
         
         
        Q. She knows that? 
         
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
      No further questions were asked of any witness, including police officers, about the availability or otherwise of the witness or whether she had been interviewed or had made a statement about the matter. 
       
      
    51 Although defence counsel had indicated to his Honour that the question of whether a comment should be made about the absence of the witness in accordance with Jones v Dunkel had arisen, the matter was never raised again with the trial judge, either before the summing up or after it. The Judge clearly had not declined the application or refused to make a comment. The matter had not been determined at the time defence counsel had raised it but had been deferred until after addresses at the suggestion of defence counsel. 
     
      
    52 In my view this is a matter where rule 4 should apply. Although counsel raised the issue, in a very off-hand manner “a little bit of Jones v Dunkel there I think”, he did not seek to argue the matter before the trial judge or obtain a ruling from him, after the issue was deferred at his suggestion. Nor did he complain when, understandably, the trial judge said nothing about the matter in the summing up. Either defence counsel had second thoughts about the request on reflection or simply forgot about it, of such little import was it in his mind. Defence counsel in his address to the jury never mentioned the witness or her absence, or the fact that some inference or criticism of the Crown case might be drawn by the failure of the Crown to call her. 
     
      
    53 Senior counsel accepted on the hearing of the appeal that, standing by itself, the failure to make a comment about the witness would not give rise to a miscarriage of justice. That being the case it is impossible to see why leave should be given to rely upon the ground. There was no attempt to explain why defence counsel had not raised the matter again after the addresses or at the end of the summing up notwithstanding that defence counsel at the trial was junior counsel on the hearing of the appeal. 
     
      
    54 In any event the question of whether a Jones v Dunkel direction should be given against the Crown in a criminal trial has most recently been considered by the High Court in Mahmood v Western Australia [2008] HCA 1; 232 CLR 397, a decision to which neither party referred the Court. This decision related to a trial on a charge of murder. One of the grounds of appeal complained that the trial judge did not give a Jones v Dunkel direction against the Crown in relation to the failure of the Crown’s expert witness to give evidence about stains of the deceased’s blood found in the accused’s pocket. The Crown asserted that the accused must have placed the murder weapon, a knife, in his pocket before disposing of it. Defence counsel in his address criticised this allegation as conjecture in light of the failure of the expert to be asked about the cause of the staining. 
     
      
    55 In dismissing this ground of appeal, the Court stated (footnotes omitted): 
     
      
       
        
         
        [27] It was neither necessary nor appropriate for the trial judge to direct the jury that an inference adverse to the case for the prosecution could be drawn because the presence of blood in the appellant's trouser pocket had not been the subject of evidence by the prosecution's witnesses. In the joint reasons in RPS v R it was pointed out that where a witness, who might have been expected to be called and to give evidence on a matter, is not called by the prosecution, the question is not whether the jury may properly reach conclusions about issues of fact but whether, in the circumstances, they should entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused. Similar views were expressed by Gaudron and Hayne JJ and by Callinan J in Dyers v R.  
         
        
       
      
    56 In R v Riscuta and Niga [2003] NSWCCA 6 at [103] in the judgment of Heydon JA (as he then was) this Court refused to apply what was said by Gaudron and Hayne JJ in Dyers v The Queen [2002] HCA 45; 210 CLR 285 at [6] to the effect that a Jones v Dunkel direction should not be given against the Crown. Heydon JA stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ………………….if the proposition in [6] represented the law of New South Wales, it would amount to a change in the law. In my opinion it did not in fact change the law, but constituted only a dictum. If the reasoning in that dictum were incorporated in a decision of the High Court, or in a decision of this Court, it would change the law. On an issue of this importance, which could radically affect the rights of accused persons to seek comments adverse to the Crown case, a change in the law should not be effected by this Court, but only by a decision of the High Court. It has not yet been effected by any decision of the High Court. 
         
        
       
       
      It seems to me that the decision in  
      Mahmood 
       in the passage quoted has effectively changed the law in this State. 
       
      
    57 In the present case, therefore, it may have been appropriate for the trial judge to raise with the jury whether the failure of the Crown to call the witness gave rise to a reasonable doubt about the truthfulness and reliability of the evidence of Williams but he was never asked to do so. The absence of such a comment in relation to a witness, who was only relevant to the credit of Williams, did not amount to a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    58 This ground should be rejected. 
     
      
       
       
       
      The verdict was unreasonable 
      
    59 This Court should approach a ground asserting that the verdict was unreasonable or against the weight of the evidence by satisfying itself on all the evidence at the trial that it was open to the jury to convict the accused. However, if, after having considered all of the evidence, having paid due regard to the advantage of the jury and having taken into account the atmosphere of the trial, this Court has a doubt about the guilt of the accused, that is a doubt that a reasonable jury ought to have entertained: M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 494; MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606 at 614 to 615. 
     
      
    60 It should be obvious from what I have already written that the Crown case was based entirely upon the evidence of Williams although the Crown relied upon the telephone conversations as support for his credibility. There is much that can be said, and that was said at the trial by both defence counsel and the trial judge, in criticism of Williams’ credibility both generally and in relation to the allegations he made against the appellant. Concern arose not only because of his criminal record and because of the discount he received to his sentence arising from his co-operation but also because he admitted that he had been untruthful with the jury during the course of his evidence. These were matters of which the jury would have been well aware. The Crown at the trial accepted that Williams generally would have had little credibility. 
     
      
    61 The jury were warned as to the doubtful reliability of Williams’ evidence both in the written directions given to the jury by the trial judge and in the summing up. The warning in the summing up occupied four pages of transcript and included the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        You should bear in mind that there may be unknown motives or motives which cannot be explored in cross-examination for which Chad Williams may wish to lie. I direct you as a matter of law that you should be sceptical about the evidence of any prisoner witness, such as Williams, who has gained an advantage from giving certain evidence. 
        
       
       
      The jury were told that it would be dangerous to convict on the evidence of Williams. 
       
      
    62 Of course in this case the jury’s evaluation of Williams’ evidence, in light of the warning that they were given about it, was critical. The jury’s superior position to this Court because they saw him give evidence must be acknowledged. Further, they saw the appellant give evidence and were entitled to assess and evaluate her evidence as against that of Williams, but having regard to the onus of proof. There can be no suggestion that the verdict of the jury may have been unreasonable because they failed in some way to appreciate the caution with which to approach the evidence of Williams. The directions and warnings given by the judge to the jury far exceeded what was required by s 165 of the Evidence Act. In effect the trial judge converted what were legitimate factual comments into directions of law. 
     
      
    63 Much of the submissions made by the appellant under this ground of appeal complain of the jury’s verdict in light of the directions given by his Honour. I do not understand that those directions bind this Court when it reviews the evidence for itself. For example, although this Court has to consider the nature and character of Williams as a witness and take into account appropriate warnings that would be given to a jury under s 165, it is not compelled to reject his uncorroborated evidence simply because the trial judge in effect told the jury that they should. Similarly this Court is not bound by the Judge’s erroneous direction that the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the context of the telephone conversations revealing that the appellant was party to the agreement to kill the victim. 
     
      
    64 The credibility of Williams cannot be considered out of the context of the issues arising at the trial and the nature of the allegation he made against the appellant. It might well be the case that generally speaking little reliability could be placed upon anything that he said and that in some circumstances no jury could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truthfulness of what he said. But the success of this ground does not depend upon generalisations made about Williams’ credibility despite that this was the approach taken by the trial judge in his directions and warnings. The fact that it might be dangerous for a jury to convict on the evidence of the witness does not mean that it was not open to them to convict upon it. The jury were not bound to take the same view of Williams that apparently the trial judge did. 
     
      
    65 Yet this is in substance the submission of the appellant. The argument is as follows: the jury were told that they could not rely upon the evidence of Williams alone such was his lack of reliability, the only evidence to support him was the telephone conversations, the jury were told that they could not use them to support Williams unless they could rule out any other innocent explanation, the jury could not have ruled out an innocent explanation, therefore it follows that they must not have obeyed the judge’s directions and acted unreasonably in convicting the appellant. 
     
      
    66 In my opinion it was open to the jury to accept the evidence of Williams beyond reasonable doubt despite his lack of credibility generally. The jury were entitled to act upon their own assessment of Williams in relation to the allegation he made against the appellant and were not bound to accept the judge’s assessment of his reliability generally. Clearly a highly relevant fact for the jury to take into account was the likelihood, or otherwise, of Williams deciding to kill the victim without being solicited to do so by the appellant. 
     
      
    67 There was some discussion of this question in both addresses and in the summing up. That is unsurprising because that question must have loomed large in the considerations of the jury. Although motive is a matter that is notoriously difficult to ascertain, the absence of any apparent reasonable motive of Williams to kill the victim and yet the existence of a possible motive for the appellant to wish him dead because of the on-going custody dispute would have been a matter of very significant importance to the jury in evaluating Williams’ allegation and the denial of it by the appellant. 
     
      
    68 The only possible motive suggested by the defence was that Williams, like the knights who killed Thomas Beckett in 1170 (an analogy used by defence counsel in his address), took it upon himself to rid the appellant of a troublesome husband either to curry favour with her so that he could obtain work and residence at the caravan park or because of his strong views about the custody of children. Such a scenario probably seemed as unlikely to the jury from their consideration of the evidence that they heard as it does to me from my review of the evidence in the transcript. 
     
      
    69 In regard to the issue of motive the appellant relies upon what was said by the trial judge to the jury deprecating the possible motive of the appellant to have her ex-husband killed notwithstanding that he was the applicant in pending proceedings in the Family Court concerned with custody of the children. But that was a matter for the jury and they were not bound to accept what the judge said about it. With respect to the judge, I would not so readily dismiss the suggestion that the appellant had a motive to wish to have the victim killed simply because she might have had custody of her children. The question of motive, and the judge’s findings on that issue, arise in respect of the Crown appeal on sentence and I will address that matter later. But there is merit in the Crown’s contention that the Judge’s findings on that matter were unreasonable. 
     
      
    70 The appellant’s argument is based upon an approach analogous to a circumstantial case. So it is argued that the jury could not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was no innocent explanation for the phone conversations, the jury could not have been satisfied that the appellant had a motive to have her husband killed, and the jury could not have been satisfied that Williams did not have a motive. But this is not a proper approach to be taken either to a circumstantial case or to the evidence in the present case. The focus is, and should have been at the trial, whether the jury could have accepted the evidence of Williams beyond reasonable doubt taking into account what they made of the phone calls and the question of motive of either the appellant or Williams to kill the victim. 
     
      
    71 This ground also requires this Court to form its own view of the evidence including the credibility of Williams having regard to the specific allegation he made against the appellant and taking into account its own view of the conversations. As I indicated earlier in this judgment this Court should give little or no weight to the fact that the Judge gave a certificate in respect of this ground when there are no reasons to explain why the certificate was given. The simple fact that it might be assumed that the judge had a doubt about the reasonableness of the conviction does not itself justify this Court usurping the jury’s function. 
     
      
    72 Even had there been no material capable of supporting the evidence given by Williams, in my view it would have been well open to the jury to accept the account he gave beyond reasonable doubt. This is so even though in other circumstances any evidence given by Williams might have been readily dismissed because of his unreliability. There seems to be no reasonable possibility that Williams would have organised and participated in the attempt to kill the deceased unless he was solicited to do so by the appellant. I have no difficulty in rejecting, as the jury must have done, the account given by the appellant’s son. 
     
      
    73 But as I have already indicated, the evidence of the telephone conversations could support Williams’ account even though they did not amount to a confession by the appellant that she had solicited him to kill her husband. As I have earlier noted, the directions given by the trial judge in relation to the use to be made of that evidence by the jury were erroneous in law and unduly favourable to the defence. Yet in accordance with those directions it can be taken that the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that in the two telephone conversations “the language of [the appellant]…can only point to prior complicity by her in arranging the hit on her ex-husband”. In effect they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that conversations revealed her guilt. 
     
      
    74 The appellant argues that it was not open to the jury to reject an innocent explanation for what the appellant said, for example in that it indicates knowledge that she had gained after the attack upon her husband. But this is not the way to approach that evidence. The approach taken by the Judge erroneously compartmentalised the evidence into three independent categories: Williams, the conversations and possible motive. The correct approach is to consider them together. That is in my view the only sensible way to assess the Crown case. 
     
      
    75 In any event at the request of the parties the recording of the second conversation was played at the hearing of the appeal. As might be expected, it is not so much what the appellant says but the way she says it that gives context to the conversation. In my opinion it was well open to the jury to conclude that she was giving instructions to Williams as to the way he was to conduct himself and reassuring him that from her side he had nothing to fear. The manner in which she spoke to Williams is consistent with his account of her being the person who was responsible for the plan to kill the victim and inconsistent with her later gaining knowledge of Williams independently determining to have her ex-husband killed. That is the conclusion I would draw. 
     
      
    76 It was unnecessary for the jury to reach that view beyond reasonable doubt as the judge instructed them. But I have no difficulty in finding that it was open to them to be satisfied of that conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. I am far from persuaded that the verdict of the jury was not open to them or was otherwise unreasonable or not in accordance with the evidence. With respect to the trial judge, who apparently had a different view, I am not left with a doubt about the appellant’s guilt. 
     
      
    77 This ground fails. Therefore in my opinion the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
       
       
      Crown appeal 
      
    78 As has been noted, the offence of which the appellant was convicted carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. The appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 6 years and a balance of the term of 4 years to date from 15 September 2008. On the face of it the sentence imposed so far falls short of the standard non-parole period that it strongly suggests that the sentence is manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    79 Williams pleaded guilty to an offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to murder. He received the benefit of a discount of 45 per cent for his plea of guilty and assistance and as a consequence was sentenced to a non-parole period of 7 years with a balance of term of 3 years. Denning pleaded guilty to the same offence and was sentenced after a discount of 40 per cent to a non-parole period of 6 years with a balance of term of 2 years 6 months. Moyes received an indemnity against prosecution for his part in the attack upon the victim.  
     
      
    80 The offence of solicitation is of such a nature that there is less scope for significant variation in the factual basis for the offence or the degree of culpability of the offender than might be the case with other offences to which a standard non-parole period applies. The intention of the offender will never vary; the death of the victim is always intended. The offence will always be unsuccessful in achieving its intended result. One exceptional mitigating factor would be where the offender having solicited the killing of another later, on reflection, takes action to ensure that the murder does not take place. But generally it will be unusual to find a case of solicitation that is not premeditated. There can be variations in the role played by the offender, so that, for example, it may be less serious if the offender is merely the go-between for the principal and the would-be killer. But again given the nature of the offence, in the normal case the fact that the offender was not the instigator will not be significantly mitigating. 
     
      
    81 There can of course be variations in the motive or reason for which a person seeks to have another murdered but, given the intended consequence of the offender’s actions, there generally can be little mitigation found in the purpose behind the solicitation. An exceptional mitigating factor might be that the offence is a result of provocation or that the offender suffers from some form of mental disturbance at the time of the solicitation. These are matters that reduce the offence of murder and, therefore, would be mitigating of the offence of solicitation to murder. But putting those matters to one side it is unlikely that the motivation for the offence will be mitigating. It is more likely that a particular motivation will be an aggravating factor. 
     
      
    82 I make these comments because, as will be seen, the ascertainment of the appellant’s motivation became a matter of crucial significance to his Honour’s determination of the sentence he imposed upon the appellant. With respect, in my opinion the Judge paid far too much attention to this factor and allowed it to distract him from a proper evaluation of the appellant’s criminality. Ultimately it became decisive in his decision to depart from the standard non-parole period notwithstanding that he acknowledged the seriousness of the appellant’s offending. 
     
      
    83 In the present case the verdict of the jury must have meant that they substantially believed the evidence of Williams as to the circumstances surrounding the attack upon the victim. Because the appellant denied her involvement in the attempt to kill the victim, there was no other account than that of Williams and, therefore, his account was the basis upon which the appellant was to be sentenced. 
     
      
    84 Therefore the appellant was to be punished on the basis that she had proposed to Williams that he kill the deceased some weeks before the attack, she repeatedly encouraged him to arrange the killing and she was aware of the arrangements that Williams had made to have the victim killed by Denning and the involvement of Moyes. She had agreed to pay $2,000 for the killing and had paid the sum of $200 for expenses. She had taken Williams to the vicinity of where the victim lived and gave him information enabling him to have the victim ambushed for the purpose of killing him. The intercepted conversations clearly reveal the appellant giving instructions to Williams as to the way he was to conduct himself after the offence and reassuring him that he had nothing to fear from her side. 
     
      
    85 The appellant was obviously the principal in the plan to kill the victim, she assisted in that plan being implemented and the killing was for her purposes whatever they might have been. There was a lack of remorse evident in the recorded conversations apart from that which can be inferred from her plea of not guilty. There was no suggestion of the appellant having any mental condition that might have explained her behaviour. Rather it was a cold-blooded plan to have a completely innocent person killed in what she understood would be a violent attack as he went about his normal course of travelling to work. 
     
      
    86 The victim suffered serious physical and psychological injuries as a result of the nine stab wounds he received to the back, neck and abdomen. He underwent surgery on two occasions and wore a colostomy bag for several months. The injuries amounted to very significant grievous bodily harm. There was a victim impact statement from a psychologist indicating that the victim was suffering Post-traumatic Stress Disorder that had left him unable to work. The appellant was criminally responsible for these injuries and she was to be punished for them even though she was not charged, as her co-offenders were, with inflicting those injuries. 
     
      
    87 The appellant was aged 45 years at the time of the offence and had no prior criminal record. Because of her denial of the offence, there was little material that could be put forward by way of mitigation. The effect of her imprisonment upon the children was not a matter taken into account by his Honour nor could it be. 
     
      
    88 The Judge found that there were matters of aggravation. These were that the solicitation took place over some time and involved planning, the involvement of accomplices, and the actual infliction of injuries upon the victim. His Honour found in mitigation that the appellant was a person of good character without any prior convictions, there was no prospect of further offending and that “to the extent that a motive can be discerned, it is to be regarded as a crime of passion rather than one of profit”. 
     
      
    89 Leaving aside the question of motive, the offence committed by the appellant was a very serious example of its kind having regard to the fact that the appellant was the principal who initiated the attempt to kill the victim, the cold-blooded nature of the intended killing and, as his Honour noted, the serious injuries inflicted upon the victim. This latter factor was unusual because most offences of solicitation come before the courts without any attempt having been made to kill the intended victim. This is usually because the person solicited is an undercover police officer or a police informant. 
     
      
    90 Having regard to the very serious nature of the offence, it was unlikely that the motive of the appellant in seeking the death of her husband was going to be a factor that would significantly reduce the objective seriousness of the crime or the offender’s criminal culpability. Yet, as has already been noted, the substantial part of his Honour’s consideration of the seriousness of the offence was taken up with this issue and it was ultimately decisive in his determination of the sentence to be imposed. 
     
      
    91 In considering this issue his Honour appears to have fallen into the error of converting the absence of a finding of an aggravating factor into a mitigating factor. For example, his Honour was not satisfied that the motive was to “derail or pervert” the pending Family Court proceedings. But this finding did not mitigate the offence because had the offence been so motivated this would have been a seriously aggravating factor and would have resulted in the offence being in the most serious category. Unless his Honour concluded that there was a motive that could truly be characterised as mitigating, the offence remained a very serious one; it simply was not as serious as it might have been had a motive been found that could be characterised as aggravating.  
     
      
    92 The Judge found that the motivation for the offence “remains obscure, even mysterious”. He noted that there was no evidence of material gain or profit under a will or any other financial motivation. Again the fact that no such motive was present did nothing to mitigate the seriousness of the objective circumstances of the offence. In this regard the Judge drew a comparison between Williams and Denning, on the one hand, and the appellant, on the other. In respect of the co-offenders, his Honour noted they had criminal records and their motivations were apparent; in the case of Williams a material gain in having steady employment and accommodation at the caravan park and in the case of Denning a desire to punish a person he believed was a paedophile. Apparently his Honour thought that each of those motives was aggravating. 
     
      
    93 His Honour’s error in the approach to motive is also clear in the underlined portion of the passage from his remarks quoted below. The fact that there might have been worse motives than a desire to be with one’s children does not reduce the objective seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    94 Having generally referred to the relevance of motive and having noted the maximum penalty for the offence and the prescribed standard non-parole period, the Judge then stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “However, I do not regard this as a case where the imposition of such a minimum term as the standard non-parole period in this case would be appropriate. 
         
         
        In particular, notwithstanding the objective seriousness of the offence, the absence of comprehensible motivation causes me to impose a lesser non-parole period than the standard non-parole period. In the range of offences involving soliciting to murder, there are commonly motivations involving the diversion of legal proceedings and financial gain. These are common ones. Love gone wrong is another. Hatred and revenge are other motives which do appear from time to time.  
        In this case, as I have said, it is difficult to discern a motivation but there are certainly worse motivations to crime than the desire to be with one’s children, even if that desire provokes, as the jury found in this case it did, seriously wrong conduct. 
         Furthermore, coupled with the factor to which I’ve just made reference, I regard the offender’s prior unblemished record as a special circumstance making it appropriate for me to vary the usual relationship between the overall sentence and non parole period. I add to that my concern that the attachment between the offender and her children will undoubtedly cause in her case serving a period of imprisonment of some length as this sentence will be, to be more oppressive that it would be in the case of other offenders.” 
         
        
       
      
    95 It is this passage that the Crown submits discloses an erroneous approach by the Judge to the sentencing of the appellant. The Crown argues that the Judge erred in finding that the offence fell below mid-range of seriousness, that his Honour erred in making findings as to the appellant’s motive which lessened the objective seriousness of the offence and that the sentence overall is manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    96 On behalf of the appellant it was submitted that, “although lenient” the sentence is nether wrong in principle nor manifestly inadequate. It was argued that, having regard to sentences imposed for this offence since the application of the standard non-parole period provisions, the sentence imposed was within the permissible range open to the Judge. It was also submitted that there were discretionary reasons why this Court would not intervene even if it found that the Judge’s discretion miscarried. 
     
      
    97 The manner in which a sentencer is to approach a consideration of the standard non-parole period has been well established in a number of decisions of this Court. There is a helpful summary of the steps to be taken set out in the judgment of Kirby J in MLP v R [2006] NSWCCA 271; 164 A Crim R 93 at [33]. They were recently approved in Mencarious v R [2008] NSWCCA 237. There is no need to set them out again. It is noteworthy, however, that his Honour’s sentencing remarks contain not one reference to any of the decisions of this Court concerned with the manner in which the standard non-parole period is to be applied, or any reference to the principles that have been stated in those cases. And yet this was sentencing after trial so that the standard non-parole period was more than merely a reference point or a guide to the appropriate sentence. The passage set out above is the only consideration of the application of the standard non-parole period and the full extent of the reasons for departing from it. 
     
      
    98 The second step set out in MLP is described as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Secondly, should the offence be characterised as being in the mid-range of objective seriousness? That task should be approached in the manner suggested by Simpson J, intuitively evaluating the objective seriousness of the offence and looking to those matters in s 21A, aggravating or mitigating, that relate to the offence (including the offender's state of mind). Matters in s 21A which form part of what is usually termed ""the subjective case"" of the offender are not relevant to the issue of whether the offence falls within the mid-range. If the offence falls within the mid-range, the standard non parole period should apply, subject to the remaining issues. 
        
       
      
    99 Nowhere in the sentencing remarks did the Judge attempt to determine the objective seriousness of the particular offence committed by the appellant in the way described in this passage. Although he listed the aggravating and mitigating factors under s 21A in one paragraph of his remarks, it was not in the context of assessing the objective seriousness of the offence as against an offence in the mid-range of seriousness. In any event one of those factors, that is the appellant’s prospects of reoffending, was not a matter relevant to a determination of the objective seriousness of the offence. The fact that an offender has no prior record, another factor mentioned by his Honour, does not of itself impact upon an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. Without determining the relevant factors, considering how they operated in the particular case and deciding what weight they were to be given in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, his Honour could never properly determine whether the standard non-parole period should be imposed or whether there were reasons to depart from it. 
     
      
    100 This was a fundamental error in the approach taken by his Honour and clearly caused his discretion to miscarry. It explains why the sentence falls so far short of the standard non-parole period and the objective seriousness of the offence. As indicated above, putting aside the question of motive, the appellant’s culpability was great and the objective seriousness of the offence was high. It was significantly above mid-range of seriousness having regard to the appellant’s conduct and the consequences of the offence. It remained so even accepting that the appellant’s motive was a desire to remain with her children. That was not, in my opinion, a motive that was capable of mitigating the seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    101 Yet it was the finding, or lack of finding, as to motive that was used by his Honour to depart from the standard non-parole period in the following passage of the remarks: 
     
      
       
        
         
        In particular, notwithstanding the objective seriousness of the offence, the absence of comprehensible motivation causes me to impose a lesser non-parole period than the standard non-parole period. 
        
       
      
    102 An offence is not mitigated by the fact that no comprehensible motive can be shown. Motive is like any other aspect of the circumstances surrounding the commission of an offence. The Crown is only required to prove the elements of the crime charged. If the Crown wishes to rely upon motive as an aggravating feature, the Crown must prove it beyond reasonable doubt. If the accused contends that the motive is a mitigating factor, the accused is required to prove it on the balance of probabilities. If the court cannot determine what motivated the offender, it follows that it is not a factor that can be taken into account in determining the objective seriousness of the offence or in any other way relevant to sentencing. 
     
      
    103 The Crown complains about the finding by the Judge in relation to motive. I confess to having some difficulty in understanding on the facts of this case the distinction between the motive, as found by his Honour, that the appellant had “the desire to be with her children” and a motive of interfering with the Family Court proceedings in the circumstances where proceedings in that Court for custody of the children were pending, the victim was the applicant, and the appellant admitted in evidence that the proceedings were costing her a large amount of money. A wish to be rid of the irritation and expense of proceedings commenced by the victim was not inconsistent with a belief on the part of the appellant that she would have custody of the children regardless of the pending proceedings. 
     
      
    104 Nor do I understand why the motivation of the appellant, however mysterious it might have been, in wanting to retain custody of her children was any less serious than that attributed to Williams in wanting to ensure a stable life so that he could persuade the authorities to return his children. Yet his Honour disregarded the sentence imposed upon Williams on the basis that his motive was apparent and he had a criminal record. But Williams was given the same sentence as the appellant and a greater non-parole period notwithstanding that he received a 45 per cent discount for assistance. Whatever be the extent and nature of Williams’ criminal record, I do not understand how it could have justified such a disparity between the sentence imposed upon him and that imposed upon the appellant when her criminality was significantly greater than his. 
     
      
    105 Of course the purpose of a Crown appeal is not to redress disparity and I do not take into account the substantial disparity between the sentence imposed upon the appellant and that imposed upon her co-offenders in determining whether error has been shown or whether this Court should intervene. But the discrepancy is so great that it should have alerted his Honour to the possibility that his discretion had miscarried in relation to the sentence he intended to impose upon the appellant. 
     
      
    106 I can well understand the Crown’s dissatisfaction with the findings made by his Honour about the motive of the appellant. But as I consider that the sentencing discretion miscarried, it is unnecessary to determine that matter. I would myself have made a different factual finding, even beyond reasonable doubt, but as this is a Crown appeal the appellant will receive the benefit of the finding that she did not solicit the victim’s murder in order to defeat his proceedings in the Family Court. 
     
      
    107 Because the Judge failed to determine the objective seriousness of the offence as he was required to do in order to consider where it stood against a mid-range offence and because he erroneously used motive as a mitigating factor to depart from the standard non-parole period, his discretion miscarried. I have already stated my opinion that the offence was above mid-range in objective seriousness even if I accept that her motive was not an aggravating factor. 
     
      
    108 The next step is to determine whether there are any factors of a subjective nature that may indicate that there should be a departure from the standard non-parole period. The Judge found that there was no likelihood of reoffending and that the appellant was of good character. Those two findings are, having regard to the nature of the offence and its seriousness, of little weight. They would not themselves indicate that a non-parole period of less than the standard non-parole period was appropriate. 
     
      
    109 The next question is whether there are special circumstances. The answer to that question depends upon whether there is a reason to depart from what would be the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence. It is, therefore, necessary to have regard to what would be the parole period if the standard non-parole period applied, there being up to this stage no reason to depart from the standard non-parole period so as to impose a lesser minimum term. 
     
      
    110 Were I sentencing the appellant afresh and unconstrained by the fact that this is a Crown appeal, I would have imposed a non-parole period above the standard prescribed, because the objective seriousness of the offence was significantly greater than mid-range. This is notwithstanding the mitigating factors of her good character and prospects for rehabilitation. I would have considered a non-parole period of 13½ years with a balance of term of 4½ years the appropriate sentence. Having regard to the length of the balance of term there would be no reason to find special circumstances as the parole period would be adequate for her rehabilitation after release and there is no other reason to reduce the non-parole period. I do not believe that the simple fact that the appellant had prior good character itself justified a finding of special circumstances. Nor do I consider that the impact upon her of being separated from her children a reason to reduce the non-parole period. 
     
      
    111 The appellant relied upon statistics derived from other sentences imposed for this offence. They are of very little, if any, significance. First, there are only 9 cases listed. Secondly, the statistics supplied to the Court do not discriminate between those cases where there were pleas of guilty. The least sentence imposed was two years and the highest 16 years. The non-parole periods imposed are remarkable given that there is a standard non-parole period of 10 years specified for the offence. Only one case received that sentence. One case received 6 years; this is probably the appellant’s sentence. The rest received less than 3 years one being as low as 18 months. As is usually the case when consideration is given to statistics for offences where there is a standard non-parole period specified, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that courts are apparently paying little or no regard to the standard non-parole period. In any event, the appropriate sentence is determined by a proper application of the standard non-parole provisions regardless of what the statistics reveal. 
     
      
    112 It should be apparent that in my opinion the sentence is manifestly inadequate to a very significant degree. It is less than half of what it should have been. Therefore, before this Court would exercise its discretion to refuse to intervene, there would need to be some matter of quite remarkable significance that would justify the Court staying its hand. There is not. A psychological report was tendered on this issue that reveals that the appellant is not dealing with custody well and it has affected her physical and mental health. That is unfortunate but it would be so whatever sentence the appellant was called upon to serve. The appellant’s children are suffering but the dismissal of the appeal would hardly ameliorate that problem. 
     
      
    113 An issue was raised at the hearing about the placement of the appellant at the Long Bay Correctional Centre and the distress that it caused the appellant because of the impediment it placed upon her seeing her family. The parties were given leave to tender further evidence on that matter after the Court had reserved its decision. The Crown provided material from an Assistant Superintendent at the correctional centre where the appellant was being housed that contradicted some of the material contained in the psychological report tendered in this Court. That material reveals that she has had almost weekly visits by her family since being housed in that establishment. In any event, the placement of the appellant is a matter for the custodial authorities but it does not appear that she is being unduly prejudiced by her current custodial situation. 
     
      
    114 As is normally the case in order to address to some degree the double jeopardy that attends a Crown appeal, the sentence I propose is less than I believe should have been imposed at first instance. It is the very least that can reflect the culpability of the appellant and address Parliament’s intention by passing the provisions relating to the standard non-parole period. There are no special circumstances. 
     
      
    115 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The appeal against conviction is dismissed. 
         
         
        2. The Crown appeal against sentence is allowed. 
         
         
        3. The sentence imposed in the District Court is quashed. 
         
         
        4. In lieu the appellant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprised of a non-parole period of 10 years and a balance of term of 3 years 6 months. The sentence is to commence on 25 September 2008 and the appellant is eligible to be released to parole on 24 September 2018.

   JUDGMENT 1. John Henry Tomkins has reached the sunset years of his life without a blemish on his record. He leaves in his wake community achievement after community achievement. For more than 55 years he has been a farmer and grazier on the lands his family tended since his ANZAC father was injured and returned to Pokataroo in 1916.2. John Tomkins took over the property in 1952. Since 1960 he has been a Justice of the Peace. He fought his first rural fire in 1947 and thereafter was actively involved in the Rural Fire Service as a president and vice captain. In all, 61 years of service. 3. He has been president and held various other positions in the Collarenebri Tennis Club during the past 50 years. He was heavily involved in the Collarenebri Air Service, and instrumental in that community building an air landing strip to open Collarenebri to air traffic. He was a foundation member of the Scouts, and built a hall for the Red Cross. As he approaches his four score years all the honours, achievements and fulfilments to be savoured by one who has lived his life so well must taste like ashes in his mouth as he stands today accountable for possessing four unregistered firearms, including a prohibited firearm, on the thirtieth of August 2008 at his home at Pokataroo. 4. As sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing contentions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence outcome for the offence before the court committed by this offender in his community.5. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offence before the court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to him, that is, subjective matters. The starting point for such assessments requires a sentencing judge to make findings of fact from evidence before the court relating to the offence and offender. The offender's rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed before any sentence can be made. There are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found, back up charges brought from the Local Court to be finalised in this court, whether this offence attracts a standard non-parole period, and finally, of course, the ultimate sentencing disposition. None of these can be commenced until the primary facts are determined. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as the primary focus the protection of the community will also need to be determined. (R v Rushby (1977) NSWLR 597, R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740, R v Cuthbert (1967) 2 NSWR 329).6. I mentioned the back up charge from the Local Court. There is a s.166 certificate with reference to a charge that the accused did not take all reasonable precautions to ensure that a firearm was safely kept, the accused being the person who possessed the said firearm, between 4.30pm and 5.30pm on 30 August 2008 at Collarenebri. That is an additional charge.Facts7. On 16 August 2008 police were searching a motor vehicle in Collarenebri. In that motor vehicle a firearm and ammunition were located. The driver, one Elijah Treloar, was charged in relation to possessing the firearm without a permit. When asked who owned the firearm Treloar nominated he had purchased the rifle from someone other than Tomkins. That was untrue. Police inquiries quickly established the firearm was registered to Tomkins. Indeed, as ultimately turned out, it was still owned by him. Two weeks after the arrest of Elijah Treloar police attended upon Mr Tomkins at his home Pokataroo. Pokataroo is some ten kilometres from the Collarenebri Township. Mr Tomkins told police that although Elijah Treloar was caught with the rifle he did not know how he came by it.8. The rifle was taken from his house. He did not sell it to Treloar. Mr Tomkins was having some renovations done to his home in July and August of 2008. That work had been given to Barry Treloar, Elijah's father. My sense from the evidence is that Tomkins held Barry Treloar in some respect and with some regard. Barry Treloar was seriously unwell. Consequently Mr Tomkins did not bring to Barry Treloar's attention criminal indiscretions he, Mr Tomkins, attributed to Elijah Treloar about this time, who also had access during this time to his house. 9. As can often happen with the elderly, their memory becomes less certain with the passage of time. Mr Tomkins gave evidence and he appeared to me to answer all questions, favourably and unfavourably, with attention to honesty.10. However, he appears now less certain as to whether he may, in fact, have lent Elijah Treloar the rifle. Given the account Elijah Treloar gave of the possession of rifle and Tomkins' first explanation to police, it is likely that the rifle was taken from a locked safe without Tomkins' knowledge. 11. During the renovations the keys to the gun safe had been moved from their regular secure spot onto his desk in the study. They were normally hanging behind a door in another part of the house. It is unclear to me whether this is the s. 166 summary matter of not keep firearm safe, or being kept in a locked safe where ammunition was also being kept. It appears the gun safe was in the same room as the desk. 12. In the gun safe there were seven firearms, all long arms, four of which were not registered, namely a bolt action rifle, a 410 Stirling shotgun, a 12 gauge shotgun, a Stirling .22 semi automatic with a sawn off barrel.13. Mr Tomkins readily surrendered all firearms, including the unregistered ones. His licence was suspended. His ammunition was seized. It was located on the top self of the gun safe, which I am now told is the s. 166 matter. The ammunition should not have been stored there. 14. Mr Tomkins was arrested, taken to Collarenebri police station where he was interviewed. He told police he had collected the unregistered firearms over the years. The working firearms were only used for the destruction of vermin and for humane killing of animals when the need arose. He told police the barrel had been sawn off the .22 Stirling semi automatic in 1989-1990, (he said in evidence), to make is safer to carry over the property in the four-wheel drive. He was not challenged by either police or prosecution on this account. 15. The prosecution case is the .22 Stirling semi automatic with the sawn off barrel constitutes the prohibited firearm for the purposes of the charge. 288 millimetres, (11 inches), of the barrel had been removed. That weapon was found to be in working order. 16. Mr Tomkins thought that the bolt action rifle was his father's and had always been on the property. The Stirling 410 shotgun as used to frighten birds from the sorghum paddocks; last used by him in the 1990 wet season, which he thought was the early 1990s. That 410 shotgun was described by him as a ""snake gun"" that his late wife used. She died two years ago. As I understand his evidence, he has not used it personally since the 1990s. 17. Mr Tomkins described himself as, ""not a shooter."" He used firearms only when necessary for pest control and compassion in disposal of stock. He spoke of how gruelling and soul destroying it had been for him to slaughter a large number of Merino sheep in the wool/sheep crisis of the early 1990s. I understand he used the .22 Stirling automatic for that purpose. If my understanding is correct, the barrel had been sawn off it by that time. 18. He was unaware of the requirement that ammunition be kept separate from the weapons. He secured both separately, but in the same gun safe; ammunition on the top self, the weapons below. He accepted that possession of unregistered firearms constituted a serious offence.19. He was aware there had been a number of amnesties for the purpose of permitting firearm owners to surrender weapons without penalty. He had taken advantage of one such amnesty to surrender a pistol. 20. He was aware, during his possession of these unregistered weapons, that it was unlawful for him to keep them while they were unregistered. In that sense his offending was a deliberate choice made by him at the time he selected which weapons would be registered and which would be not. Objective Criminality21. From the facts as he finds them to be, a sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offence as an essential step in a assessing the criminal behaviour of the offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality in the instant offence with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality offence can be evaluated. The objective criminality has an important impact upon the sentencing outcome. 22. In assessing the objective criminality of firearm offences, a useful starting point is to have regard to the principle objectives of the Firearms Act 1996 (The Act). They are to be found in s 3 of The Act as being:  
     
      
      “To confirm firearm possession and use as being a privilege conditional upon the overriding issue of ensure public safety. Secondly to improve public safety by imposing strict control on possession and use of firearms”. 
      
    23. The potential harm to the community that can arise from firearms being made available unlawfully to an unregistered possessor/purchaser is obvious that it needs no saying. Such a deliberate act would be an act of immense social irresponsibility.24. The firearms laws were enacted by Parliament to guarantee public safety through the close monitoring of weapons and to ensuring that only fit and proper persons have access to these lethal items. 25. The Firearms Act of 1989 was part of a national campaign to implement firearms control. In 2002 the Minister for Police introduced to amendments to what was then the Firearms Act 1996, which inserted section 51D (2) into the Firearms Act. That is the offence that Mr Tomkins has been charged with.  When introducing this amendment the minister said:  
     
      
      “Firearm related crime is a major concern for both police and the community. In July 2001 the Government introduced tougher firearm trafficking laws designed to inhibit the illicit supply of firearms and this Bill is a further strengthening of our laws.” 
       
       
      To crackdown on possession for the purposes of illegal trafficking proposed by section 51D will introduce an offence of possessing, by an unlicensed person, of three or more unregistered firearms. That will mean that criminals warehousing illegal guns for sale on the black market will be liable to up to 20 years in gaol if the firearm is a prohibited one or is a handgun, (See  
      Regina v Cromarty  
      (2004) 144 A Crim R 515;  
      Regina v Brown  
      (2006) NSWCCA 249).  
       
      
    26. There is no dispute, when assessing the objective criminality, Mr Tomkins does not fall within the target group referred to by the Minister when introducing s. 51D (2). There is no suggestion these weapons were housed for purpose of illegal trafficking. Of course, illegal supply can occur simply because some thief, for a person acting illegally, knows of the presence of the unregistered firearms or comes across them in the course of illegal activity and steals them for his or her own purpose. The supply the Minister was seeking to address by introduction of the legislation was an intended deliberate supply usually for money or some other specified benefit. Unlawful access to Mr Tomkins' gun safe was not contemplated by the section's sponsors. 27. Secondly, the likely access was low. As the facts of the case reveal, it was a possibility, but given the remoteness of the property and the usual housing of his gun safe key in a place other than where it was located at this time, the possibility was an unlikely one.28. As the activities of Elijah Treloar demonstrate, access to the weapons can be obtained by another party with or without permission. Having obtained assess, access to the gun safe became problematic. In this case while Elijah Treloar's conduct is indicative, whether surreptitious or authorised, it was a registered firearm that was in his possession, not one of the unregistered ones. 29. From Mr Tomkins' view point the unregistered firearms were secure in his gun safe. In the normal course of events, the keys giving access to them were kept in their own secure area. The four weapons the subject of the charge were secure in the gun safe when discovered by police. At the time they were discovered they were there because of their sentimental value, not because they are working weapons. 30. It would appear, apart from the 410 Stirling shotgun, the other weapons had not been used for almost two decades. The 410 Stirling had been used more recently by Mrs Tomkins prior to her demise. 31. The decision to retain the weapons unregistered was one deliberately made. 32. So far as s. 51D offences are concerned, any criminality associated with them can only date from July, 2002 when the section became operational, at least so far as s. 51D is concerned.33. There is no evidence suggesting three of them could not have been registered. The shortened Stirling was unregisterable. In terms of the specific objectives of s. 51D (2), the criminality exhibited by Mr Tomkins' possession of the unregistered firearms was low. 34. However, the Minister, when introducing section 51D, referred to its general purpose of tightening up the firearms legislation. Against this proposition the criminality of maintaining these four weapons unregistered as part of a collection is more significant because of the potential harm to the community35. The Government's legislative efforts to improve public safety by imposing strict control upon possession of firearms and close monitoring of them, was being ignored. 36. Again, in fairness, I am not suggesting any potential for unlawful supply by Mr Tomkins, but rather potential for unlawful access to his collection by some untrustworthy person or some criminal breaking into his premises. During the renovations, that potential was heightened by the presence of the keys to the gun safe being kept in or near proximity to it and presumably by the presence of workers, perhaps unknown to Mr Tomkins, taking part in the renovations.37. The Crown submitted while the criminality was towards the bottom of the range, it was sufficient to require a conviction and s. 9 bond. When asked what rehabilitation purpose a s. 9 bond would serve, given the facts of this case, she conceded it would serve no rehabilitation purpose. The other function of a bond is that it does constitute a form of punishment and, of course, a s. 9 bond could easily serve that purpose.38. The defence argued that the criminality was of such a low order that a section 10 discharge would not be inappropriate. Subjective Matters39. I turn now to the subjective factors. I am both entitled, and required, to do that. Not only am I sentencing for a criminal offence, but I am also sentencing this offender for it.40. Each offender coming before the court varies from other offenders who stand for sentence. Circumstances personal to an offender may offer to the court some explanation and insight in the commission of an offence for some reason for a more or less sentencing outcome being appropriate.41. At the outset of these remarks, I canvassed many of the favourable subjective features. References were tendered in his case. They would appear to establish Mr Tomkins is a committed family man with two children, a son and a daughter and grandchildren; generous in his support of others in the district needing assistance; widely popular; giving assistance to others in times of flood. 42. Shire Counsellor, Robert Greenway, described John Tomkins as, ""One of the most honest and respected persons I know."" Another referee described Mr Tomkins's conduct as, ""Out of character."" As I earlier remarked, the decision not to register these four firearms is a long standing one. If the referee meant no more than other criminal conduct is out of character, I accept that is true, but this particular criminal conduct, that is failure to register, is long standing. 43. Doctor Jamal Smit provided a report listing Mr Tomkins' past medical history. Doctor Smit observes, ""Mr Tomkins has been quite sick in the last 18 months and has an extensive medical history."" 44. Hypertension has been diagnosed since January, 2003. Kidney problems have been diagnosed since November, 2004. That condition exacerbated over the years until there was, ""no right kidney and at the same time there was a cyst on the left kidney, (September, 2007)"". In December, 2007 he experienced pneumonia in his left lung. In April, 2008 there was carcinoma found in the colon, which required an anterior resection. 45. Mr Tomkins' doctor observed it was in Mr Tomkins' best health to not engage in activities causing stress.46. During his evidence in court, others were present. They were not identified, but it seems axiomatic that those present were supporters of his and likely to be friends or relatives,Resolution of the Matter47. It was without argument in the circumstances of this case that this particular sentence is not one attracting the standard non-parole period. The offence is one, however, that can carry a maximum penalty of 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. 48. As can be seen from the maximum penalty of 20 years and the standard non-parole period of 10 years, this is an offence of a kind, which the legislature regards with considerable gravity. 49. The maximum penalty is a reflection of the seriousness with which the public as expressed, and understood by the legislature, regards particular forms of criminal conduct, (See Regina v Brown (2006) NSWCCA 249). 50. The maximum penalty is, of course, reserved for the worse category of cases. No doubt the worst categories would have features consistent with the description given by the Minister in the Second Reading Speech of targeting offending for which section 51D was designed to confront.51. This offence has none of those features. Although not argued before me, my mind has turned upon the question of whether a section 10 discharge can ever be appropriate for an offence, which carries a standard non-parole period after trial. Insofar as this case is concerned, I have already determined that the standard non-parole period does not apply to it. 52. Secondly, if the legislature intended to deny access, or limited access to s. 10, it would have made statutory provision, as it has done within the Motor Traffic and PCA legislation. That it has not done so is clear demonstration that there is no denial of access to a s. 10 discharge in an appropriate case. Section 10 contains the following relevant provisions heading ""Dismissal Of Charges and Conditional Discharge of Offender"". 
     
      
      (1) without proceeding to conviction a court that finds a person guilty of an offence may make one of the following orders:  
       
       (a) an order directing that the relevant charge be discharged. 
        
       (b) an order discharging the person on condition that person enter in to a good behaviour bond for a term not exceeding two years. 
        
       (c) an order discharging the person on condition that the person enter in to an agreement to participate in an intervention program and to comply with any intervention program arising out of the program. 
       
      (2) an order referred to in subsection 1(b) may be made if the court is satisfied:  
       
       (a) that it is inexpedient to inflict any punishment (other than nominal punishment) on the person, or 
        
       (b) that it is expedient to release the person on a good behaviour bond 
        
       (2)(a) an order referred to subsection 1C may be made if the court is satisfied that it would reduce the likelihood of the person committing further offences by promoting the treatment or rehabilitation of the person... 
       
      (3) in deciding when to make an order referred to in subsection (i) the court is to have regard to the following factor:  
       
       (a), the person's character, antecedents, age health and mental condition 
        
       (b) the trivial nature of the offence 
        
       (c) the extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed. 
        
       (d) any other matters that the court thinks proper to consider...” 
       
      
    53. As can be seen section 10(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act sets out factors to be considered. Case law establishes none are conclusive but all are to be taken in to account. R v Paris [2001] NSWCCA 83. R v Piccin (No. 2) [2001] NSWCCA 323. 54. At the outset I have dealt with Mr Tomkin's character. His contribution to the community has been exceptional. His integrity and character appear highly regarded by those who know him. As a family man, farmer and grazier he has made significant contributions to the community other than those that brought him to the notice of his peers.55. He has no prior matters before the court. At 77 years of age the ignobility of an arrest must have been galling. His health has been of serious concern in the past 18 months. He is stressed, although much of that stress arises from his being charged in these proceedings and should abate shortly after these proceedings have been finalised.56. It would be inappropriate to assess this offence as trivial. I have assessed it as falling towards the low end of the range. I note the practice book speaks of determining and assessing the ""Triviality of the offence"" by reference to the actual offence committed by the offender and the circumstances surrounding the offence and not by reference to the maximum penalty. (see Walden v Hensler). Since Walden v Hensler (1987) 163 CLR 561 greater regard to assessing the seriousness of offences such as these is given to assessing whether that offence falls within a mid range of seriousness. ""Triviality"" is really another way of expressing a measure of absence of significant criminality.57. There was nothing in Mr Tomkin's conduct that promoted criminality. The potential for his weapons to fall in to another's hands virtually required criminal conduct by a third party. That conduct would have been required in a remote location in the state.58. In assessing the issue of triviality it is important to note how the prosecution has exercised its discretion in the charge it formulated. The charges formulated to embrace a one hour period of possession i.e. between 4.30 and 5.30 on 30 August 2008. In the light of admissions made in the interview it was open to formulate the charge so that a greater time span of possession was pleaded. Indeed, the charge, on the evidence available to police, could have been formulated as ""For the period first August 2002 to thirtieth August 2008"". It could also have been formulated ""Between the first of August 2002 to the thirtieth of August 2008"". In charges formulated in those ways the time of possession becomes part of the actual criminality charged. In the present charge the period of the possession charged is minimal. 59. That minimal period is, of course, to be evaluated in its criminality against the background of it not being an isolated period. Nonetheless, this is a distinction that makes a difference in the actual criminality of the charge. This offender is being called accountable for the criminality exposed by one hour of his possession rather than accountable for all six years of his possession. (Six years because the section was enacted in July 2002).60. The prosecutorial discretion exercised by the charging police was not interfered with by the DPP. It would not be surprising, given Mr Tomkins age, reputation in the community, and prior good character, that police would have some sympathy for his possession when charging him.61. I do not see any extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed. Nor, in fairness, has any been relied upon by the defence. As to any other matter the court thinks proper to consider the case law establishes that it is erroneous to dismiss a charge under the section to avoid the consequences of a conviction if a dismissal is otherwise warranted. See for example Re the Attorney General's application under section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (2004) 61 NSWLR 305.62. A conviction would disqualify Mr Tomkins from holding a shooters licence in the future. A discharge would have the consequence of permitting him to retrieve his suspended licences or apply for new ones. In evidence he says he does not want to have weapons any more. My own view is he has forfeited his right to hold a licence given he refused to abide by the statutory provisions. While it may be impermissible to consider consequences to avoid unfavourable consequences when giving a section 10 discharge, I have considered whether the obverse is true. That is, if a section 10 is otherwise merited should it be denied so adverse administrative consequences will flow (in this case loss of access to a shooters licence)? I have decided these are purely matters for the administrative arm of government and cannot impact upon the criteria relevant to the granting of a section 10 discharge or criminality. 63. Several of the purposes of sentencing have been given voice in these proceedings: Denunciation, personal deterrence, recognition of the potential for harm to the community, making the offender accountable for his acts, protection of the community. My own view is a minimum level of punishment is required.64. I intend to achieve that by the imposition of a bond as provided by section 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.65. Mr Tomkins, I find proved, the offence that you on 30 August at Collarenebri in the state of New South Wales did possess more than three firearms, to wit four, that were not registered, one of which was the sterling .22 semiautomatic sawn-off rifle, which was a prohibited weapon, in circumstances where you were not a person authorised by licence or permit to possess those firearms.66. However, I intend to discharge you conditional upon you entering in to a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of one year from today. 67. I also find the offence that you between 4.30 and 5.30 on 30 August 2008 at Collarenebri did not take all reasonable precautions to ensure that your firearms were kept safely because you kept the ammunition in the top draw and the guns in the bottom part of the cabinet, again I intend that you will be discharged on that conditional upon you entering in to a bond to be of good behaviour pursuant to section 10 for a period of six months.68. The second sentence that I just pronounced was, of course, an exercise of s.166 of the Criminal Procedure Act. I make no orders as to supervision. What I am seeking to achieve is the punishment derived from having a bond imposed.

    3 HOWIE J: The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to an offence of conspiring to deal with money to the value of $1,000,000 or more being the proceeds of crime reckless as to the fact that the money was the proceeds of crime. This is an offence contrary to s 11.5(1) and s 400.3(2) of the Criminal Code (Cth). The maximum penalty prescribed for the offence is imprisonment for 12 years. The applicant adhered to his plea before the District Court and was sentenced by Marien DCJ (the Judge) to imprisonment for six years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 7 months. The applicant is eligible to be released to parole on 8 July 2010. 
     
      
    4 There were initially three grounds of appeal filed. Two further grounds were added later but one of those grounds, Ground 4, was withdrawn shortly before the hearing of the application. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
      
    5 The facts can be summarised as follows. As a result of a conspiracy involving a number of persons including Dallas Fitzgerald, $150 million was fraudulently transferred from the funds of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme to accounts in Switzerland, Greece and Hong Kong. One of the accounts that was to be the recipient of the stolen money was an account in the name of the Lun Tun Travel Trading Co. (“Lun Tun”) with the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (“the HSBC”). 
     
      
    6 The offence with which the applicant was charged arose from an agreement between him and a number of other persons to deal with over $20 million of the stolen funds using the Lun Tun account. The funds were transferred to the account with a settlement day of 29 December 2003. Fortunately the fraud was discovered on that date and the bank did not release the funds. They were ultimately returned to the owner. Although about $3½ million was lost through the fraud, that money did not come from the Lun Tun account. 
     
      
    7 The applicant was involved in steps taken to establish the Lun Tun account. It was opened on 22 December 2003, two days before the stolen funds were received into it. The account was opened by Chan, the owner of Lun Tun, at the request of a person named Chao, a relative in Australia. That request was made on 20 December. Chao had himself received a request to open the account from Jiao an acquaintance at Star City Casino. Jiao had been asked by Zheng to find an account that could be used by her boss, the applicant. 
     
      
    8 Chao travelled to Hong Kong on 20 December and was joined by Jiao and Zheng on 22 December. There were calls made from the hotel, where these persons were staying, to the mobile phone of the applicant. That evening Zheng sent a fax to the applicant at his home. It contained details of the Lun Tun account. 
     
      
    9 On 22 or 23 December the applicant went with a man known as David He to a hotel in Sussex Street where they met Fitzgerald, a person involved in the theft of the funds. David He acted as interpreter at the meeting. The applicant handed Fitzgerald the information concerning the Lun Tun account. This account was one of four that was nominated for the transfer of funds in the documents by which the fraud was perpetrated. On 25 December the applicant made two calls to Zheng. 
     
      
    10 The applicant arranged for He and Zhang, an acquaintance of the applicant from Star City Casino, to travel to Hong Kong to assist him in dealing with the funds. The applicant paid the cost of Zhang’s travel. The three men travelled to Hong Kong on 26 December 2003. Fitzgerald travelled to Hong Kong on 27 December and was met at the airport by the applicant with Zhang and He. 
     
      
    11 The HSBC received instructions on 29 December to receive the funds and make two payments, one of over $HK118 million into the Lun Tun account. There was another account with the bank that was to receive over $HK175 million of the stolen funds. Later that day the fraud was detected and the bank was instructed to return the funds. The applicant attended at the bank with Fitzgerald, Chao, He and Zhang on a number of occasions in an attempt to access the funds. 
     
      
    12 Zhang and He returned to Australia on 31 December 2003. Although the applicant was originally to return on 10 January 2004, because of the failure to obtain the funds he returned on 1 January. David He assisted the police by making an induced statement to police implicating the applicant and others in the attempt to obtain the stolen funds. He was later granted an indemnity. At the sentencing hearing of the applicant He was required to give evidence because of a factual dispute that arose as to the role of the applicant in the conspiracy. I will return to that matter later as there is a ground of appeal arising from the Judge’s findings about that dispute. 
     
      
       
      Subjective matters 
      
    13 The applicant was born in China on 26 December 1965 and was subject to a childhood in poverty with his six siblings. He came to Australia in 1990 and became an Australian citizen in 2001 but he speaks little English. He maintains contact with his family in China. He married in 1994 but following a back injury and his difficulty as a result in obtaining work the marriage failed. He was divorced in 2001, however his wife has visited him in prison and they may eventually reunite. The applicant was involved in manual work in Australia until 2000 and thereafter was only casually employed. 
     
      
    14 The applicant told the officer preparing a pre-sentence report that after his divorce he lived a different lifestyle including frequent gambling and making criminal contacts. He claimed to be a “middle person” in the scheme to launder the funds and stated that he was promised $50,000 if he could find an account for the transfer of the stolen funds. He said that he was unaware of the magnitude of the funds and he held a lowly position in the conspiracy. 
     
      
    15 The applicant was sentenced in the District Court on 31 October 2006 in respect of a number of offences relating to identity theft arising from items found in a search of his premises. These matters had nothing to do with the present offence. He was sentenced to a total term for those offences of three years imprisonment from 9 March 2005 with a non-parole period that expired on 8 December 2006. 
     
      
    16 There were in evidence three psychological reports prepared by the same psychologist over the period 21 August 2006 to 30 May 2007. The applicant claimed to have been depressed for many years initially arising from his difficulties in assimilating into Australian society. He also has long-standing anxiety. Both these conditions were exaggerated as a result of a work-related accident that caused him a back injury. The psychologist believed that he had drifted into poor company that resulted in his criminal offences because he was “vulnerable to the manipulations and solicitations of significant others”. The psychologist found that the applicant’s period in custody had a salutary effect upon him. In the latest report the psychologist saw a connection between the applicant’s gambling and his offending. 
     
      
       
       
       
      Was there a misapplication of the principle of totality? 
      
    17 The complaint under Ground 1 is that the sentence imposed by the Judge was made cumulative to the sentence that was imposed on the applicant in October 2006. It was submitted that all the applicant’s offences were committed “during the one depressed episode in his life” which arose because of his back injury. It was argued that this fact alone justified some concurrency between the sentences earlier imposed and that imposed by the Judge. 
     
      
    18 There was little information before the Judge as to the facts of the offences for which the applicant had previously been sentenced. But on what his Honour knew, those offences represented completely independent criminal conduct unrelated in any real sense to the offence for which he was being sentenced. They were committed about 12 months before the present offence and were of a completely different character. 
     
      
    19 In those circumstances it was open for the Judge to determine that the totality of the criminal conduct could only be properly reflected by the accumulation of the sentence imposed by him on the non-parole period for the earlier sentences. This was a matter for his Honour’s discretion and there is no basis for concluding that he erred in that regard. 
     
      
       
      Did his Honour breach the De Simoni principle? 
      
    20 The Judge was required to resolve a dispute of fact as to the applicant’s knowledge as to the amount of money involved in the funds being transferred and the applicant’s role as compared with that of David He. The Crown alleged that the applicant had recruited He but the applicant maintained He recruited him. To resolve the dispute both the applicant and He gave evidence. 
     
      
    21 During his sentencing remarks and when rejecting the applicant’s account the Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ………I do not accept his assertion that he did not know right from the outset that this enterprise involved dealing in illegally obtained money. His own evidence that David He offered him $50,000 to find a bank account in Hong Kong clearly, in my view, demonstrates that from the beginning the offender must have known he was involved in the laundering of illegally obtained money. His assertion that he went to Hong Kong because he was afraid of David He is not consistent with the very active role he took when he got to Hong Kong. 
        
       
      
    22 The applicant complains under Ground 2 that the finding that the applicant knew the funds were illegally obtained from the outset of his involvement in the conspiracy is inconsistent with the charge to which the applicant had pleaded guilty and which alleged a conspiracy to deal in money reckless as to whether it was the proceeds of crime. Therefore, it is argued, the Judge has breached the principle arising from De Simoni v The Queen (1981) 147 CLR 383 in that he took into account a fact that was an element of a more serious offence than that for which the applicant was being sentenced. 
     
      
    23 It is unnecessary in resolving this ground of appeal to set out the relevant legislation or the scheme of the offences coming under s 400.3 of the Code. They are considered in detail in Ansari v R [2007] NSWCCA 204; 70 NSWLR 89. But it is obvious that there is a more serious offence arising where a person dealing with money over $1 million believes that the money is the proceeds of crime, and such an offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment; see s 400.3(1). Even though recklessness of a circumstance as an element of an offence under the Code can be proved by actual knowledge of that circumstance, when sentencing for an offence under s 400.3(2) the distinction must be maintained between the less serious offence involving recklessness and the more serious offence involving belief, see Ansari at [131]. 
     
      
    24 At the outset of his sentencing remarks, the Judge set out the offence and the relevant statutory provisions correctly. He also referred to the maximum penalty for the offence as being imprisonment for 12 years. This would not preclude a Judge from breaching De Simoni but at least it indicates the framework in which his other findings were being made. The sentence itself does not suggest that his Honour fell into the error especially when regard is had to his findings. Shortly after the passage set out above, the Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Taking into account the role played by the offender and the large amount of money the subject of the conspiracy I assess the objective seriousness of the offence committed by the offender as being above the middle of objective seriousness for offences of this kind. I make it clear that in assessing his criminal culpability I have taken into account that with respect to the Lun Tun Travel account no loss was suffered and the offender, it is conceded by the Crown, made no financial gain. 
        
       
      
    25 The Judge later indicated that, were it not for the discount as a result of the plea of guilty, he would have imposed a sentence of 8 years. Clearly his Honour came to that decision as against a maximum penalty of 12 years. Having regard to his findings as to the applicant’s criminality and the level of the objective seriousness of the offence, the undiscounted sentence was entirely appropriate. I do not believe that the Judge erroneously took into account the finding of the applicant’s knowledge that the funds were illegally obtained. That finding influenced his resolution of the dispute as to the role played by the applicant but it did not have any other bearing on his assessment of the offender’s criminality. 
     
      
       
      Did his Honour err in failing to have regard to the applicant’s assistance? 
      
    26 Ground 5 complains that the Judge failed to take into account assistance proffered by the applicant to investigating police. That assistance took the form of a statement made to police relating to the involvement of Fitzgerald and He in “drug activity”, as defence counsel described it at the sentencing hearing. 
     
      
    27 A police officer, Federal Agent Miller, gave evidence before the Judge and stated that the applicant was of no assistance in relation to the money laundering offence. The applicant did however supply the police with information that Fitzgerald and He were involved in the supply of drugs. Federal police did not pass on that information to State police. The officer stated that when he first spoke to David He, he was under arrest for State drug offences. The officer also indicated that it was common knowledge that Fitzgerald was involved in drugs. 
     
      
    28 In his sentencing remarks the Judge referred to this evidence and an exhibit that stated that the police considered that the applicant’s assistance had no value. He then said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Noting the assessment document and taking into account the evidence of Federal Agent Miller and the offender I am unable to see that the assistance or information provided by the offender to the authorities can be seen to be of such a value as to warrant any reduction or mitigation of the sentence that I would otherwise impose upon him. 
        
       
      
    29 The complaint is that even assistance that is of no value should be taken into account if it is seen as a genuine attempt to assist the police and, therefore, some evidence of contrition. The applicant does not contend that he should have been given a percentage discount but submits that the Judge was in error in disregarding it as a relevant factor that might mitigate his sentence. 
     
      
    30 I accept that on its face the Judge appears to have disregarded the evidence of the applicant’s assistance, such as it was, simply because it was of no value and that he was in error in doing so. But the error is of little significance having regard to the nature of the assistance. Further the Judge did take into account the psychological reports before him that included a statement, referred to by his Honour, that the applicant had expressed “considerable regret for his behaviour” and that this expression appeared to be genuine. He also referred to the psychologist’s opinion that there was a “significant shift in the offender’s attitude” and that he “now acknowledges his wrongdoing and appears to have insight into the dynamics surrounding his offending”. The Judge also referred to a letter written by the applicant that included expressions of remorse. 
     
      
    31 Although his Honour should not have dismissed the proffered assistance simply because it was of no value, the evidence would have only been relevant to the applicant’s remorse. There was ample evidence before his Honour on that topic and the Judge did not reject it but rather said that he was taking it into account. In my opinion the error by the Judge would not have made the slightest difference to his Honour’s evaluation of the applicant’s contrition or the sentence that he imposed. 
     
      
       
      Was the sentence manifestly excessive? 
      
    32 As his Honour found, the applicant played a significant role in the conspiracy and it included travelling to Hong King and recruiting other persons to assist him. In Ansari, above, the following was stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [123]  
        It is likely that an offender before the court for sentencing for an offence within the Division will be a person facilitating the laundering of the money or actually involved in that process, rather than the owner of the money or the beneficiary of the laundering. The prosecution may not be able to show that the offender knew of the source of the money or its ultimate destination. In  
        Assafiri v R 
         [2007] NSWCCA 159 an analogy was drawn between money laundering offences and drug importations in that both types of offences usually reveal a hierarchy of persons involved in the conduct who have different roles to play and different gains to be made from the commission of the crime. The most important consideration in sentencing an offender for an offence under this Division will be to consider what the offender did, because there may be little or no evidence before the court as to the organisation behind the offence, the source of the funds or the ultimate use to be made of them: see  
        R v Olbrich 
         (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [19]. 
        
       
      
    33 His role in the conspiracy involved making arrangements for access to over $20 million in stolen funds. The Judge found that the applicant was aware that the activity in which he was involved related to “a very large sum of money”. In R v Huang and Siu [2007] NSWCCA 259, this Court said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [34] The amount of money involved is clearly a highly significant matter because the legislation uses it as the principal means of dividing the offences into categories and it is the primary identifier of what is the maximum penalty for an offence. The only difference between an offence falling within s 400.3(a), and carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years, and an offence falling within s 400.4(a), and carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years, is the amount of money or the value of the property with which the offender dealt. 
        
       
      
    34 There was no suggestion that the Judge erred in finding that the offence was above the middle range of seriousness, and I would have thought that it was well above. It has been made abundantly clear by the decisions to which I have referred that this type of activity is to be considered as serious criminal conduct whatever the role undertaken by persons involved in it. Where, as here, the offender is “at mid level in the organisational hierarchy of the conspiracy” to deal with these funds, the criminality warranted a very severe sentence having regard to the amount of money involved and what the applicant did in an attempt to make the funds available to the persons involved in its theft. 
     
      
    35 I am of the opinion that the sentence imposed was within his Honour’s discretion and there is no basis for this Court to interfere. Therefore, I propose that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant pleaded guilty to the following offences: 
     
      
    · Two counts of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of fourteen years in circumstances of aggravation, being under his authority contrary to s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act 1900; 
     
      
       
      
    · Sexual intercourse with a child under the age of sixteen in circumstances of aggravation, being under his authority contrary to s 66C(4) of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    2 The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s 66C(2) is twenty years imprisonment. For an offence contrary to s 66C(4) the maximum penalty is twelve years imprisonment. 
     
      
    3 The applicant was sentenced in relation to the two counts contrary to s 66C(2) to concurrent terms of imprisonment of nine years with a non-parole period of six years. In respect of the s 66C(4) offence he was sentenced to a term of seven years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years. His total sentence was imprisonment for a period of eleven years with a non-parole period of eight years.  
     
      
    4 The applicant seeks leave to appeal his sentence. Originally the only issue pressed in the appeal, so it was submitted was that the adjustment which his Honour made to the sentences to reflect a finding which he made of special circumstances was inappropriate. However, on the hearing of the appeal a further ground was advanced to the effect that the sentencing judge erred when he identified the maximum penalty for the offence against s 66C(4) as being 14 years imprisonment. It is actually 12 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    5 The offences which the applicant committed were described by the sentencing judge as “not in the worst category of case but falling slightly above the mid-range of objective seriousness for an offence of this type.” The applicant’s victim was his “step-daughter” who was in his care following her mother’s leaving the home to take up with another man overseas. The applicant and the complainant first had sexual intercourse shortly after the complainant’s thirteen birthday and a child was conceived. The sexual relationship continued after the child was born and subsequently a further child was conceived. At the time of sentencing the complainant who was aged 16 years of age, was the mother of two children. Because the applicant had secreted the relationship with the complainant the births of the children were not registered and they had not received the usual vaccinations. The effect on the complainant was significant. She had been deprived of her teenage years and schooling during that period. 
     
      
    6 The applicant showed only modest insight into his offending. He described his relationship with the complainant as a “de facto relationship” and said they were engaged to be married. Although he pleaded guilty the sentencing judge found that the plea was not entered at the earliest opportunity and allowed a discount of 15%. His Honour found that, although there was some evidence of contrition, it was difficult to assess the true level of remorse when the applicant maintained that he wished the relationship to continue. 
     
      
    7 The applicant was in custody when sentenced. By reason of the nature of his offences he was placed on protection. The fact that he was at risk was confirmed when on one occasion he arrived at court with facial bruising and other injuries inflicted since his incarceration. The sentencing judge had regard to these matters when determining the sentence. 
     
      
    8 His Honour was mindful of the need to impose a sentence which provided adequately for general deterrence, denunciation and retribution. His Honour found special circumstances of which he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Being that at 41 years of age this will be the offender’s first time serving a custodial sentence.” 
        
       
      
    9 His Honour’s finding with respect to special circumstances was reflected in the individual sentences. However, because of the manner in which his Honour structure the individual sentences the aggregate non-parole period is 72.7% of the aggregate head term. It is about this proportion which the applicant complains. It was submitted that the ultimate sentence reflects only a very minor adjustment for special circumstances. It translates to a three month increase in the period on parole to that provided by the statute for an individual sentence: s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    10 After careful consideration of his Honour’s remarks on sentence I am satisfied that the overall sentence which his Honour imposed and the relationship between the aggregate non-parole period and period on parole was deliberate. The finding of special circumstances almost immediately precedes his Honour’s statement of the sentences to be imposed and it must be assumed that his Honour was mindful of the finding which he had made when pronouncing both the sentences and the overall sentence. 
     
      
    11 The appropriate approach when a finding of special circumstances is made has been considered by this Court on a number of occasions. In R v Swan [2005] NSWCCA 252 Rothman J emphasised that when sentencing for multiple offences s 44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act 1999, as amended in 2002, although not irrelevant, does not mandate a relationship between an overall non-parole period and the remainder of the overall sentence. The section is concerned with the relationship between the period of full time custody and the period on parole in relation to each particular offence for which an offender is being sentenced. 
     
      
    12 As I have indicated his Honour’s finding of special circumstances was based on the fact that the applicant would be serving a prison sentence for the first time. Reservations have been expressed in this Court as to whether the fact that a person will be in custody for the first time is capable of constituting special circumstances R v Kama (2000) 110 A Crim R 47 (per Spigelman CJ at [10]); R v Kaliti [2001] NSWCCA 268. I have similar reservations. There will be many persons facing a court for sentence who will receive a custodial term for the first time. No doubt where appropriate that fact will be reflected in the sentence which is imposed. But whether for that reason alone a finding of special circumstances is appropriate is doubtful. Most people who have been incarcerated for any period will need assistance in re-establishing themselves in the community and it may be that a repeat offender is in greater need than some one incarcerated for the first time. 
     
      
    13 In the present case as I have indicated, the sentencing judge’s finding of special circumstances was reflected in the sentence on each individual count. This Court has explained on many occasions that the extent of any adjustment to the statutory requirement is essentially a matter within the sentencing judge’s discretion. In R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [31] Spigelman CJ said that an adjustment for special circumstances “raises so many matters of a discretionary character that this Court should be very slow to intervene.” Only if the non-parole period provided is manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive should this Court intervene: Cramp at [36]; R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 per Spigelman CJ at [19]. 
     
      
    14 It is common to find that when an offender is being sentenced for multiple offences the relationship between the period of full time custody and the non-parole causes practical problems. If this arises in the sentencing of an offender, in order to provide an appropriate overall relationship between the period on parole and the overall sentence, a finding of special circumstances may be made. Hunt CJ at CL commented on these matters in R v Simpson (1992) 61 A Crim R 58: see also R v Clissold [2002] NSWCCA 356 and the discussion in R v Cook [1999] NSWCCA 234 and R v Ibrahim [2005] NSWCCA 43. 
     
      
    15 In the present case, leaving to one side the question of the maximum penalty for the offence against s 66C(4) I am of the view that the sentence which his Honour imposed is appropriate. Although the finding of special circumstances led to only a minor adjustment of the statutory ratio with respect to the aggregate sentences I am not persuaded that an error has occurred. I am satisfied that the sentencing judge was mindful of the finding of special circumstances which he made and which facilitated the adjustment of the statutory ratio which his Honour provided. That adjustment was within his sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    16 In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge identified the maximum penalty for the offence contrary to s 66C(4) as being 14 years. However, during the course of submissions his Honour had been informed that the maximum penalty was 12 years and this was also identified in written submissions provided to his Honour by the Crown. In these circumstances it would seem likely that the identification of 14 years was a slip which was not corrected. 
     
      
    17 In relation to the s 66C(4) offence his Honour imposed a penalty of a non-parole period of 4 years with a total term of 7 years imprisonment. By so doing his Honour made plain that, in accordance with the legislative intent evident from the relevant maximum penalties that a lesser sentence should be imposed for the offence committed when the complainant was aged in excess of 14 years. Although the term of imprisonment imposed by his Honour was significant having regard to the circumstances of the offence and the subjective features of the applicant it was not inappropriate. There can be no doubt that this offence fell above the mid-range of objective seriousness. The applicant engaged in unprotected sex with his step-daughter leading to the conception of a second child. The earlier offences required significant punishment but subjecting his step-daughter to further sexual activity when it was likely that a further child would be conceived was a very serious offence. The criminality was greater than that involved in the earlier offences, although of course the maximum penalty was less. 
     
      
    18 The Crown emphasised that when sentencing the applicant his Honour provided wholly concurrent sentences in relation to the first two counts. They were separate and serious offences and warranted, in my judgment, an identifiable term of imprisonment for each offence. His Honour provided for the partial concurrency of the sentence imposed in relation to the third count with the consequence that in relation to that count the applicant will serve a period of two years in full time custody with the prospect of parole for a further three years. Even if I was persuaded that his Honour was mistaken when identifying the maximum penalty for this offence and that mistake has influenced the sentence. I would not have intervened to alter the period which the applicant will spend in custody or on parole. However, I am not persuaded that having regard to a maximum penalty of twelve years the sentence which his Honour imposed for the third count was excessive. I would have adjusted the relevant dates so that the total period of full time custody and the period on parole were the same as was actually imposed. 
     
      
    19 Although I would grant leave to appeal the appeal should be dismissed.

      REGINA v DEON JAMES EDWARDS 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Deon James Edwards (the offender) stands for sentence having pleaded guilty to the murder of Adelaide Breckenridge (the deceased) at Nambucca Heads on 23 February 2008. The offender was then aged 38 and the deceased was 45. The maximum penalty for the offence is life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 20 years is applicable to it.  
     
      
    2 There is no dispute about the factual background to the offence. In outlining that material I have placed considerable reliance upon an Agreed Statement of Facts. 
     
      
    3 In about July 2007 the offender met the deceased and they formed a relationship. Thereafter the deceased regularly stayed at the offender’s premises at 3 Sussex Street Nambucca Heads. During the course of their relationship, the deceased and the offender constantly argued. Sometimes the arguments would escalate into violence. On occasions the offender assaulted the deceased and threw her out of the house. Likewise the deceased, on occasions, retaliated by throwing bricks and rocks at the offender. 
     
      
    4 On 9 August 2007 the offender was convicted of assaulting the deceased and causing actual bodily harm to her. He was placed on a bond for a period of 18 months. It was a condition of the bond that he not assault, harass or otherwise interfere with the deceased. The bond was current at the time the deceased was killed. There was also an apprehended violence order in existence which placed restrictions upon the manner in which the offender could behave towards the deceased. Despite the existence of that order the deceased nevertheless continued to visit the offender. 
     
      
    5 The offender and the deceased are both of Aboriginal descent. The offender was employed by the Narala Aboriginal Lands Council on Mondays and Tuesdays. From Thursday of each week until the end of the weekend, the offender and the deceased were accustomed to drinking large amounts of alcohol together on a regular basis. They also smoked cannabis and frequently argued with one another. 
     
      
    6 On Friday 22 February 2008 the offender and the deceased were at the offender’s home playing music. Although at times during the day they were arguing, there do not appear to have been any violent incidents. Several other persons, including the offender’s sister, came to the premises where they joined in drinking alcohol and listening to music. 
     
      
    7 At about 11pm the police brought the offender’s niece to his home as she had been involved in a fight. Police told the offender that his niece would be arrested if police saw her on the streets again. After the police departed, an argument erupted as a result of which the offender’s niece left the premises. During the course of the argument, the offender was heard telling the deceased to “get the fuck back in the house, you slut or you will cop it”. That argument continued into the early hours of Saturday 23 February.  8 Later that morning the offender and the deceased were again heard to be arguing. The front door of the premises was opened and the deceased was heard to say “ I want to go home , I want to go home. I want to see my daughter”. The accused said “Get back inside you slut”. The front door was then slammed shut.9 During the afternoon, the offender’s next door neighbour, Mathew Barber rang the Nambucca police station and informed police that there was a “pretty bad domestic going on…and [that] they should come and fix it”. For reasons that remain unexplained, the police did not attend the premises. 10 At about 5pm the deceased was seen at the front door of the offender’s premises. She was heard to say, “I want to go home, I want to go home, I don’t want to get bashed anymore”. The deceased got part of the way out of the front door before the offender grabbed her by her hair and pulled her back inside. He then shut the door. It appeared that at that stage both the offender and the deceased were intoxicated. As a result of this incident, Mr Barber again contacted the police. The call was diverted to Kempsey police station but again it appears that police did not respond to the call. 11 At about 7:50pm the offender went to the door of Mr Barber’s home. He called out “ Matt, Matt, I need your help, ring someone. I’ve done something bad, Adelaide’s not breathing.” “I’ve done something wrong. I think I’ve killed her, come and check”.12 Mr Barber and two other men then returned with the offender to his premises. They discovered that the deceased was lying on her back on the floor in a bedroom. The men were unable to locate a pulse and efforts to revive her were unsuccessful. The offender said “I did it to her. I killed her”. He repeatedly asked for a gun in order that he could shoot himself. 13 Police and ambulance personnel attended the scene. The offender was arrested and conveyed to Macksville police station. Custody management records indicate that the offender was well affected by alcohol at the time. Those records also indicate that he attempted to strangle himself with his underwear. 14 At about 3am the following morning the offender participated in a brief interview with police. He is recorded as having said that: 
     
      
       
        
        “I loved her, that’s the only thing I am saying” 
         
         
        “Man, she’s my woman, I’m fretting for her, she’s gone.” 
        
       
      
    15 Clothing removed from the offender included a bloodstained pair of tracksuit pants. DNA located on the tracksuit pants was discovered to be the same profile as that of the deceased. 16 Police crime scene officers examined the offender’s unit. In the kitchen they located a number of empty wine and port bottles and a number of empty beer and UDL vodka cans. Fingerprints matching those of the offender were found on some of the beer cans. 17 In the lounge room of the house, police located an empty port bottle, an empty bladder from a wine cask and a “bong”. DNA, located in an area of blood staining on the carpet in that room, was found to match the DNA profile of the deceased. A blood stain on a picture frame also contained DNA which matched the profile of the deceased as did a blood stained shirt which was also discovered. 
     
      
    18 The largest concentration of visible blood was located in the hallway of the residence. DNA analysis of this blood revealed that it had the same profile as that of the deceased. Police are of the opinion that a “bloodshed event“ had taken place in the hallway and that some of the blood in that area had been wiped up. A small bloodstain on the hallway wall was found to have the same DNA profile as that of the deceased.19 An empty wine cask was found in the hallway adjacent to another area of blood staining. This area was just outside the bedroom in which the deceased’s body was located. That blood also had the same DNA profile as the deceased’s profile. 20 A pair of white tracksuit pants were found in the bathroom. The pants, which were heavily bloodstained, contained DNA which matched the deceased’s profile. 21 The deceased’s body was found lying face up in a bedroom. There were lacerations to her right temple, her right cheek, her upper lip and under her chin. There was bruising to the right side of her eye and ear but there was very little blood on her face. Her hair was wet and appeared to have been brushed away from her face. Nor were there any significant bloodstain patterns such as one would expect if the deceased’s injuries had been sustained in that room. 22 An axe handle was located near the deceased’s feet. There was no head to the handle and one end of it was jagged. DNA was located on both ends of the handle, the major component of which matched the profile of the deceased whilst the minor component matched the profile of the offender. 23 Dr Cala performed an autopsy upon the deceased on 25 February 2008. He observed a large number of injuries to various parts of her body. The deceased had sustained very significant lacerations to her chin, below her right eye and above her right eyebrow and to her upper lip. There was also extensive bruising to both of her ears, to her left eye, to an area near her left eyebrow and an area near to her left cheek. There was also bruising to two of her ribs, her upper chest area and to both of her arms and her shoulders. 24 An internal examination was also conducted. It revealed bruising to the deceased’s scalp and two separate lacerations to the heart, the most significant of which was what Dr Cala described as a “through and through” rupture of the apex of the left ventricle resulting in 500ml of blood getting into the pericardial sac. Lacerations to the left and right lobe of the deceased’s liver were detected. Multiple recent rib fractures were also located. 25 Dr. Cala concluded that the direct cause of death was “multiple injuries”. He went on to express the opinion that the injuries to the heart and liver may have resulted from a blow or blows such as a stomp or “knee drop” to the upper abdomen and lower chest region inflicted whilst the deceased was lying in a supine position.  
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
               
                
                 
                
               
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    26 Dr Cala also concluded that the injuries to the deceased’s head, face, trunk and arms were consistent with having been inflicted during an assault. He expressed the opinion that they could have involved blows from a blunt object such as a bottle, a lamp, a small baseball bat or indeed from the axe handle that was found next to the body of the deceased.27 The deceased had a blood alcohol reading of 0.269g/100mls with the vitreous alcohol level being 0.288g/100mls. At the time of her death she weighed 42 kg and was 163 cm in height whilst the offender was estimated to be between 175 cm and 180 cm in height, and to weigh 90 kg. He was described as being of solid build. 
     
      
    28 On 29 February 2008, the offender made a telephone call to a relative from gaol which was recorded. During the phone call the offender stated “Do you know if they have found any weapons…, cause I seen it on the news…, there was no weapon, there was no weapons, I was watching it on the news”.  
    29 I have been informed about the offender’s background in a report prepared on his behalf by a forensic psychiatrist, Dr Robert Delaforce. The offender was born in Macksville and spent the first few years of his life there. He was never close to his father who died in 1995 from heart disease. His father was in the habit of consuming excessive amounts of alcohol and left the family home when the offender was about 4. He and the offender’s mother had frequently argued. The offender reported having been physically abused by his mother. On one such occasion, when he was aged about 5 or 6, he hid under his mother’s bed after having received “a hiding” from her. His mother and a male companion were on the bed at the time and it collapsed on the offender. The offender was only able to escape when he began screaming. He was apparently traumatised by the incident for a long period of time. The offender’s brother told the offender that when he (the offender) was about 2 or 3, the offender had been the victim of repeated sexual abuse at the hands of an adult male.30 The offender had a disrupted schooling. He was always in the lowest class and had difficulty reading and writing. He was teased because of his shortcomings and was constantly in trouble. He was eventually expelled in Year 11. As a young man the offender showed considerable promise as a rugby league footballer. However his career was cut short because of his dependency upon alcohol which he first started consuming at the age of 9. From the age of 14 he began to drink excessively, a pattern which continued until his incarceration for the present matter. It would seem that he was in the habit of drinking throughout the day commencing from first thing in the morning. If he was unable to purchase alcohol, he would drink methylated spirits. He described himself as having been “born an alcoholic”. Since the mid 1990s the offender reported having experienced “blackouts” after consuming alcohol. He said that he had little, if any, recall of the events which culminated in the fatal incident.  
     
      
    31 The offender also reported having commenced using cannabis at the age of 12. He estimated that for many years he had been in the habit of smoking 20-30 “bongs” a day. Following a court order, the offender spent a total of 9 months during the 1990s in a rehabilitation centre in an endeavour to overcome his dependency upon illicit drugs and alcohol. 32 The offender’s abuse of alcohol and cannabis appears to have also plagued his personal relationships, all of which appear to have been volatile. A de facto relationship in the 1980s, during which his 21 year old son was born, faltered for that reason. An 11 year relationship with another de facto partner ended in about 2001 for the same reason. After that relationship broke down, his partner denied the offender access to their three children, an issue which caused the offender a considerable degree of distress. Indeed he was forced to go to court in order to obtain access to them.33 It is to the offender’s credit, that despite his various challenges, he has been in fairly constant employment, albeit that it has been in quite menial positions. Despite having employment, the offender nevertheless owed a substantial sum of money to the Aboriginal Lands Council for outstanding rental on the premises which he was occupying. 34 Concerning the offence, the offender told Dr Delaforce that “I just can’t believe I could do something like that and kill somebody”. Dr Delaforce observed that the offender “expressed some remorse that [he] judged to be genuine”.35 Dr Delaforce was able to examine the offender’s Justice Health file. It revealed that when he was first received into custody, the offender was assessed as being “highly suicidal” and that he “appeared to be grieving for the loss of his partner”. Those suicidal thoughts continued for some time. The offender is now, for the first time, on medication for his depressed condition although he has had something of a history of self-harm and attempts at suicide.36 Dr Delaforce observed that the offender was very depressed when he first examined him. Nevertheless he concluded that there were “no signs of any psychotic features” and that the history which the offender provided indicated “satisfactory cognitive functioning”.37 Dr Delaforce arrived at the following conclusion: 
     
      
       
        
        I nevertheless assessed [the offender] to be a very sad and tragic figure who is a psychiatric/psychological victim of traumas in his childhood that permanently changed his mental health in a way that he found best able to deal with by excessive substance use. That use contributed to his repeated violence and failures in life that include substantial problems with his education, employment, relationships, and to even his failure to develop further his obvious football ability. 
        
       
       
        
        Stressors he experienced in recent years aggravated his chronic overall severe psychiatric problems with his increasing accommodation rent debt, loss of the building construction site employment, legal attempts to overcome no contact with his children, alleged death threats from [the deceased’s] family that he accepts followed his prior violence to her, and his only father figure’s heart by pass surgery. 
        
       
      
    38 The offender is serving his sentence in protection because he maintains that he has received threats from relatives of the deceased some of whom are also in custody. A letter from the Department of Corrective Services confirms that fact.39 The offender has a criminal record dating back to 1988. Although it contains a number of entries, the offender has never previously been sentenced to a term of imprisonment. He has twice been convicted for driving with the high range prescribed concentration of alcohol and twice for driving whilst disqualified. He has several convictions for relatively minor matters of dishonesty, the last of which was in 1998. He also has a number of convictions for street offences such as offensive behaviour, not leaving licensed premises, resisting arrest, damaging property and possessing a prohibited drug. Of more significance for present purposes are convictions in the Local Court in 1993, 1995 and 2001 for offences of common assault. The first two of those offences attracted pecuniary penalties, whilst for the 2001 matter the offender received a community service order. Breaches of apprehended domestic violence orders, in 1996 and 2001 respectively, attracted pecuniary penalties. The most serious offence on the offender’s criminal record is the assault occasioning actual bodily harm which, as I have said, he committed upon the deceased in 2007.  
     
      
    40 The offender’s record, along with the other material which is before the court, suggests that most, if not all, of his offending behaviour has occurred against the background of his excessive consumption of alcohol. 
     
      
    41 I have received victim impact statements from one of the deceased’s sisters and from one of her daughters. The feelings which they have so eloquently and poignantly expressed and the grief which they and their families have suffered is entirely understandable. It is quite impossible to adequately summarise that sense of loss in a few sentences and to do so, or to attempt to do so, would detract from the contents of their statements. Clearly no sentence which any court could impose can ever begin to make good that loss. I extend to the family and friends of the deceased my deepest sympathy. The approach of a sentencing judge to statements of this kind is nevertheless now well settled: see R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76; R v FD & JD (2006) 160 A Crim R 392; MAH v R [2006] NSWCCA 226. 
     
      
    42 In approaching the task of sentencing the offender, I must have regard to the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Act). I must also pay due regard to the various aggravating and mitigating factors identified in s 21A of the Act which have particular relevance to the case. 
     
      
    43 Although there remains considerable uncertainty as to the precise circumstances in which the deceased was killed, there are a number of aspects of the case about which there is agreement. First, the Crown realistically acknowledges that the offence is not in the worst category such as to warrant the imposition of the maximum penalty. That being so, it is appropriate to impose a determinate sentence. Secondly, the parties are in agreement that the evidence supports the proposition that the offender intended to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased but did not intend to kill her. Thirdly, it is common ground that the fatal incident was not premeditated and that the offence is not to be treated as being “part of a planned or organised criminal activity” within the meaning of s 21A(2)(n) of the Act. Fourthly, the Crown concedes that it is unable to establish to the criminal standard that a weapon was used in the commission of the offence. Although there is evidence available which suggests that the offender may have had resort to the axe handle during the course of the fatal incident, the Crown accepts, in light of the somewhat tentative opinion expressed by Dr Cala, that it cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt that it was in fact used. Fifthly, it is common ground that the fact that the fatal incident occurred within a home should not be treated as an additional aggravating factor within the meaning of s 21A(2)(eb). Although the deceased was accustomed to staying at the offender’s premises, it was not her home. Nevertheless she was entitled to feel safe and secure in those premises and the fact that she was not, is a relevant factor in assessing the overall objective gravity of the offence. Finally, it is accepted on behalf of the offender that it was a matter of considerable aggravation that he was on a bond at the time of the offence, particularly as it had been imposed for an assault upon the deceased. 
     
      
    44 That said, the circumstances surrounding the offence reveal criminality of a most serious kind. The nature and extent of the injuries which the deceased sustained reveals that the blows which the offender inflicted upon her were administered with very considerable force. It is not possible to determine precisely when the various blows, including the fatal injuries which the deceased sustained, were inflicted. It can however be reasonably inferred that the attack upon her occurred over a not insignificant period of time and that it consisted of a number of blows. Moreover, the deceased endeavoured unsuccessfully to escape from the offender. Dr Cala formed the opinion that the bruises which were located on the deceased’s right shoulder, arm, elbow and wrist suggested that she had been restrained by the offender. Finally, given the physical disparity between them, it seems clear that the deceased was in no position to adequately defend herself in the face of the offender’s violent conduct. 
     
      
    45 On the other hand, there are a number of mitigating factors upon which the offender is entitled to rely. A significant factor to be weighed in his favour is his plea of guilty: see s 21A(3)(k) and s 22. I was informed that sometime before the trial the offender offered to plead guilty to manslaughter. That offer however was rejected. I was also advised that the offender’s legal representatives obtained a further report from a forensic pathologist, and also explored other possible defences, before indicating to the Crown shortly before the trial commenced that the offender would plead guilty to murder. It was submitted that the offender should not be disadvantaged by the fact that steps taken on his behalf by his professional advisers had delayed the entry of his plea of guilty. I have given that matter due consideration and recognise that it is no small matter to plead guilty to the most serious offence in the criminal calendar. Although the plea of guilty could hardly be described as being entered at the first available opportunity, there was still some significant saving of the resources of both the State and the Court. I was informed that the trial had been set down for three weeks and that the Crown intended calling 40 witnesses. The offender’s plea has spared them from the ordeal of having to give evidence.  
     
      
    46 In the circumstances the offender has “facilitated the course of justice”: Cameron v the Queen (2002) 209 CLR 339. Accordingly, and because his plea of guilty has utilitarian value, he is entitled to a discount which I assess to be worth 15%, in accordance with the range identified in R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. 
     
      
    47 The Crown accepts that it is appropriate to allow a further reduction of sentence to the offender on account of the contrition which he displayed both in his conduct and by his utterances at the time of, and shortly after, the offence was committed: s21A(3)(i). Furthermore, by pleading guilty the offender abandoned any chance that a jury may have returned a verdict of manslaughter upon the basis that the Crown had not established, in the light of his state of intoxication, that he had formed the requisite intention for the crime of murder. 
     
      
    48 As I have said, the offender has been in protective custody whilst on remand. The authorities make it plain that the circumstances in which an offender who is on protection is serving, and is likely to serve, his or her sentence should be carefully scrutinised by a sentencing court: see R v Durocher-Yvon (2003) 58 NSWLR 581; R v Mostyn (2004) 145 A Crim R 304; R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at 199-200. 
     
      
    49 I accept that the offender entertains reasonable fears for his well-being. In any event, it is highly likely that he will remain in some form of protective custody for the remainder of his sentence, a period of time which will, of necessity, be very lengthy. Those factors will mean that his time in gaol will be more burdensome than would be the case for a mainstream prisoner: see generally Durocher-Yvon (supra) at 587. Nevertheless, as best one can tell at this stage, it seems that the offender is likely to go to a facility which is predominantly a protection gaol and so his access to facilities and programs should not be unduly interfered with.  
     
      
    50 The offender does not have the benefit of a clear criminal record. In approaching this issue, I have borne steadily in mind the principles enunciated in R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566. He has a number of convictions for offences of violence, although none of them of course even remotely approach the seriousness of the present offence. However, in light of all the material which is before the court, it is appropriate to have some, albeit limited, regard to the need for personal deterrence. It is also important to acknowledge that considerations of general deterrence must also take their place in the sentencing process. The present offence, seen against the background of the offender’s overall history, would suggest that the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation must, at first blush, be approached with considerable caution. However, there remains some room for optimism, particularly in view of his acceptance of responsibility for the current offence. Moreover, by reason of the sentence which I shall impose, the offender will, by the time he is released into the community, have reached an age at which it can be reasonably anticipated that he will have attained a measure of maturity. His rehabilitation will also depend very largely upon whether he can overcome his dependency upon illicit drugs and alcohol. 
     
      
    51 As I observed earlier, the offence of murder attracts the operation of s 54A of the Act. Section 54A(2) provides that “the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness”. In approaching this aspect of the matter, I have had regard to the principles set out in Way (supra) especially at pars 117-124; 131. See also R v AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 575 per Simpson J at par 13; R v MLP (2006) 164 A Crim R 93. 
     
      
    52 It was submitted on behalf of the offender that the offence should be assessed as falling “in the low or at worst the low to mid-range”. The Crown submitted that it fell into “the mid-range of seriousness”. In my view, the circumstances which I earlier outlined demonstrate that the offence should be characterised as approaching, but falling a little below, the “middle of the range of objective seriousness”. In coming to that conclusion, I have had regard amongst other things, to the fact that the offender did not intend to kill the deceased, the fact that the offence was not premeditated and that it was not established that a weapon was used. In any event, it is common ground that I should impose a non-parole period which is shorter than the standard non-parole period. I intend to do so particularly because of the offender’s plea of guilty, the contrition which he has demonstrated and the other favourable subjective features of the case to which reference has been made. I have nevertheless kept steadily in mind that the standard non-parole period remains of relevance “as a reference point, benchmark, sounding board or guidepost”. 
     
      
    53 It was also submitted, although somewhat faintly, that I should make a finding of “special circumstances”. I am not inclined to do so because the factors upon which the submission is based, are matters which I have already taken into account in arriving at the appropriate sentence. In that respect I have given due weight to the issues raised by Dr Delaforce in his report concerning the offender’s disadvantaged background. Moreover, to the extent that it is appropriate to do so, I have had regard to the principles enunciated in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58. The effect of the overall sentence which I shall impose will, in any event, enable the offender to have an extended period of supervision in the community whilst on parole.  
     
      
    54 In written submissions filed on behalf of the offender a possible range for the present kind of offence was suggested. That submission however was somewhat refined in oral submissions presumably because the initial range was based largely upon cases which were decided before the introduction of standard non-parole periods. Reliance was placed in oral submissions upon the decision in R v Vu [2005] NSWSC 271 as providing a useful comparable authority. That offender received a non-parole period of 13 years 6 months with an overall term of 18 years imprisonment. In response, the Crown drew my attention to R v Thompson [2008] NSWSC 109 in which a non-parole period of 15 years with an overall term of 20 years imprisonment was imposed. 
     
      
    55 Whilst I have derived some assistance from a consideration of other decisions, and in particular from the two authorities which I have just mentioned, the extent of any such assistance is necessarily limited given the inevitable differences between those cases and the facts of the present case: see R v Trevenna (2004) 149 A Crim R 505. In the final analysis, I must exercise my own sentencing discretion having had proper regard to the relevant sentencing principles to which I have referred and having considered the salient features of the present case: see R v Markarian (2005) 228 CLR 357. 
     
      
    56 Because a human life has been needlessly and unlawfully taken, it is necessary to impose a sentence which properly reflects the objective gravity of the offence. It must also give effect not only to the various matters referred to in ss 3A and 21A of the Act but also to the maximum penalty prescribed by the legislature. In setting the effective non-parole period, I have borne steadily in mind the need to fix the minimum period which the offender must spend in custody: R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704. 
     
      
       
      Sentence 
       
      
    57 For the murder of Adelaide Breckenridge the offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 14 years with an overall sentence of 18 years 8 months imprisonment. Both terms will commence on 23 February 2008. The total term will expire on 22 October 2026. The non-parole period will expire on 22 February 2022 on which date the offender will be eligible for release on parole.

   JUDGMENTIntroduction1 On 16 September 2002 the yacht ‘Excalibur’ sank approximately 20 miles off Seal Rocks, just north of Port Stephens, and four of the crew died. Alex Cittadini and Adrian Presland are currently on trial in respect of four counts of manslaughter arising from these deaths. The cause of the capsize was the shearing away of the bottom “half” of the keel fin (with the lead bulb attached) along a horizontal line where the starboard and port sides, or “skins”, of the fin had been cut and then welded back together. The evidence in the trial is that the two sheets of stainless steel that comprised the ‘skins’ of the keel fin were not designed to be cut and that such cutting and welding was a fundamental defect in the construction of the yacht.2 The prosecution sought to lead evidence only in relation to the trial of Alexander Cittadini,  
     
      
      (i) of the presence of, and relevant opinions about, alleged deficient welding in the hull as a consequence of investigation of employees from Australian NDT Services Pty Ltd in 2006, and 
      
     
     
      
      (ii) from Alan Saunders (the owner of the yacht) and two Hamilton Island tradesmen, Brian Chandler and Craig Berg, who undertook the relevant repairs regarding particular deficiencies in the welding of what might generically be called the “rudder post” housing less than a month before the yacht capsized and  
      
     
     
      
      (iii) from Mr Saunders concerning the positioning of staunchions for a safety rail which did not comply with “Blue Book” requirements, on examination of the yacht in Sydney in mid 2002. The yacht was built between mid 2000 and early 2002 and was sailing in open water by at least May 2002. 
      
    3 The evidence is said to be relevant to proof of the alternative basis of the allegation of manslaughter against Mr Cittadini, that is, gross negligence by omission of the accused. It has no relevance to the prosecution case against Mr Presland. Objection is taken to the admissibility of the evidence by the accused, on the basis that the evidence subject of objection is either that it; 
     
      
      (i) is not relevant (s55  
      Evidence Act 
       1995 – “the Act”), or  
      
     
     
      
      (ii) or ought be excluded pursuant to s 137 or s 135 of the Act. 
      
    4 I earlier ruled that the evidence outlined in 2(i) and (iii) ought be excluded, but that outlined in 2(ii) ought be included. These are the reasons for those decisions.Background to the Application5 The evidence now the subject of objection, refined and narrowed in the course of a “voir dire/Basha” enquiry and as the trial has unfolded, was the subject of objection when a trial before his Honour Judge Sorby was to commence in October 2008. His Honour excluded some of the evidence, then the subject of objection, on the basis that it was “tendency evidence” and did not have “significant probative value”, such as to satisfy admission pursuant to s 97 of the Act. 6 The learned Director appealed his Honour’s ruling and in R v Cittadini [2008] NSWCCA 256, the Court of Criminal Appeal held by majority that the evidence was not “tendency evidence” and was thus not inadmissible by reason of the application of s 97. The Court held that the evidence might be relevant as “circumstantial evidence” of a lack of adequate, or any, supervision or quality control, in the construction process that led to a delivery of a defective yacht. The Court observed that adequate supervision or “quality control” would have detected the defect in the keel which caused the yacht to capsize (causing the deaths of the four deceased) and thus it would have been repaired or dealt with before delivery. 7 As the majority of the Court summarised the alternative Crown case against Mr Cittadini, the Crown puts its case for criminal negligence amounting to manslaughter on the basis that the accused failed to implement a system of adequate supervision and quality control in the construction of the yacht. The Crown seeks to show by identification of certain defects that the supervisory and/or quality control process was inadequate and that as a consequence of that inadequacy the boat was delivered with a defective keel. 8 At [29] Simpson J, for the majority, summarised the position as follows: 
     
      
      (i) Mr Cittadini was director and manager of the company and under a duty to implement a system of the construction of the yacht that incorporated adequate and proper supervision and quality control, 
      
     
     
      
      (ii) he failed to implement such a system, 
      
     
     
      
      (iii) that failure (or breach of duty) resulted in the delivery of a yacht with a defective keel, 
      
     
     
      
      (iv) the defective keel was the cause of the deaths. 
      
    9 Her Honour identified the evidence excluded by Sorby DCJ as going to the second matter “the alleged failure to implement an adequate system”, which caused the delivery of a yacht with a defective keel. Her Honour categorised the evidence sought to be admitted as “circumstantial evidence” from which the jury would be required to “draw inferences”, that the system was “inadequate and negligent” [30]-[31]. She said the evidence goes to “the correct characterisation of the system”. She noted that none of the instances of defective workmanship of itself would prove the system was inadequate or negligent, in combination it might. Her Honour pointed out that the asserted breach of duty was in “the implementation of the system of work”. She noted that the issue of the necessary causal connection between the alleged breach and the cause of death was a question for the jury, not the Court. She also observed it was inappropriate for the Court to determine that the evidence is admissible for “non tendency” purposes as there may be reasons that the evidence is “inadmissible” and the Court had not seen the evidence in a form in which it would be tendered. 10 The issue of admissibility now argued was one which could not be resolved at the commencement of the trial and had to be considered at such time as the relevant evidence in relation to the circumstances of the construction of the yacht was available such as to put the objected evidence in proper context and to understand what was relevant to determining what a reasonable person in the position of the accused would do. (Some of the evidence was not in “statement” form, hence a “Basha” inquiry.) Her Honour pointed out in her judgment that the correct analysis of the Crown case was that it was not part of the Crown’s case, on the alternative basis, that Mr Cittadini knew or even ought to have known of the defective keel. That is relevant to the first basis upon which it presents its case (Cittadini [25]). The ‘non tendency’ purpose of the evidence was that the inadequacy of the “system” was the cause of the delivery of the yacht, with a negligently constructed keel (Cittadini [26]). The Crown would seek to show the supervisory process was inadequate and negligent by showing an accumulation of defects. The negligence in supervision allowed a yacht with a defective keel to be delivered (Cittadini [27]). The Relevant Legislative and other Principles11 In proof of guilt of manslaughter by criminal negligence through omission, apart from having to prove relevant duty of care to the deceased persons relevant to the particular charges by reason of the alleged omission(s) by the accused, he was in breach of a duty of care owed to a particular deceased and that the omission caused the death of a particular deceased, the prosecution must prove that such omission merited criminal punishment because: 
     
      
      (i) it fell so far short of the standard of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances and 
      
     
     
      
      (ii) it involved such a high risk that death or really serious bodily harm would follow and  
      
     
     
      
      (iii) the degree of negligence involved in the omission(s) is so serious that it should be treated as criminal conduct. 
      
    12 S 55 of the Act provides as to the meaning of “relevant evidence” that:  
     
      
      “(1) The evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.” 
      
     
     
      
      No issue adverse to admissibility arises under s 55(2) of the Act. 
      
    13 S 137 of the Act provides: 
     
      
      “In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.” 
      
     
     
      
      “Probative value” is defined in the Act to mean,  
      “the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue” 
      .  
      
    14 The “danger of unfair prejudice” has been discussed in a number of authorities such as R v BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131 (at 139, 151), R v GK (2001) 53 NSWLR 317 (at [30] per Mason P), R v Sing-Bal (1997) 92 A Crim R 397 (at 403), R v Yates [2002] NSWCCA (at [252]), R v Haoui [2005] NSWCCA 209, and in a common law context R v Swaffield & Anor (1995) 192 CLR 159 (at 192).15 The relevant ‘fact in issue’ is, whether the accused failed to establish systems of construction that, if they had been adopted, would have prevented the yacht being delivered with a defective keel. The Evidence the Subject of Objection - Hull Welding16 The evidence the prosecution seeks to lead in relation to the welding of the hull was given on the voir dire by Travis Tuck, a technician for Australian NDT Services Pty Ltd and his “employer”, Ross McNeill the General Manager of that company. It is concerned with non-destructive testing of metal products and objects; including welding, amongst other tasks. The basis of their oral evidence is to be found in the report prepared by Mr Tuck from his examination of the hull of Excalibur conducted on 15 September 2006 (Exhibit 4 on the voir dire) the admissibility of which as a document has not been discussed but which I assume for the purposes of this judgment. He conducted a visual examination of the hull, conducted testing by “eddy current” (an “oscilloscope type” instrument), which he said was concerned with the keel area (although his report says otherwise) and separate radiographic testing of twelve random areas by 22 x-ray images. 17 The location of radiograph testing was assisted by Mr Saunders who was concerned to determine whether the hull was in condition to be used again. The examination occurred at a property on the Mornington Peninsular four years after the capsize. Mr Tuck using a standard that he misdescribed as AWSD 1.1 (but which in fact was AWSD 1.2), which is a standard, or code, applicable in the United States for aluminium welding amongst other matters relating to aluminium. He concluded from his radiographic examination that 19 of the 22 plates revealed non-compliance with the “American Welds Standard”. No defects were found in the welding examined by ‘eddy current’ method. Mr Tuck did not observe on visual examination any cracking in welds examined by him. His visual examination was confined to the interior of the hull, as the exterior was covered by fibreglass or an epoxy resin. Mr Tuck gave evidence of examples of non-compliance (which are coded in the report) as varying between “incomplete root penetration”, “uniform porosity”, “gas porous welds” and/or “transverse cracks” in welds. These expressions are explained in the evidence on the voir dire. Mr Tuck was a technician skilled in undertaking the non-destructive testing and interpreting the results of his testing, however he was assisted in that regard by Mr McNeill, who examined the radiographic plates and made his own comments in a covering letter. 18 Summarizing Mr McNeill’s evidence, he expressed the view that the testing revealed that the welds were defective in a range of ways by reference to the ‘Standard” and said that the non compliance reflected a “lack of quality control”. He said in the absence of any standard applying in Australia in relation to the welding of aluminium, there were still procedures for welding and testing welders that could be obtained from the aluminium manufacturer, the materials supplier, or the welding supplier. The “American” standards may be downloaded from the internet for a fee, but they did not strictly apply in Australia. He said for the purposes of “quality control” that there was a wide range of inspection techniques including visual inspection, through to ultrasound and radiography. Visual inspection would reveal obvious defects. He said that the methods of inspection were provided for in the ‘Standard’. His inspection of the yacht visually revealed some corrosion or “oxidising” from immersion in salt water but not “a tremendous lot”. He could not examine the aluminium externally covered by epoxy paint or fibreglass. Internally there was some oxide showing. There was no evidence from him of visual observation of cracking in the welds he may have examined. There is no evidence of any records kept by him of any of welds he may have examined. There was some conflict in the evidence of Mr Tuck and Mr McNeill as to whether finding defects was common place under radiography. Mr Tuck said a defect was usually found but may still comply with the ‘Standard” (893). Mr McNeill said, “you normally don’t see many defects” (967).Rudder Post Housing and Placement of Staunchions19 The evidence relevant to the inadequate welding of the rudder housing, comes primarily from observations of Mr Saunders and from the two tradesmen working at Hamilton Island in August/September 2002, Mr Chandler and Mr Berg. The evidence from Mr Saunders is to the effect that during a race in the Hamilton Island area the rudder housing broke free. Subsequent investigation by Mr Chandler and Mr Berg revealed inadequate welding of the housing box to the hull and of a plate required to secure it. Mr Chandler and Mr Berg re-welded this area. Mr Saunders said that when the rudder housing broke his visual observation revealed deficiencies in the welding, although he admitted no expertise in that area. 20 As to the placing of the staunchions Mr Saunders gave evidence that when the yacht was submitted to Cruising Yacht Club of Australia inspection to participate in a race Southport the staunchions at the rear of the boat were “2.1 or 2.2” instead of “about 2 metres” apart as required by the ‘Blue Book’, which sets out standards for ocean racing yachts. The relevant passage of the ‘Blue Book’ in fact requires them to be 2.2 metres apart, but I accept that an official of the CYC required relevant staunchions to be closer together by .1 of a metre. This was done (with assistance from Mr Cittadini) to comply with the direction of the Yachting official.SubmissionsDefence Submissions21 It is submitted by the accused that the Crown has particularised the alternative case of failure to implement a system of adequate supervision and quality control in the construction of the yacht by alleging that the accused was negligent in failing to do the following things: 
     
      
      (a) ensure that “standard” welding procedures were adopted in the construction of the yacht; 
      
     
     
      
      (b) ensure that welders engaged in welding the yacht do test plates; and 
      
     
     
      
      (c) ensure that spot checks be conducted on a regular basis in respect of the construction of the yacht  
      
    22 It is not alleged that the accused was negligent in failing to do the following things: 
     
      
      (a) employ more staff; 
      
     
     
      
      (b) employ staff with maritime experience; 
      
     
     
      
      (c) employ only staff with experience in yacht construction; 
      
     
     
      
      (d) radiograph the yacht prior to delivery; 
      
     
     
      
      (e) use different tools and machinery; 
      
     
     
      
      (f) use someone other than Mr Presland to construct the keel; 
      
     
     
      
      (g) employ staff with different qualifications to those who were employed. 
      
    23 It is submitted that what must be assessed for the purposes of s 55 of the Act is the extent to which, if at all, the evidence in question could rationally affect the assessment of the probability that the accused failed to establish systems of construction that would have been implemented by a reasonable person in the accused’s position and “would have prevented the yacht being delivered with a defective keel”. 24 As to the deficiencies in welding of the rudder housing and the staunchion placements it is submitted that asserted deficiencies would not have been prevented or detected (and remedied) by a system of construction that would have been implemented by a reasonable person in the accused’s position. The presence of deficiencies does not, of itself, tend to establish either of that proposition or the proposition that they would not have been prevented by any system not implemented by the accused. It is submitted that the deficiencies as to the staunchions and the rudder housing were discovered in the period after delivery during what may properly be described as “shake down sails”. These may be regarded as part of a “system” designed to detect deficiencies and then correct them, as occurred here. 25 In respect of the deficiencies identified by Australian NDT Pty Ltd staff, discovered by the use of radiography, there is no suggestion that a reasonable person in the accused’s position would have radiographed the yacht. This is conceded by the prosecution. It is submitted that there is no evidence that the deficiencies would have been prevented or detected by some other system of construction that would have been implemented by a reasonable person in the accused’s position. It is submitted that it may be concluded that the Crown has failed to adduce any evidence tending to show that the asserted deficiencies would have been prevented or detected (and remedied) by a system of construction that was not implemented by the accused and would have been implemented by a reasonable person in his position. 26 It was submitted that, assuming that the evidence of the asserted deficiencies does tend to establish that they would have been prevented, or detected (and remedied), by a system of construction that was not implemented by the accused and would have been implemented by a reasonable person in his position, the Crown must show a logical process of reasoning by which it may be concluded that the failure to implement that system caused the yacht to be delivered with a defective keel. In assessing that issue this Court should note that while the other alleged defects related to a planned part of the yacht, the cutting (and welding back together) of the keel was a completely “unprogrammed event”. It was not part of the design of the keel and was a gross variation from the specified design of the keel. On the assumption that the accused was not informed of the cutting and welding back together of the keel (the assumption made for the purposes of the Crown’s alternative case: Simpson J at [27]), the person or persons who cut the keel and welded it back together must have decided to keep such a major departure from the construction plan secret from the accused. In such circumstances, the welding back together of the keel may well occur without adoption of proper methods for welding and without the application of standard monitoring procedures. The strength of an inference from inadequate processes of supervision or quality control in respect of programmed steps in the construction of a yacht must be very limited where the particular defect in question was not programmed and takes place in secret. It is submitted that standard quality control methods that might work for programmed work may well be completely ineffective for “unprogrammed” and “secret” work – so that failure to adopt such monitoring methods may have made no difference whatever to the outcome. It is submitted that it is difficult to see how they could have prevented the yacht being delivered with a defective keel as the prosecution presents this case. Thus, there would not be the necessary causal connection between the failure to adopt such methods and the negligent defect that caused the deaths. 27 With regard to the evidence of asserted deficiencies relating to welding it is submitted that the following points are material on the basis that Mr Presland made the relevant ‘cut’ to the keel:  
     
      
      (a) the person (Mr Presland) who, on the Crown case, cut the keel and welded it back together, was fully qualified to perform that work. Systems designed to ensure proper qualification of welders could not have prevented what happened, 
      
     
     
      
      (b) since the operation of cutting the keel and welding it back together was unprogrammed and, on the Crown alternative case, the accused was not aware of the operation (indeed, he had expressly directed that the keel was not to be cut per Derek Harris a boilermaker/welder), Mr Presland must have decided to keep such a major departure from the construction plan secret from the accused. In such circumstances, the welding back together of the keel might well occur in a rush and without adoption of proper methods. A system designed to ensure adoption of proper procedures cannot operate in such circumstances and could not have prevented what happened.  
      
     
     
      
      If a third party, or Mr Presland, was responsible for the cuts:  
      
     
     
      
      (c) it should be noted that the operation could have been conducted in less than 6 hours, and there was nothing suspicious about the keel after the operation had concluded, any system of monitoring that might be adopted (short of radiography of the yacht) was most unlikely to detect what had happened.  
      
    28 The accused submits that it is extremely difficult to see how any processes that would have been adopted by a reasonable person in the accused’s position to prevent other deficiencies could have prevented or detected the deficiencies in respect of the cutting (and welding) of the keel. No evidence has been adduced to support the existence of such a causal link. The accused’s counsel asked rhetorically: how (for example) might a system of construction that would have ensured that stanchions on the yacht complied with AYF regulations have prevented or detected the cutting of the keel? 29 As to the objection pursuant to s 137 Evidence Act 1995, it is submitted that the evidence has very low probative value in respect of the use to which it may be put, in the context of other matters raised as relevant. It is submitted also as to “the danger of unfair prejudice” that while sometimes it may be assumed that a jury will follow judicial directions, that is certainly not always the case (see, for example, R v Ibrahim [2001] NSWCCA 72 at [33]; R v Abdul-Razzak, Razzak & Razzak [2006] NSWCCA 195; R v GAC [2007] NSWCCA 315, at [87]). Based on that last judgment (through Giles JA) it is submitted that while the fundamental assumption of a criminal trial is that the jury acts on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge are well known, “prejudicial effect, however, is to be evaluated without such a foreclosing assumption”. In this case, there is a real the danger that the jury may conclude that the accused is a “sloppy boat builder” and, as a result, the evidence may be misused to ‘sheet home’ blame so to speak unfairly or improperly. Crown Submissions30 In general terms in relation to the objection taken as to the relevance of the evidence the Crown said its case was “there were no systems of supervision in place and no systems of quality control in place”. The Crown submits that laying down of weld procedures, testing welder qualification, the use of standards available for welding, regular programmed and unprogrammed visual inspections, requirement of reporting provisions, supervision, adequate instruction to tradespersons, inspections of the product of each stage of the construction were matters that would have provided a system to prevent the delivery of a defective keel. 31 The probative effect of any evidence of this type, bearing in mind it was circumstantial evidence, required consideration of all the circumstances taken as a whole. Although it is submitted that each of the circumstances sought to be adduced had “significant probative value”. 32 Generally, on matters relating to s 137 Evidence Act, the Crown submitted that the evidence sought to be adduced has probative value and no unfair prejudice had been demonstrated. The evidence could not be “misused by the jury” in that it would invoke horror or some other emotion, or any other unfair prejudice. 33 Particularly in relation to the detail of the evidence, the subject of objection, to summarise the prosecution’s position it submitted:  
     
      
      (a) in respect of the alleged deficient welding in the hull, the purpose of tender was to show that Mr Cittadini failed to implement any, or any adequate, processes of supervision of quality control in the construction process and this failure resulted in the supply to Mr Saunders of the defective yacht. It is not tendered to show that Mr Cittadini might have utilised radiograph testing to discover defects in the welds nor should have employed the standard used by NDT. Nor is it suggested Mr Cittadini should have employed such testing. The evidence of radiograph testing is simply evidence that discloses defects in the welds. The evidence is intended to be used as “one circumstance” in support of the case of the absence or of inadequacy of supervision or quality control that would or could have prevented delivery of the yacht in a defective condition. The evidence of the NDT investigation was available to enable the jury to draw an inference, in conjunction with other defects, that an inadequate and negligent system of supervision was in operation. Perhaps the best summary of the Crown’s position on this aspect is in the oral submissions of the learned Crown Prosecutor at p993 -994 of the transcript.  
      
     
     
      
      (b) As to defects in the rudder housing it is submitted that the significant defect observed by Mr Saunders and the tradesman, would have been capable of being prevented by proper supervision and quality control checks. It was on a section of the boat that was critical to sea worthiness and safety and a major mechanical component, the engineering and construction of which was the responsibility of the accused. Mere visual checking would have revealed the defects and they could have been remedied during manufacture”. It was submitted that it was not to point that it would be expected to find such a defect in a “shake down cruise”. The evidence is said to be a circumstance in support of the inference that an inadequate and negligent system of supervision and quality control was in place.  
      
     
     
      
      (c) In relation to the spacing of the support staunchions, essentially it was submitted that the boat was a ocean racing yacht and was meant to be available for Category 1 racing, that is open water racing, and as it was constructed for that purpose, the builder was aware of the requirements calling for the fitting of “jackstays” and “safety rails and fences” and would have known that these were preconditions for participation in yacht racing, particularly as Mr Cittadini was an experienced sailor. The requirements were readily available in the form of the ‘Blue Book’, which set out the requirements of yachts participating in different categories by the Australian Yachting Federation. The Crown conceded that the error in construction, claimed by Mr Saunders but not the subject of any other direct evidence, of approximately .1 of a metre might be regarded as “insignificant” and it would not effect the sea worthiness of the yacht, but that the requirements were so specific for obvious safety reasons and it prevented the yacht being raced as constructed. It is asserted that the spacing requirements should have formed part of the construction drawings and details and would have been easily capable of being installed correctly during manufacture and were not something that could be left to be discovered and remedied during any shake down. It is said that the “defect” is evidence of a circumstance in proof of the inadequacy of the systems of supervision and quality control in the construction of the yacht. The error could easily have been found. As with the deficiency in the welding of the rudder post housing, these matters were not those that could reasonably be expected to be ‘ironed out’ or detected in the “shake down” phase of the yacht.  
      
    Consideration34 It is important to note from the outset that the prosecution case, in the alternative, is that the cutting of the keel and its re-welding was not known by Mr Cittadini to have occurred. If he knew that had occurred that would be relevant to prove the primary case against him (Cittadini [13] [27]). Although I propose to deal with each part of the evidence separately, I appreciate that the strength of inferences from a particular circumstance may strengthen when considered alongside other circumstance(s).35 The evidence of the deficiencies in the welding of the rudder housing to my mind present little difficulty both in relation to the issues of relevance or in relation to potential exclusion pursuant to s 137, or alternatively s 135 Evidence Act. The existence of an obvious deficiency in welding in a vital part of the yacht which readily could be identified by visual examination is of substantial, at least, probative value, and could not be said to not be able “to rationally affect directly or indirectly the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue”, as previously identified in the submissions of Mr Odgers SC. This defect is not one that reasonably (or in the mind of the owner of the yacht) was one which could be expected to be identified in “shake down exercises”. It was one that a reasonable person in the accused’s position could have identified or would be expected to identify. The unfair prejudice is said to be the misuse of the evidence for “tendency purposes”. In my view appropriate direction minimises any risk of misuse of the evidence in that regard although may not necessarily remove it. I do not agree with the prosecution that there is no danger of unfair prejudice in the manner in which it has been identified by the accused’s counsel, notwithstanding the observations of Giles J in R v GAC at [83]-[87]. In fact, adopting the approach that his Honour recommends, I am of the view that the risk of, or danger of, unfair prejudice is outweighed by the probative value of the evidence. 36 In relation to the staunchions the Crown submitted in the course of oral submissions that the nub of the deficiency was that the placement of the staunchions (the workmanship of which is not the subject of any criticism) was “not fit for purpose” or not capable of satisfying the “purposive” test of construction. The Crown case however for “fit for purpose” must be understood in the context of the case it seeks to establish. This is not an action in “negligence” at common law. That case is one of a lack of system which otherwise would have detected, in the course of construction, or before delivery, the particular deficiency in the keel. The failure to put staunchions in at the distances required by the “Blue Book” (if indeed the evidence of Mr Saunders establishes that) does not speak of an absence of system which would lead to the delivery of a yacht with a “deficient” keel, notwithstanding consideration of other relevant “circumstances” to the issues requiring proof by the prosecution under this alternative basis for manslaughter. Building the boat with regard to the requirements of the “Blue Book”, to make the boat eligible for particular categories of competitive sailing, even as a safely issue, does not go to a system of construction that the Crown is required to establish ought to or could have existed, such that a reasonable person in the accused’s position would or could have implemented to prevent the delivery of a negligently constructed yacht, that is with a defective keel. Evidence of the placement of the staunchions contrary to the ‘Blue Book”, notwithstanding potential ‘safety considerations’, is not, in the absence of evidence of any lack of structural integrity, inherent design, engineering fault or any manufacturing weakness, is not something that rationally, directly or indirectly leads to proof of the “fact(s) in issue”, for a case of manslaughter by negligent omission, even when taken into account with other circumstances.37 In any event, even if relevant, the matters identified above as to the workmanship of the staunchions both as to design, manufacture and installation significantly diminish the probative value of the evidence. Further, the ‘fit for purpose’ issue identified by the Crown, even if it characterises correctly the relevance of the evidence, is quite remote from both the fundamental lack of ’fitness for purpose’ of the keel such as to speak of an absence of system with any real force by itself or in combination with other matters. Here in any event one would reasonably expect that the requirements of placement of staunchions for the purpose of ocean racing, was something that would be detected in the course of ‘rating‘ the yacht before it entered its first “category” race, as opposed to sailing the boat in ‘non race’ conditions on Port Phillip Bay, or even while sailing up the coast to commence racing from Sydney. In all these circumstances I regard the probative value of this evidence as slight, perhaps even neutralised by the weight of other considerations. The evidence of Mr Saunders may be regarded as hearsay evidence. There is an ever-present risk of unfair prejudice, as identified by the accused that, notwithstanding appropriate direction and given the availability of other circumstances, outweighs the probative value of the evidence.38 As to the evidence of investigations and opinions from Mr Tuck and Mr McNeill (“NDT” evidence), noting the character of the prosecution case for the alternative basis for manslaughter and the “fact(s) in issue” the assessment of which the evidence is claimed to directly or indirectly affect, the relevant “system” would have to be one which detected unprogrammed work, performed without the knowledge of Mr Cittadini (perhaps even contrary to instruction) and possibly over a relatively short period of time (less that 6 hours) and in secret. In these, or some of these, circumstances the failure to comply with an “American Weld Standard”, not strictly or legally applicable, in the context of the evidence of the yacht’s designer David Lyons, an alleged failure to have any or some supervision to ensure test welds, and/or inquiries of various sources as identified by Mr McNeill, does not rationally effect the assessment of the facts in issue.39 David Lyons has given evidence that he provided the “naval architecture” for the yacht, comprising its shape and some of the construction scantlings (the dimensions of the structural components within the yacht), including designing the hull, the keel, the rudder, the mast rigging and the dimensions of the sails. He did not impose any requirements in respect to engineering or methods of construction, particular methods or standards of welding or matters relating to quality control. There was no “quality assurance” component required in the construction of the yacht. These were matters left to the discretion of ‘Applied Engineering’. There is no evidence in the trial that the owner of the yacht made or set requirements in relation to “quality assurance” matters, in accordance with any Australian or other Standards. It was not part of the agreement for the construction of the yacht. There was no requirement for independent engineering standards or testing to be undertaken. In fact the evidence is clear from Albert Cittadini and Mr Lyons that no system of “quality assurance” was required. Of course, “quality assurance” as understood by Mr Lyons and Albert Cittadini may not necessarily in any event be a yardstick for “quality control” and do not necessarily mean the same thing. Mr Lyons described the cutting of the keel as not only “a gross variation from the specified method for constructing the keel” but said that it would be “inherently dangerous”. 40 It was submitted by the prosecution that the evidence of Mr Harris and Mr Cittadini was that the accused was aware of “types of systems and quality controls” that had been employed in other projects and that Mr Cittadini “would have been aware of the existence of various standards of welding that he might have used in such systems of supervision and/or quality control”. This submission ignores the import of the evidence of Albert Cittadini as to the lack of relevance of other projects and the application of quality assurance standards of those projects to the construction of the yacht in question. A quality assurance standard, such as described in the evidence of Mr McNeill, was not required by design or agreement. It should be noted that the very central issue of this trial is concerned with a defect in the yacht that was so contrary to the design specifications of the yacht that no issue of compliance with a particular standard or “quality assurance” arises. 41 I accept the concern expressed by Mr Odgers in reply (pages 999-1000), underpinning part of the objection to this evidence on relevance, but also relevant to discretionary considerations, concerning the failure of any witness, including experts such as Mr Gray and Mr Burns, the metallurgists, to suggest that quality assurance standards were required, ought to have been sought or insisted upon, or might reasonably be expected in the welding of the yacht. Mr McNeill’s evidence, it might be said, casts little or no light upon the practical situation in the construction of the yacht, unlike the evidence of Mr Gray. Although this point of the trial is not the time for final pronouncements on the matters identified by the Crown as “particulars” of the absence of any, or adequate, systems, some earlier identified appear not supported by the evidence otherwise admissible. I am of the view ultimately that the evidence the subject of objection does not satisfy s 55 of the Act. Further, both to underline that finding, but perhaps more pertinent to the issue of assessing the probative value of the evidence, there is no evidence of any defect in the hull’s operation by reason of the welds examined by Mr Tuck, no evidence of leaking, structural failure, failure of the welds contributing to the failure of any other part of the yacht. There is no evidence that the defects in the welds identified by NDT were either “seal welds” or “structural welds”, as discussed by Mr Gray. The prosecution puts this as a matter adverse to the submissions justifying rejection of the evidence. In my view these are matters favourable to the defence objections in the context of assessing the probative value of the evidence and its relevance. 42 Although the objected evidence was not available to the prosecution, no practical attempt was made particularise these matters in the evidence of Mr Gray. Little evidence has been led from Mr McNeill about practical implications of the alleged defects during his evidence on the voir dire. In assessing the probative value of the evidence, in the context of a claim failure to undertake adequate or any ‘spot checks’, it is the case that the defects were not visibly identifiable, or revealed by ‘eddy current’ detection but only identified by radiographic examination. Even allowing for the Crown’s submissions as to the significance of the use of radiography to detect defects in the context of the objection, as opposed to being an examination technique required of the accused, the absence of observable defect and evidence of physical consequence of the defect is a matter to be taken into account in assessing the probative value of the evidence. In this context I also note the earlier cited observations of Senior Counsel for the accused as matters that diminish the probative value of the evidence. 43 The danger of unfair prejudice, in the sense of misuse of the evidence, is real and looms larger when considering that this evidence concerns a “latent defect”. The misuse of the evidence in my view would be greater, even with careful directions, than would be case of an obvious defect in welding as might be exposed in race conditions. The judgment of this aspect includes consideration of what was observed by Giles JA in GAC. Here in my view the danger identified outweighs the probative value of the evidence. Further in this matter the danger of unfair prejudice is increased because issues of the claimed failure of adequate or any system, in the welding of the hull, or relevant to that issue arising from Mr McNeill’s evidence, noting the evidence of Greg Brown an experienced builder of aluminium boats, have not been taken up, within permissible limits of examination in chief, with any relevant witness to that aspect of the construction of the yacht. In this regard I point to the evidence of Derek Harris who, according to him, welded seventy percent of the hull. Neither the “Standard” discussed by Mr McNeill, the competence of Mr Harris, or his methods of welding etc have been seriously raised with him. 44 There is procedural unfairness in my view that arises with the introduction of the evidence the subject of objection, if evidence germane to its practical relevance has not previously been addressed. For example, to recall Mr Harris would have the effect of exacerbating matters, which if relevant, are still only circumstantial, in proof of an alternative case which even allowing for this evidence would have difficulties in establishing the kind of “wicked” or “gross” negligence sufficient to prove manslaughter. Foreseeability of death or really serious bodily harm of a reasonable person in the position of the accused, one might have thought, are somewhat more present in cases of breach of duty of care by omission arising, as usually is the case in manslaughter trials, by failure to provide medical care to a person when the alleged offender has some knowledge of the deceased’s antemortem condition or his or her presentation.

   JUDGMENTOn no case to answer; see transcript p 12301 HIS HONOUR: Adrian Presland, the accused, is on trial in respect of four counts of manslaughter particularised in the indictment presented at the commencement of this trial. These charges arise from the capsize of a yacht ‘Excalibur’ off the coast of New South Wales, near Seal Rocks on the mid north coast, on 16 September 2002. Four of the six crew died as a consequence.2 Although the prosecution case is not closed, there being no further evidence to be called in the Crown case against Mr Presland, application was made on Monday and early Tuesday, 16 and 17 March 2009, for a verdict by direction on the basis that the Crown case is not capable of establishing the essential ingredients of the offences charged against the accused.3 The test for directing a verdict of not guilty on the basis advanced by the accused through his learned senior counsel Mr Gray is set out in decisions such as R v R (1998) 18 NSWLR 74 (particularly at 77B and following where Gleeson CJ discusses the implications of such power) and in the High Court judgment of Doney v The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 27 (per curiam at 214-215). These tests, perhaps differently formulated in expression, were applied in R v Rivkin [2005] NSWCCA 7 at [165].4 Although the application proceeded in relation to two bases upon which it was anticipated the prosecution case was conducted, the application narrowed to consideration of the issue of Mr Presland’s potential liability as a principal in the first degree and to matters concerning evidence or lack of evidence on that point. The prosecution in the course of submissions, referring to the detail of the accused’s counsel’s written submissions, no longer presses the issue of “accessorial liability” which was discussed at the commencement of the trial.5 The charges brought against the accused are charges of manslaughter by reason of criminal negligence. The application advanced on behalf of the accused, if I understood it correctly, proceeded primarily on the basis that there was no evidence of the relevant foreseeability required to be proved of the risk of death or really serious bodily harm by a reasonable person in the position of the accused.6 As I apprehend the Crown’s submissions, the understanding of the accused as to the basis of the case brought against him for manslaughter in this respect is not disputed and the principles arising discussed in cases such as Lavender v The Queen (2005) 220 CLR 67 and R v Tak Tak (1996) 14 NSWLR 226.7 It is submitted for the accused, in relation to this aspect of the matter, that in the context of what the prosecution must prove and the particulars that have been supplied to the accused of the case against him, there is no evidence that a reasonable person in the position of the accused could have any knowledge or appreciation whatsoever of the function of the keel, the possibility or likely consequences of the failure of the keel and/or whether there is a high risk that death or really serious bodily harm would follow such a failure.8 The features of the matter from the perspective of the accused are set out in para 19 of the submissions which I will come back to shortly. This aspect of the application concludes by the assertion that: 
     
      
      “There is no evidence capable of establishing one of the admittedly essential ingredients of the Crown case against Mr Presland, namely the foreseeability to a reasonable person having Presland’s attributes and experience of the ‘catastrophic’ consequences of failure of the keel or that they carried with them a high risk of death or grievous bodily harm”. 
      
    9 It is further submitted on behalf of the accused that there is a second basis for directing an acquittal. It is submitted that there is no evidence, upon which the accused could be convicted, which is capable of establishing that the accused was the person that acted or failed to act as particularised and particularly cut the keel horizontally such as to cause the flaw in the keel that directly contributed to the capsize of the ‘Excalibur’ and thus the deaths of the four deceased, the subject of the charges.10 In relation to this aspect of the matter it is pointed out in the written submissions, as the case is a circumstantial evidence case, that in order to secure a verdict by direction the accused must do more than establish that an inference of guilt is not the only one available and/or that other inferences inconsistent with guilt have not been excluded. A judge cannot direct a verdict of acquittal if there is evidence upon which a reasonable jury could find the accused guilty, even though one or more reasonable hypotheses consistent with innocence can be formulated. It is for the jury to consider the significance of the latter and that submission is underpinned in JMR (1991) 57 ACR 39 (particularly at 43-45 per Lee CJ at CL) and Haas (1986) 22 ACR 299 (at 304). In my view those principles are undoubtedly correct.11 In the course of this aspect of the matter reference is made to the submissions that a “faint scintilla” of evidence is not sufficient to establish a case to answer, citing observations of Jordan CJ in R v Crooks and Hudson (1944) 44 SR (NSW) 398.12 It is submitted in this matter that this is a case where there is simply not “any evidence upon which reasonable men or women could find a verdict of guilty”.13 Just in passing, in relation to the observations of the late Chief Justice Jordan, it should be pointed out that the tests, if I might use that expression, differently expressed in R v R and Doney v The Queen are as follows. Gleeson CJ in R v R said that a judge should only direct an acquittal if he concludes there is “no evidence upon which a jury properly directed could properly convict”. This could be expressed by saying that “the question is whether there is evidence on which the accused could lawfully be convicted”.14 In Doney v The Queen the High Court said: 
     
      
      “It follows that if there is evidence (even if tenuous of inherently weak or vague) which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberations and that evidence is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left to the jury for its decision or to put the matter in more usual terms, a verdict of not guilty may be directed only if there is a defect in the evidence such that taken at its highest it will not sustain a verdict of guilty.”  
      
    15 There would appear from these authorities four slightly different formulations of the same general principle expressed from different perspectives. They seem to all apply at this point and certainly, in the context of submissions made by the accused as to the character of the evidence and the like, the observations that I have quoted from Doney seem most apposite.16 The submissions on behalf of the accused include the proposition that, putting aside the question of the opportunity for other persons to have cut the keel which is a matter for the jury to consider of course, the Crown case has, it is said, a more “fundamental” problem on the basis that the particulars provided to the accused as to the character of its case: 
     
      
      “Reduces to little more than the simplistic proposition that since someone cut the keel and since Presland was involved with the construction of the keel, that someone must have been him. That conclusion or inference just does not follow”. 
      
     
     
      
      The written submissions go on to say: 
      
     
     
      
      “It is not merely that it is only one of the number of possible inferences that might be rationally capable of being drawn, that would be a matter for the jury rather, it is not a rational inference at all”. 
      
     
     
      
      Other comments are made in para 29 of the submissions. 
      
    17 The problem with the submission is that the “conclusion or inference” referred to in para 28 does “not necessarily” follow, not that “inevitably” it does not follow. The Crown case is not fundamentally reduced solely to what is summarised above. In the context of the fact that Mr Presland was the person who had fabricated and constructed the keel before it was sent off to have the bulb attached there is a need for consideration of the evidence of the opinions of, for example, Mr Gray and Mr Burns, the metallurgists, as to the character of the horizontal cut, its relationship to alterations made to the ram compartment and particularly the cover plate, the relationship of the horizontal cut to the leading edge pole and the order in which various events would have occurred. This is a very brief analysis, if I could call it that, of the evidence. I am of course excluding what appears to be conceded in the case that the so-called box which was placed on what I loosely call “the top” of the keel must have been placed after the transverse or horizontal cut. The prosecution says that the inference available given the evidence of the stages of construction, is that Mr Presland made that horizontal cut which led to the welding of the skins of the keel together and hence the fundamental defect in the construction that led to the sinking of the boat.18 I appreciate in relation to this aspect of the matter, by reference to the submissions and any reasonable assessment of the evidence, that there are a wide range of reasonable possibilities or hypotheses inconsistent with guilt in this trial. I do not propose to go through them. The parties will do that no doubt for one or other purposes during the course of the trial. There are possibilities conceded by Mr Gray, for example, as to the circumstances of the making of the horizontal cut and its relationship to the leading edge pole arising out of opinions of Associate Professor Yeomans. I bear in mind, of course, in making this judgment I can have no regard to Professor Yeomans’ evidence.19 I note evidence relating to the difference in the quality of welds that are said to be clearly made by Mr Presland as opposed to welds in dispute and what might be drawn from that. I also bear in mind matters arising from the evidence such as the qualities and qualifications of Mr Presland as a welder and the evidence of his denials when interviewed relatively shortly after the event in circumstances where he may have exercised his right to silence. Also there is evidence of his good character, his industry and his finer qualities, as they are relevant to an assessment of the credibility of his denial of guilt and as to the likelihood of him acting as the Crown has identified.20 I understand ultimately that the claim made is one on analysis that the Crown case against Mr Presland is weak, notwithstanding what are said to be strengths arising out of the opinions of Mr Gray in particular. I understand that it may be said on behalf of Mr Presland that a reasonable doubt may be an inevitable consequence from all this material. But in the context of the tests set out in R v R and particularly in Doney, ultimately it is my view that on this basis there is evidence which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberations that is capable of supporting a verdict on this point and, most importantly, as the jury is the constitutional tribunal of fact it must be left to the jury for its ultimate decision. There is no “defect in the evidence” on this matter which taken at its highest is such that the evidence could not sustain a verdict of guilty.21 Dealing with the primary matter advanced on behalf of the accused Mr Presland, those submissions summarised are these: there is no evidence that Mr Presland had built a keel before and there is no evidence that Mr Presland had any familiarity or experience with yachts or sailing or keels. There is no evidence that Mr Presland knew anything or that anyone told him anything about the role of the importance of a keel in a yacht. There is no evidence that people generally in the community at large would realise the function and essential role of a keel in the safe passage of a yacht, et cetera. There is no evidence that either Mr Presland, or a reasonable person in his position, might have realised that to cut the keel across horizontally might be a problem in light of other circumstances therein outlined.22 In relation to this aspect of the matter I am assisted by the learned Crown’s submissions where seriatim he seeks to address the matters raised in the submissions of Mr Gray SC on behalf of his client, citing amongst other things statements made by the accused in the course of an interview with police which might suggest, vis a vis, issues of his knowledge of the function of the keel, the significance of alterations to the keel as he manufactured it.23 The difficulty with the analysis undertaken by Mr Gray SC is that, firstly, it may be said that there is no direct evidence of a number or even all of the matters to which he identified. However, in relation to the issue of “foreseeability”, as it is understood in the case of manslaughter by criminal negligence, the Crown case is one which requires the drawing of an inference from a body of circumstances. It is not incumbent upon the Crown in order to justify the inference, that there be direct evidence of the matters particularised. Of course, the matters particularised have to be seen in the very real context of matters of which there is considerable direct evidence. That includes consideration that Mr Presland was the person who constructed the keel, the order in which events occurred culminating in the horizontal cut, particularly bearing in mind that Mr Presland’s role in the fabrication of the keel, as I understand the way case has been conducted by both parties, continued after the horizontal cut. The fact that the accused was a long time employee of a factory that had an involvement in the construction of yachts from time to time and that, as I understand the Crown case as it touches upon Mr Presland, Mr Cittadini was the Managing Director of the corporation, was responsible for the supervision of the construction of the keel, which must have included to whatever extent supervision of the fabrication of it by Mr Presland. Mr Cittadini was an experienced sailor who had a personal interest in the construction of the yacht for commercial purposes and was himself a yacht owner who had previously constructed yachts in the premises. Mr Presland must have had considerable work related contact with him.24 Ultimately, it seems to me that it could not be said that there is absolutely no prospect of an inference being drawn by the jury of the accused’s knowledge of the significance of a keel in a yacht and the significance of, for example, alterations to the keel, so far as its structural integrity was concerned. In that context I bear in mind the expert evidence about the purpose of welds, the deficiencies particularly in one of the welds on the skins leading inevitably to the shearing away of the fin, and, of course, evidence that seemed to suggest, although this point seemed to be disavowed at least by Mr Cittadini’s counsel at the commencement of the trial, that a properly implemented weld ought theoretically to have left the skins in the same state of strength as they were when they were in fact each one sheet. This is in the context of the Crown case being that the accused fabricated the skins. In all the circumstances if there be evidence of the accused’s involvement in the manufacture of the keel and there be circumstances that may point to he having made the horizontal cut in the manner in which I have described, it may be open to the Crown to draw the inference that it would seek to draw in relation to this issue of foreseeability.25 It is not unreasonable to conclude from my perspective that a reasonable person in the position of the accused knew that this yacht was going to be used for ocean sailing. I do not believe it is unreasonable therefore to conclude that a reasonable person in the place of the accused in all the circumstances of the case would have not foreseen a catastrophic failure of the keel could cause death or really serious bodily harm if that occurred when the boat was in the open ocean.26 Of course in the jury’s analysis of these matters such a conclusion as sought to be drawn by the Crown, may not be the only conclusion, it may be even the less likely conclusion. But in the context of the principles as I have outlined these are matters for the jury. 27 Of course I bear in mind with regard to what Mr Gray SC has put, that a jury will need to be warned against speculation in relation to the drawing of inferences. It will need to be warned about filling gaps in the evidence such as they may be identified, about drawing irrational inferences, about ultimately having to conclude, for example, in relation to this aspect, that the inference to be drawn is the only inference that can be drawn. But these are quintessentially jury tasks. 28 With no disrespect to Mr Gray, and his very careful and considered submissions, he analysis of this aspect of the no case to answer by him, is one that leads to the conclusion that the points he made are essentially a series of arguments for not drawing the inference required by the Crown. The fact that there is no direct evidence does not of course equate to the fact that there is no evidence.29 In any event, ultimately again in relation to this second aspect, I am of the view, in the context of the tests in Doney and R v R, that I could not direct an acquittal and I decline so to do.

      JUDGMENT  
       
      1. This appellant is a juvenile. In any report of these proceedings, he is not to be identified.  
       
      2. On 2 September, 2008 at Moree Children's Court, he came before the court on 32 charges comprised of 32 offences; 8 serious driving offences and 24 criminal offices which I would classify as serious. All of the offences were committed whilst he was on a bond. He was a one man crime wave.  
       
      3. Magistrate Richardson sentenced him to 2 years 7 months control order with a non-parole to expire when 24 months had been served.  
       
      4. He seeks to appeal the sentences and the disqualification periods imposed for the driving offences and to appeal the sentence imposed for the most serious of the aggravated break, enter and steal with intent to commit an indictable offence.  
       
      5. Whilst it is clear his Honour, in setting the head sentence of a control order of 2 years and 7 months for the aggravated break and enter, that is sequence 1 of 32 offences, was intending to set a sentence that reflected the totality of criminality his Honour was then dealing. Regrettably his Honour erred. The jurisdictional limit for any one offence in the Children's Court is two years. Consequently that sentence will need to be marked downwards when I finalise this matter.  
       
      6. The eight driving offences constitute four of driving whilst disqualified, three of driving at a speed and in a manner dangerous to the public and one of driving under the influence of a drug and/or alcohol; probably both.  
       
      7. The circumstances of these offences is that they all occurred over a six day period in January, 2008. The offences are aggravated in that the offender was on a bond. The offences occurred when he was fleeing crime scenes in which he was the perpetrator or one of the perpetrators of the relevant offence.  
       
      8. He was driving a vehicle that was not his own. The offence on 21 January occurred in circumstances of a police pursuit. The offences were on country roads at night when kangaroos or other animals could have been on the highway and on all occasions he was not in a sober state when driving. That he received only four months control orders for the driving offences, suggested a lenient approach by Magistrate Richardson.  
       
      9. The complaint founding the appeal is not about the actual sentence imposed, but the fact that these offences carry a statutory period of disqualification.  
       
      10. The young person now realises that a disqualification until 2017 will impose no end of holes for his career path and social life. In that sense they constitute a handicap to him. While I have not closed my mind to the possibility of giving some amelioration of the disqualification period, it cannot, in the circumstances of those offences, be very much. But assuming that he is successful in the rehabilitation task, I do take the view he ought to get some reward. 
       
      11. His counsel sought a section 33 (1) (c2) bail for the applicant to give him an opportunity to demonstrate that he can rehabilitate and for me to assess his capacity and prospects of rehabilitation.  
       
      12. On my count, the applicant has been serving this control order for some 14 months.  
       
      13. Given the high level of criminal conduct disclosed by each of these driving offences, the immense danger to other occupants of vehicles that may have been on the road and the level of danger to himself and others in his vehicle and the other features of aggravation I have referred to, the convictions must stand on the driving matters, save and except for what I said earlier that in the event of successful completion of this bail he is entitled, in my view to some reward.  
       
      14. If there had been an injury, say a loss of life or bodily limb to him or any of the others, he would then understand when young people commit crime there will be long term effects. Sad though it be that he cannot drive until 2017, by comparison with other potential long term effects, this is also a long term effect of his criminal behaviour. It is a handicap he must bear in employment and social life until 2017 or such shorter period as I ultimately determine. 
       
      15. The aggravated break and enter was committed on 21 January, 2008 that occurred in these circumstances. Between 12.30 am and 5 am on 21 January, 2008, he travelled to 24 Hassel Street, Moree, entered the rear yard of those premises and walked to a rear window. At the rear window he removed a flyscreen that was on a kitchen window. The window was locked but he manipulated it and opened the window. He entered the premises, went through several rooms, including the bedroom where a victim, JR, was lying asleep. He stole $50 in Australian currency, a fake gold ring, a set of keys to a motor vehicle, which was a yellow 2006 Suzuki Swift. He then left the premises in the same time way he came in.  
       
      16. The offence is called an aggravated form of offence because somebody was present there. The reason that that makes it a more serious offence is that had this woman woken up and seen a man, particularly a man of his build in the room, she would rightly have been terrified. The trauma to her would have been great. If it had been a man, there may have been a fight and someone may have been injured. It is for that reason, the potential for greater harm to come, that the matter is said to be aggravated. 17. Standing on its own, this offence, however, would not have attracted a two year control order. But, as I have said, Magistrate Richardson used it as a mechanism for dealing with the total criminality before him. I will have to bring the sentence for it to below 24 months when I finally come to finalise these matters. The question is whether I interfere with the non-parole period.  
       
      Subjective Matters 
       
      18. RD was 16 years and 3 months at the time of the offending I am dealing with. For reasons that no one appears to have investigated thoroughly, he has been difficult to manage from a young age. There were behavioural issues through primary school and worse behavioural issues in secondary, resulting in suspensions. To his credit, during the suspensions, he did attend the PCYC programmes in 2005 in fitness, cooking and work skills whilst on suspension.  
       
      19. I should say that he presents as a young, fit, athletic looking man. What his cooking or work skills are like, I do not know. Hopefully some information will come to me on that in the next few months.  
       
      20. Meanwhile, in 2004, he was coming to the attention of police more and more frequently. He was before the court on two occasions in 2004, three occasions in 2005, two occasions in 2006 and one occasion in 2007 when a control order of 5 months non-parole period was imposed on him, and one occasion in 2008 for the 32 matters I referred to earlier.  
       
      21. He has now been in custody for 14 months on 20th of this month, which I think is a Saturday.  
       
      22. The Juvenile Justice report and the psychological court report presented at the appeal hearing indicates some maturing, growing insight by him into his offending. For example, he wanted to relocate to Nambucca Heads to his 24/25 year old brother, Jeremy. That was a sensible move. Regrettably, it cannot be achieved at least at this time.  
       
      23. He has acquired a Green Card, which is now called a White Card, whilst in custody. He says he works well with his hands, likes mechanical work and has worked in cotton gins. He has a particular interest in commercial cleaning and studied one unit of that at TAFE and would be willing to pursue that course further at TAFE, although I am not sure if it is offered at the Moree TAFE.  
       
      24. He probably has an inquiring mind, if anybody gave him a chance to exercise it. He now appears to recognise he has serious problems with alcohol and drugs. I think he is beginning to understand how they are contributing to his extreme level of risk taking. I do not know that he likes it when I call him a risk taker, but I am trying to demonstrate to him why he presents as one. 
       
      25. Hopefully as he matures he will become less of a risk taker and be more cautious and considered in decisions he makes.  
       
      26. He was desirous to break connections with his Moree peer group. As matters now stand, that cannot be achieved. He does say that of his Moree peer group, many of them are in custody.  
       
      27. After some consideration I have decided that he must be given a line of responsibility somewhere in all this and I am giving it to him in respect of those he chooses to associate with. He knows, and indeed has blamed, in part, them for the mess he was in. If he cannot be responsible, that history may repeat itself. If he can be responsible, his chances of rehabilitation become the greater. 
       
      28. He has indicated he enjoys sport. He is willing to seek out a sporting team in Moree and do all he can do to participate in competitive sport in the area. This is likely to place him in the path of other young sportsmen, hopefully sportsmen who are not drug addicts or alcoholics. Again some level of responsibility is entrusted to him to choose carefully those he chooses to associate with outside the sporting ring.  
       
      29. He has an appalling record of accepting supervision. Hopefully he now understands that those who supervise him are the court's eyes and ears. It is through his supervisors I will learn how he is progressing, what areas will need to be addressed at future progress reports and what areas are progressing well.  
       
      30. In his evidence he requested counselling for drug and alcohol rehabilitation. That he seeks such counselling is a positive sign. In the programme that Juvenile Justice has put before me today, the one thing he will have plenty of, I suspect, is counselling.  
       
      31. He has agreed to do his best not to consume alcohol and drugs for the next six months. He has agreed to accept random urine analysis for the detection of illicit drugs and alcohol. Regrettably that cannot be done through Juvenile Justice and my memory is the Aboriginal Medical Service also declined to participate in that. I do believe, however, that six visits are available to a local GP and I will have that explored on the medical health scheme.  
       
      32. He should understand, if he does not already know, that while some drugs may dissipate within 24 to 36 hours, cannabis, which is the most frequently consumed drug by young Aboriginal men, will stay in the body for two to three weeks. It can be detected on a random urine test, even one that is scheduled. 
       
      33. I have determined to place him on very strict bail conditions. While I am prepared to give him one chance to succeed in all the tasks I have set, I have also told him my most important consideration is the protection of the community from offenders.  
       
      34. He has agreed that if he consumes alcohol or illicit drugs just once, if he commits one driving or one criminal offence, if he refuses to accept supervision by Juvenile Justice, or direction from his family just once, he is liable to be returned to custody. 
       
      35. I have taken great pains to ask him if he is up to all this and he says he is.  
       
      36. I am prepared to accept what he says and grant him bail starting from today.  
       
      The bail conditions will be these.  
       
      ·  
      That he will be of good behaviour.  
       
      ·  
      That he reside at his parents address, 10 ------ Avenue, Moree. 
       
      ·  
      That he will accept supervision by Juvenile Justice and accept all reasonable directions from his case manager with Juvenile Justice. 
       
      ·  
      That he will pursue the drug and alcohol counselling as set out in the Juvenile Justice report of 18 March, 2009. 
       
      ·  
      That he will accept the Forensic Mental Health programme for on-going psychological intervention as set out in the Juvenile Justice report of 18 March, 2009. 
       
      ·  
      That he will accept the Education/Employment Programme, ""Links To Learning"", as set out in the Juvenile Justice programme of 18 March, 2009. 
       
      ·  
      That he will accept the Post-Release Support Programme, ""Pathfinders"", as set out in the Juvenile Justice report of 18 March,2009. 
       
      ·  
      That he will abstain from the consumption of all alcoholic beverages for the first 6 months of the bail period. After that he will have a chance to drink responsibly. 
       
      ·  
      He will abstain from the consumption of all non prescribed illicit drugs for the duration of the bail period. 
       
      ·  
      That he will submit to urine analysis testing as directed by his case manager, assuming such a service is available from the local GP on the medical health schemes.  
       
      ·  
      Refusal to participate in a drug and alcohol test will be deemed a breach of bail.  
       
      ·  
      Supplying urine sourced from another person will be deemed a breach of bail.  
       
      ·  
      He will do all he can to maintain attendance at TAFE.  
       
      ·  
      He is to participate in a community sporting club activity of his own choice, which will require him to attend all training sessions as directed by the coach of his selected team.  
       
      ·  
      He is to seek to obtain selection into a team, which is the best that he can make and in the event he is successful, to do all he can to maintain selection.  
       
      ·  
      He is to seek assistance with a Commonwealth employment agency and enrol with a personal assistance programme, subject to his case manager agreeing that that is a proper thing to do. 
       
      ·

      2008/5766 R v Mohamed ABBAS 
       
       
       
      REASONS FOR SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 10 November 2008 the offender, Mohamed Abbas, pleaded not guilty on arraignment to a charge that on 10 December 2006 he murdered Joseph Webber. A jury was duly empanelled and the trial commenced. Two witnesses had given evidence by the end of the first day. The next day the offender asked to be re-arraigned. On this occasion he pleaded not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, a plea which was accepted by the Crown in full discharge of the indictment. The jury was accordingly discharged and the matter stood over for sentence. 
     
      
    2 The circumstances of the killing are as follows. At about 7.30 pm on Sunday 10 December 2006, the victim, Mr Webber, and two friends, Trinity Heng and Zaccariah Hough, went to a KFC restaurant at Wentworthville. They had spent much of the day on a pre-Christmas cruise, hosted by their employer, followed by a few hours of partying at the home of their employer’s son. A considerable amount of alcohol had been consumed and Mr Webber was significantly intoxicated. 
     
      
    3 The three of them sat at a table in the outside seating area of the restaurant. One of them went inside for some food which the three of them then shared between them. Not long afterwards the offender and his companion, Mr Hanna Saade, arrived and sat at a table in the same outside area. Neither the offender nor Mr Saade had ever previously met Mr Webber or either of his companions. 
     
      
    4 I should say at this stage that almost everything that happened that evening was captured on CCTV. Accordingly, the Court was in the most unusual position of being able to observe at first hand many of the actual movements of the participants, together with the time at which all relevant events occurred. 
     
      
    5 At 7.56.17 pm Mr Webber got up and walked towards the table occupied by the offender and Mr Saade. He asked for a dollar. His demeanour was threatening and angry, and his friend Mr Heng, sensing impending trouble, went over and offered the deceased five dollars. Mr Webber threw it to the ground, and continued to walk towards the offender and Mr Saade demanding that they give him a dollar. Both Mr Heng and Mr Hough tried to restrain him and move him away. They told the offender and Mr Saade to ignore him as he was drunk. 
     
      
    6 At about this point – at 7.56.46 pm – the offender left the area, saying he was going to get change from his car. He went outside to his car where he was seen to take a knife from the glove box. While he was away, Mr Webber was trying to get to Mr Saade, but was held back by Mr Hough. Very shortly before the offender returned, Mr Webber broke away, lunged at Mr Saade and grabbed him by the neck of his shirt. He was in this position when the offender returned. The offender was momentarily held back by Mr Heng but broke free. He went up to Mr Webber, who was still holding Mr Saade, and stabbed him four times. 
     
      
    7 Shortly afterwards the offender and Mr Saade left. They went to the offender’s car where the offender told Mr Saade that he had stabbed the deceased in the leg in order to immobilize him as “he looked like he was strangling you”. 
     
      
    8 None of the onlookers had seen the knife in the offender’s hand, and it was only when Mr Webber collapsed shortly afterwards that his companions realised the seriousness of the situation. A triple-0 call was made and an ambulance arrived almost immediately. However, Mr Webber died shortly after his arrival in hospital. 
     
      
    9 All this happened very quickly indeed. The actual stabbing took place at 7.57.41 pm, a mere one minute and 24 seconds after the confrontation had started with Mr Webber first approaching the offender and Mr Saade. 
     
      
    10 The next day, after learning through the media that Mr Webber had died, the offender voluntarily attended the Merrylands Police Station where he was arrested and charged with murder. He has been in custody ever since. 
     
      
    11 A post-mortem examination found that Mr Webber had sustained four stab wounds: three to the abdomen and one to the groin. One of the abdominal wounds had penetrated the aorta. This was the immediate cause of death. Even without it, one of the other abdominal wounds would have caused death without early medical intervention, as it had penetrated the gall bladder, the pancreas and the colon. The doctor performing the post-mortem was unable to determine the order in which the wounds had been inflicted. 
     
      
    12 Mr Webber had a blood alcohol reading of .238 per 100mls, a very high reading indeed. He was heavily intoxicated at the time of these events. This is confirmed by the CCTV images and by the evidence of his companions. 
     
      
    13 It is agreed that the plea of guilty to manslaughter is based on excessive self-defence (or more accurately, excessive defence of Mr Saade). 
     
      
    14 I turn to say something about the offender’s background. This largely comes from evidence given during the sentencing proceedings by the offender himself and two of his siblings, and also from a report of Dr Olav Nielssen, which was tendered by the defence. 
     
      
    15 The offender is now 34 years old, having been born on 18 January 1975. He has a police record consisting of a number of driving offences and a few other relatively minor offences. The only offences involving violence were two convictions, in 1996 and 2003 respectively, for assaulting a police officer. Both of these were dealt with by way of bond. The offender has never been in gaol before. 
     
      
    16 The offender, who is of Lebanese extraction, is the oldest of seven children. His mother was 16 when she married his father, a much older man, in an arranged marriage. They came to Australia shortly afterwards and the offender was born the following year. His parents’ marriage was never happy. The offender told Dr Nielssen that his father was a gambler who later became addicted to heroin. He was away from the home for long periods of time so that it was, in many respects, a single parent household. 
     
      
    17 The offender’s mother was clearly a bitter and unhappy woman. She visited a degree of violence on all her children, but it was the offender who was singled out to bear the brunt of her abuse. The evidence on this matter came primarily from the offender’s younger brother, Sam Abbas, who said that the offender was beaten severely on an almost daily basis. His mother made him solely responsible for the great majority of household chores. He washed the dishes, made the beds and cleaned the home. If he did not perform these tasks to his mother’s satisfaction, he was severely beaten. He was a bed-wetter until the age of 14. His mother always checked his bed and beat him when she found that he had wet it. Sam Abbas said that he used to hear his brother crying in the middle of the night. He attempted suicide twice, when he was in his early teens. 
     
      
    18 The offender told Dr Nielssen that in the course of this abuse he sustained burns, a broken leg and was sometimes beaten unconscious. He was teased at school because of the bruises and other marks caused by his mother’s abuse. From time to time his teachers brought him to the attention of child welfare services because of his obvious injuries, but he declined to inform them about the source of the injuries and no action was taken. He left home at age 15, and moved in with other relatives. 
     
      
    19 Probably because of this physical abuse, the offender did not do well at school. He left school without completing year 10 and has worked ever since as a bricklayer’s labourer. A very favourable report was tendered on sentence from his previous employer who has continued to visit him in gaol. He expressed willingness to re-employ the offender upon his release from custody. 
     
      
    20 In March 2005 the offender was married and in February the following year his son was born. The offender’s wife gave evidence on sentence in which she described him as a devoted father and a good husband. She and their son visit him regularly. 
     
      
    21 Dr Nielssen considered that the offender showed no features of psychotic illness or delusional or abnormal beliefs. He estimated his intelligence to be within the normal range. He considered it likely that the severe physical abuse suffered by the offender in early life pre-disposed him to developing a high level of arousal in response to threats of violence such as the threat he perceived to have been posed by Mr Webber. Dr Nielssen went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “Despite the severe level of neglect and abuse he experienced in early life … Mr Abbas did not go on to develop adolescent conduct disorder or a pattern of anti-social conduct as an adult. Moreover, he does not have a substance abuse disorder, which is the other factor most strongly associated with criminal recidivism. He has a history of stable employment, stable family life and strong support from his siblings. I believe Mr Abbas has good prospects for rehabilitation and a low risk of further offences of any kind.” 
        
       
      
    22 The offender does not drink alcohol or take any other form of recreational drug. 
     
      
    23 The maximum penalty for manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years. As has been observed on many occasions, this offence covers a broader range of culpability than any other in the criminal calendar. It can range, at the lower end of the spectrum, from a practical joke gone wrong, to, at the other end, a killing which is little short of murder. Sentencing patterns in relation to particular categories of manslaughter can provide something of a useful guide, but ultimately each case will turn upon its own facts. It must never be forgotten that the offence involves the unlawful taking of a human life. 
     
      
    24 The starting point in the sentencing process is to assess the objective seriousness of the offence. The Crown relies upon the following aggravating factors under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999: first, pursuant to paragraph (2)(c), that the offence involved the actual use of a weapon; and second, under paragraph (2)(ea), that the offence was committed in the presence of a child under 18 years of age. In this respect a number of KFC employees under the age of 18 were in the vicinity. Only one of them, a 16 year-old, witnessed the actual incident. 
     
      
    25 I would not use this second factor, namely the presence of the 16 year-old, as a relevant matter in this case. As Mr Dailly SC pointed out on behalf of the offender, he did not choose this venue to commit the offence. He happened to be there with his friend Mr Saade when Mr Webber approached them and the altercation between them ensued, with tragic consequences. 
     
      
    26 The following mitigating factors are potentially relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence. First, pursuant to paragraph (3)(b), the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity; second, pursuant to paragraph (3)(c), the offender was provoked by the victim. However, the Crown rightly submits that the deceased’s provocation has already been taken into account in reducing the offence from murder to manslaughter. It should not be used again in mitigation of the manslaughter offence. 
     
      
    27 In addition to the matters under s 21A, the Crown submitted that the offender’s action in going to the car and obtaining a knife was not a reasonable response in the circumstances. At that time neither the offender nor Mr Saade were in any danger. Mr Webber had not touched anyone, and his friends were trying to move him away. Nor was Mr Saade in any serious danger when the offender returned and, with no prior warning, proceeded to stab Mr Webber four times in quick succession. 
     
      
    28 On the other hand, as the defence points out, this episode was initiated entirely by Mr Webber. Before it started, the offender and Mr Saade were apparently oblivious to the presence of Mr Webber and his friends at another table in the area. The deceased’s friend, Mr Heng, acknowledged that no provocative word or gesture at all had preceded Mr Webber getting up and going to the table where the two of them were sitting. 
     
      
    29 The offender said in evidence that, before he went out to his car and collected the knife, he tried to persuade Mr Saade to come with him. Had he succeeded, both of them would have left the area and nothing more would have happened. A tragedy would have been averted. Unfortunately Mr Saade refused to move, so the offender went and collected the knife. His intention at the time, he said, was to frighten Mr Webber. When he returned he saw Mr Webber with his hand at Mr Saade’s neck. I should interpose here that Mr Webber was a large man, approximately 180 cm in height and 102 kg in weight. He was significantly larger than the offender, and larger (although less so) than Mr Saade. The offender first tried to push Mr Webber away with his left hand, but could not move him. He then stabbed him with his right hand. He said that he thought he had stabbed him only twice, and lower in the body. He was clearly wrong in this respect. 
     
      
    30 The Crown did not accept that the offender tried to pull Mr Saade away before going to his car. However, having viewed the video on several occasions, I accept that this did indeed take place. I also accept that the offender’s purpose in getting the knife was to frighten Mr Webber. It was only when he saw Mr Webber holding Mr Saade in the neck area that he lunged at him with the knife in order to stop him. This was, on any view of the matter, a highly excessive response, given that no injury had at that stage been sustained by either the offender or Mr Saade. I accept that the offender had no intention to kill Mr Webber. However, as he himself conceded, in stabbing him with a knife he must have realised that really serious injury would virtually inevitably follow. I also accept, consistently with Dr Nielssen’s findings, that the offender’s childhood experiences of severe and unremitting abuse, meant that he was particularly prone to develop high levels of arousal when confronted with threats of physical violence. 
     
      
    31 The knife itself was a relatively small, opening knife, which the offender routinely kept in his car for use during his employment.  
     
      
    32 It follows that the most significant factor exacerbating the objective seriousness of this offence was the use of the knife in circumstances which clearly, in hindsight, did not merit a response of that nature. Further, as the medical evidence shows, the knife was used to inflict no less than four stab wounds, three of them to the abdomen. 
     
      
    33 On the other hand I accept the various matters referred to by Mr Dailly in mitigation of the objective seriousness of this offence. Amongst the more important of these is the fact that neither the offender nor his companion did anything whatsoever to provoke this episode. The fact that the offender sought to avoid the confrontation by pulling Mr Saade outside quite early in the piece is also a significant factor. Nor is there any doubt as to the genuineness of the offender’s belief at the time that he needed to protect his friend Mr Saade, albeit that the means he used was grossly disproportionate to the threat posed by Mr Webber. 
     
      
    34 Objectively, the offence must be placed at the lower end of the spectrum of manslaughter offences, given the broad range of criminality encompassed by that offence. 
     
      
    35 I turn to discuss the effect upon sentence of the offender’s subjective features. These are, without exception, favourable to the offender. The Crown sought to urge that, as the offence of assault police in 2003 involved the threatened use of a knife, greater weight should be given to personal deterrence in the sentence for this offence. However, without going into the detailed facts of that earlier offence, I do not regard it as relevant in this case. Accordingly I do not propose to treat the offender’s criminal record, minor as it is, as an adverse factor in the sentencing process. 
     
      
    36 The offender has expressed extreme remorse for this offence and I accept that he is entirely genuine in this respect. In his evidence he expressed severe regret and said that he deserved to be punished for killing Mr Webber. He acknowledged that Mr Webber did not deserve to be stabbed. He wrote a handwritten note which was read in court, apologising to Mr Webber’s family and seeking forgiveness for the pain and sorrow he had caused them, whilst acknowledging that it would be difficult for them to forgive him. 
     
      
    37 Given the offender’s contrition and the various matters referred to by Dr Nielssen, I consider it most unlikely that the offender will re-offend in any serious manner in the future. This is a highly significant matter on sentence. A further highly significant matter is the offender’s plea of guilty. Although this was only entered during the course of the trial, a letter was sent on the offender’s behalf to the DPP in September 2007, requesting that the Crown accept a plea of guilty to manslaughter based on excessive self-defence. It was not until the second day of the trial, after Mr Webber’s two companions gave evidence which supported the offender’s version of events, that the Crown agreed to accept this plea. The offender should not be penalised for the Crown’s delay in this regard. In all the circumstances I propose to apply a discount of 20% for his plea of guilty. 
     
      
    38 Mr Webber was the father of a daughter, Rakaia, born in 1991, and a son, Teiwa, born in 2003. Extremely moving victim impact statements were read in court on behalf of Mr Webber’s widow, Christine Tumanako and his daughter Rakaia. A further statement, of Mr Webber’s youngest sister, Briar London, was tendered by the Crown. I would like to convey my own and the Court’s sincere condolences to Mr Webber’s family and friends. Their lives have forever been changed by the events of 10 December 2006. I hope that they will understand that the extent of the grief and loss suffered by the family of a homicide victim cannot be used as a measure for the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon the perpetrator. 
     
      
    39 This is a most unusual case in a number of respects, particularly relating to the offender’s background and his strong prospects of rehabilitation. The Crown has agreed that special circumstances exist which justify a departure from the statutory nexus between the non-parole period and the total term of imprisonment. 
     
      
    40 The offender has been in custody since 11 December 2006 and his sentence is to commence on that date. 
     
      
    41 Mohamed Abbas, for the manslaughter of Joseph Webber you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years and nine months, commencing on 11 December 2006 and expiring on 10 September 2010, together with an additional term of three years, commencing on 11 September 2010 and expiring on 10 September 2013; a total sentence of six years and nine months. The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole is 10 September 2010.

    1 HER HONOUR : The prisoner, Clayton John Wilson, was found guilty by a jury on 7 November 2008 of the murder of Stephen Knowles on 19 December 2006. The prisoner and the victim had shared a two-bedroom house in Forster for about 20 months. The Crown case at trial was that the prisoner had effectively bludgeoned the victim about the head and upper torso with a walking stick, while the victim was lying on his back on his bed sometime after 7pm on 19 December 2006. Despite inflicting serious injuries, evidenced in part by a large amount of blood spatter over the walls of the bedroom, the prisoner left the victim in an unconscious state. The victim’s body was discovered in the bedroom in the evening of the following day.  
     
      
    2 The offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and attracts a standard non-parole period of 20 years, if the Court were to find that the offence falls within the mid range of objective gravity for offences of this kind, and there are no factors of a mitigating nature that warrant a departure from the standard non-parole period. 
     
      
    3 The Crown case was largely circumstantial, although there was powerful direct evidence of the prisoner’s voice raised in anger against the victim on the night of the offence, accompanied by the sound of thudding or thumping. The prisoner has maintained since his arrest on 11 January 2007 that someone else assaulted the victim. The jury rejected that possibility beyond a reasonable doubt. Since his conviction, the prisoner has remained mute, as he is entitled to do. Nothing has been placed before the Court that throws any light upon the prisoner’s state of mind at the time of the offence, or since. The Court’s insight into the prisoner’s subjective circumstances is limited by the absence of reports that usually address such matters, save for the prisoner’s criminal history and a letter to the Court from the prisoner’s mother and brother. The Court has therefore been placed in the position of making necessary findings of fact for the purpose of sentence almost entirely from the evidence produced at trial. The most contentious of these is whether the prisoner intended to kill the victim, or whether he intended to inflict grievous bodily harm. A brief explanation of the background to the commission of the offence is relevant to that issue. 
     
      
    4 Both the prisoner and the victim were unemployed and in receipt of social security benefits. They both spent a considerable amount of their time in licensed premises consuming alcohol or obtaining cannabis from ""the mission"" across the road from their house. They were each intoxicated to some degree on an almost daily basis. Several of the prisoner’s and the victim’s acquaintances would visit the premises from time to time to obtain small amounts of cannabis from either the prisoner or the victim. The relationship between the prisoner and the victim appeared to be friendly, but for the occasional arguments over the purchase of alcohol and/or cannabis. 
     
      
    5 On 19 December 2006, the victim spent most of the day at the Forster Bowling Club drinking and socialising with friends. At some point during the day, the victim confronted the prisoner at the club about the payment of rent money. They argued and the prisoner left. The victim told others that he was anxious to obtain the prisoner’s share of the rent and that if he did not receive it by the end of the day, he would move the prisoner’s furniture out of the house. 
     
      
    6 The victim left the club at approximately 4 pm, very well affected by alcohol. His blood/alcohol reading was 0.198 more than 24 hours after his death, indicating a very heavy drinking session on that day. It is clear from the jury’s verdict that they accepted that the victim returned home, had a further argument with the prisoner at about 7 pm, probably about money, and that the prisoner assaulted the victim at that time. The prisoner himself had been seen in licensed premises earlier that day and was also affected by alcohol, although it is not possible to determine the extent of his intoxication. I accept that the assault was spontaneous and unpremeditated. I am unable to determine who initiated the argument. 
     
      
    7 The evidence of Dr Lee, a forensic pathologist who conducted the autopsy on the victim, is indicative of the ferocity of the prisoner’s assault. Dr Lee described injuries consistent with approximately 10 blows to the face and jaw of the victim, 2 blows to the throat, 4 to the right side of the head, 7 to the upper chest and a further 5 blows on the upper torso. The profuse and external bleeding from the face, together with the moderately extensive sub dural haemorrhaging and light, diffuse subarachnoid bleeding, were consistent with a relatively light object used with a moderate to heavy degree of force. There was quite extensive trauma to the mouth, including teeth knocked out of the lower central jaw, and multiple fractures to the face and jaw. The left upper jaw was no longer connected to the left side of the mandible. There was a fracture to the base of the right side of the voice box, indicating heavy blunt force trauma to the front of the throat. The injuries to the voice box were potentially fatal of themselves. According to Dr Lee, the victim would have been incapable of getting up and moving after the assault. A degree of blood inhalation signified a loss of consciousness followed by death approximately 20 minutes to an hour later. 
     
      
    8 This sustained and focused assault upon the victim is indicative of an intention to kill. However, there are certain factors which, in my view, detract from that finding. Accepting that the prisoner was affected by alcohol and that he was irritated by the victim’s persistent request for money over the course of the day, it is logical to conclude that the prisoner’s anger erupted suddenly as a result of a further confrontation between them, and the prisoner resorted to the use of the walking stick as a weapon, in circumstances where the prisoner had been using the walking stick for some weeks to assist him with a minor injury. By the time he had regained his composure, the prisoner had inflicted potentially fatal injuries upon the victim, yet he pulled a doona over the body of the victim and left the room, closing the door behind him. The prisoner maintained to a number of people that the victim had left the premises and had not returned. Moreover, the prisoner was observed by others during the course of the evening of that day to be behaving relatively normally. 
     
      
    9 Bearing in mind that the finding of an intention to kill must be made beyond reasonable doubt, the circumstances surrounding the assault upon the victim that I have described above militate against that satisfaction. Accordingly I proceed to sentence on the basis that the prisoner intended to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the victim. That finding of course does not necessarily remove the offence from the midrange of objective gravity, although it must be acknowledged that an intention to kill would more often place an offence in that category. 
     
      
    10 The Crown's contention is that the offence falls within the midrange for the following reasons, namely, that the prisoner used a weapon, that the degree of violence was high, that the victim was vulnerable at the time of the assault due to his intoxication, that the prisoner failed to seek assistance for the victim following the assault and that the prisoner took steps to conceal the assault from others. The Crown also relied upon an asserted intention to kill on the part of the prisoner. Notwithstanding the failure of that submission, the remaining factors are capable of placing the offence within the midrange of objective gravity. 
     
      
    11 The Crown also relied upon the fact that there is no evidence of the assault having been provoked by the victim, and that there is no evidence of the prisoner's judgement being impaired. Had such evidence been available, no doubt the partial defences of provocation and substantial impairment would have figured in the course of the trial. The objective gravity of the offence of which the prisoner was convicted should not be affected by the unavailability of a partial defence. The offence must be assessed for what it is, not for what it is not. I do not therefore regard the absence of a basis for a partial defence to be relevant to the assessment of the objective gravity of the offence of murder. 
     
      
    12 Dealing with the remaining factors in turn, whilst the use of a weapon is an aggravating feature, it has already been noted that the prisoner was, at the relevant time, in the habit of using a walking stick. There is a distinction, albeit subtle, between resorting to the use of a weapon, such as a knife or heavy instrument, and using a lawful implement in the course of an assault. However, the fact that the prisoner chose to strike the victim repeatedly with such an implement is a relevant objective factor. There is no doubt that the prisoner inflicted considerable violence upon the victim.  
     
      
    13 As for the victim’s intoxication, it too is a relevant factor in the assessment of objective gravity, although it does not qualify as an aggravating factor for the reasons outlined in R v Tadrosse [2005] NSWCCA 145 and R v Doolan [2006] NSWCCA 29. It is not possible to determine whether the prisoner knew of the extent of the victim's intoxication, but I accept that the prisoner was aware that the victim had been drinking alcohol during the day, consistent with his usual practice. It is also pertinent to observe that the victim was a relatively slight man, 60 kg in weight and 175 cm in height. By way of contrast, the prisoner is considerably taller and of a heavier build. Realistically, once the prisoner had commenced his assault upon the victim, the victim was not in a position to defend himself. 
     
      
    14 Accepting that the prisoner himself had consumed alcohol that day, it is nonetheless true to say that he acted swiftly and decisively, as soon as he realised the extent of the harm that he had inflicted. He made a conscious decision to conceal the assault and refrain from seeking medical assistance for the victim, whose very serious injuries must have been apparent to the prisoner. I also accept that it was the prisoner who placed a sheet over the window of the victim's bedroom, so that visitors to the premises who passed in front of the window were unable to see the condition of the room. Whilst there was some evidence of the sheet being in that position in the days prior to the assault, the presence of the prisoner’s blood on the top right-hand corner of the sheet could only be consistent with an attempt by the prisoner to conceal his offence. 
     
      
    15 The combination of these circumstances leads to the conclusion that the offence falls just below the midrange of objective gravity. In the absence of evidence of the prisoner's remorse, and any other mitigating circumstance, other than those already canvassed in the course of discussing the objective gravity of the offence, there is little scope for a significant departure from the standard non-parole period.  
     
      
    16 The prisoner is presently 34 years of age. Exhibit 1 reveals that the prisoner is one of four children, the youngest child (together with his twin sister) born into a loving and caring family. The prisoner's father died when the prisoner was 28 years of age. The prisoner is described by his mother as an average student, who was popular at school, and who has had many jobs since leaving after year 10. The prisoner was in a relationship, now dissolved, which produced two daughters. The prisoner is said to be a loving and devoted father to the girls and a stepson, as well as a ""very soft and kindhearted person"" who still keeps in close contact with his family, including two nephews and a niece. Some limited insight into the prisoner’s circumstances at the time of the offence is provided by his brother, who states that the prisoner was debilitated by back pain, unemployed and without access to his children. 
     
      
    17 The prisoner's criminal history commences in 1996 with a conviction for common assault. In 2002 the prisoner was convicted of common assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Further convictions for common assault and contravene apprehended domestic violence order were recorded in 2004. In respect of all of these convictions the prisoner received the benefit of bonds and a community service order. In 2008 the prisoner was convicted of a break and enter offence, for which he served four months imprisonment commencing on 20 February 2008, concluding on 19 June 2008. The commission of this property offence pre-dates the offence of murder.  
     
      
    18 The prisoner’s prospects of rehabilitation are speculative. There is no evidentiary basis for a finding one way or the other, except that the prisoner’s previous manifestations of violence have been of a relatively minor nature and probably committed in a domestic context. It is troubling that the prisoner has not taken the opportunity to confront his offending so that the Court might be in a better position to determine whether he has developed any insight into his behaviour and whether he is capable of addressing the underlying causes. Perhaps that insight will develop over time. Without any material justifying the need for an extensive period under supervision in the community, beyond what is provided for by the statutory proportion in such cases, I cannot find special circumstances. 
     
      
    19 The prisoner has been in custody on the charge of murder since 11 January 2007. I therefore propose dating the sentence from 11 May 2007, to allow for the sentence on the break and enter offence. 
     
      
    20 Clayton John Wilson, you are convicted of murder. You are sentenced to a non parole period of 18 years, to date from 11 May 2007, expiring 10 May 2025, with a balance of term of 7 years, expiring 10 May 2032. You are eligible for release to parole on 11 May 2025.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Katrina Murphy appears for sentence today, having pleaded guilty at an earlier time to three offences of obtaining financial advantage by deception. These offences were committed some time ago, in 2001. The reason for the delay in dealing with the matter is quite simple, Ms Murphy did not appear at her trial when required to do so in 2004. A warrant was issued for her arrest and it was only recently executed. 2 Ms Murphy’s offences were committed in a remarkably simple way. She was connected with the payroll of Ord Minnett Cash Management Trust. It was her job, along with others, to ensure that the employees were paid. To do that she had to engage in some electronic banking, transmitting to Westpac details of who was to be paid and how much. On each occasion she simply altered the electronic banking records so that payments were made to her bank account, for employees who no longer worked at Ord Minnett. By that remarkably simple means she obtained, as far as count one is concerned, $7,255.79 cents; as far as count two is concerned $5,238.16 cents; and as far as count three is concerned $6,679.50 cents. 3 That money was repaid some time ago, shortly before Ms Murphy absconded. It is not a matter of mitigation however, that the company bears no loss. It would have been a matter of aggravation if the money continued to remain unpaid when the offences were committed so long ago. 4 This is not Ms Murphy’s first breach of the criminal law in this manner. In 1996 she was dealt with for a number of offences of dishonestly obtaining financial advantage by deception and on each she was put on a good behaviour bond under what was then s 556A of the Crimes Act for two years. 5 It is to be noted that the way in which she committed her earlier offences in 1996 bore some striking similarities to the way she committed her offences for which she is to be sentenced today. That is, she was a payroll officer who simply altered the payroll records so that her bank accounts were credited with money that should have been paid to others. 6 I received a number of references concerning Ms Murphy. One can only assume that they were prepared without the knowledge of Ms Murphy’s earlier offences or at least that that knowledge was belatedly given to the authors of the references. Many of the references make reference to these offences being completely out of character for Ms Murphy. Wanda Brown, her niece said that there has never been any suggestion that Ms Murphy was anything other than an “exemplary employee”. Sadly that is not the case. 7 What certainly is the case is that Ms Murphy has had some stresses in her life over various years. She has been significantly depressed at times, one of those episodes of depression occurring at about the same time as the breakdown of her marriage. It seems that at that time she was responsible for the care of four young children. She had a lot to do to look after them and also found it difficult apparently to conduct full-time work. It is said that these circumstances explain the commission of the current offences. I accept that those who are depressed are less able to reason about the wrongfulness and rightfulness of their actions than those who are not depressed, but it is a significant step, and one I am not prepared to take, to suggest that depression explains the commission of crimes. There are many people in the world suffer loss and do not steal from their employers. There are many people in the world who are significantly depressed and his law abiding lives. It is simply taking matters too far to say that her depression explains her conduct.8 For many years Ms Murphy was living separately from her husband, he being in Queensland and she being in New South Wales. Recently the evidence suggests that they have reunited and she has been living on the Gold Coast for some time. The circumstance led to a number of adjournments of this matter for reasons I will shortly explain. 9 Offences such as these are serious because they represent a significant breach of the trust that has been placed by an employer in Ms Murphy. Modern relationships, including relationships of employer/employee depend upon a significant level of trust. Those who are given the opportunity to work in areas where they have close contact with money must understand that if they breach the trust placed in them then significant, and even harsh, penalties must necessarily follow. The more so is that the case when, as here, the offender has earlier convictions for similar matters. 10 General deterrence is of significant importance when sentencing for offences of this kind. There is a limit to what businesses can do to prevent dishonest misappropriation of money. Trust is essential, and where trust is broken the courts must do what they can to prevent others acting in a similar way. The earlier offences also suggest that there is a greater than usual need for personal deterrence to play a part in the sentence to be imposed. 11 In order to reflect the gravity of the offences and particularly because the offender is not appearing before the courts for the first time I am satisfied that a custodial sentence is required. This leads me to return to the matter I adverted to earlier. Periodic detention is not available in Queensland, nor is it possible for home detention orders to be made which can be supervised by Queensland Probation and Parole authorities. I drew this to the attention of Mr Brady when the matter was first before me. He was hanging his hat on a s 12 bond. I formed the view that a custodial sentence was required because a suspended sentence would not have sufficiently met the requirements of general and personal deterrence. I have decided how long that sentence should be, taking into account both 25% discount for Ms Murphy’s plea of guilty and also the short period of time she spent in custody after the warrant for her arrest was executed. I then needed to determine how the sentence would be served in order to be armed with the knowledge as to what options were available. I suggested to Mr Brady that his client might wish to seek the opportunity of a pre-sentence report, in particular as to whether she was suitable for periodic detention. Of course the fact that she is living in Queensland would be a significant impediment to such a sentence being imposed. Ms Murphy, up until the eleventh hour, refused to make any arrangements such that she would become suitable for periodic detention. Given the decisions I had already made this could only have led to her serving a sentence of full time custody. Fortunately she has had a change of heart. She is now prepared to make arrangements to move down to Sydney and stay with her brother for the period of any sentence I impose upon her. She is now suitable for periodic detention and has signed appropriate undertakings. 12 Given the length of the sentence I have determined it is appropriate that I further indicate why I have rejected the submission put to me by Mr Brady that a suspended sentence would be appropriate. In my view that would not sufficiently deter Ms Murphy from further misconduct. No doubt at sometime in the future she will face stresses in her life, she will feel under pressure and she may well feel depressed. Temptation will come her way again. Having received a bond the first time she committed an offence of this kind, and then having got another bond (if I acceded to Mr Brady’s submission) for these more serious offences, in my view Ms Murphy would get the completely wrong idea about whether or not she should give in to that temptation. She needs to be punished in a concrete way, not in a nebulous way with the Sword of Damocles hanging over her head, but in a way she will feel and others will understand. 13 The sentence I impose is this, I am going to impose concurrent sentences on each matter. On each matter the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I find special circumstances due to this being her first time in custody. I set a head sentence of two years with a non-parole period of twelve months. I order that that sentence be served by way of periodic detention. Accordingly Ms Murphy is to attend the Tomago Periodic Detention Centre at 8.30 am on Saturday 21 March 2009.

      JUDGMENT - On application by all accused for a discharge of the jury 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is an application brought on behalf of all accused seeking a discharge of the jury. This is the second time during the trial a discharge has been sought, although it must be said the earlier application was based on different grounds than is the present one. Commencement of the jury empanelment began in late October 2008. This means, in practical terms, that the trial is now well into its fifth month and the present estimate is that there are another four, or perhaps five months, left to run.  
     
      
    2 The discharge application is sought because of the media publicity given to the sentencing of a number of men in Melbourne on Tuesday, 3 February 2009. On that day Bongiorno J, in the Supreme Court of Victoria, sentenced Abdul Nacer Benbrika and a number of other men to lengthy sentences in respect of their convictions for terrorism related offences committed in Victoria.  
     
      
    3 The accused in the present trial are five men who have been each charged with an offence of conspiring with each other to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. This indictment was presented in late October 2008. There had been an earlier indictment charging nine men with a similar offence but, for reasons not necessary to mention here, four of those men are not on trial in the present proceedings. Hence the need for a fresh indictment in October 2008.  
     
      
    4 Between February and October 2008 the Court was involved in an extensive series of pre-trial applications concerning the anticipated trial of the nine men on the original indictment. These decisions remain of relevance for the trial of the remaining five men the subject of the October 2008 indictment. The offence with which each man is charged is a serious offence, carrying with it a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life. 
     
      
       
      The nature of the Crown case 
       
      
    5 The accused are five of nine men who are said by the prosecution to be parties to the conspiracy involved in the charge contained in the indictment. The following summary of the Crown allegations is taken from the Crown Case Statement The prosecution case is that each of the conspirators considers himself to be a devout Muslim; each held certain beliefs in common relating to their interpretation of the Muslim faith. These common beliefs included the following: - 
     
      
       
      (a) Islam throughout the world was under attack and there was a religious obligation to come to the defence of Islam and other Muslims; 
      
     
     
      
      (b) “Jihad” was the primary means by which this religious obligation should be fulfilled; 
       
        
       
      (c) a significant and legitimate aspect of the fulfilment of this obligation was violent Jihad, which involved the application of force and violence, including in certain circumstances the killing of “infidels” or “kuffir” (that is, persons who do not have the same fundamentalist beliefs). 
       
        
       
      
    6 These views are evidenced by, amongst other things, the finding of a large volume of material supporting such views (“extremist material”) at the premises of each accused upon the execution of search warrants. That extremist material was found in the form of electronic media including videos, DVDs, CDs and material from websites downloaded and saved on each of the accused’s computer or computers.7 In accordance with the holding of those common beliefs, the accused entered into an agreement to obtain the capacity or capability to prepare for a terrorist act (or terrorist acts). This involved equipping themselves with the knowledge, ability and means to prepare for or plan a terrorist act (or terrorist acts). In furtherance of the agreement the accused amongst other things: 
     
      
       
      (a) obtained or attempted to obtain chemicals and other relevant materials which could be used (directly and/or indirectly) in the construction of an explosive device; 
       
      
      
      (b) obtained or attempted to obtain weaponry and ammunition; 
       
       
      (c) possessed large amounts of extremist and instructional material. 
       
        
       
      Certain of these matters are summarised below. 
       
      
    8 In undertaking their activities the accused became aware that they were being monitored by the authorities. This investigative activity by the authorities included physical and electronic surveillance, interviews and search warrants conducted on the premises relating to various accused before they were arrested. Despite this awareness, each of the accused continued with their activities in relation to the offence. In undertaking these activities, the accused displayed a high level of planning to avoid detection. For example, some of the covert means which the accused utilised included the following:(a) acquiring and using mobile telephones in false names (these telephones were used, for example, to make enquiries and purchases relevant to the conspiracy and to organise meetings); 
     
      
    (b) using coded SMS messages (with mobile telephones in false names) to arrange covert meetings and to pass messages to each other; 
     
      
    (c) using false names when making enquiries about purchases and purchasing items; 
     
      
    (d) using false names to book camping trips; 
     
      
    (e) using techniques to avoid physical monitoring (“anti-surveillance”) and/or techniques to detect physical monitoring (“counter-surveillance”); 
     
      
    (f) using public telephones (in circumstances where the accused were known to be in possession of mobile telephones); 
     
      
    (g) using electronic equipment to check whether they were the subject of electronic monitoring. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    9 In particular, the accused used techniques to avoid and/or detect monitoring by the authorities during the weeks leading up to the arrests in early November 2005. During this period, certain of the accused arranged covert meetings in public places using coded text messages from mobile telephones subscribed in false names. These arrangements included meetings to be held during the early hours of the morning. The accused engaged in anti-surveillance and/or counter-surveillance before these meetings took place. On a number of occasions, these meetings were cancelled by the accused when they discovered that they were under surveillance. 
    10 Abdul Nacer BENBRIKA (“BENBRIKA”) was an Islamist who had publicly declared his support for militant or violent Jihad. Members of the BENBRIKA group included Izzydeen ATIK (“ATIK”) Aimen JOUD (“JOUD”), Ahmad RAAD (“RAAD”) and Fadi SAYADI (“SAYADI”). BENBRIKA, JOUD, RAAD, ATIK and SAYADI communicated with certain of the accused in Sydney. This contact was often covert in nature, involving the use of covert and public telephones. BENBRIKA and JOUD maintained a degree of contact with HASAN, ELOMAR, SHARROUF, Moustafa CHEIKHO, Khaled CHEIKHO and JAMAL. BENBRIKA travelled from Melbourne to Sydney and met some of the accused on those occasions. 
     
      
    11 The following are some examples of the nature of the instructional material alleged by the Crown to have been held by the accused and the others named in the indictment:12 On 8 July 2004, a computer, which was located at the premises of Khaled CHEIKHO, accessed and downloaded from a website 3 documents in Arabic, as follows: 
     
      
    (a) a 1 page document showing Osama Bin LADEN and containing links to “military lessons, Jihad websites, Jihad chat rooms, scholars of Jihad and news”; 
     
      
    (b) a 1 page document containing “a few advices” inciting Muslims to engage in Jihad; and 
     
      
    (c) a 12 page document in Arabic containing instructions on various types of explosives (including the speed, force, ferocity and sensitivity of explosives), how to construct a detonator and manufacture improvised explosives from commonly available products.13 On 27 June 2005, during the execution of a search warrant upon ELOMAR’S vehicle and premises, the authorities seized 4 boxes of compressed hexamine and a USB memory stick which contained a 60 page document in Arabic entitled “The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Abdullah Zul Bajadin – Part Two”. The document is in the form of a series of written lessons, accompanied by photographic illustrations of matters relating to the text and contains a session in the form of “Questions and answers”. The document contains step-by-step instructions on the manufacture of a series of chemical mixtures/specific explosives and detonating devices. It includes details and advice on: how to source ingredients or precursors, on chemical properties, on how to extract, prepare, store, dispose of and use the explosives described. It provides alternate ingredients and advises how these may be sourced from non-laboratory/scientific sources, such as chemist shops. The document outlines information about car bombs, with reference to “the Riyadh explosions” and “explosions in Bagdad”, and includes material from “one of the Jihadist Encyclopaedias” concerning placement of explosive devices and selection of targets for car bombs. 
    14 The Crown will maintain that the document is directed to a terrorist audience. For example, the writer asks: 
     
      
       
        
        “What exactly are you thinking of: an embassy a complex, terrorising? State what is your mind and hopefully I will try to answer it. As for now I am giving a general illustration as the specified target determines everything from directing the detonators to the amount required…”. 
        
       
      
      
    15 The document contains instructions for the manufacture of Tri-Acetone Tri-Peroxide (“TATP”) using various commercially available items, including hydrogen peroxide, sulphuric acid and acetone. The instructions and images relating to the manufacture of TATP found in this document were consistent with items obtained, or attempted to be obtained, by the accused. The process of manufacturing TATP requires various chemicals to be cooled continuously while mixing. TATP must also be kept cool after manufacture. By relying on the recipe contained in the “The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Abdullah Zul Bajadin – Part Two” and only using the chemicals and equipment sourced (or attempted to be sourced) by the accused, TATP could be manufactured.16 On 27 June 2005 also located during the execution of the search warrant on ELOMAR’S premises was a CD containing a 1,064-page document in Arabic. Moustafa CHEIKHO’s fingerprints were on the CD cover. The document is entitled “Security and Intelligence”. The document contains chapters including, “Security and Islam”, “Sabotage and Counter Espionage”, “Surveillance”, “Audio and Visual Taping”, “The Hierarchy of the Security Department of a Jihad Organisation”, “Secret Communication”, “Topography” and “The Primary Rules of Sabotage”. Again this document contains instructions relating to the manufacture and detonating of various improvised explosive devices. As with the previous document, it contains step-by-step instructions on how to manufacture explosives from commercially available products, with details and advice on how to source the ingredients, extract and prepare them for use. The requirements specify the use of beakers, thermometers, pipettes, etc. One of the types of explosive devices in these instructions is TATP. This document also provides instructions on how to manufacture Hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (“HMTD”) using various commercially available items including hexamine, hydrogen peroxide and citric acid. 
    17 Both TATP and HMTD are highly sensitive explosives, which are relatively simple to manufacture, and specialist equipment, knowledge or experience is not required to do so. Following the instructions provided in these documents a person is capable of manufacturing both TATP and HMTD. Both TATP and HMTD could be manufactured using only the chemicals and equipment obtained or attempted to be obtained by the accused. 
    18 On 27 July 2005 and on 12 August 2005, ELOMAR’S niece Oula AWAD asked the authorities to return various items, including the USB drive (the item containing The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Abdullah Zul Bajadin – Part Two). She said: “...and I really importantly need that memory card, I really need it, there is like um, my uncle has got stuff on it, drawing and that he has to submit it to people, that’s work for him”. The USB drive (which still contained The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Abdullah Zul Bajadin – Part Two) was returned to ELOMAR on 19 August 2005. Upon the execution of a further search warrant at ELOMAR’S premises on 8 November 2005, the USB drive was seized again. Analysis of the USB drive showed that The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Abdullah Zul Bajadin – Part Two had been removed on 19 August 2005. This was the only item deleted from the USB drive. 
    19 The Crown will rely upon the opinion of a Forensic Chemist that:  
     
      
       
      (a) the type of explosives capable of being produced from the chemicals obtained, or attempted to be obtained, by the accused fall into the category of “ 
      primary high explosives 
      ”; 
       
       
      (b) primary high explosives are explosives that may be readily initiated by heat, shock or friction to detonate; and 
      
      
       
      (c) the explosive effects of TATP and HMTD can cause death, serious injury, and/or result in damage or destruction to property. 
        
      
    20 The above documents are but a few illustrations of a very large number of instructions/documents/manuals, which were located in the possession of the accused. Such instructional material covered topics, which included the production and use of explosives, firearms and covert methods to thwart detection by the authorities, and dealing with the authorities in the event of detection or arrest. Where such instructional material was found on an accused’s computer or computers, invariably material of an extremist nature was also found on that computer or computers. Other examples of such instructional material include the following: 
     
      
      (a) A document showing a diagram of an electrical circuit involving a mobile phone and explosive material was found on Moustafa CHEIKHO’S computer. This document was obtained through a Jihadi forum website which invites the reader to have a look at a way to explode objects by using an Ohmmeter and a mobile telephone. 
       
      (b) A document providing specific instructions on how to make the following explosive devices: Molotov cocktails, eagle fireballs, eagle cocktails, towed charge, pole charge, and satchel charge. This document was found on HASAN’S computer. In order to construct some of these devices, the document states that it is necessary to know how to prime charges electrically and non-electrically. 
      
      
       
      (c) A document providing information on how to construct an M14 Antipersonnel Mine was found on HASAN’S computer. 
       
      
    (d) A document identifying the 11 steps required to prepare a non-electric firing system was found on HASAN’S computer. This document refers to the non-electric firing system in the context of demolition work such as breaching minefields, breaching wire obstacles, clearing landing zones, blowing holes in walls of buildings and blowing down trees to create obstacles. 
     
      
    (e) A number of documents relating to surveillance tactics was found at Khaled CHEIKHO’S premises. This included a book entitled: “The Layman’s Guide to Electronic Eavesdropping: how it’s done and simple ways to prevent it” by Tom Larsen. [This book was also located at Moustafa CHEIKHO’S premises]; 
     
      
    (f) A video containing instructions on how to build and detonate a remote anti-personnel explosive device was found at SHARROUF’s premises. 
     
      
    (g) Material in the form of a number of “lessons”, apparently for the training of someone to join the “military organisation” of an Islamic group to undertake militant Jihad. The lessons covered topics such as “Training”, “Weapons: measures related to buying and transporting them”, “Special Tactical Operations” (which include “assassinations, bombing and demolition”), and “Kidnapping and Assassinations Using Rifles and Pistols” (with detailed instructions on the use of various firearms), “Interrogation and investigation at prison and detention centres”. The material was found at SHARROUF’s premises stapled inside the cover of a booklet entitled “Choice Islamic Stories” [for children] distributed by the Islamic Welfare Centre, which appeared to have replaced the original contents of the booklet. [Khaled CHEIKHO’S fingerprints were located on several pages of the document.] 
     
      
    (h) A VHS Cassette Tape entitled “Sheikh Osama’s Training Course” and a document entitled “Lessons by Al-Qaeda and Taliban in the art of hitting and frightening the Americans” was found on a computer at TOUMA’s premises. 
     
      
    (i) Audio and video files displaying the beheading and execution of Westerners and other captives, attacks on the forces of the United States of America (US) and the Coalition in Iraq, images and desecration of dead soldiers, bombings of buildings and vehicles with Islamic chants and cheers and images of deceased martyrs found at MULAHALILOVIC’S premises. Other items found included songs and speeches urging Muslims to engage in militant Jihad including the killing of “disbelievers”; “Treaties in getting prepared for Jihad” and audio files which include discussing the manufacture and detonation of car bombs. 
     
      
    (j) Military documents relating to sniper training were found on JAMAL’S computer. A number of documents relating to sniper weapons and training, and images of snipers were located on HASAN’S computer. 
     
      
    (k) A number of training documents on topics including the manufacture of silencers for firearms, making grenades and mines, “electronics, explosives and poisons” and “explosives engineering” were found on a thumb drive located at the premises of ELOMAR. 
     
      
    (l) An instructional article relating to the kidnapping of nationals of a “hostile country” as part of Jihad was found on BALADJAM’S computer. A number of other documents relating to sniper weapons, physical training and survival skills in the context of military operations were also found. 
     
      
    21 The accused shared a considerable quantity of extremist/instructional material. 22 A brief overall summary of the category of matters set out in chronological and extensive detail in the Crown Case Statement is as follows: 
     
      
      (a) the possession by all the accused of documents advocating extremist views and the carrying out of acts of violence in the pursuit of Jihad; 
      (b) the possession of documents containing instructions for the preparation of violent Jihad, including, but not limited to, instructions on the assembly and use of explosive devices and the use of firearms; 
      
     
     
      
      (c) enquiries about and the intended and actual purchase of, components of and equipment related to the manufacture of explosive devices; 
      
     
     
      
      (d) the possession of such components of and equipment for, the manufacture of explosive devices; 
       
       
      (e) enquiries about and the attempted and actual purchase of, firearms and ammunition; 
      
     
     
      
      (f) the possession of firearms and ammunition; 
       
       
      (g) the use of various techniques and methods in order to protect the operational integrity and security of the objectives of the accused; 
       
      
    (h) the undertaking of other activities by the accused which reveal the accuseds’ terrorist intent, including but not limited to, discussions expressing views as to violent Jihad and attendance at camps; and 
     
      
    (i) evidence of association between the accused and the circumstances of that association. 
     
      
    23 It will be seen from the above outline that a small and relatively confined part of the Crown case alleges a connection between Benbrika, some of his associates and the Sydney men. It is not a large part of the Crown case but it is an aspect of the prosecution evidence which has itself been the subject of various pre-trial decisions in 2008.  
     
      
    24 One of the earliest of those was an application by the defence seeking certain non-publication or suppression orders in relation to the reporting of material emanating, or likely to emanate, from the Melbourne trial. The Melbourne trial had begun on 13 February 2008, and guilty verdicts were later to be brought in against a number of those men, not all of them, in September 2008. Sentencing submissions took place in November and December 2008 and, as I have said, the sentences were imposed on 3 February 2009.  
     
      
    25 On 28 February 2008, at the very outset of the pre-trial proceedings, I gave a decision (R v Baladjam & Ors) in which I refused to grant the injunctions that were then sought. It may be helpful if I reproduce in this decision some of the matters mentioned in that pre-trial decision. It is a lengthy decision and I will quote from it reasonably sparingly.  
     
      
    26 The nature of the “problem” asserted by the defence appears in paragraphs 3 to 8 of the decision: -  
     
      
       
        
        “Last week two counsel for the accused in the present trial went to Melbourne and were granted leave to intervene in that trial for a limited purpose. An application was made before the Melbourne trial judge, Bongiorno J, seeking certain non-publication or suppression orders in relation to the reporting of certain material emanating, or likely to, from the Melbourne trial. Particularly, an order was sought to achieve the proposed suppression by requiring the media to refer to one of the Melbourne accused by a pseudonym, ""C"" or ""Mr C""; secondly, an order was sought to prohibit the naming of the Sydney accused, either individually, or by any collective title or reference.  
        
       
       
        
        As I understand it, these orders were sought on the basis that, if granted, they would protect the Sydney accused from being tried by a Sydney jury, chosen from a population which had been exposed to media reports of the Victorian trial as it progressed. In particular, concern was expressed as to Sydney exposure to the Melbourne Crown's allegation against one of the accused, Benbrika, and to his and the other defendants' connection with the Sydney accused.  
        
       
       
        
        I should mention that senior counsel for the Crown in the Melbourne trial, Mr Maidment SC, had indicated early in the proceedings that for the purposes of the opening and throughout the trial generally, any mention of the Sydney accused in the Melbourne proceedings would be limited to their first names and no mention would be made of their surnames.  
        
       
       
        
        The intervention proceedings took place on 20 February 2008. Counsel heard on the application included Mr Bellew of senior counsel who represented the Sydney Crown, as I shall for convenience and clarity refer to it; and Dr McEvoy who appeared with leave for all the major media interests. As I understand it, all major local and national media interests were represented, except for Channel 10 and SBS.  
        
       
       
        
        On 21 February 2008 Bongiorno J refused the interveners' substantive application, but suppressed details about the application itself until further order. Essentially his Honour held that the time factors involved were unlikely to lead to prejudice and that, in any event, suitable directions could be given by the Sydney trial judge to protect the capacity of adverse publicity attaching to Mr Benbrika from impacting upon the jury's task.  
        
       
       
        
        Secondly, his Honour thought that the Sydney trial judge would be in a better position than he was, or would be, to ensure that the Sydney accused could be tried fairly; and in a better position to adjudicate from time to time upon any matter arising from media reports that might have a tendency to interfere with the fair trial of the Sydney accused.”  
        
       
      
    27 The relief sought was set out in paragraphs 10 and 11 as follows: -  
     
      
       
        
        “The summons originally sought an injunction prohibiting publication of any of the following information which may be adduced during the evidence at the trial in Melbourne:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          1. The names of the Sydney accused, whether in whole or in part; 
          
         
         
          
          2. Any collective reference to those accused and especially a reference to Sydney or any of its geographical parts; 
          
         
         
          
          3. Any reference to the activities of any of the accused charged in the Melbourne proceedings which take place in Sydney, as having taken place in Sydney or any of its geographical parts; or 
          
         
         
          
          4. Or any reference to any of the accused as coming from Sydney or any of the geographical parts. 
          
         
         
         
        By leave, an additional paragraph was permitted to the summons and it has become paragraph 5 of the relief sought. It is as follows: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          5. Any reference to the accused Abdul Nacer Benbrika and any publication in New South Wales, except for the pseudonym ""C"" or ""Mr C"".”  
          
         
        
       
      
    28 Although it may be repetitious, it will be helpful, I think, if I set out paragraphs 19 to 21 of the decision.  
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown case in the present trial will include evidence concerning a Melbourne man, Abdul Benbrika. He was, according to the Crown case, an Islamist who publicly declared his support for militant or violent jihad. As I have earlier indicated, he was one of those charged in Melbourne relating to his principal role there in the terrorist organisation, which is the subject of the Melbourne charges currently being heard.  
        
       
       
        
        It will be alleged in the Sydney trial that Benbrika communicated with certain of the accused. For example, in Sydney, this contact was often covert in nature, involving for example airline travel being booked in false names. Benbrika had regular contact with five or six of the Sydney accused and there will be evidence of conversations intercepted on his telephone service in which extremist words were used or mentioned.  
        
       
       
        
        It is not, however, alleged by Crown that Benbrika is or was a co-conspirator with the Sydney accused. It is not suggested by the Crown that the Sydney accused were members of the Melbourne terrorist organisation. It is not suggested that the Sydney accused played a part in the Melbourne organisation's plan to advance the cause of violent jihad by explosive or violent activity in that state. It is not suggested that there was any joint conspiracy between the two groups to engage in any joint criminal enterprise of violent jihad.”  
        
       
      
    29 The basis of the application before me in February 2008 was the substantial amount of media publicity that had been extensively reported in Victoria, New South Wales and elsewhere in Australia arising out of the Crown opening in Melbourne. Counsel argued that there would be potential prejudice on behalf of the accused arising out of the material opened by the Crown in Melbourne, especially the evidence against Benbrika, but generally in relation to the Melbourne co-accused as well. The particular concern was, however, with material which would not be duplicated in the Sydney trial. As I pointed out in my decision, the “Benbrika connection” was an important part of the Crown case in the Sydney trial but it was limited and, overall, relatively minor in its scope and extent. The material that formed part of the allegations against Benbrika in the Melbourne proceedings was summarised by me at paragraphs 24 to 29 inclusive.  
     
      
       
        
        “Both Mr Waterstreet and Mr Scragg have provided me with written summaries of aspects of the Crown opening in Melbourne. These summaries highlight certain behaviour by Benbrika alleged in the Melbourne proceedings, which will not be part of the case against the Sydney accused. They include the following: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) Activities and communications between Benbrika and an undercover officer concerning explosive material; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) Statements of Benbrika and his co-accused concerning the desirability of blowing up public areas such as football grounds or train stations. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        This very brief summary does not attempt to embrace all of the matters alleged against Mr Benbrika in the Melbourne proceedings. There are many more and they are fully set out in the written submissions which have been provided to me. In the main, these matters do not form any part of the material that is to be led by the Crown in the Sydney trial.  
        
       
       
        
        I have also been provided with newspaper reports, some of which carry rather sensational headlines, about the evidence that will be adduced in the Melbourne trial against Benbrika and his Melbourne associates. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Waterstreet has extracted a correlation between the name ""Benbrika"" and ""bombing"" or ""bombs"". This emerges from a Google search and there were literally thousands of entries matching the two words.  
        
       
       
        
        The gravamen of the arguments before me focuses upon two matters principally. The first is the asserted temporal connection between the Sydney trial and the Melbourne proceedings. It has been argued that although the Sydney trial may not start for some time, there is likely to be an area of overlap between the commencement of the Sydney trial and the conclusion of the Melbourne trial. Consequently, so the argument runs, there will be a potential for prejudice to taint members of the community who may form part of the jury pool. Thus will extend to the actual jury who are selected, if publication of damaging material about Mr Benbrika is to continue in the Sydney media unabated.  
        
       
       
        
        Secondly, it has been argued that although the more unfavourable and damaging publicity about Mr Benbrika is not to be introduced in the Sydney trial, Sydney readers or followers of the media generally will have had their minds poisoned about Mr Benbrika to such an extent that when the trial starts, the jury members will be likely to find the present accused guilty because of their association with such a repellent and dangerous person.”  
        
       
      
    30 In the end I decided to refuse the relief that was sought. My reasoning is contained in paragraphs 43 to 62. I shall set out those paragraphs here.  
     
      
       
        
        “Consequently the questions I propose to pose for my determination are these:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) Have the accused satisfied me that an injunction is necessary in the present circumstances to protect the public interest in the due administration of justice or to maintain the integrity of the judicial process?  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) Have the accused satisfied me in the present circumstances as to the test of necessity so far as the suppression or non-publication orders are concerned?  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        After careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that I must answer each of these questions in the negative.  
         
         
        The first matter to be considered is the nature of the orders sought. It is quite clear to me that these have been both deliberately and carefully framed to suggest a minimal disturbance to the principles of open justice. Despite the care with which they have been crafted, they do not, in my view, disguise the fact, however, that what is proposed is a relatively substantial interference with the first principle of open justice I have stated above.  
         
         
        Secondly, I do not consider that the temporal connection between the two trials warrants the conclusion argued for on behalf of the accused. There is, I think it is clear, a temporal connection. But it is rather more remote at this stage than has been argued. My own present estimate is that there may be anywhere between three and six months before a jury will be empanelled in the present trial. This estimate is based, so far as one can make an estimate, upon the nature of the interlocutory applications I have seen thus far, but, even in the course of this week, I have seen those increase, or at least potentially increase, in a reasonably significant way. Thus, experience suggests it may be many months before anything that could be described as a potentially critical situation might arise.  
         
         
        I positively reject any suggestion that the publications that have occurred in the New South Wales media since the Melbourne trial began in mid February have, or could have, in any realistic sense, already ""indelibly poisoned"" the minds of potential jurors. Many months hence, fifteen jurors will be selected from a pool of perhaps eight or nine hundred citizens. The pool itself will be selected from a vast population area. The possibility that any of these fifteen jurors will or would recall, or will or would have paid much heed to, the material that has been published thus far is quite remote.  
         
         
        Moreover, by the time the present trial commences with the empanelment of the jury, the potential jurors may be quite uninterested in the reporting that will have occurred between now and the time of empanelment. There will be many thousands of media reports on all sorts of topics to divert, stimulate or interest people between then and now.  
         
         
        It is true that recent reporting has painted Mr Benbrika in a most unfavourable light. But there will be many other people painted in an unfavourable light in the media between now and the time of the empanelment of the jury. This will happen on every page of the newspapers. It will happen in many segments of the television news. It will happen on the media that is available and accessible over the Internet.  
         
         
        It is quite possible - indeed somewhat likely - that the reporting itself will not be as intense as the months go by as it has been for the last couple of weeks. I do not suggest that there will not be a degree of reporting of the Melbourne trial as the weeks and months pass, but it is, I think, unlikely to be at the level generated by the reporting of the opening of the Crown case by Mr Maidment in Melbourne.  
         
         
        So often one sees a situation where a Crown opening attracts considerable attention on the front or leading pages of the newspapers but, as the trial progresses, it dwindles towards the back pages. The reporting becomes less intense; the headlines become less sensational, and the like. Of course, I cannot foresee exactly what will happen in the present matter. I have no reason to suppose otherwise than there will be a lessening of publicity.  
         
         
        Further, the surnames of the Sydney accused will not be mentioned in the reporting of the Melbourne trial. To my way of thinking, this is a significant factor in relation to the arguments that have been addressed to me.  
         
         
        I would also add that, in any event, members of the jury pool will, at the outset of the selection process, be invited to seek exclusion from the panel if they feel, for any reason, that they are biased or cannot bring an impartial mind to the task, if they were to be selected as a jury member. This invitation will, so far as I am concerned, be expressed in quite pejorative and precise terms, so as to make it abundantly clear that any person who has a biased opinion about terrorism generally, any person who has a biased opinion about these accused men, or about any aspect of the trial, including the evidence that will be adduced in the trial, has no role whatsoever to play in the jury process. I will not hesitate to exclude any such person from participation in the jury selection process. This is not to be critical of such persons, because bias is something we all experience, as we do with prejudice. But it will be taken into account in that way at the very commencement of the trial.  
         
         
        The next matter I come to consider is that I am conscious that, in England especially, suppression orders, or more accurately postponement orders, have issued from time to time in what are described often as back to back trials.  
         
         
        Now, the position in the present matter is, to my mind, quite different from those situations. First, I do not accept the submission that, having regard to the anticipated evidence, any of the Melbourne accused, including their spiritual leader can be regarded as an un-indicted co-conspirator.  
         
         
        Secondly, I have earlier set out, and I repeat, that no member of the Sydney accused is, on the Crown case, a member of the Melbourne organisation. It is not suggested by the Crown that any member of the Sydney accused played any part in the Melbourne organisation's plan to advance the cause of jihad by bombing or explosive activity in that State; finally, it is not suggested that there is any joint conspiracy between the two groups to engage in a joint criminal enterprise involving violent jihad.  
         
         
        Thirdly, the evidence to be led in this trial of an association between any of the Sydney accused and Mr Benbrika, or for that matter any of the other Melbourne accused, is, in the main, evidence of intercepted calls and of a few meetings. The relevance of the evidence is, as I presently understand it, germane especially to the mental element of the alleged offence and proof of the terrorist nature of the preparatory actions by some of the Sydney accused.  
         
         
        I should mention that there is to be a challenge to the Melbourne evidence, both as to its relevance and as to its prejudicial effect. In relation to the latter aspect, the Court will be asked to exclude the evidence. But, assuming the evidence is admitted, the jury will be aware of no more than the content and nature of the relevant conversations. The relevance and scope of such material, if admitted, will be limited to the conversations, the terms of those conversations, and the meetings themselves. It is true that the jury may become apprised of Mr Benbrika's extremist views arising from that material, but that is all that they will know from the evidence in this trial. 
         
         
        May I divert my remarks to make one further comment. I do not know what the issues will be in this trial. We are nowhere near counsel informing me what those issues are. For all I know, it may become a relevant issue in this trial that the accused, or some of them, will wish to distance themselves from Mr Benbrika and from his views. They may wish to paint him in a bad way. I mention this merely to indicate how hypothetical, in some way, the present arguments are when they are divorced from the real issues in the trial, or they may be when the real issues in the trial are known. It may be that those issues are not even known to counsel at this stage. This is of course, merely speculation on my part; and it plays no part in my reasoning. It is simply a comment. 
         
         
        In any event, to return to the evidence itself, if it be admitted in the Sydney trial, this leads me to the final matter that persuades me that the relief should not be granted. This is the issue of the giving of directions to the jury. The experience of the Court has been that, even in the absence of specific directions, jurors bring a special integrity to their task and have a basic appreciation that they are concerned only with the evidence in the trial and not with other matters, even where those other matters may relate to publication of material in the media.  
         
         
        Secondly, it is the further experience of the Court that juries in the main do pay heed to specific directions given by the trial Judge. There is a great deal of authority now, which provides principal support for the anecdotal experience of individual judges. ( 
        Re: Glennon 
         (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 603;  
        Kanaan v R 
         [2006] NSWCCA 109;  
        John Fairfax Publications v District Court 
         at 103;  
        R v Lodhi 
         [2007] NSWCCA 360 It is, of course, far too early to say what directions should be given to the jury in this matter, or when such directions should be given, especially in relation to publication that has occurred to date, or for that matter to publications which may occur between this date and the commencement of the Sydney trial, or after the trial has commenced. Throughout all these periods, the Court will be in a sound position to assess, reassess and monitor the situation from time to time over the next three to six months, or, indeed, if it be necessary, over the next twelve months.  
         
         
        For all these reasons, I propose to dismiss the summons and refuse the relief sought.”  
        
       
      
    31 The pre-trial decisions then proceeded apace. A number of months later, on 28 May 2008, I gave a decision on the foreshadowed application to exclude the Melbourne evidence altogether. In this decision, R v Baladjam [No 19], I declined to exclude the evidence. It may be helpful, once again, if I set out a number of the paragraphs in that decision where details of the foreshadowed ""Melbourne evidence"" in the Sydney trial were set out. It needs to be borne in mind, however, that some of the evidence that was referred to in R v Baladjam [No 19] has since, for one reason or another, not been pressed by the Crown. Moreover, the “detail” of the evidence should not overshadow the fact that it is, literally, only a fraction of the evidence being led in the Crown case. 
     
      
       
        
        ”The Crown has listed in its written submissions examples of some of the Sydney accused associating or having connection with Benbrika and some members of the Melbourne group. These include: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “(a) Hasan, Elomar and Moustafa Cheikho's visit to Raad and Benbrika in Melbourne on 30-31 August 2004. (On the return trip from Melbourne on the evening of 30 August 2004, the vehicle in which Hasan, Elomar and Moustafa Cheikho were travelling (registered number ULC 693) was stopped shortly after midnight at Sutton Forest by the New South Wales Police. When questioned by the police as to where they had travelled from, Moustafa Cheikho is alleged to have falsely stated ""we've been to Canberra...we were looking at buying a boat"".) 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) On 17 September 2004 at 1/56 Birchwood Boulevard, Hoppers Crossing, Victoria, a search was made of Joud's computer. This located a number of documents, which, amongst other things, provided instructions on the manufacture of improvised explosive devices, firearms and other weapons. The ""weapons caching"" section of one of the documents contained instructions on the storage of weapons and ammunition using PVC pipes and ""slip on type end caps"", with a recommended best choice for sealing them with PVC cement. The document further recommended sealing the ammunition into airtight containers or zip lock bags before placing it in the containers. (The Crown case suggests a connection between this material and the fact that, in November 2005, at a time when the accused were aware that they were likely to be ""raided"", a number of activities occurred, which included the obtaining of items such as those referred to in ""The White Resistance Manual"". This involved a number of the accused obtaining PVC pipes, end caps, cement solvent, airtight containers, et cetera: Despite the fact that this material was obtained shortly before the arrest of the accused, many of these items, and indeed a large amount of ""ammunition"", have not been located.) 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) On 6 December 2004, Benbrika travelled from Melbourne to Sydney by plane. He travelled under a false name. While in Sydney, Joud, Raad, Sayadi and Benbrika were observed visiting a camping store. They spent the afternoon at Sharrouf's residence. Hasan was also there. (On 31 May 2004 and on other occasions, Hasan had attended at various branches of a well-known camping and disposal store and purchased large quantities of camping equipment. He gave a false name and paid in cash. He told the sales staff the equipment he was purchasing was ""for a youth group"", although the clothing and other equipment were in adult sizes. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) Hasan and Sharrouf travelled to Melbourne to visit Benbrika on 23 February 2005. During this meeting, they appeared, according to the Crown, to be printing material from a CD entitled ""A Guide for the Mujahideen"" and they also discussed another book of which Benbrika had only printed one side, entitled ""Martyrdom Operations"". Later, when Joud was present, Benbrika discussed living in an Islamic state and fighting against ""them"" if their law threatened Sharia law. He then discussed preparing the mujahideen, stating: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            “Everyone has to prepare himself. Or to die or to be gaoled...but we have to be careful. If we want to die for jihad, we do maximum damage. Maximum damage. Damage their buildings with everything and damage their lives, just to show. That's what we're waiting for. You be careful...trust no one.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) Whilst at Benbrika's home, there was a discussion among those present about purchasing or ordering laboratory equipment from Haines (this was a company (Haines Educational Pty Limited) based at Oakley, Victoria. (Hasan's wife had contacted the company on 11 August 2004 and asked for a catalogue. The catalogue included laboratory equipment.) During the course of the conversation on 23 February 2005, reference was made to items in the Haines catalogue, to prices, and to a list, which had been made, including a reference to quantities of equipment. 
          
         
         
          
          (f) The “discussion” correlated with a handwritten list of an order, which was ultimately placed with Haines on 2 June 2005. This order was placed by way of a fax sent to Haines from a fax machine at Sayers Road Pharmacy, Hoppers Crossing, Victoria. (This business was located about 1.5 kilometres by road from Joud's premises). The order was in the name of ""Peter Drabjic"". The items ordered were laboratory equipment which, according to the Crown case, could be used in the manufacture of explosive devices, et cetera. A handwritten list of these items with the Haines code numbers and the quantities required was found at Joud's premises during execution of a search warrant on 22 June 2005.  
          
         
         
          
          (g) Hasan and Joud's fingerprints were found on the document located at Joud's premises. The document was in the handwriting of Elomar. A follow-up call in relation to the order was received by Haines on 14 June 2005. The inquirer gave a contact number 0421 002 054. This telephone had been activated on 14 June 2005 in a false name. The receipt for this telephone was located at Hasan's premises on 27 June 2005 during the execution of a search warrant. The address given for the “false name” telephone service was 26 Morris Road, Hoppers Crossing, Victoria (the same street and suburb as Joud's premises). The telephone service was later shown to be used by Hasan in making inquiries with a firm called Techni Ice.  
           
           
          (h) On 27 June 2005 there was a discussion between Sharrouf and Joud concerning the fact that Benbrika's home had been ""raided"" by the police and that this had happened to ""three brothers as well"". There was then a mutual discussion between the two men about this topic, comparing the situation in Sydney and Melbourne. The discussion included a reference to the possibility of police intercepting their telephone calls. 
           
           
          (i) On 27 July 2005 there was a conversation between Sharrouf, Benbrika and others during a car journey, which was captured on a listening device. The conversation included reference to one Taj el-Din. He was apparently a Muslim who had informed on others. Sharrouf was condemnatory of the informer (""may God curse him""). 
           
           
          (j) Between 31 July and 2 August 2005; Benbrika visited Sydney. He was picked up by Sharrouf. Jamal was with Benbrika, having driven him back to Melbourne a few days earlier. There was a meeting at the ASJA Prayer Hall. Hasan and Elomar were seen near the hall at the time. Later Benbrika delivered a sermon at Sharrouf's home. A number of the accused were present then and later.  
           
           
          (k) A number of the accused watched Benbrika's performance on television during The 7.30 Report (ABC TV 4 August 2005). During this interview, Benbrika praised Osama bin Laden and stressed the importance and value of jihad. He proclaimed the only law to be spread ”here or anywhere” was the law of Islam.  
           
           
          (l) Benbrika came back to Sydney on 9 August 2005 to give a ""lesson"". During the visit he was seen with Sharrouf, Khaled Cheikho, Moustafa Cheikho, Hasan and Jamal. 
           
           
          (m) There was a further visit on 31 October 2005. Benbrika came to Sydney Airport where he was collected by Moustafa Cheikho and Sharrouf. He gave a lesson on that day.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    32 One of the principal arguments in R v Baladjam [No 19] was the relevance of the Melbourne evidence to the Crown case. The Crown had submitted that it was generally relevant to the existence and scope of the alleged conspiracy. Further, in some respects it was said to be relevant to the intention of various of the accused in undertaking activities said to be in furtherance of the conspiracy. It was also pressed as relevant to rebut the likely defence case, namely that the acts of the individual co-conspirators might be explained in an innocent fashion, without reference to violent jihad.  
     
      
    33 So far as Benbrika was concerned, the Crown had urged that the limited material involving him was relevant, more precisely, on the basis of the fact that other evidence would show that the accused, or at least some of them, were receiving religious advice and inspiration from Benbrika, a person who supported and promoted violent jihad. There was also limited evidence that the accused may have been supplied by Benbrika and others with extremist material, including instructional material. There was also evidence, as the detail indicates, that they were assisted, at least on one occasion, by Benbrika and Joud, in their attempts to obtain a quantity of laboratory equipment.  
     
      
    34 It is not necessary for me to refer to all of the arguments that were advanced on behalf of the accused in an endeavour to exclude the Melbourne evidence. They were many and varied. Ultimately I held that the material was relevant and should be admitted. In general terms, I accepted the basis of relevance that had been urged by the Crown. In particular, at paragraphs 109-112 I said: -  
     
      
       
        
        “Applying the  
        Evidence Act 
         test of relevance to the conversation, in the light of the manner in which the Crown will contend that the Melbourne evidence generally may be used in the trial, it will be seen that it is the relationship itself between Benbrika and the accused that brings about a situation where the conversation may properly be regarded as relevant. The relationship is one evidenced by the duration, frequency and content of the association between Benbrika and many of the accused on the other. It is that relationship, being one of religious and spiritual guidance, that makes relevant the fundamentalist attitudes expressed both publicly and privately by Benbrika. The relationship is one of spiritual guidance in connection with his views on the dictates of Islam. To Benbrika, jihad is a fundamental precept of his religion. This he makes clear in the interview in The 7.30 Report on the ABC in August 2005. He is an admirer and supported of Osama bin Laden. He does not tolerate other religions. Benbrika is what sections of the media have loosely described as “a fire brand cleric”. Tacitly, he appears to approve of the September 11 destruction of the Twin Towers and the loss of American civilian lives. He is reluctant to ascribe blame to Al-Quaeda, but if they were the perpetrators, their actions were justified. 
         
         
        It is clear that the relationship does not prove by itself the existence and scope of the alleged conspiracy. Nor does the conversation. The conversation, and indeed, the relationship, are but part of an overall circumstantial case that includes the actions of the Sydney accused themselves in ordering laboratory equipment, ammunition and other materials arguably connected with preparation for a terrorist act or acts. It includes as well their possession of extremist material supporting jihad. The nature of the association, in my opinion, is relevant as a circumstantial fact, in proof of the existence and scope of the conspiracy. The accused are men with strong religious views about their faith. They hold strong views about events relating to Muslims in the Middle East and elsewhere. They are disconcerted by the attention paid to them by police and other authorities. They look to Benbrika as a religious leader.  
         
         
        The conversation may also be relevant (although I make no decision at this stage) as part of an act done in furtherance of the conspiracy. The conversation, after all, occurred as part of a wider discussion, which included aspects of religious guidance in the context of Islamic history. It occurred in the context of references to Islamic history including military action, warfare and martyrdom. It included the discussions referrable to a plan to organise an order for the supply to the Sydney accused of a large volume of laboratory equipment. The ordering of the laboratory equipment is alleged by the Crown to be an overt act within the conspiracy. Indeed, the general relevance of evidence relating to that act (including discussion about it) is, subject to some arguments about exclusion under s 137, not seriously put in issue by the accused. Whether the conversation might be relevant in this further way, I shall put to one side. The application of the co-conspirator’s rule will normally be considered at the close of the Crown case. 
         
         
        I return, however, to the primary basis on which the evidence of the conversation is sought to be adduced by the Crown. It is, as I have said, in the context of the relationship between Benbrika and the Sydney accused. It is in the context of his providing spiritual guidance over an extended period of time. The fact that the spiritual guidance is, on a number of occasions, focused on guidance about religious matters that do not extend to the waging of jihad is beside the point. It is the nature of the relationship that makes the evidence of Benbrika’s public and private espousal of violent jihad relevant to the facts in issue, and especially to the existence and scope of the conspiracy.” 
        
       
      
    35 The issue of the possibility of potential prejudice arising because of the possible juxtaposition of aspects of the Melbourne trial with the Sydney trial was also a matter I adverted to in this earlier decision. At paragraphs 132 to 135 I addressed the potential for prejudice in the following terms: -  
     
      
       
        
        “The issue is whether s 137 requires the exclusion of the evidence because the jury in the present trial will be likely to make the wrong use of publicity emanating from the Melbourne trial. This is particularly likely to be the case, it was argued, should the Melbourne trial result in a conviction and should it conclude at or after the time the Sydney trial commences.  
        
       
       
        
        I accept that there is a genuine concern involved in this aspect of the defence submissions. It is probably too early at this stage to make a final decision about the outcome of the argument. Much will depend upon the timing of the conclusion of the Melbourne trial and the commencement of our own. If I assume, as I think I probably can, that the Sydney trial will not begin until about September, how will that affect the position? The best indication I have at the moment is that the Melbourne trial may finish in June 2008. In my opinion, the position is simply too uncertain to make a final decision about these contingencies at the present time.  
        
       
       
        
        I will say this: If the timing of the Melbourne trial throws into very close juxtaposition the commencement of our own trial, I would incline to the view that the use of the names of the Melbourne men ought be altered or shortened in some way to minimise the question of prejudice. I agree entirely with the Crown submission that appropriate directions to the jury to confine themselves to the evidence in this trial will be respected by the jury and obeyed. I have no doubt about that. It is my conviction, having been involved now in many criminal trials over the last eight years as a trial Judge. Prejudice and bias are difficult creatures to harness, however, and I do not consider that the Court should be restricted to the use of but one weapon in its armoury. It is for that reason that, depending on the way events turn out, I consider that some ""editing"" of the identity of the relevant Melbourne men may well be desirable. I put it no higher than that at the present time.  
        
       
       
        
        I propose to leave it to the parties, however, to discuss and agree about the form any such editing or cloaking of identity should take. I would expect the parties to agree to a sensible compromise. I will intervene if that is not possible, but that intervention should be left until the appropriate time, if it be necessary. I do not consider that the “admissions” drafted by Mr Dalton SC, helpful though they have been in considering this aspect of the argument, should be foisted on the Crown if it is unwilling to consent to that course.” 
        
       
      
    36 The final material I considered in that decision was contained in footage of The 7.30 Report program on ABC on 4 August 2005. I addressed the issues relating to this evidence and its potential for prejudice in the trial at paragraphs 170 to 184: Ultimately, I determined the evidence should be allowed and did not require exclusion. At the conclusion of the decision, I said: - 
     
      
       
        
        “The final matter relates to s 137 of the  
        Evidence Act 
        . Should the name of Benbrika be cloaked or made the subject of a pseudonym for the purpose of the viewing of this material? I have touched upon this in an earlier part of this decision. I will not repeat those remarks. I accept that the Crown's suggestion that Benbrika be known as ""Abu Bakr"" may be sufficient. On the other hand, depending on the timing of the commencement of the present trial, it may be necessary to consider a more obscure pseudonym. While I am generally sympathetic to the defence position on this point, I continue to maintain that a jury will pay heed to and respect a direction given by a Judge that the trial is to be determined by reference only to the evidence given in the courtroom, and is not to be influenced by outside publicity, whether relating to this trial or any other trial.”  
        
       
      
    37 Prior to the commencement of the Crown opening in the present trial, the parties informed me that throughout the trial the Crown would refer to Benbrika as Sheikh Bakr and that any of the other Melbourne men mentioned would be referred to by their first names only, and no more. That procedure has been followed up to the present time.  
     
      
    38 It is necessary to refer, again by way of background, to one further pre-trial decision. This was the decision in R v Baladjam [No 59]. It was given much later on 10 November 2008, immediately before the Crown opening. The application had been brought on behalf of all the accused, although it was made in the name of one of them, Abdul Rakib Hasan. The orders sought by Mr Hasan were as follows: -  
     
      
       
        
        “(i) that there be no publication of any information tending to connect criminal proceedings in Victoria against Benbrika, Haddara, Hammoud, Joud, Kent, Merhi, Ahmad Raad, Bassam Raad, Ezzit Raad, Majed Raad, Sayadi and Taha, information or evidence revealed therein, and the proceeding in this Court commenced by the filing of an indictment on 25 February 2008 against Hasan, Baladjam, Khaled Cheikho, Moustafa Cheikho, Elomar, Jamal, Mulahalilovic, Khaled Sharrouf and Mazen Touma. 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) no further publication of the interview between Abdul Nacer Benbrika and the ABC on 4 August 2005 or any part thereof. 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) no publication of any photograph or image of Abdul Nacer Benbrika. 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) no publication of this application or of this hearing.” 
        
       
      
    39 The particular application arose because of wide publicity given to The 7.30 Report, to which I have made reference, in media reports following upon the conviction of a number of the Melbourne accused in mid September 2008. In particular, the publicity had focused on images of Benbrika taken from the 7.30 Report of 4 August 2005. It was anticipated that the submissions on sentence hearing for those convicted in Melbourne would take place on 18 November 2008. As I have said, the Crown opening in the present trial was scheduled to commence on Tuesday, 11 November 2008. The Crown had indicated that it would wish to tender during the trial at least the interview with Benbrika from which segments were taken in compilation of The 7.30 Report. It also wished to tender other material relating to Benbrika's relationship with some of the accused.  
     
      
       
        
       
      
    40 It seems that shortly after the verdicts in the Melbourne trial, Bongiorno J had made an order in terms that were very similar to orders (i) and (iv) in the notice of motion then before me. I had been informed that his Honour's ruling had been made on the basis of the likely prejudice to be suffered by those of the Melbourne accused who would be facing a second trial some time in mid or late 2009 (perhaps later), which would allege certain facts showing a connection with some of the Sydney men. As I understood it, his Honour's order was to safeguard the interests of those Melbourne accused in that respect. The application before me, however, was brought to protect the Sydney accused from a similar problem arising in their trial, particularly in the light of the sentencing submissions that would be made in Melbourne, and the publicity likely to be given to the subsequent sentence. The orders in paras (i) and (iv) were sought by Mr Hasan on the additional basis that Bongiorno J's orders might not have a cross border validity. In other words, the orders were sought, for more abundant caution, to ensure the media outlets, through their local publications in Sydney, did not reveal, when reporting the Melbourne outcomes, a connection between the criminal proceedings in Victoria and the proceedings in this Court.  
     
      
       
        
       
      
    41 So far as the orders sought in paragraphs (ii) and (iii) were concerned, the concerns were more broadly based. The concern was that, when Benbrika came to be sentenced, the publication of images of him, and statements made by him, taken from The 7.30 Report, or the unedited interview, might reinforce in the Sydney jury's mind not only the fact that he was a person with extremist views, but that he was a convicted and imprisoned terrorist. The concern was that, when Benbrika came to be sentenced, the media might rely upon the images in The 7.30 Report, the very material that would or might have been shown to the jury in the present trial.  
     
      
       
        
       
      
    42 In the ultimate, I determined that I should make the orders sought in paragraphs (i) to (iv) of the notice of motion. As it happened, order (i) was made in a slightly amended form but it is not necessary to focus on the difference between the orders sought and the order ultimately made. In relation to the order sought in relation to the images of Benbrika, it may be convenient if I simply reproduce paragraphs 63 to 75.  
     
      
       
        
         
        “I turn then to the major issues, those raised by orders (ii) and (iii). In my view, it is reasonably necessary to make the order sought in para (ii) of the notice of motion. The restriction involved is itself necessary to secure the proper administration of justice. I agree with Mr Dawson, however, that order (iii) is too broad in its terms. I propose to make an order in modified terms to that originally suggested in (iii). I am also satisfied that making an order in the modified form is necessary, and that the restriction itself is necessary for the due and proper administration of justice. I will briefly state my reasons for these conclusions.  
         
         
        First, I do not consider that orders (ii) and (iii) constitutes a ban or a prohibition on reporting the sentencing submissions in Melbourne. Nor do I consider that they would constitute a prohibition on reporting the outcome of the sentencing hearing, including the sentence or sentences themselves. All that will be prohibited is the further publication, for a stipulated period of time, of the images or content from The 7.30 Report, or images or content derived from it or based on it. In essence, all that will be prohibited will be a particular image or images and their potential derivatives.  
         
         
        I do not consider that the situation is comparable to that dealt with in  
        John Fairfax Publications v District Court of New South Wales 
        . There the non-publication order was of the verdict itself. The Court held that the test of necessity must be applied with strictness, and that the objective of ensuring the fairness of a subsequent trial could be achieved in another way. It could have been achieved, for example, by a stay order or an adjournment.  
         
         
        By way of contrast, the non-publication order here does not impinge upon the reporting of the sentencing proceedings or the sentences themselves. In addition, it could not be seriously suggested that either the present Sydney trial, or the Melbourne sentencing proceedings, should be stayed or adjourned. So far as the Sydney trial is concerned, the accused have been in custody, bail refused, for over three years. So far as the Melbourne proceedings are concerned, there is an obvious need that sentences be pronounced at the earliest possible time. Either an adjournment or a stay, in either case, would be a serious affront to the proper administration of justice. 
         
         
        Moreover, the restriction on publishing Benbrika's images from The 7.30 Report is, to my mind, a relatively minor infringement of the principles of open justice, if it be an infringement at all. I accept that the unedited form of the Channel Two interview with Benbrika was an exhibit in the Melbourne trial. To that extent, the non-publication order I propose will, at least so far as New South Wales is concerned, result in a temporary restriction of further publication of that exhibit or derivatives from it. 
         
         
        On the other hand, it could not be said, in a real sense, that the Channel Two interview is an essential part of the sentence proceedings. It is certainly not part of the sentence itself. This is not to say that some reference to the interview might not appear in the reasons for sentence. But that fact would not require the republication, or further publication, of the images that were shown at the time of conviction. To the extent that it might be thought to be necessary, the restriction is, as I have said, of a relatively limited nature.  
         
         
        The important point, of course, is the evaluation of the effect that further publication of the images might have on the jury in the Sydney trial. I am not prepared to say that publication of those images, following the imposition of sentence, necessarily would warrant the immediate discharge of the Sydney jury. As many of my earlier judgments have shown in the present trial, I am firmly of the view that juries pay attention to and heed directions from the trial judge. 
         
         
        If the images of Benbrika from The 7.30 Report were further published in the next few weeks, for example, this would not necessarily lead to the discharge of the jury because directions could be given to them to ignore the content of the reports associated with the publication of those images. There would, however, be a potential risk for a discharge of the jury and, depending on the precise circumstances, that prospect would have to be seriously entertained. Beyond that prospect, there would always lurk an unresolved concern that the Sydney accused might have had their right to a fair trial jeopardised by the insistent publicity surrounding the further publications of the Benbrika images. It is these considerations that drive me essentially to the conclusion that orders (ii) and (iii) are necessary, and that the making of the orders now is itself reasonably necessary. Mr Dawson’s “timing” argument is, with all due respect, unrealistic. The likely timing of the prejudicial events clearly points to the need to make an order at this stage. 
         
         
        Mr Dawson argued that the problems with securing a fair trial could be managed, as he put it, from the inside out. This was a reference, first, to the use of pseudonyms. That measure has, it must be conceded, already been adopted. Secondly, he suggested that the image of Benbrika shown by the prosecution to the jury in the Sydney trial could be the subject of pixilation. I am by no means satisfied that pixilation of images would prevent the jury from realising that the images they may well have already seen of Benbrika at the time of his sentence were those of the same man whose pixilated images were shown to them during the Sydney trial. 
         
         
        There is, however, another point to be made about Mr Dawson's second suggestion. The prosecution in the Sydney trial maintains that it is essential that the jury see clearly the demeanour of Benbrika when he made the statements which I have set out in the earlier part of this decision, those being statements of an apparently extremist kind. Without the ability to observe closely the demeanour of the Melbourne cleric, the assessment of his beliefs and views would be made significantly more difficult.  
         
         
        This leads me to Mr Dawson's third suggestion of management from the inside out. He argued that the Crown, in the Sydney trial, could be simply prohibited from showing The 7.30 Report images altogether. In relation to this submission, to a degree Ms Yehia and Mr Dawson shared something of an unholy alliance. Each, for rather different reasons, supported the proposition that the Crown should not be permitted in this trial to show the jury the images contained in The 7.30 Report. Ms Yehia's position was consistent with that urged by defence counsel in previous pre-trial applications, although it must be fairly presumed that one reason for this approach may have been the apparent cogency of the images in revealing the impact of the genuine fanaticism of Benbrika. It would plainly be beneficial, from a defence point of view, if the images were not shown to the jury at all.  
         
         
        Mr Dawson's embrace of this third suggestion was rooted firmly in the contention that, absent the showing of the footage in the Sydney trial, there could be little complaint if his clients were permitted to show the footage as an attractive, albeit rather sensational, adjunct to the reporting of the sentencing proceedings in the Melbourne matter. There can be no doubt that the ability to show those images at the time of Benbrika's sentencing would be beneficial from the point of view of the media outlets.  
         
         
        Mr Dawson's third suggestion, however, ignores the right of the prosecution to present its evidence in the Sydney trial both fairly and cogently. This right is an adjunct of the due administration of justice. In my view, it would be quite unreasonable to suggest that the prosecution should not show the footage simply because the media interests wished to use it to make their reporting of the sentencing proceedings more attractive to the viewing public. Mr Dawson's third suggestion must yield to this aspect of the proper administration of justice, especially when it is considered in the light of the other matters I have taken into account.”  
        
       
       
      The relevance of the background material 
       
      
    43 I have taken considerable trouble to assemble this background material as a proper context to the present application. It enables, I consider, some general points to be made. First, the present trial has at all times proceeded with the Melbourne trial hovering as something of a cloud on the horizon. This simply came about as a coincidence of timing. The Court, senior and junior counsel, and the parties, have been aware at all times of the need to proceed watchfully and with caution in view of the potential for publicity, particularly sensational publicity, to emerge from any aspect of the Melbourne trial.  
     
      
    44 Secondly, it is fair to observe that both this Court and the Victorian Supreme Court have, it appears, crafted, on occasions, moderate orders, where it has seemed necessary to do so, to restrain potentially troublesome publicity from arising.  
     
      
    45 Thirdly, in general terms, those orders have been respected by the media bound by them.  
     
      
    46 Fourthly, it is fair to observe, as I predicted in February 2008, that the publicity generated by the Melbourne proceedings has diminished considerably, in relative terms, as the months have passed. In practical terms, it might be observed that it has dwindled considerably as a news item of major interest. For example, at the time of the order I made in February 2008, there had been a massive amount of publicity focusing upon the three-week opening by the Crown of the evidence that was likely to be led in the Melbourne trial. As it turned out, that publicity occurred some eight months before the jury in the Sydney trial was empanelled. In that sense, it did not pose any real problem for the commencement of the Sydney trial, although potential jurors would have been possibly aware that there was a terrorism trial proceeding in Melbourne. 
     
      
    47 The verdicts of the Melbourne jury were brought in during September 2008. Again, at that time, there was a brief flurry of publicity, but it was markedly less than the publicity that had accompanied the opening of the trial. The sentences were imposed on 3 February 2009 and, as I shall later demonstrate, the publicity surrounding the sentence had very considerably diminished by this time. Essentially, it demonstrated itself in news bulletins on 3 February, newspaper articles on the 4th and Internet publications on those two days. Although news bulletins appeared on both those days, it is clear, as I shall point out, that the scope of the publicity was very significantly less than it had been at other times during the year. In general terms, the topic had been well and truly relegated away from front headline status. 
     
      
       
       
       
       
       
      The material relied upon by the accused in support of the application 
       
      
    48 The approach taken on behalf of the accused was to assemble, through the affidavit of Juliana Crofts (and other diligent research by counsel), every possible media mention of the sentences in Melbourne. These were to be found in radio news clips on 3 February 2009, and in television news broadcasts on 3 February 2009. They also included media print reports in The Daily Telegraph, The Sydney Morning Herald and the Australian on 4 February 2009. There were two further short articles in the Australian on 5 February 2009. Finally, in the first volume assembled on behalf of the defence, there were a number of Internet reports, principally on 3 and 4 February 2009 (there was one Internet “mention” on 6 February 2009).  
     
      
    49 Not content with this amount of research, at the hearing of the application, the defence by then had been able to assemble some further material that had, after further exhaustive search, been discovered. The “second” volume contained first a list of Google links, that is to say, links searched for and organised by Google on 3 and 4 February. The majority of these were references to links in far away countries: Asia, America, South Africa, Europe and beyond. The second category in volume 2 were a few further Internet reports, principally on 3 and 4 February 2009 (although some were anticipatory of the sentence being dated 2 February 2009). I shall refer to these as the volume 2 Internet material. Finally, I was handed up one Internet extract from the website www.theage.com.au dated 4 February 2009 and a wikipedia entry basically dating from 2005, but with modifications as at 3 February 2009. 
     
      
       
      Submissions on behalf of the defence application 
       
      
    50 The defence asked me to find the following as facts to be taken as accurate in relation to the application: -  
     
      
       
      (a) There has been reference in the trial to some of the Melbourne men who were convicted of terrorism related offences in Melbourne. 
       
       
      (b) The first names of these men were also mentioned in documents in the possession of the jury, namely a chronology of Crown allegations, and the first (of three) folders of telephone intercept transcripts. 
       
       
      (c) The media have, in their reports, “made the link between Benbrika and the name Bakr”.  
       
       
      (d) The Crown material to which reference has been made, and the Crown opening, mentioned that ""Aimen's"" premises were located in Hoppers Crossing. 
       
       
      (e) The jury has seen the unedited interview which led to The 7.30 Report. This means that they have seen footage of Sheikh Bakr in the trial. It follows, having regard to the material relied on by the defence, that there is a link between Bakr and Benbrika, who now stands convicted of directing a terrorist organisation.  
       
       
      (f) The jury has, during the trial, seen images of various of other of the Melbourne men, such as Bakr, Aimen and Fadl, at the Formule One motel at Casula.  
       
       
      (g) Leading counsel for the Crown has appeared in both the Melbourne and Sydney matters. His name has appeared in the press in relation to the Melbourne proceedings and his name is known in the courtroom in the Sydney trial. (For example, the jury has a ""map"" identifying where each counsel sits in the courtroom.) 
       
      
    51 I shall make comments about these co-called “facts” a little later in this decision. Some of them I accept, others I do not. 
     
      
       
      Submissions by Mr Waterstreet 
       
      
    52 In the light of these ""facts"", the submissions made by Mr Waterstreet were principally as follows: - 
     
      
       
      (a) The connection between the Sydney accused and the Melbourne men is of considerable significance to the prosecution case (Mr Waterstreet gave detailed reference to parts of the Crown opening). 
       
       
      (b) The suggestion that Benbrika acted as a spiritual leader to some of the Sydney accused is “dangerous”, especially in the light of some of the detailed findings of Bongiorno J in his sentencing decision (it might be observed that the quoted parts of Bongiorno J's decision do not appear to have been published in the media). 
       
       
      (c) The jury is likely to have made or will make a connection between the ""Aimen"" mentioned in the Sydney trial and the man Joud, who was convicted and sentenced in Melbourne. This is because of his first name and the fact that in the media (or some portions of it) there is a mention of his address being “Hoppers Crossing, Victoria”. This address has been mentioned in the Crown opening and in one of the two documents earlier identified).  
       
       
      (d) Any link between the present accused and ""Aimen"" will be especially prejudicial in light of some of the remarks of Bongiorno J suggesting that Aimen had been a leader in the organisation in Melbourne (once again, this passage in the sentencing decision does not appear to have been quoted in any of the media reports).  
       
       
      (e) The Crown case in Sydney will invite the jury to conclude that activities which might otherwise appear innocent have a sinister purpose. The jury will ""unquestionably"" be more apt to follow this suggestion in the light of its knowledge of the fact that the Melbourne offenders were convicted of terrorism offences. (The Crown in its opening had referred to the first name of three men who were present with some of the Sydney accused at a camping trip at Curranyalpa. These men had the same first name as three of the men convicted in Melbourne.) 
       
       
      Submissions by Mr Dalton SC 
       
      
    53 Mr Dalton SC on behalf of the accused Elomar stressed that many people these days take their information from the Internet rather than from the newspapers (Mr Dalton was conscious of remarks I made during argument that, generally speaking, the newspapers, the print media and the radio had not contained material prejudicial to the position of the accused in this trial).  
     
      
    54 Mr Dalton undertook to do some research on the use in the community of the internet site ""ninemsn"". Mr Dalton's concern was that this particular Internet news item made a mention of the fact that Benbrika was also known as Abu Bakr. Mr Dalton's principal argument was that persons serving on a terrorist trial would inevitably be interested in a terrorist trial in another state or another country and would endeavour to acquaint themselves with the details of that trial or those trials. This would lead them to the Internet. Later submissions took those points up again. In relation to “ninemsn”, statistical material showed that the particular entry had been accessed by 7439 “monthly unique visits”. This, was, however, out of a total of nearly 6.9 million visitations to the website during the same period. 
     
      
    55 Finally, Mr Dalton submitted that there could be no doubt that the jury would make the connection that the person who had been convicted of being the head of the Melbourne terrorist organisation was in fact Sheikh Bakr, the man mentioned in the Crown evidence in Sydney.  
     
      
       
       
      Submissions by Ms Yehia 
       
      
    56 Ms Yehia made some brief submissions of her own. On the accused Hasan's behalf, Ms Yehia said that, if one were to Google ""Benbrika"" and get the wikipedia site, one would find a link to The 7.30 Report, where the full text of the interview is available. Ms Yehia later amended this to note that only the beginning of the interview would be available, not the whole of it.  
     
      
    57 Secondly, Ms Yehia referred to the fact that the defence had attempted to persuade the Supreme Court Registry to enable an approach to be made to stop publication on the Internet in relation to matters concerning the trial but that the defence had been told there was no jurisdiction for that to be done. (This apparently took account of the fact that many of the Internet providers were based outside of Australia).  
     
      
    58 Thirdly, Ms Yehia acknowledged that it might be possible, short of a discharge of the jury, to make some allowance for a modification of the evidence to be led from this point on. While this might lessen the potential for prejudice, Ms Yehia argued that it was, upon reflection, really too late. She instanced the reference to ""Aimen"" and ""Hoppers Crossing"". Counsel also instanced a reference to Sheikh Bakr mentioning ""maximum damage"" in a February 2005 intercepted conversation. Ms Yehia said it had been “reported” in the Internet publication of The Age. At least, it appeared that the particular phrase had been mentioned, even though it had been jumbled up with other phrases that will form no part of the evidence in the Sydney trial. Ms Yehia mentioned that ""the maximum damage"" conversation, taken from the Melbourne trial, is also on the Internet, accessible through a search under the name ""Benbrika"". 
     
      
       
       
       
       
      Submissions by Mr Button SC 
       
      
    59 Mr Button SC made submissions on behalf of Moustafa Cheikho. He made five short points. First, there was a temporal connection between the playing of The 7.30 Report in the trial (this happened on 28 January 2009) and the publicity after sentence which occurred on 3 and 4 February 2009. Secondly, there had been no marked change in Benbrika's appearance between August 2005 and the publishing of the images in the media after sentence. Thirdly, Mr Button emphasised that recent reports referred to an Islamic cleric from Algeria, a person who lives in Melbourne with children, et cetera. There was also a reference in one or two of the reports as to which suburb he lived in. In other words, the descriptions were of a very specific person, and specific in ways identical to some of the characteristics of the man revealed in the Crown case. Fourthly, while Mr Button submitted that the quantity of the Melbourne evidence was small when compared to the Crown evidence overall in the Sydney trial, it was, he suggested, the quality of the evidence that was more important. In particular, the role that Sheikh Bakr is said to have played as an inspirational coach. Finally, Mr Button agreed with the points concerning the Internet made by Mr Dalton and Ms Yehia. Counsel submitted that there were young jurors on the jury and that judicial notice could be taken of the fact that young people are much more likely to use online material as opposed to the print media and the more antiquated artefacts of the now defunct 20th century.  
     
      
       
      Submissions by Mr Scragg 
       
      
    60 Mr Scragg made two broad submissions and one specific submission. The first broad submission was that there would be likely to be an interest among the jurors serving on a lengthy trial involving terrorism to seek out and absorb any news item about terrorism. Secondly, counsel submitted that Benbrika's facial features and his mode of dress were “distinctive”. He said that any member of the jury who saw the Channel Seven news item, or the SBS news item, would be likely to make a link between those images and the image that had appeared when The 7.30 Report interview was played during the trial. Realistically, counsel argued, one had to conclude that one or more of the jurors would have drawn the link already.  
     
      
    61 Finally, Mr Scragg mentioned that his client's connection with Benbrika was detailed in the Crown case material. There was, however, no listening device or intercept material that pointed directly to Mr Jamal having been recruited by Benbrika for terrorist purposes. Notwithstanding this, the jury might conclude, because of the publicity they had seen, that Jamal's very association with Benbrika may have been because he had been proselytized to pursue terrorist activities. At the very least, there would be an unfair risk of speculation on the part of the jury that, on the occasions Jamal was with Mr Benbrika, he had been the subject of an attempted recruitment into the latter's terrorist organisation. 
     
      
       
      Submissions on behalf of the Crown 
       
      
    62 Mr Bellew SC, on behalf of the Crown, distilled its written submission into three broad propositions. First, the Crown submitted that there was at least a real doubt as to whether or not the asserted link referred to in the defence written submissions had been established at all. The Crown submitted that it was simply wrong to concentrate upon the cumulative effect of the mass of material that had been obtained through the diligent research of the solicitor and counsel for the accused. It was more appropriate to look carefully at the material category by category.  
     
      
    63 In this regard, Mr Bellew submitted that there was nothing in any of the radio reports containing any particular reference which would be likely to create the link which was asserted. Leaving aside the opinion piece by Mr Morrison (which did not identify any such link), the other radio reports were simply news pieces within news bulletins. They were short and none of them was, in any sense, a lead item.  
     
      
    64 Counsel then submitted that none of the television news pieces, with the possible exception of two, had any capacity whatsoever to create the link suggested by the defence. Once again, none of the TV news items were lead stories. They were brief. Generally, the images were shown from a distance or otherwise were unclear. In one instance the face of Benbrika was completely pixilated. In other instances, sketches (as opposed to photographs) were shown. SBS was the only one to show a photograph more clearly of Benbrika but it was not apparently an image from The 7.30 Report.  
     
      
    65 The print media was, in no case, a lead item. The Australian article was on page 9. The Daily Telegraph article was on page 11. The second Australian article (5 February 2009) was on page 11. Any photographs contained in these publications were of poor quality, and obscure, making it difficult, if not impossible, to draw any relevant comparison. It was not possible, for example, to determine any facial features from the photograph in The Daily Telegraph article. The photograph in the second Australian article was entirely pixilated. None of them were taken from The 7.30 Report. Most showed a distant shot of a man being led to or from the prison van. 
     
      
    66 Finally, in relation to the Internet material, there were, in all of them, only two brief references, not to Sheikh Bakr but to “Abu Bakr”. Counsel submitted that it would be unrealistic to proceed on the assumption, particularly given the directions to the jury, that a member of the jury would have amassed the entirety of the Internet material and somehow, after careful and deliberate consideration, made a link between the two people.  
     
      
    67 The second major submission made on behalf of the Crown related to the authorities which were outlined in the written submissions. The Crown accepted that the fundamental guiding principle is that each of the accused is entitled to a fair trial. The Crown submitted that the principle must be applied to the particular facts of this case. In particular, it was submitted that the events in the evidence leading to the conviction of the Melbourne accused were not even remotely similar to the events forming the basis of the Crown case in the present trial. It could not be said that the present case and the Melbourne proceedings were based upon “a common substratum of facts”, even in the most remote sense. There may be a few pieces of common evidence but the detailed facts of the two trials were essentially different.  
     
      
    68 The third proposition advanced on behalf of the Crown was this: While it is clear that the accused must have a fair trial, and that this principle must be applied to the facts of this case, there can be no doubt that the jury has been instructed on a number of occasions that they are required to determine the issues in this trial on the evidence called in the trial, and on no other basis. Further, they have been given specific directions about not using the Internet. The defence argument essentially proceeds on the basis that a member of the jury will have disregarded this direction, and will have accessed the Internet in some way, and perhaps located one of the two articles or the Internet Encyclopaedia to which reference has been made. The Crown rejected the defence submission that the jury would be unable to follow the trial judge's directions. On the contrary, the Crown submitted that there is every reason to think that the jury will have followed the Court's directions, and will do so for the future.  
     
      
       
      Principles to be applied on the application 
       
      
    69 There is no dispute between the parties as to the principles applicable in the present situation. It is fundamental to our system of criminal justice that a person should not be convicted of an offence save after a fair hearing according to law (Dietrich v The Queen (1992) 177 CLR 293, 362 per Gaudron J). Although the Court should be slow to stay proceedings or to discharge a jury, in an appropriate case, the Court should not refrain from taking either step (R v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592, 623 per Deane, Gaudron and McHugh JJ; see also the Victorian Court of Appeal judgment upholding the trial judge's order restraining publication of the television series ""Underbelly"": General Television Corporation Pty Limited v DPP). (Case reference to be supplied) 
     
      
    70 It is not necessary for the accused, in a discharge application, to demonstrate that he or she would not have a fair trial. It is sufficient if there is a real risk of prejudice if the trial were to continue (Re K (2002) NSWCCA 374 at (9)(10) per Beazley JA, Sully and Simpson JJ). In that case the Court found there had been “an unacceptable risk” (para 18) and that there would be a ""real risk"" if the trial were to proceed immediately following the pronouncement of the Court's decision. 
     
      
    71 Courts will assume that the jury, properly instructed, will accept and obey the directions of the trial judge to decide the case solely on the evidence placed before it during the trial. As Johnson J noted in R v Petroulias [No 19] BC200711115 at (40) - a judgment involving a stay application:- 
     
      
       
        
        “There is an increasing body of judicial opinion to the effect that whatever pre-trial publicity exists, jurors, when they take on the solemn responsibility of the performance of their duties in the courtroom, differentiate between gossip, rumour, news and opinion which they hear before the case and the evidence which they hear in the Court in the trial for which they are empanelled. A question remains in each case where the intensity, proximity and nature of the media coverage of the particular accused, or the particular circumstances, is such as to occasion the risk of unfairness to the accused so as to prejudice the accused's right to a fair trial for a time after the publicity. A judgment is called upon in each case having regard to the particular facts which are proved:  
        R v Yuill 
         (1993) 69 A Crim R 450 at 453-454."" 
        
       
      
    72 I would venture to suggest that similar considerations arise in an application such as the present, where the publicity is directed not to the accused themselves, but to persons involved in another trial involving similar issues, albeit based upon significantly different facts.  
     
      
    73 In R v Glennon, Mason CJ and Toohey J at 603 observed that the possibilities that a juror might acquire irrelevant or prejudicial information is inherent in a criminal trial, and continued:-  
     
      
       
        
        “The law acknowledges the existence of that possibility but proceeds on the footing that the jury, acting in conformity with the instructions given to them by the trial judge, will render a true verdict in accordance with the evidence. As Toohey J observed in  
        Hinch 
         (1987) 164 CLR at 74, in the past too little weight may have been given to the capacity of jurors to assess critically what they see and hear and their ability to reach their decisions by reference to the evidence before them.” 
        
       
      
    74 In John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited v District Court of New South Wales (2004) 61 NSWLR 344, Spigelman CJ (Handley JA and M Campbell AJA agreeing) said at 366 (102-103):-  
     
      
       
        
        “As set out above his Honour expressed his concern that a future trial judge could not effectively ensure a fair trial by giving the jury directions, particularly as this may highlight the issues which establish the possibility of prejudice. In this regard, in my opinion, his Honour was proceeding on a basis which has, in recent years, come to be rejected by the Courts in relevantly analogous case law. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        There are now a significant number of cases in which the issue has arisen as to whether or not an accused was able to have a fair trial in the light of substantial media publicity, indeed publicity much more sensational and sustained than anything that occurred here. Those cases have decisively rejected the previous tendency to regard jurors as exceptionally fragile and prone to prejudice. Trial judges of considerable experience have asserted, again and again, that jurors approach their task in accordance with the oath they take, that they listen to the directions they are given and implement them. In particular, that they listen to the direction that they are to determine guilt only on the evidence before them.” 
        
       
       
       
       
       
       
      Resolution of the issues 
       
      
    75 The first matter to determine is a factual one. It is necessary to examine the media reporting of the Melbourne sentence and to ask the following questions: Is there, as asserted, a clear connection between the material reported in the Melbourne proceedings and the present proceedings? Would the jury in the Sydney trial inevitably have made the connection between the Melbourne offenders and the Melbourne persons mentioned in the present trial? If not, to what extent was or is there a risk that such a connection would have been, or will be, made?  
     
      
    76 When those factual determinations have been made, it will still be necessary to consider, having regard to the possibility of such a risk, whether it has been sufficiently avoided by the directions which have been given, or by any further directions which ought to be given. 
     
      
    77 The ultimate question, however, is the one I have posed earlier, namely whether there is a real risk, that is not a fanciful risk, that the accused, having regard to the publicity, will be unable to have a fair trial. 
     
      
       
      The media material 
       
      
    78 It is necessary to examine the media material in some little detail. Volume 1 of the media material was assembled and made part of the affidavit of Juliana Crofts of the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales. Miss Crofts said that she had seen television reporting in New South Wales of the Melbourne sentences. She had heard radio reporting and had read newspaper reporting in New South Wales of those sentences. Finally, Miss Crofts indicated that she had seen reporting ""easily accessible"" in New South Wales of the Melbourne sentences. Full details of these were provided. The written submissions of the accused and the Crown were based upon this material. 
     
      
    79 I will deal, firstly, with the newspapers. In conformity with the Court's orders, none of the print media articles contain any information connecting the Melbourne proceedings to the Sydney trial. The Sydney Morning Herald article is written by Karen Kissane. The article focuses upon the leader of the Melbourne terrorist group Abdul Nacer Benbrika. Such of the facts taken from the decision of Bongiorno J as are mentioned in the article focus precisely on the Melbourne activities. There is nothing that connects the Melbourne trial to the Sydney trial. The only possible exception to this is the reference to one of the Melbourne men whose name is given as ""Izzydeen Atik"". (Apparently Atik pleaded guilty and gave evidence against the other Melbourne men, although Bongiorno J found he was a worthless witness of no credit).  
     
      
    80 In the Sydney trial, there will be brief mention of a Melbourne man referred to as ""Izzydeen"", who on a few occasions contacted or associated briefly with some of the Sydney accused. It is fair to say that this is a minuscule portion of the Crown case against the Sydney men. The Sydney trial will not mention the surname “Atik”. The article does not, save for the reference to Benbrika, mention any of the other accused or their addresses. The article appears on page 2 of the Herald. It is quite a small article and does not contain any photography or images. The swearing-in of her Honour Justice Virginia Bell on the opposite page, for example, takes up a much larger area of the newspaper spread and is accompanied by eye-catching photography. Further, the bulk of page 2 is taken up with the index of the paper and an article warning of the dangers of imminent bushfires throughout the country. There is nothing conceivably of a prejudicial nature, in my view, in the article and its surrounding context, in any event, diminishes its impact considerably. 
     
      
    81 The report in The Australian appears well back at page 9. There is the report and also an article on the same page. The leader of the group is referred to throughout as ""Abdul Nacer Benbrika"". There is no reference to the name ""Sheikh Bakr"". It is true, as Mr Waterstreet argued, that the full names of the other men sentenced are set out in a column next to the principal article. Their places of abode are not mentioned. It is, however, also true that the first names of four of those men happen to correspond to the names of persons who will be briefly mentioned in the Sydney trial. They are not unusual names in the Muslim community worldwide. There is no mention in the newspaper report of any matter that would directly connect the Melbourne proceedings to the Sydney trial.  
     
      
    82 In the article by Garry Hughes, which appears below the principal report, there is a reference to the fact that Benbrika came to Australia in 1989, fleeing the war in his native Algeria and seeking in this country greater religious freedom. He is also described as having a wife and seven children. I think it is quite unlikely that any member of the jury would ""dig out"" from this minor article, appearing as it does on page 9, the two sparse facts I have mentioned and draw a conclusion that the man Benbrika may be the person Sheikh Bakr. There is also a photograph of Abdul Benbrika being led from the Supreme Court in Melbourne after the sentencing. It is a very unclear photograph, quite grainy and indistinct. Indeed, the facial features of the man are not particularly like those shown of Sheikh Bakr in The 7.30 Report. It is nearly five years since the interview, and Benbrika has been in prison for over three years. The article is quite balanced and lacking in any sensationalism. It is, as I have said, contained well towards the back of the paper and many other items precede it on earlier pages that would be far more eye-catching and notable. 
     
      
    83 The third newspaper is The Daily Telegraph. This is a publication that would undoubtedly be read by many Sydneysiders, and is unquestionably popular in the area around Parramatta. There is a small article on page 11, which is significantly less prominent than each of the two other articles I have already described. There is also a small picture of the same image of Benbrika being led away by police officers, but it is entirely indistinct and his face cannot be seen. The fact that this innocuous brief article appears on page 11 is a fair indication of how disinterested in the item the more “sensational” newspapers have become by this time.  
     
      
    84 The other articles in the subsequent publications of The Australian do not require any detailed specific comment. The article ""Terror Lurking Within"" has a photo of Benbrika being led from the Victorian Supreme Court, but his face is entirely pixilated. There is a reference to the joint task force operation ""Operation Pendennis"", but this is buried well down in the third column, and is not stated to have any relationship to the Sydney trial. This article appears on page 11 of the publication. 
     
      
    85 I will not take a significant amount of time in describing the television reporting footage. It will be sufficient to deal with it on an overall basis. None of the ABC reports has any photos of Benbrika or images taken from The 7.30 Report. There is a group drawing of all the men in the dock in Melbourne, but the image of Benbrika is dissimilar to that seen by the jury in the Sydney trial. The Channel Ten News has an entirely “pixilated” shot of Benbrika's face. Channel Nine has a distant piece of footage, which similarly would not link the convicted man to The 7.30 Report interview. Channel Seven News has a clearer image, but it is shown very briefly and fleetingly. The only news item having a clearer picture of Benbrika is SBS News, but it is not an image taken from The 7.30 Report. None of the TV news reports were lead items. Overall, each appeared about halfway through the news programme, and they were, in each case. relatively short ""grabs"". For example, the news report on the ABC was 36 seconds; the report on Channel Nine, 33 seconds; the Channel Seven report was similar. The Channel 10 report - with the face of Benbrika pixilated - was 95 seconds. Again, the only one that fell into a slightly different category was SBS where the report was 168 seconds. It was a longer item than the others, although the image of Benbrika was only there for a relatively short portion of that time. There was nothing of note on either Lateline or the ABC Late Report. 
     
      
    86 I turn then to the radio broadcasts. These were, with one exception, as the Crown submitted, very brief news broadcasts appearing during ordinary hourly bulletins. There was nothing sensational in any of them, and nothing which linked the Melbourne trial to the Sydney men. Benbrika was referred to by his own name throughout. There was, as I recall it, no mention of the addresses of any of the Melbourne men who were sentenced. There was an opinion piece by Mr Morrison on 2GB at 4.08 on 4 February 2009. It, however, was harmless and made no connection between the matters in the two trials, or the persons in the two trials. 
     
      
    87 I turn then to the Internet publications contained in Volume 1 of Exhibit 1. The ABC bulletin posted on the afternoon of 3 February 2009 did refer to “Aimen Joud of Hoppers Crossing”. There was a drawing of the men in the dock but the portrait of Benbrika bore no relationship to the image seen by the jury in The 7.30 Report. The image, as I say, was in the nature of a drawing.  
     
      
    88 There were several reports on the Melbourne Age website. These, of course, would be accessible to anyone in Sydney but I doubt whether many, if any, Sydney residents would have bothered accessing them. In any event, there was nothing particularly significant in those reports. One of them had a drawing of Benbrika, but it was not particularly similar to the image shown on The 7.30 Report. Indeed, it was rather dissimilar. One of them had a reference to the phrase “maximum damage”. I will return to that matter shortly. 
     
      
    89 The next four Internet publications were on The Australian website. The first of these has a drawing of Benbrika that is quite dissimilar to the image in The 7.30 Report. This does mention the address of the accused Joud as being “Hoppers Crossing”. It gives the full names of the other men as well, and their suburbs of abode. Benbrika is referred to only by this name in each of the articles. There are brief references to findings of fact made by Bongiorno J in the sentencing proceedings. 
     
      
    90 The only website in Volume 1 that mentioned that the defendant Abdul Nacer Benbrika was also known as ""Abu Bakr"" is the Adelaide Now website of 3 February 2009. This is a detailed, six-page article, and a brief reference to the name ""Abu Bakr"" is to be found in the middle of page 2. Once again, I accept that it would be an accessible website for people in New South Wales, but I hardly think it would be one accessed by Sydney residents to any great degree, if at all. There are other State websites gathered together in the exhibit, but these contain no images and no mention of Benbrika other than by his full name. These websites include Canberra, Melbourne and the BBC News and Asia Pacific. The BBC News does have a facial image of Benbrika that may have been taken from The 7.30 Report. 
     
      
    91 Volume 2, as I have said earlier, was produced apparently as a result of thorough and diligent searching by Mr Waterstreet's junior counsel, Mr Lange. Prior to its tender, it is fair to say there had been only one mention in all of the media reports I have analysed of the name ""Abu Bakr"". There was no mention of ""Sheikh Bakr"". The only reasonable likeness of any duration appeared on the SBS News although it was comparatively brief, and the image shown on the BBC/Asia Pacific Internet site. 
     
      
    92 The first body of material in Volume 2 of Exhibit 1 is the list of links on the topic organised by Google. There is no need for me to detail these. They are all obviously accessible, although many of them relate, as I said much earlier in this decision, to far-flung countries and far-away places. Counsel did not draw my attention to anything remarkable in any of them. 
     
      
    93 The second section of Volume 2, however, did contain one particular publication that drew some comment in submissions. This was a publication on news.ninemsn.com.au appearing at 18:21 on 3 February 2009. The publication tendered before me does not have any image of Benbrika. I have, however, taken the opportunity to access the website myself and I have noted that it is possible to play a recording of the news broadcast that would have been made on Channel Nine on 3 February 2009. I have confirmed that this contains no photographic image of Benbrika, and the only image is one that is not similar to his appearance on The 7.30 Report. The point at issue, however, is that in paragraph 8 on page 1 of this report, Benbrika, who was referred to as Algerian born and the father of seven, is described as ""also known as Abu Bakr"". 
     
      
    94 “Ninemsn"" is an Australian joint venture between Microsoft and PBL Media. It acts as the website for the Nine Network and is popular as a result of it being the default home page for Internet Explorer 6 users in Australia. It is particularly popular, as I understand it, because it actively syndicates television, movie, entertainment, restaurant and gig guide listings. An examination of the home page shows that it is likely to be attractive to young viewers. It has plenty of information on entertainment, and appears to concentrate on news, sport and “gossipy” pop material. I accept that it is possible that it could have been accessed by one of the jurors, although, as I have indicated, it is likely to be more appealing to young people. Two or three of the jurors fall into this category. For those reasons, I acknowledge the possibility, although, so far as I have been able to ascertain, the ""blurb"" for the particular news item was a normal one, and not particularly highlighted in the list of news items for the day. Secondly, the reference to the name ""Abu Bakr"" appears once only and in the context of a two-page publication. There are no references in it to the addresses of any of the Melbourne men. Overall, I do not consider that the article poses any risk to a fair trial. The number of visitations to the relevant article were a miniscule percentage of the overall visitations to the website during the relevant period. The statistics do not assist the defence argument. 
     
      
    95 The other Internet references in Volume 2 do not call for any detailed comment. An entry from the ABC website does refer to Aimen Joud as being ""of Hoppers Crossing"". There are also Internet sites from Geelong, AFP, Market Watch and Livenews. There are no images in any of these.  
     
      
    96 The final two publications that were mentioned precisely in argument were the Internet article by Karen Kissane, published on theage.com website, and an extract from wikipedia, the Internet encyclopaedia. 
     
      
    97 Ms Yehia raised particular concerns about the Kissane article. This was because there was a reference to the jury having heard Benbrika say on one tape (in the Melbourne trial) that he wanted ""maximum damage"" and ""to die for jihad"". 
     
      
       
        
        “He said an act of terror would make Australia withdraw its troops from Iraq...if you kill - we kill here a thousand, the Government is going to think.” 
        
       
      
      
    98 Ms Yehia was concerned that the jury in the Sydney trial will hear an intercepted conversation where Sheikh Bakr mentions the phrase doing ""maximum damage"". However, counsel accepted that the rest of the terminology I have mentioned forms no part of this trial. 
     
      
    99 I consider that the reporting of the two words in an Internet site for the Melbourne Age on page 2 of the detailed article is not likely to raise the kind of prejudice that concerned counsel. It is a phrase that is not highlighted. I seriously doubt whether the casual reader, even an attentive one, would have noticed it at all. 
     
      
    100 The final document is the wikipedia extract. This has a very detailed entry on ""Abdul Nacer Benbrika"". It does indicate that he is also known as ""Abu Bakr"". This publication dates from 2005, although it was updated to take account of the sentence proceedings in February 2009. It is, of course, always possible that a member of the jury might access wikipedia, but I do not think it is realistic to suppose that a juror would be likely to access the entry under ""Benbrika"".  
     
      
    101 I have given the jury forceful directions warning them against inappropriate use of the Internet and its facilities. Mr Waterstreet acknowledged that this was so, but stated that the warning was in the context of any matter arising in this trial. The suggestion that the jurors might endeavour to make a connection between Benbrika and Sheikh Bakr is a matter arising in this trial and it is clear, in my view, that the direction I have given would be sufficient to prevent a jury, acting in conformity with my instructions, from accessing prohibited material. 
     
      
       
      Is there a clear connection demonstrated by the publicity between the Melbourne proceedings and the present proceedings? 
       
      
    102 In my view, there is no such connection. I acknowledge that there is the theoretical possibility that a juror, armed with the diligence, knowledge and interests of Mr Waterstreet's junior counsel, might, after scrupulous search of all the media material I have mentioned, conclude that there might well be a connection between Benbrika and the man Abu Bakr. But I do not consider that an ordinary juror in this trial, properly instructed and directed, would, in any realistic sense, be likely to have endeavoured to or in fact have made such a connection. There is of course a coincidence between the first names of various Melbourne men who will be mentioned in this trial and the first names of some of the men sentenced in Melbourne. Their surnames, however, are not known to the present jury.  
     
      
    103 There is, secondly, a connection between Hoppers Crossing, as the residence of Aimen, and the address of Aimen Joud, who was convicted and sentenced in Melbourne. I accept that this is a closer connection than the mere mention of first names. However, the mention of Hoppers Crossing to date has been slight, has not been highlighted in any way and I am by no means convinced that a reasonable juror would have seized upon, or even become aware of, the address of Joud from publicity following the sentencing proceedings in Melbourne. There is some Internet mention of that address, but very little, if any, elsewhere. It was not mentioned in the newspapers, the radio broadcasts or on television. 
     
      
    104 Thirdly, and most importantly, I do not accept that the media has made the link between Benbrika and the name ""Bakr"" as suggested in the written submissions. Yes, there are two mentions in Internet publications that Benbrika is also known as Abu Bakr. In none of the other publications relating to the sentencing is that fact mentioned. In my opinion, the media has in general terms obeyed the orders I made in November 2008. Certainly, those who were bound by the orders, with the possible exception of SBS Broadcasting, have done so. The first website that made the mention of Abu Bakr was “Adelaide Now” and the second was “ninemsn”. Neither of these are of sufficient prominence to establish the submission made by counsel. There is no direct suggestion that Sheikh Bakr, a person mentioned in the Sydney trial, is the same person as Abdul Nacer Benbrika, the man sentenced in Melbourne. 
     
      
    105 The publicity surrounding the sentencing was brief, muted, and did not assume any particular significance in any broadcast or news item. Generally speaking, the matter was only mentioned on the day of sentencing, or, in the case of newspaper reports, on the following day. Thereafter, other news has completely swallowed the topic up and it has not been mentioned again. In the days immediately following the sentencing, the media focused on major issues, such as the gloomy economic situation and then the terrible bushfire catastrophe in Victoria.  
     
      
    106 My firm view is that the entire topic of the Melbourne sentences came and went with very little fuss or attention. I watched the jury carefully on the day after the sentences and I observed no indication that their usual diligence in listening to the evidence was in any way distracted or altered from that which it had been prior to the imposition of the Melbourne sentences. No juror has sent me a note, or raised with me any question about the Melbourne sentences. At the request of counsel, I gave a brief direction to the jury on 4 February 2009, reminding them that they were to pay heed only to the evidence in this trial. This was said to be in conformity with my original instructions and their usual practice. The members of the jury indicated by their demeanour that they understood this direction perfectly. The trial has now continued for some weeks since the Melbourne sentences were pronounced. The jury has continued to go about its business carefully and apparently quite unperturbed by any aspect of the Melbourne matter, 
     
      
    107 In all the circumstances, having considered the facts of the argument carefully, I have come to the conclusion that the jury would not have inevitably made the connection between the Melbourne offenders and the Melbourne persons mentioned in this trial. I acknowledge, however, that there might have been some minor potential for that occurring. But, overall, I consider it most unlikely that any such connection would have occurred to jurors or would, in fact, have been made. Overall, the methodology employed by the defence in assembling material to suggest that the jury will have made a connection between the two trials is flawed, at least in two respects. 
     
      
    108 First, the assembly of every possible publication in this manner is not likely to have been the way any news item might potentially have come to the attention of an individual juror. Secondly, the defence approach has been based on its positive knowledge that there is in fact a connection between the two trials. What the defence has done is to “scour” every article for any possible connection and, in the few instances where such a connection might conceivably be made, seize upon it, like an amateur sleuth, as proof of the inevitable. A more realistic appraisal of the situation, from the perspective of the average juror, is that he or she may have seen a report of the sentences, brief though it was, in one or perhaps, more than one, of the media publications, and left it at that. There is no warrant for supposing any juror would have gone on the “hunt for clues” envisaged by the defence submissions. 
     
      
    109 A further matter that needs to be brought into the equation is that the Melbourne evidence is, in truth, a very small part of the overall Crown evidence. The jury have been listening to evidence for four months. Often each day they will have heard evidence from as many as eight to ten witnesses. They have been given a considerable number of folders, maps and copy exhibits. The Melbourne evidence has not been of any special significance. Nor has it been singled out from the vast body of evidence, of which it forms but a fraction. The ABC interview was shown in less than half an hour. It was not sensational evidence, simply one man expressing his opinion to an interviewer. I doubt whether the jury would recall where the man came from or how many children he had. Those facts were completely incidental to the interview. In addition, it was his opinions, not his appearance, that were particularly notable in the interview. The Crown case has already involved the calling of approximately 200 witnesses. A substantial number of further witnesses is anticipated, probably as many again. The Crown case statement is 181 pages long and has nearly 700 footnotes of densely concentrated evidence. It is not unfair to describe the Melbourne evidence as but a fraction of this material. Its significance is of no greater dimension than the remainder of the other material relied on by the Crown. It is all part of a detailed and elaborate mosaic or pattern going to make up the circumstantial case to be relied on by the Crown. That mosaic, including the fragments represented by the Melbourne evidence, will not fall to be considered in its entirety until the passage of a further four or five months. By that time, the publications in Exhibit 1 will be a distant memory and their impact, slight as it was likely to have been, if there had been any impact at all, will have been consigned to the oblivion inevitably awaiting “yesterday’s news”. 
     
      
    110 Finally, I remind myself that I have given extensive directions to the jury in this matter, and indeed to the jury panel before the jury was selected. I will not overburden this decision by setting out those directions in detail. Directions of this kind, referring to the need to determine the issues on the basis of evidence in the trial, were given on 27 October 2008 to the jury panel. Directions were given to the jury itself in relation to the dangers of Internet usage on 3 November 2008. A third and fuller direction was given again on 11 November 2008. There have, as well, been many other occasions, between November and the present time, when I have reminded this jury of the fact that they must determine the issues arising in this trial only on the evidence that is presented before them in this courtroom. I have counselled them on numerous occasions to keep this direction steadfastly in mind. As I have said, a carefully crafted but brief direction on the same point was given on the very morning of 4 February 2009. This jury has shown every indication that it is very alive to and willing to comply with the directions given by the Court. I have every reason to suppose that they have heeded my various directions to determine the issues in this trial solely on the evidence placed before them in this courtroom, and by no other means. 
     
      
       
      Other matters 
       
      
    111 Mr Waterstreet's written submissions suggested that the case of R v Sheikh 144 A Crim R 124 is ""on all fours"" with the present matter. In my view, this is not so at all. In that case, the appellant had been joined with three others in an indictment containing nineteen counts, only two of which were in respect of the appellant. A separate trial was ordered, as prejudice was likely to be suffered by the appellant because of the presence at trial of evidence inadmissible against him but admissible against the others. The appellant's trial began two days before the return of the verdict in the trial relating to the other men. The appellant was in fact being cross-examined when the verdict on the earlier trial was delivered. There is no need for me to go into any further detail in this matter. The following points of difference, however, may be noted: -  
     
      
    · Following the verdict against the other men, intense and angry media coverage spanned a full week between 7 and 14 June 2002. 
    · Coverage included broadcasts and telecasts providing extensive and graphic reporting of the earlier trial and strongly expressed commentary about the conduct, character and the just deserts of the accused.  
    · The overlap included the fact that the same complainant was involved in both trials; that the relevant locations of the alleged offences were the same; and that a series of connected events occurred at each trial in relation to the same identification of locations. The complainant’s reliability and courage were praised in all the reports. 
     
      
       
      
    · There were other overlapping similarities, including the ethnicity of the accused, the date of the gang rape, and the surrounding circumstances, where the complainant had been lured off a train and sexually assaulted at Bankstown Railway Station before being taken to other locations in the Bankstown area. 
    · In addition, the Court of Criminal Appeal considered that the directions given by the judge to the jury were obscure and would have puzzled the jury. 
    112 In the present trial, by way of comparison, the focus is on the activities of the five accused and the other persons named in the indictment as co-conspirators. Broadly speaking, the Melbourne evidence is but a small part of the overall circumstantial case and, with one relatively brief exception, is relevant to the intentions of the men and proof of the mental elements in the charge. 
     
      
    113 The one exception I have mentioned is that Aimen and Sheikh Bakr are said to have been involved in one of the overt acts, namely the ordering of laboratory equipment from Haines Educational in June 2005. That allegation, however, did not form part of the evidence in the Melbourne trial. It is my understanding that the particular event may, however, become part of the evidence in the future trial against Joud in Melbourne, although no date has yet been set for the commencement of that trial. 
     
      
    114 The evidence in the Melbourne proceedings was, apart from the brief areas of commonality I have mentioned, completely different to the Sydney trial. The charges were different and the nature of the allegations was different. I accept that there were some commonalities of a general nature, for example, ethnicity, terrorism and the presence of a spiritual leader. But the specific allegation against Benbrika in Melbourne was that he was the leader of a terrorist organisation. That allegation is not made in the Sydney trial. The role of Benbrika in relation to the Sydney men is far more muted. He is not alleged to have been one of the Sydney co-conspirators and his role is generally confined to being that of a spiritual guide to some of the men, not all of them. While I accept that the commonalities require that the Court approach the present application with caution and care, I am not satisfied that the publicity that has occurred in Melbourne has created a risk in real terms that the accused will not receive a fair trial. The risk adverted to by the accused is, in my opinion, upon analysis an unrealistic and fanciful one. I reject the submission that, in light of the publicity I have analysed in detail, it is no longer possible to safeguard the accused's right to a fair trial. 
     
      
    115 I have not in these reasons endeavoured to answer specifically every submission made by individual counsel. I will, however, mention briefly those that I consider warrant a specific response. The common theme underlying all the submissions is that the jury, being concerned with a terrorist trial in Sydney, will be likely to find out all they can about any other terrorist trial, whether occurring in Sydney or elsewhere. I do not consider that any basis, beyond speculation, has been established for this proposition. It is just as likely that the voluminous detail of the present trial, and the time and attention the jury is having to give to it in diligent performance of their duties, make it highly unlikely that any of them would want to trawl through publicity about another trial in detail. I accept that they might be interested to note the outcome of a sentencing procedure in Melbourne in a terrorist trial. But I hardly think it likely that their interest would be any greater than that. Counsel's submissions are, in my view, merely speculative. More importantly, they ignore the clear and repeated directions that have been given to the jury to decide this trial on the evidence adduced in these proceedings. 
     
      
    116 Secondly, having considered carefully the images of Benbrika shown in the recent publicity, I am not satisfied that there is any real likelihood that the jury will link that footage with the images they have seen of Sheikh Bakr in The 7.30 Report interview. Similarly, although they have seen brief images of Bakr, Aimen and Fadl at the Formule One Motel at Casula, it must be said that that was a fleeting glimpse a considerable time ago and one not highlighted in any sense at all. Moreover, those particular images were very indistinct and unclear. I rather doubt that the jury would at present remember the fact that the images were shown to them at all. Although the footage was initially admitted into evidence and played briefly to the jury, it was subsequently withdrawn by the Crown as an exhibit and it was marked for identification in lieu, following a request from one of the accused. My recollection is that it was shown for no more than several minutes. 
     
      
    117 Thirdly, the remarks on sentencing made by Bongiorno J in Melbourne were over seventy pages in length. Those portions of it mentioned in the media were very brief and singularly sparse. 
     
      
    118 Fourthly, I accept that it was perhaps regrettable that The 7.30 Report was played to the jury on 28 January 2009, in circumstances where the publicity, after sentence, occurred on 3 and 4 February 2009. This was nobody's fault, as it could not have been anticipated that Bongiorno J would give his decision when he did. (It had been anticipated that the decision would not be given until March or April 2009. Circumstances not relevant to this decision made it necessary for his Honour to give the decision hurriedly, and when he did.) I have taken this point made by Mr Button SC into account. I have considered it carefully but it does not, for the reasons I have given generally, lead to a different conclusion in relation to the application.  
     
      
       
      Final matters 
       
      
    119 There are two final points to be mentioned. While I consider that the directions that have already been given to the jury are sufficient, I will give counsel the opportunity to address me as to whether any further directions are needed. 
     
      
    120 Secondly, I have made some suggestions during argument about ways and means of the presentation of the Crown's further evidence, so as not to over emphasise the Melbourne connection. While I do not think this is really necessary, it can do no harm if the Crown and the defence endeavour to have a meeting of minds on this issue. I will leave it to the parties to have that discussion between themselves. 
     
      
       
      Order 
       
      
    121 For all these reasons I have concluded that the application for discharge of the jury should be refused. That is the order I make.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an appeal against conviction on a count of unlawfully causing a person to take a stupefying thing with intent to commit an indictable offence contrary to s 38 of the Crimes Act 1900 as applicable at the date of the alleged offence, namely 22 April 2006.  
     
      
    2 The appellant was tried before Nield DCJ and a jury at Katoomba District Court on an indictment containing that count and two further counts charging aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. He was found guilty on all three counts. The appeal challenges only the conviction on the first count.  
     
      
    3 As a result of a short relationship, the appellant fathered the victim, a daughter who was born on 28 October 1991. Although he had other children, he lived as a single man. In years recent to the offences, the appellant re-established some contact with the complainant’s mother and his daughter occasionally stayed overnight at his house on a weekend. She came for that purpose on 22 April 2006. At the time she was fourteen and half years of age and the appellant was forty. 
     
      
    4 In the afternoon, the appellant purchased eight bottles of “Vodka Cruiser” and some beer. It was common ground that the complainant had not previously drunk alcohol. At his urging she drank two of the bottles of Vodka Cruiser after which she said she did not want to drink any more. The appellant encouraged her to get drunk by consuming the remaining bottles and he made a “bet” that, if she drank them, she could have all the coins that were lying on a table in the loungeroom. These had previously been counted and amounted to $137.  
     
      
    5 The appellant gave evidence at his trial. He did not dispute these facts but claimed that it was his intention to “street smart her, get her to understand and know how to moderate her drinking ….now she knows not to have eight Cruisers.” He agreed that the complainant “started stumbling, slow speaking, slurring” and when asked whether she was intoxicated to the degree of “falling down, legless drunk” he responded “a bit less than that.” 
     
      
    6 The complainant agreed that she had eventually drunk all eight bottles. After she had drunk four of them the appellant began to kick a ball saying she would feel better if she moved about. She couldn’t kick the ball and said that she felt “weird” and her legs were shaking. After watching some television she went to bed. She felt that she was “spinning” and she vomited into a receptacle (an “esky”) which had been located nearby to her bed. 
     
      
    7 During the night she awoke to find the appellant in bed with her under the covers. The first sexual assault then occurred. The complainant rose and went to the toilet feeling confused as to what was happening. When she came out of the toilet she saw the appellant was then lying in the living room, so she returned to the bed. She went to sleep but awoke again as the appellant had returned and the second sexual assault took place. In response to a question from him she said (untruthfully) that she “was fine” but she gathered her belongings into her bag and unlatched the door. She took some money from the table and ran to the house of a friend. She was later contacted by her mother to find out why she had not stayed at her father’s house and after inquiry, her mother took her to the police station.  
     
      
    8 The appellant sent a series of text messages to the complainant. It can be observed that a jury may well have regarded the content of some of these as inculpatory of the appellant. 
     
      
    9 Mr Smith of counsel for the appellant (who did not appear at trial) argued that the conviction on the first count could not be sustained for either or both of two reasons. First, he submitted that it was not unlawful for the appellant to supply alcohol to his daughter and, second, that alcohol was not a “stupefying thing” within the meaning of that expression in s 38. 
     
      
    10 Section 38 (as applicable in this instance) was in the form originally legislated in the Crimes Act 1900, subject to a subsequent change in the available maximum penalty from penal servitude for life to 25 years imprisonment. The provision has earlier antecedents in the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 (24 and 25 Vict c 100) (Imp). The relevant statutory prescription was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        38. Using chloroform, &c., to commit an offence 
        . Whosoever unlawfully applies or administers to or causes to be taken by, or attempts to apply or administer to, or cause to be taken by, any person, any chloroform laudanum or other stupefying or over-powering drug or thing, with intent in any such case to enable himself, or another person, to commit, or with intent to assist another person in committing, an indictable offence, shall be liable to penal servitude for life.” 
        
       
      
    11 In support of the first argument counsel referred to the Liquor Act 1982 (in effect as at 22 April 2006) which provided (so far as is relevant): 
     
      
       
        
        “114(1) A person shall not, in any place ….supply liquor to a person under the age of eighteen years 
        
       
       
        
        ….. 
        
       
       
        
         (6) It is a defence to a prosecution for an offence under subsection (1) …..if it is proved that the defendant was a parent …..of the person to whom the liquor was ….supplied …..” 
        
       
      
    12 Attention was drawn to one of the practice texts which described the elements of an offence under s 38 as: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) The accused unlawfully  
        
       
       
        
        …. 
        
       
       
        
         (iii) Caused to be taken ….a substance  
        
       
       
        
         (2) which was ….. 
        
       
       
        
         (iii) a stupefying ….thing; and 
        
       
       
        
         (3) the accused intended to enable himself ….to commit an indictable offence ….”  
        
       
      
    13 It was contended that it should therefore be concluded that the legislative expression “unlawfully” related to the act of “causing to be taken” and the provision should be construed to require proof of an objective element of unlawfully causing the stupefying thing to be taken and, separately, a subjective intention to commit an indictable offence. 
     
      
    14 The submission misconstrues the meaning of “unlawfully.” As is the case in numerous similar legislative prescriptions, the meaning is “without lawful excuse”. Hence it would not be unlawful if, for example, a supply was made under duress or for a genuine therapeutic purpose. 
     
      
    15 The construction argued for the appellant which disjoins the unlawful causing to be taken from the intent to commit an indictable offence should be rejected. As the Crown Prosecutor Mr Arnott SC pointed out, if the legislature had intended that “unlawfully” was confined to qualifying that part of the provision which included “causes to be taken”, the section could simply have been drafted to insert the word “and” before “with intent”.  
     
      
    16 The defence made available under s 114 (6) of the Liquor Act above recited is, in its terms, referrable to a prosecution under s 114 (1) and does not purport to extend scope beyond what is stated in the provision. 
     
      
    17 It is not the case that the word “unlawfully” in s 38 has no work to do. In its appropriate meaning of “without lawful excuse” it in particular makes available defences such as have been exemplified above.  
     
      
    18 I would reject the first proposition argued by the appellant. 
     
      
    19 The second submission was that alcohol was not comprehended within the expression “stupefying thing” in s 38. 
     
      
    20 With commendable candour, Mr Smith acknowledged that unless this Court concluded that the decision of the Victorian Full Court in R v Murcott & Ah See 1893 XIX VLR 408 was wrong, his argument must fail.  
     
      
    21 Murcott was a case where the offenders sought to ply the victim with alcohol in the form of what was described as chinese brandy. An expert was called who testified that the liquor was “a cordial aromatic stimulant weaker than the best brandy, but about the same strength as common brandy.” He added an opinion that if “that girl (the victim) drank half a tumbler of the spirit after a glass of ale it would ultimately stupefy her.” 
     
      
    22 I interpolate that in the present trial there was no expert evidence of this type but there was no dispute about the effect on the complainant, some aspects of which have been described above. Dr Thacker, who examined the complainant at Bathurst Base Hospital was not asked about this nor was it inquired of her whether she felt qualified to express an opinion. She said that a person under the influence of alcohol would be relaxed and interference with the vagina of a very relaxed person would not necessarily produce injury. She had detected no injury when she examined the complainant. 
     
      
    23 The prosecution in Murcott alleged breach of s 19 of the Crimes Act 1890 (Vic) the wording of which was slightly different from s 38 but, as Mr Smith correctly conceded, it was not different in any material way.  
     
      
    24 Section 19 was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whosoever shall unlawfully apply or administer to or cause to be taken by or attempt to apply or administer to or attempt to cause to be administered to or taken by any person any chloroform laudanum or other stupefying or overpowering drug matter or thing with intent in any such cases thereby to enable himself or any other person to commit or with intent in any of such cases thereby to assist any other person in committing an indictable offence shall be guilty of felony and being convicted thereof shall be liable at the discretion of the Court to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding seven years.” 
        
       
      
    25 The submission by the offenders (Murcott and Ah See) was that the section was never intended to cover alcoholic liquors which intoxicated, but merely cover drugs of known stupefying or overpowering qualities. 
     
      
    26 Rejecting that submission Madden CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It would have been plainer, no doubt, if the section had contained more explanatory words, for instance, if the word ‘intoxicating’ had been added. We think, however, that there is enough to show that the offence here charged is fairly supported by the evidence. The argument that the words which follow ‘chloroform’ and ‘laudanum’ mean really something of the same character as chloroform and laudanum and would not cover other things having different effects, cannot prevail. If the sentence had stopped at the word ‘drug’, or the word ‘drug’ had not been used at all, much might have been said in favour of the argument that the thing to be ‘administered, taken, or applied’ must be something of the same character as chloroform and laudanum. But the word ‘drug’ is used and it is followed by the words ‘matter or thing’, so that the administration not only of a drug but of any ‘other stupefying or overpowering matter or thing’ is sufficient.” 
        
       
       
      Holroyd and Hood JJ were in agreement with the Chief Justice. 
       
      
    27 It is the capacity of the “thing” to stupefy and not the class of substance which is relevant. It can be observed that in editions of Archbold in relation to the foundational legislation of 1861 the editors have commented “if the drug etc is not named in the indictment, evidence must be given to show that it was of a stupefying or overpowering nature, calculated to aid the offender in the commission of a felony.” This comment has been reproduced in local texts, for example, Criminal Law in New South Wales Watson & Purnell. 
     
      
    28 I have above observed that in the present case the effect on the complainant was not in real contest and there was ample evidence for the jury to conclude that she was in fact stupefied by the ingestion of the alcohol. 
     
      
    29 I would not depart from the views expressed in Murcott and in my opinion the construction offered therein was correct. 
     
      
    30 In deference to the argument canvassed in the appellant’s written submissions I should note the analysis of the replacement of s 38 by a substituted provision which took effect on 28 March 2008. The amendment was achieved through the Crimes Amendment (Drink and Food Spiking) Act 2008. The new provision refers to an “intoxicating substance” and there is a definition of this to include “alcohol or a narcotic drug or any other substance that affects a person’s senses or understanding”. As the name of the amending statute suggests, a particular mischief at which the new provision was directed was the practice of “spiking” drinks.  
     
      
    31 I would reject any contention that the amendment responded to some gap in earlier legislation whereby alcohol was not included as a possible stupefying thing. I would derive no assistance from the subsequent statute to resolve ambiguity in the earlier provision as it is my view that there was no ambiguity to be resolved: cf Allina Pty Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation 1991 28 FCR 203 at 212. I would reject the second submission. 
     
      
    32 I propose that the appeal against conviction on count 1 of the indictment be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is a Crown appeal brought pursuant to s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. That provision concerns the adjustment or correction of sentence when a person has failed to be forthcoming with promised assistance to prosecution authorities after receiving a reduction in sentence for a promise so to do. Such a reduction has statutory authority in s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The purpose of s 5DA is to correct, with the benefit of hindsight, what can be seen to have been a miscarriage in the sentencing process. It is not punitive: R v El-Sayed  (2003) 57 NSWLR 659. Section 5DA (2) provides that the Court may impose such sentence as it thinks fit. 
     
      
    2 The respondent pleaded guilty in the Local Court to an offence of soliciting to murder. This offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years with a prescribed non-parole period of 10 years. On committal for sentence by Charteris DCJ in the Sydney District Court, his Honour was asked to take into account on sentence pursuant to the Form 1 procedure an offence of being an accessory before the fact to malicious damage of property by fire. That offence has a maximum prescribed penalty of 10 years imprisonment. The respondent was sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months commencing on 26 March 2007 and expiring on 25 September 2010 with a balance term of 2 years 3 months. 
     
      
    3 In a written submission on behalf of the respondent it was stated that the respondent accepted the background, facts and undertaking as set out in written submissions by the Crown. It will suffice to refer to these in summary as it was further stated on behalf of the respondent, “It is conceded that on 11 June 2008 the respondent failed to fulfil his undertaking.” 
     
      
    4 The respondent was employed by Brian Murphy whose business, MMP Industrial Pty Limited, was in competition with Stalyce Holdings Australia Pty Limited whose principal was one Craig O’Sullivan. The respondent acted as a “middle man” in arranging damage to this competitor’s operations and, ultimately, the intended murder of Mr O’Sullivan. 
     
      
    5 There were others involved to various extents but it is not necessary to recount that detail. The respondent was supplied with large amounts of cash by Brian Murphy, which he paid from time to time to one Gavin Crosby, who might be described as the active participant. At the relevant time, Crosby had recently been released from prison. 
     
      
    6 As a result of arrangements made, on 16 July 2006 Crosby lit a fire which damaged some contents of and the Stalyce factory building. The factory was not destroyed. For further payment, Crosby later agreed to murder Mr O’Sullivan. Carrying out of this plan was impeded somewhat by Crosby being arrested by police from time to time for unrelated matters. In a telephone call in October 2006 the respondent told Crosby that, in effect, he had to perform the killing or refund the money which had been advanced to him. He had apparently spent this money. However, between 1 and 15 November 2006 Crosby was again in custody and the respondent unsuccessfully tried to find someone else to carry out the killing. 
     
      
    7 On 22 November 2006 the Stalyce factory was destroyed in another fire but, as at the time the respondent appeared for sentence, no one had been charged in respect of that fire which investigators believed had been deliberately lit.  
     
      
    8 Investigations had been taking place and evidence, including the content of the intercepted telephone calls, was being gathered. On 26 March 2007 the respondent was arrested at his home. He was interviewed by police and made what his Honour described in his remarks on sentence as “full admissions”. He observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender admits that Brian Murphy, his employer, approached him to ‘wipe out’ the Stalyce business. The offender confirmed his contact with the man ‘Gavin’, who of course, is Crosby. Some of the offender’s answers, appeared to me, to be guarded, but the offender made admissions concerning the arson, and also concerning the soliciting to murder offence. He agreed he had paid the man Gavin sums of money provided to him by Murphy. He agreed that Murphy wanted to ‘put a hit on the owner’ of Stalyce, meaning to murder him. Murphy had provided the offender with O’Sullivan’s personal details. The offender agreed with police that he had paid $40,000 to Gavin re the murder contract, and later a further $10,000. He further agreed that he gave Gavin a deadline to carry out the murder. 
        
       
       
        
        Tapes of intercepted telephone calls were played to the offender during the interview. The offender agreed that he and Gavin sometimes talked in code upon the telephone. 
        
       
       
        
        As regards the role played by him the offender said ‘I don’t know why I done it, I really don’t’.” 
        
       
      
    9 In the course of the sentencing proceedings on 20 December 2007 the Crown tendered an undertaking by the respondent to give evidence in proceedings against Brian Murphy. Annexed to the undertaking were a series of statements by the respondent made between September and November 2007 detailing, inter alia, his dealings with Murphy wherein he was asked by Murphy to arrange a fire at the Stalyce premises and later to arrange the murder of Craig O’Sullivan. In addition the respondent described the passing of money supplied by Murphy between himself and Crosby.  
     
      
    10 Charteris DCJ did not nominate a starting point of his sentence assessment but he expressly referred to allowances which he made in favour of the respondent. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I take note of the provisions of section 23  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         1999 (NSW). I find the past assistance given to authorities and that provided for the future is significant and useful. I accept that the offender is presently subjected to harsher custodial conditions on protection, as a consequence of his assistance to date and his promised testimony in the future. I think it likely the offender will spend much, if not all, of his time in prison under protection as a result of his cooperation with authorities. I accept, consistent with the evidence that I have heard in many cases over a number of years, that prisoners on protection had reduced opportunities for employment and continuing education within the prison system. The sentence is served under harsher conditions than that served in the general prison. 
        
       
       
        
        I will not lose sight of the requirements of section 23 (3)  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         1999 (NSW) so that the sentence I impose must not be disproportionate to the circumstance of the offence. I allow the offender a discount of twenty-five percent to reflect his plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity. I allow a further twenty-two point five percent for his considerable assistance to law enforcement authorities in the past and promised for the future. I assess the value of that future assistance at fifteen percent, as I consider his evidence to be crucial to the prosecution case against Mr Murphy, the alleged principal in the activity.”  
        
       
      
    11 As earlier noted, the breach of the undertaking has been conceded. In brief, on 11 June 2008 the respondent was called by the prosecution in committal proceedings of charges brought against Murphy. We were informed by counsel that inquiries revealed that these proceedings are not yet completed. When asked about his statements the respondent said that parts were true and parts had been fabricated by police. He asserted that police had not honoured agreements as to the sentence he would receive and an agreement not to charge his girlfriend. It scarcely needs to be said that police have no authority to fix sentence and the matter is mentioned to demonstrate that this is not a case where a witness has claimed that he reneged on an undertaking as a result of fear engendered from external sources by threats or the like. No mitigating matter arises out of any reason for the respondent’s breach. 
     
      
    12 A significant aspect of the respondent’s departure from what was contained in his statements was his claim that he could not remember who asked him to “set the fire” and in relation to neither the fire nor the plan to murder Craig O’Sullivan did he say anything which would inculpate Brian Murphy. 
     
      
    13 The Crown seeks removal of the “unjustified 15 percent” which his Honour indicated that he was allowing by way of reduction of sentence for promised future assistance to authority.  
     
      
    14 The issue debated in the appeal focussed upon a Crown submission: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no suggestion that any of the other discounts were moderated to preserve proportionality as discussed in  
        R v Lenati 
         [2008] NSWCCA 67.” 
        
       
      
    15 Lenati was a case where the offender had himself provided information to police, in the absence of which it was doubtful that charges could have been brought against him. This triggered an entitlement to consideration along the principles of R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603. The sentences which Lenati received were subjected to a combined discount by the judge which had been stated to amount to 60 percent for the pleas of guilty, the “Ellis” consideration and past and future assistance. 
     
      
    16 The future assistance by Lenati included an undertaking to give evidence in accordance with some eleven statements in proceedings involving twelve named suspects and seven separate offences. The judge had stated that, if Lenati failed to fulfil his promise (as it was conceded on appeal that he did) the sentence ought be increased by 20 percent. It was accepted that the discount which Lenati had received for future assistance was of that order. 
     
      
    17 As Simpson J, who gave the leading judgment in Lenati, observed it was necessary to engage in some “unravelling” of the approach to sentence at first instance. In particular examination sought to detect whether the discount attributable for past assistance had been reduced to accommodate s 23 (3) (a provision referred to by Charteris DCJ in the extract above quoted) and/or the principle of proportionality. Her Honour’s analysis resulted in a conclusion that the allowance for past assistance had been in the region of 5 to 10 percent and in the particular circumstances of the case should have been considerably greater than that. It follows that it should be deduced that elements in the combination which made up the discount had been compressed in order to preserve proportionality.  
     
      
    18 It might be observed that her Honour found that past assistance had in the case of Lenati been considerable. It was determined that, although he should lose the benefit of the 20 percent for the future assistance not given, he should have restored that part of the discount for past assistance that he had lost as a result of “compression”. 
     
      
    19 In a separate judgment in Lenati, Bell JA noted that she, “accepted the force of Simpson J’s analysis” but would have assessed an assumed moderation for past assistance at a different figure with the result that she would have increased Lenati’s sentence by 10 percent.  
     
      
    20 The Crown appeal in that case was dismissed, not because the restoration proposed by Simpson J (with whose judgment Adams J agreed) would counterbalance fully the 20 percent which had been allowed for future assistance, but in the exercise of the discretion vested in the Court to dismiss a Crown appeal. In the case of Lenati, significant delays, the fault of neither the Crown nor Lenati had created a situation that his release was imminent when the appeal was heard and seizing that release from him was regarded as very harsh indeed. The exercise of discretion was attracted by that circumstance. Bell JA joined in the order of the Court because of that consideration. 
     
      
    21 The kernel of the argument on behalf of the respondent in the present appeal was the contention that it should be concluded that the respondent’s past assistance should have entitled him to a greater discount than 7½ percent, that figure having been calculated by deducting the specific 15 percent for future assistance from the 22½ percent total stated by his Honour. It is contended that the overall discounts and particularly that for past assistance, were perceptibly “compressed” by his Honour in accordance with his view, expressed in an exchange with counsel, that a discount of 50 percent (or greater) was reserved for exceptional cases. His Honour’s observation was consistent with authority. In SZ v The Queen  [2007] 168 A Crim R 249 Howie J stated (at 251): 
     
      
       
        
        “…in general a combined discount for pleas of guilty and assistance ….should not normally exceed 50 percent.” 
        
       
       
      And Buddin J stated (at 261): 
       
       
        
        “….a combined discount exceeding 50 percent should be reserved for an exceptional case …”. 
        
       
       
      Simpson J expressed agreement with both judgments.  
       
      
    22 The facts found by his Honour, which are not the subject of challenge, record that a police task force was set up soon after the July arson attack and investigations had, at an early stage, identified Crosby as the suspect for it. As abovementioned the respondent was arrested on 26 March 2007 and he was interviewed on that day commencing at 9.48 am. The transcript shows that at the beginning of the interview (q18) the respondent agreed to a statement by the interviewing detective: 
     
      
       
        
        “Do you agree I first spoke to you about this matter on (sic) the arson and the solicit to murder it was back at the Police Station here? Do you agree with that?” 
        
       
      
    23 It was not contended that the respondent provided police with information about crime and intended crime in which he was involved about which they were unaware. It is to be remembered that investigations included the interception of telephone conversations and investigators were conscious not only of the fires but of plans being afoot to harm some person. The respondent confirmed the identity of the intended victim to them. 
     
      
    24 I am unpersuaded that this Court should intervene to ameliorate the extent of correction below the 15 percent allowed by his Honour for future assistance which he failed to deliver. The discount of 7½ percent adequately reflected the value of the assistance, substantially in the form of confession, which the respondent provided to authority. It has not been shown that the discount was “compressed” in the sense discussed in Lenati. 
     
      
    25 As above noted the total term imposed by his Honour was 5 years 9 months. This term had been arrived at after calculations applying discounts of 25 percent for the plea of guilty, 7½ percent for past assistance and 15 percent for future assistance.  
     
      
    26 For the reasons given, the respondent should forfeit the 15 percent benefit for the promise which he has failed to fulfil and as I have indicated no basis has been shown to reduce the extent of this forfeiture. The respondent should, however, retain the benefit of the 25 percent and 7½ percent discounts and counsel have agreed that it can be calculated that a sentence assessment reflecting the removal of 15 percent would result in a total term of 6 years 10 months and, applying the same proportion between non-parole period and balance term which had been effected by his Honour, a non-parole period of 4 years and 1 month should be specified. 
     
      
    27 Since preparation of the foregoing I have read the additional remarks of Buddin J. I agree with what he has written and expressly confirm my sharing the view that, where an undertaking is reneged upon, it is only in exceptional circumstances that sentence should not be increased to remove the “discount” obtained for giving the undertaking. Lenati must be categorized as having been such an exceptional case. 
     
      
    28 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1, Crown appeal allowed. 
       
      2. Sentence imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
      3. In lieu thereof (taking into account the offence on the Form 1) the respondent is sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 4 years 1 month commencing on 26 March 2007 and expiring on 25 April 2011 with a balance term of 2 years 8 months commencing on 26 April 2011. 
       
      4 The earliest date of eligibility for release is specified as 25 April 2011. 
       
      
    29 BUDDIN J: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Grove J in draft form. I agree with the order which his Honour proposes and with his Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    30 In R v KS [2005] NSWCCA 87 Wood CJ at CL, with whom the other members of the court agreed, said of s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912: 
     
      
       
        
        [t]he ability of the Crown to invoke this section is a very important part of the criminal justice system. Persons who give undertakings and who receive the benefit of those undertakings by way of a discounted sentence can, subject to exceptional circumstances, expect to have their sentences increased if they renege on their undertaking to give evidence. The departure from an undertaking of that kind is not to be regarded lightly and it will normally justify appellate intervention. 
        
       
      
    31 This court’s decision in R v Lenati [2008] NSWCCA 67 reveals that it was a case in which there were such “exceptional circumstances”. Indeed Simpson J described it as being a “rare” case [at 36]. One of its particularly unusual features was the nature and extent of the past assistance which Lenati had provided to the authorities. Simpson J expressed the view that for the past assistance only, “the respondent could have expected a benefit of at least 25-30 percent” [at 47]. As I understand the situation, Lenati had already provided significant assistance to the authorities prior to signing the undertaking in which he promised to give evidence against a number of persons in the future. Before signing that undertaking (which he subsequently breached) Lenati had already given in other proceedings. On the first occasion he gave evidence at the trial of four men charged with maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. Thereafter he gave evidence at two separate committal hearings one of which involved charges of concealing information relating to a murder. It was against that background that Simpson J arrived at the conclusion to which Grove J refers at pars 17-18 of his Honour’s judgment. 
     
      
    32 As has been said on a number of occasions, in the more conventional case of which the present is a good example, whilst the past assistance which is furnished by a person is of some utility, it has only limited value unless the person then gives evidence in court in accordance with the undertaking which he or she has given. 
    33 PRICE J: I agree with Grove J and the additional comments of Buddin J.

   JUDGMENT 1. Between March 2004 and March 2005 Ali Almoustafa served a non-parole period of twelve months imprisonment. He celebrated, if that is the right word, his twenty-third birthday in prison. At 1.55 on Sunday 6 April 2008, that is three years after his release from prison, he was released from police custody at Newtown Police Station on bail. 2. If the doctrine of general and personal deterrence was ever going to work its magic on Ali Almoustafa surely it would have done so on 6 April 2008 at 1.55pm. Newtown and Enmore are adjoining suburbs in Sydney. The most direct route from one to the other is along Enmore Road. Enmore Fine Wines operates at 141 Enmore Road, Enmore. Twenty-five minutes after signing his bail papers and being released Almoustafa entered Enmore Fine Wines with serious criminal conduct on his mind. In a one on one robbery that must have taken at least twenty minutes to complete, he departed Enmore Fine Wines with $1,500 of its stock and $1,900 of its cash.3. Police were notified. They were at his home by three o’clock. He was not there. By 4pm he was thieving items from a Mazda 626. It is likely he was also prepared to steal the Mazda for a house key had been jammed into the car’s ignition. By 4.45pm he was back in police custody. His larceny of items from the vehicle is a charge he also seeks to have dealt with on a Form 1. 4. Today he is to be held accountable for his criminal conduct. As sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions. As I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for this offence committed before this court by this offender harming the victim that he harmed in this community. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offence. I will need to have regard to matters personal to him, that is subjective matters. The starting point for such assessments requires me to make findings of fact from evidence before the court relating to both the offence and offender. 5. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed even if looking through a glass darkly. There are technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found, the Form 1 matter that I have mentioned, the length of the non-parole period and ultimately the length of the overall sentence of imprisonment. None of these can be commenced until the primary facts are determined.6. What weight needs to be given to all of this against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community will also need to be determined (see R v Cuthbert (1967) 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby (1977) NSWLR 597 and R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740). Facts7. At the time Almoustafa entered Enmore Fine Wines it was being staffed by a twenty-three year old Chung Chan. The offender approached the counter and said to Chan, “I need your help. I just got paid yesterday and I don’t know if the money has gone through yet. Do you take credit cards or cheques?” Chan responded that the store accepted credit cards. The offender said, “Okay, I need your help again. I need to buy two bottles for a present.” Chan endeavoured to assist the offender in selecting a purchase by asking questions about what he was after and making various suggestions. The offender asked Chan about a bottle of Hennessy VSOP and Chan retrieved it from a shelf for him. Chan noticed the offender was looking around after speaking and had what Chan described as an unusual expression on his face. 8. The offender lent over onto the counter and said to Chan in a soft voice, “Come closer”. Chan leaned over closer to him. The offender said, “Just be quiet. If I was going to tell you I have four bottles of Hennessy outside how much would you pay for them?” Chan responded, “I’m not the owner of the shop, so it’s no point for me to buy it”. The offender then said, “To tell you the truth, I’ve actually got four guys outside in a car that are about to jump in”. Chan felt fearful that the offender was going to bring more people in to rob him and did not respond. The offender said, “If you want to prevent that you have to listen to me”. Chan asked the offender what he wanted. The offender said he wanted three packets of Dunhill Blues, three packets of Winfield Gold, all the Benson & Hedges, all the Winfields and Dunhills.9. One notes that there is a change in what the offender wanted even as he spoke from three of something to all of them. Chan grabbed a plastic bag and placed numerous packets of cigarettes from the shelf behind the counter into it. He placed the full plastic bag on the counter for the offender. As Chan was doing this the offender put the bottle of Hennessy in a plastic bag as well. The offender then demanded that Chan get two bottles of spirit off the shelf behind the counter. Chan retrieved them and put them on the counter. The offender also packed those bottles into a plastic bag. The offender then told Chan to fill up another plastic bag with cigarettes. He indicated the cigarettes and demanded, “Open the drawer. I know where you guys hide your shit. I’m not a newbie”. Chan opened the drawer with a key and filled up another plastic bag with cartons of cigarettes. The offender said, “Do you want to do this the easy way or do you want me to get my guys in to come in and drag you to the back of the shop?” Chan responded, “It’s all right, the easy way”. 10. The offender had his right hand in his back pocket as though he were holding something and said, “You sure you don’t need me to take out the stuff?” Chan said, “No, you don’t have to take it out”. The offender told Chan to open the till and then leaned forward and took its contents. He demanded Chan give him all the notes. Chan gave him all the fifty-dollar and twenty dollar notes, totalling about $300 to $400. Chan told the offender that was all he had but the offender said, “You must have a safe or something?” Chan explained that to open the safe would take fifteen to twenty minutes. The offender said, “Yeah that’s all right, I’ll wait”. And Chan entered the PIN number into the safe. 11. About this time a female customer came into the shop and was served by Chan. Chan did not say anything to her because he was afraid of what happened. She left the shop. The offender then grabbed a bottle of Jim Beam, more cigarettes from the shelf behind the counter, placed them in a plastic bag. Chan said to the offender, “Don’t come inside the counter. You are trying to make it obvious”. The offender walked back out and told Chan to grab more cigarettes. He pointed to a Johnny Walker Blue Label and said, “Grab me that bottle and the bottle next to it. Calm down and don’t be a smart arse.” Chan said, “I’m just trying to help you and get you out of here quicker”. The offender responded, “Yeah I’ll never do that again, open the till again.” Chan opened the till, the offender took another look and demanded Chan hand over the rest of the notes. Chan gave him the five and ten dollar notes.12. Around this time a second male customer came into the shop. While Chan was serving him the offender asked, “What’s a good bottle of alcohol for all the guys?” This clearly was an attempt to pretend he was a customer. After the second customer left the store the safe opened and Chan gave the offender all the notes from it. The offender asked, “Is that all?” Chan responded, “That's all. How much do you think we carry in a bottle shop? We don’t carry that much money. There’s coins if you want them.” The offender asked for all the coins and Chan gave them to him. The total amount of money taken from the safe was $1,500. Hence the total of $1,900 all up.13. The offender said, “If I come over and look in the safe and there’s nothing in there but if there is what’s going to happen?” Chan said, “Do whatever you want. Come and have a look if you want.” The offender did not respond. The offender then told Chan to take out his wallet. Chan said, “You are not going to take my stuff, are you?” The offender said, “Just give me your licence.” Chan gave his driver’s licence to the offender. The offender grabbed a pen and paper from the counter and wrote down Chan’s address, returned the licence after wiping off any potential fingerprints.14. The offender then said, “If you dob me in I’m going to come back and get you”. Chan said, “I’m just going to close the shop after you leave.” The offender again said, “If you make noise or scream after I leave I’m going to come back and get you straight away. Chan was scared and shaking. Before the offender left he demanded Chan obtain another bottle of spirits or cigarettes. The offender finally left the premises with six bags of cigarettes, alcohol and money. As he left he said to Chan, “Follow me and look out the door”. Chan felt scared and was shaking. Before the offender left he demanded that Chan obtain another bottle of spirit or cigarettes. The offender finally left the premises with about six bags of cigarettes, alcohol and money. In total there was at least $1,900 cash and $1,500 worth of alcohol. After the offender left the store Chan reported the robbery to the owners. About 3pm police attended the offender’s residence. The Form 1 matter15. About 4pm the same day which must have been within the hour and a half the offender entered an unlocked vehicle at Tamar Street, Marrickville. Two nearby residents saw the offender sitting in the driver’s seat rummaging through items in the glove box. The offender alighted from the vehicle, walked to the front, looked at it for a couple of seconds, he returned to the driver’s seat and continued rummaging through items on the passenger side. He then exited the vehicle again and walked up the road. 16. He was seen doing all this and two witnesses alerted the owner. They inspected the vehicle and found the offender’s white jacket on the back seat and blue beanie on the front. From the vehicle small change and a street directory were missing. A spare house key kept in the vehicle had been jammed into the ignition. Consequently the ignition was damaged. The offender walked back towards the car while these folk were inspecting it and came within fifty metres of it when presumably he saw them and ran away.17. At 4.55 he returned home. His sister asked where he had been and he said I was with you. The sister and father drove him to the Marrickville Police Station. The sister noted that the offender appeared drug affected. 18. During conversation with the police when he was charged the offender is reported to have said, “I’ll break his bones if I wanted to bro, I’m going to pull out a gun”. And words were said while he was apparently drug affected, they are alarming to say the least.19. The facts as before the court do not resolve a number of matters, particularly what happened to the six bags of items taken from the shop and indeed the mechanism by which the offender arrived at the shop.Objective Criminality20. From the facts as he finds them to be a sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offence as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of the offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in this case with criminality of offences of a similar kind that the courts have dealt with before. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of this offence can be evaluated. Objective criminality has an important impact on the overall sentencing outcome.21. Justice Gleeson when Chief Justice of New South Wales encapsulated the essence of the legal wrong done by robbers and the reason why substantial punishment is required in R v Rause unreported NSWCCA 8 August 1992. The Chief Justice said: 
     
      
      “One of the primary purposes of the system of justice is to keep the peace. In this connection the idea of peace embraces the freedom of ordinary citizens to walk the streets and go about their daily affairs without fear of physical violence. It also embraces respect for the property of others. Offences of the kind committed by the present [offender] are not trivial instances of disrespect of private property. They are serious breaches of the peace. They are direct attacks upon the security of the person and the property which the law exists to protect.” 
       
       
      
    22. The essential ingredient of robbery that distinguishes it from other forms of stealing is the use of force or the threat of force against a person thereby overcoming the will, the power of that person, so that he surrenders goods or money that are his or for which he is the custodian.23. There was no physical force as such applied to the victim Chan. However he was subjected to threats of force so real that he was not only fearful for his safety and the safety of two innocent customers but he surrendered against his will stock and money to the robber. The threats of force were two distinct ones. A threat that there were four other thugs outside waiting the word to enter. The second was a threat by Almoustafa that he was armed with a concealed weapon which he was prepared to show and presumably prepared to use.24. The use of the two distinct themes of threat aggravates the severity of this offence by comparison to those offences where only one form of threat is used. There is nothing in the conduct of Chan to suggest that he was not already complying with the demands of the robber when the second threat was uttered. He had already filled two plastic bags with cigarettes and another with alcohol. The offender had already helped himself to a fourth plastic bag and a bottle of Hennessy.25. A second aggravating features is the length of time the offender remained, sustaining the period during which his victim was the subject of his threatening conduct. Robbery is most frequently an offence committed with speed. Whereas in this case the robbery is prolonged, the impact of threatening conduct upon the victim is equally prolonged. By comparison with most robberies the duration of the threats becomes an aggravating feature of the robbery.26. The offender took steps to try to prevent his detection by wiping the counter and bottles with his sleeve. The detection of serious crime is in the public interest. The wearing of disguises to prevent detection is regarded as an aggravating feature. So too in this case the taking of steps to prevent detection can be regarded as an aggravating feature by comparison to those robberies where it does not happen. However the offender went further in his efforts to avoid detection. In so doing he intruded into the victim’s privacy. He required Chan to hand over his driver’s licence, obtaining his address from the licence and then threatening him physical harm if Chan contributed to his being caught. That was the second threat that occurred after his possession of the stolen goods.27. Having received money from the safe Almoustafa said “If I come over and look in the safe and there’s nothing in there, but if there is what’s going to happen?” These further threats made by Almoustafa aggravate his criminality. The offence was committed upon a shop assistant working alone in a liquor outlet. The court regards such persons as vulnerable, easy targets, particularly requiring such protection as the court can give to them. 28. After the robbery the offender utters a further threat against Chan. In a sense that does not aggravate the robbery but what it does do is demonstrate an absolute absence of consideration for or contrition towards his victim. The final feature of aggravation is that the robbery was committed in circumstances where the offender was on a bond to be of good behaviour and bail conditions. That is he had been given liberty by police and on the understanding he would not commit crime whilst bailed. He was also given the good behaviour bond on the basis that he would not commit crime whilst he was on the bond.29. There are some aspects that mitigate the offence. The offence must have been determined upon very shortly before it was committed. That is to say it must have been opportunistic. The offender was not part of an organised criminal activity. Given that prosecutorial discretion was exercised to charge robbery I am prepared to accept he was not in the company of others even though he claimed to be.30. While items and cash appeared to have disappeared within an hour or so of the robbery that may have occurred without organisation or other criminals being knowingly concerned. The objective criminality of this offence demonstrates it as being substantially more serious than many robberies coming before this court.Subjective Matters31. I turn now to the subjective matters. I am entitled and required to do so. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence but I am also sentencing this offender for it. Each offender coming before the court varies from others who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to this offender may offer to the court some explanation and insight into the commission of this offence by this offender or some reason why more or less seriously a sentencing outcome is appropriate.Background, Family Dynamics, Relationships32. Ali Almoustafa is a twenty-seven year old Australian born to Lebanese parents. He is the only son and second eldest of four children in a Muslim family. All are adult, the eldest thirty, the youngest twenty-four. The offender grew up, he claims, in a supportive environment. He says his family experienced financial difficulties but he did not want for anything. He married his partner in late teens or early twenties. There are two girls aged six and four. He has separated although his former wife is supportive of him. She sees him in custody, bringing the children.33. There is material before me that leaves open the real possibility she picked him up from the police station after the robbery and I do not exclude the possibility that she was the one who conveyed the six bags of loot from the scene. He claims they separated because of his drug abuse. I note however that he self reports hitting his wife a couple of times.Education, Skills and Employment34. He claims he was a good student at primary school. However his high school years were troubled. There were behavioural problems. He claimed to have been stood over by school bullies who were Vietnamese youths. He in turn associated with negative peer group. There were truancy issues. He was asked to leave school at the age of seventeen after completing his Year 10 certificate. His stronger subjects were maths and English. He claims to have worked off and on from the age of fourteen in a number of areas: rendering, plumbing, tiling and building. Nine months is his longest period of uninterrupted employment. That occurred in 2005. He expressed an interest in boiler making at TAFE. Prior to arrest he was unemployed for eighteen months. He lost some of his jobs as a result of substance abuse. General Health35. He suffers a form of psoriatic arthritis and has mild swelling of the finger joints. That at times and his knees and ankles as well can be affected. He suffered a jaw injury in 2001 from a single gun shot wound. He claimed the attack was unprovoked, that he did not know the identity of the gunman. And the gunman told the court at sentence it was a case of mistaken identity. None of that evidence has been tested or led in correct form. Frankly I am sceptical, however, in respect of that event there is a diagnosis of post traumatic distress disorder. While I may be sceptical as to the circumstances of the gunman’s attack upon him I am prepared to accept it was a source of ongoing traumatic sequale. Mental Health Issues36. I have just referred to the post traumatic stress diagnosis. He also reports symptoms of depression, anxiety, including panic attacks, auditory hallucinations, persecutory delusions and delusions of reference. There have been episodes of self harm, particularly in response to stress. There are some readily identifiable stressors including custody, this court case, a $6,000 debt for outstanding fines and family issues. 37. Danielle Castles, who conducted a psychosocial assessment for the Legal Aid Commission opined Almoustafa had acquired a brain injury as a consequence of a serious head injury in 2001. That serious head injury could only have been the bullet wound which passed through the right cheek and lodged near the vertebrae at C4, that is, as it would seem to me to have been going downwards. 38. He underwent surgery for the repair of the wound and recovery of a projectile at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. He was hospitalised for two weeks. There is no suggestion of any time spent in the brain injury unit. From the qualifications supplied in her resume I am unable to determine the depth of her study into brain functioning. Clearly she is not an expert. She simply comes to the view by examination of documents. Her background seems to be one of social welfare. 39. Nonetheless he was sent to Dr Leila Cavanagh, a consultant psychiatrist, who rejects the acquired brain injury diagnosis. On her examination in history supplied by the offender she says “I have no evidence to support [acquired brain injury] and no history is suggestive of it. His psychotic symptoms appear to be secondary to elicit substances as opposed to a major mental illness of psychotic spectrum.Drug and Alcohol Issues40. There is a thirteen year history of drug and alcohol abuse. He began smoking cannabis at the age of eleven or twelve. By fifteen he was using “speed” and ecstasy on weekends. He was abusing benzodiazepines well before he claimed “self medication” on Rohypnol for his voices and post traumatic stress. He has been using heroin since at least twenty-four. His drug addiction was costing him in excess of $2,000 daily when arrested. That is a huge sum if one remembers he was unemployed. He was using criminal conduct to support is habit. 41. He had sought to confront his addiction. He participated in the MERIT program, it was then thought with some success. As a consequence of MERIT he commenced Buprenorphine in the community. Not withstanding it is claimed to be a blocking agent, he continued to use heroin. He simply added Buprenorphine to his daily drug cocktail which also included; heroin, cannabis, benzodiazepine, Rohypnol and ice.Dr Cavanagh said: 
     
      
      “When asked why Bruprenorphine did not help him cease his heroin use Mr Almoustafa explained how, although he did not experience withdrawal symptoms while on Bruprenorphine he did not experience the ‘rush’, the ‘high’ that he experienced on heroin. This only confirms that while the initial stimulus for increase in Mr Almoustafa’s substance use was to self medicate untreated symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and related conditions, his more recent use is perpetuated by the pleasure he receives from using substances despite his knowledge as to its harmfulness.” 
       
       
      
    42. He has indicated a willingness to enter a full time rehabilitation program. I have taken him at his word. There is no doubt his poly drug abuse is long standing, well entrenched and extensive in its scope.Criminal History43. He first came before the Local Court in May 2005 for a charge of possessing prohibited drugs. Since then there have been two other occasions for this offence. He has received bonds for assault, 2002 and a s 12 bond for assault occasion actual bodily harm, 2000. He has been before the District Court in 2004 for being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence (imprisoned nine months) and threatened to injure a witness for which he was sentenced to imprisonment for fifteen months.44. In November of 2007 he was placed on a section 9 twelve month good behaviour bond. His commission of this offence is in breach of that bond. There are other convictions directly related to his drug abuse in 2007, September 2005 and March 2004. Deterrence45. This offence is a serious instance of robbery. The sentence called for must take into account the need for general deterrence for persons likeminded to the accused. Notwithstanding my concern about the impact of deterrence in the community, the law requires that I take it into account. It is important, if it is at all possible, that persons of similar mind to this offender should be reminded that significant terms of imprisonment will be imposed for this kind of offence.Custodial History46. I understand he has been in custody since 6 April 2008. His sentence will be backdated from that date. He has pleaded guilty to the offence before the Local Court and I am going to give him the full twenty-five percent discount. Stand up please Mr Almoustafa. 47. Ali Almoustafa you are convicted that you were on 6 April 2008 at Enmore in the State of New South Wales robbed Chung Chan of certain property, namely money, cigarettes and alcohol which was the property of Enmore Fine Wines. I take into account the other matter in respect of the motor vehicle that you have asked me to take into account on the Form 1. 48. But for your plea of guilty I would have given you a sentence of five years imprisonment for this offence. I have reduced that by twenty-five per cent on account of your plea of guilty. I set a non-parole period of two years and eight months to date from 6 April 2008 and to expire on 5 December 2010. I find special circumstances, in particular your need for drug rehabilitation within a community setting, particularly after the course that I now plan for you to take.49. I set a balance of term of one year and one month. I order that you be referred to the compulsory drug treatment program with a view to your being accepted into that program to be compulsorily treated in respect of your drug abuse. The papers are to be forwarded to the drug court forthwith.

   JUDGMENTIndictment and trial1 The offender was found guilty after a trial before a jury in the District Court at Sydney on the following counts on an indictment:Count 12 Between 1 May and 30 June 1983 at Penrose in the State of New South Wales, did assault SC, a person then under the age of 16 years, that is, of the age of 11 years, and at the time of the assault did commit an act of indecency upon her. Count 2 3 Between 1 May and 30 June 1983 at Penrose in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with SC, a person then under the age of 16 years, that is, of the age of 11 years, without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting thereto. Count 4 4 Between 1 May and 30 June 1983 at Penrose in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with SC, a person then under the age of 16 years, that is, of the age of 11 years, without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting thereto. Count 6 5 Between 1 May and 30 June 1983 at Penrose in the State of New South Wales, did assault SC, a person then under the age of 16 years, that is, of the age of 11 years, and at the time of the assault did commit an act of indecency upon her. Count 7 6 Between 1 August and 30 September 1984 at Penrose in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with SC, a person then under the age of 16 years, that is, either of the age of 12 or 13 years, without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting thereto. 7 The counts were bought pursuant to sections 61E(1) and 61D(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.8 A maximum penalty at the time of the offence was one of 6 years imprisonment (s61E: acts of indecency: person under 16) and 10 years imprisonment (s61D: sexual intercourse without consent) – reprint 23 September 1982. 9 It is common ground that I should apply the law as it was in 1983 and 1984 including the application of the relevant penalties. There was no ‘in authority’ aggravation offence for any of the counts on the indictment at that time. Additionally there were no standard non-parole periods at that time.10 The trial took place between 24 November and 10 December 2008. The verdict was delivered on 10 December 2008.Background Parties11 The victim was born in 1971 in New Zealand and was aged 11 years at the time of the first incidents in 1983. 12 The victim and her family moved to Australia from New Zealand in 1976, and the victim’s father died shortly afterwards in late 1980 when the victim was aged nine years. The family were then living in Sydney.13 After the death of the victim’s father, her mother befriended the offender’s then wife, DB (formerly Mrs D Fischer), who lived nearby.14 The evidence of DB was that at the time of the incidents the victim was a very shy, timid girl, who wanted to stay close to her mother. Offender15 The offender was born in 1936. He was aged 47 years at the time of the first incidents in 1983. The offender married DB in 1979 and was divorced from her in 1998 following allegations of indecent assault made against him by three young girls in 1996. Reconciliation was unsuccessful. 16 DB gave evidence, for the Crown in particular, that she did not see any change in the offender after the incidents or such as to warrant a resumption of the relationship. The offender said that he thought DB had been looking for an excuse to leave him. 17 The offender has been in another relationship since 1998 that has continued for 10 years.18 At the time of the offences, the offender and his then wife were regular visitors to the victim’s family home, and the victim and her mother would make return visits to the home of the offender. The offender was therefore well known to the victim as a friend of her mother. The offender knew the victim’s father had recently died when he met her.Offender – current position19 The offender was an electrical engineer, and he and his brother owned and operated an electronics company for 32 years. His brother passed away in 2002. The offender was unable to work in the business from 2005 to 2007 due to ill health that resulted in major surgery. During this time the company allegedly began trading while insolvent. The company was placed in liquidation in 2007 and he (and his sister-in-law) has since been served with Federal Court proceedings for a $1.2 million claim by the liquidator for compensation for losses due to insolvent trading. Those proceedings are to be resisted by him.20 The offender presently has an interest in, and works part-time in, a small dry cleaning business that would not be financially viable without his own time and effort. He has a manager in that business.21 He also assists with university research projects in the engineering area. Over his life he has had a substantial number of other interests including Scouting for over 20 years. Since the offences the offender has had innocent involvement with young girls in a number of contexts.Medical/psychiatric/psychological issues22 The offender has substantial medical issues including two major surgeries in 2005 and 2006 to repair an abdominal aortic aneurysm and a cerebral aneurysm respectively. He also has musculoskeletal injuries from a motor vehicle accident in 2007, high blood pressure, chronic renal disease, and colitis. 23 The offender has been consulting with a psychiatrist for the past six months and has been diagnosed with clinical depression. He is taking anti-depressant medication. The medication record is set out in a report provided by Dr Norris.24 An updated report was provided on 26 February 2009 (exhibit S13). Further evidence provided by Dr Norris is set out later in these reasons. Venue of offences25 The offences took place at a rural property in Penrose in the southern highlands, which was owned by the offender’s wife. 26 The property consisted of a house and a detached barn. The barn was divided into separate sections to accommodate overnight guests as well as farm equipment and vehicles. The property at Penrose was used by the offender as a holiday home.27 At the time of the victim’s visit, DB’s daughter was also present, as was her son. Her daughter was 18 months older than the victim, and her son three years older. Also present on the farm were other day visitors and overnight guests including female friends of DB’s daughter who were of a similarly young age.28 The victim stayed overnight in the barn while the adults slept in the main house. The victim recalls being excited at the prospect of staying in the barn as it was a separate building away from her mother and she would be able to stay awake later than usual.  
     
      
       
      
    Findings of fact29 In the light of all the evidence, the jury’s verdict, the offender’s evidence and, in particular, the offender’s continuing and total denial of the matters, I find the following:30 Count 1 (indecent assault) occurred in June 1983 when the victim visited the offender’s property in Penrose. The victim was aged 11 years at the time of the first four incidents (counts 1, 2, 4, and 6 on the indictment). The victim and her mother arrived at the property in their car and were greeted in the front driveway area by the offender and others. The offender and the victim were standing slightly apart from the welcoming group when the offender hugged the victim. The offender then moved one of his hands from the victim’s back down the front of the victim’s pants and into her underwear where he touched her on the outside of the vagina. 31 Count 2 (sexual assault) occurred the morning after the first incident. The victim had slept overnight in the barn. On waking, she walked to the main house to use the bathroom. When the victim returned to the barn, she left the door open behind her, but it was shut moments later and she turned around to see the offender standing in the barn. The offender again pulled the victim towards him for a hug before putting his hand into her underwear where he touched and rubbed her vagina. He then put two fingers inside her vagina and quickly moved them back and forth quite roughly. At the same time the offender pinched and twisted the victim’s left breast. The victim recalls the offender being aggressive towards her and his actions causing her pain.32 Count 4 (sexual assault) occurred shortly after counts 1 and 2 at approximately 10pm at night, again at the property at Penrose. The victim was in bed in the barn, lying on her side, reading a book. The offender approached the victim from behind and sat on the bed. He then proceeded to put his hand down the back of her pyjama pants and slid it forward between her legs. The offender used all his fingers to touch and rub the victim’s genitalia before digitally penetrating her vagina. He also scratched her with his fingernails near the vagina.33 Count 6 (indecent assault) occurred in the same period of time as the previous three incidents at the Penrose property. The victim and other guests went horse riding and the victim’s clothes became wet so she returned to the barn to change. After changing her clothes, the victim noticed the presence of the offender in the barn and she recalls the offender’s body pushing her against a wall or bench. The offender then pulled up her skirt and put his hand down her underpants, and proceeded to touch and rub the outside of the victim’s vagina. This continued for approximately 5 to 10 minutes and the offender was quite rough, making the victim feel sore. The offender used his other hand to rub the victim’s breasts and pull her nipples, which also caused her pain. The victim recalls the offender breathing heavily and that she was unable to escape as she was being pushed against a wall or bench.34 Count 7 (sexual assault) occurred a year after the first four incidents in September 1984 when the victim was aged 13 years old. After dinner, the victim went outside and was standing near a tree when the offender approached her. The offender hugged the victim and pulled up her jumper. He then unbuttoned her jeans and put his hand down her pants where he touched and rubbed her vagina through her underpants. The offender then put his hand into the victim’s underpants where he moved his finger repeatedly in and out of her vagina. He also touched her breasts quite roughly with his other hand.35 The Crown submits that the jury verdicts indicate acceptance of the victim’s account of the offences, and that the offences were opportunistic, brazen, and, on occasion, planned to occur when the victim was on her own. I agree with that characterisation.36 The offender maintains that the offences did not occur. Defence counsel further submits that specific findings of fact should include that offender only had minimal contact with the victim prior to her first visit to the farm and that he did not instigate her visit, or any subsequent visit. I agree with that submission. However, he obviously knew that she was coming back to stay at his house on the second occasion.37 However, these two aspects indicate that the victim’s visits to the farm were not connected with any ‘grooming’ behaviour by the offender and were not part of a pattern of abuse. The offences were - as agreed by the Crown - opportunistic. 38 Furthermore, it was submitted that he did not attempt to contact the victim between her 1983 and 1984 visits, and that she returned to the farm with no apparent protest. In my view, that is to ignore the realities of the situation – particularly given the age of the victim and the likelihood that, unless she accompanied her mother on the second trip, it may have led to social and familial difficulties. Those should be viewed through the eyes of a 13-year-old girl. Impact on victim39 The victim gave evidence as to what impact the incidents have had on her by way of Victim Impact Statement and in evidence during the trial. She said that what took place was very rough and painful to her in circumstances that were sudden, frightening, and where she felt isolated and lacking confidence.40 That impact was still apparent when she gave her evidence after the period of some 25 years that had elapsed since the incident. During the course of giving evidence the victim repeatedly broke down and sobbed, and spoke of feeling betrayed. In my view, none of these reactions were either feigned or exaggerated. This impact should be considered in the context that, at the time of the incidents, her father had recently died, the offender was an older man, she knew him and had been to his home before, and he was a friend of her mother’s.41 The victim gave evidence that:She ‘felt betrayed.’She felt ‘revulsion, frightened, totally betrayed.’ ‘Frightened, very unsure, very alone.’‘I was frightened of what he was doing to me. It may never stop.’‘I didn’t know how to tell anyone.’‘You don’t know who you are anymore.’‘I trusted him in the beginning very much.’Issues at trialTendency and coincidence evidence42 The Crown led evidence of the offender’s convictions in 1996 for indecent assault on three young girls - RB, who was aged 10 years at the time of the offences, KB, who was aged 6 years, and KT, who was aged 8 years. All three young women gave evidence in the trial. Again, while those witnesses were clearly distressed by the ordeal of having to re-live what had happened to them, none of their presentations, nor evidence seemed to me to be feigned, exaggerated or manipulated. The offender maintains the view that some of their respective reactions were exaggerated although he later expressed remorse in relation to his conduct to them.Other relevant evidence during trial43 A number of witnesses gave corroborative complaint evidence that, in my view, was both credible and consistent with the victim’s account.Sentence proceedingsEvidence 44 The offender gave evidence on the sentencing proceedings on a number of matters set out in these remarks and confirmed his denial of the complainant’s evidence. He maintains that the whole case against him was a fabrication. 45 The offender denies having any present suicidal ideation. Pre-sentence report46 A pre-sentence report dated 11 February 2008 and prepared by Emma Marston of the Probation and Parole Office was tendered (exhibit S4).47 The report noted that the offender had a positive and supportive childhood, and had a good relationship with his parents and brother until their deaths. He has occasional contact with his sister, and an adult daughter who resides in Western Australia.Medical evidence48 Evidence was also called from Dr Norris. Dr Norris had treated Mr Fischer since 2001 and had seen him as a patient about every six weeks.49 Dr Norris said that the offender had two life threatening conditions resulting in major surgeries in 2005 (large abdominal aortic aneurysm) and in 2006 (repair of a cerebral aneurysm). In addition the offender has sleep apnoea requiring the daily use of CPA machine, muscoskeletal injuries in his neck, back and knees resulting from a motor vehicle accident in 2007, high blood pressure and chronic renal disease, as well as colitis. 50 A separate report setting out the medication the offender is prescribed for high levels of depression through Dr O’Shea, psychiatrist, as well as the other medication taken by the offender was also tendered (exhibit S7).51 In oral evidence Dr Norris said that the offender has a probability of about 50 per cent of a stroke or a heart attack over the next three-year period as well as renal failure. He also observed that there was some indication of vascular dementia resulting from the offender’s blood pressure although he hasn’t been subject to any neurological testing in that regard. 52 In cross-examination he agreed that the offender’s depression was being managed and was manageable with the current medication. 53 The report Dr Norris had received confirmed by Dr O’Shea, psychiatrist, was that the offender’s severe depression was not just a reaction to current situation but was also biologically engendered as a result of his brain dysfunction and his associated problems.Psychological/psychiatric report54 Various psychiatric reports were tendered from Dr McMurdo from both 1996 (as part of the earlier charges to which the offender pleaded guilty) and a final report dated 18 November 2008 prepared after an interval of 12 years.55 In the later report Dr McMurdo said that the offender did not suffer from a mental illness but that it was likely that he had had profound difficulty in personal relationships as well as an avoidant personality at the time of the offences in the early 1980s. 56 There is one significant difference in the reports and that is that the offender felt in 1996 that he was not doing anything wrong or damaging to the victims but realised at that stage (1996) that there was a deleterious effect from his actions. 57 I see no such evidence in the material before me in relation to these present offences. Indeed it would seem that the offender, by his continuing denial of his actions, has not come to terms with the impact of his actions on this victim. That is difficult to accept given the contents of the pre-sentence report, the presentation of the victim while she gave her evidence as well as the jury’s verdict. It raises serious issues as to the offender’s likely rehabilitation. Remorse is not something that can be considered in this context. In his oral evidence in the sentencing proceedings, the offender also inferred that he “knew much more about the complainant in these proceedings and her mother than the court knew” with the clear inference of considerable antagonism towards her.Character references58 A series of references were tendered (exhibits S5-S12) setting out the offender’s reputation in a number of social, familial, business, and other circles. Those referees deposed to the fact that he is a person of good character and has been for many years. Further, all referees state that his convictions were entirely out of character for him. The referees do not all appear to have been aware of the convictions in 1996. They are aware that the offender continues to maintain his innocence.Victim Impact Statement59 A Victim Impact Statement of SC set out that the offence had a huge impact on her childhood and adulthood. She also said that ‘nothing was ever the same’ after the assaults by the offender and that her ongoing feelings are reactivated by a variety of matters - for example, whenever she has to dress and shower her daughter who is now aged about eight. She said that: “the physical and psychological scars feel like they will be with me forever.” “Life is a rollercoaster” and has stopped her putting herself into any social or related activities. 60 SC stated that she had taken herself into some very destructive relationships that were both physically and verbally abusive. She suffers continued feelings of isolation and alienation particularly from her family. There are additional matters, for example, the time she spends in the bathroom scrutinising her body and purging herself and extreme emotional fragility (which was very evident during the trial) are ongoing problems for her. 61 Consistently with her presentation during her evidence is the statement: “I will never know what I might have made of my life without this. There seems to be nowhere I can go in life where this pain and shame doesn’t come into play.”62 These statements are consistent with many such statements from victims of abuse particularly where it occurs at these tender years. In my view, the impact of the offender’s actions on the victim have been at least as much if not more than expected of a person in these circumstances. As I have said elsewhere in these remarks, care must be taken not to double-count this issue given that the maximum penalties reflect an age classification for victims indicating the extent that the community regarded these matters was already taken into account in the maximum penalties established. Prior record63 A NSW Police summary of the offender’s prior convictions was tendered (exhibit S1), which showed the aforementioned prior convictions for four counts of aggravated sexual assault to which he pleaded guilty in 1996. For these he was sentenced to five months periodic detention.64 Following these 1996 convictions, the offender paid $130,000 after the Victims Compensation Tribunal commenced proceedings that the offender did not oppose. Counsel for the offender submits that this amounts to extra curial punishment.65 I do not consider that those payments can be regarded as extra curial punishment in relation to these offences. Had the offender accepted his guilt in relation to these current matters, he had the opportunity to make a clean slate of the situation at that time in relation to this victim. That did not occur. The victim and indeed, the victims in the earlier matters, had to re-live the entire events by giving evidence.Law66 Applying the decisions of Dousha v R [2008] NSWCCA 263 and R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; 54 NSWLR 368, the questions I need to consider are: 
     
      
      1. What, if any, was the discernable sentencing pattern at the time for comparable cases? That will include a consideration of the points of similarity and the number of such cases said to be representative (see  
      Featherstone v R 
       [2008] NSWCCA 71). 
      
    67 In Dousha v R [2008] NSWCCA 263 at [43]-[44], it was said that : 
     
      
      In the absence of statistical and non-statistical data, her Honour was obliged to adopt the approach which was settled in  
      R v MJR 
       [2002] NSWCCA 129; 54 NSWLR 368. Her Honour was provided with  
      MJR 
       together with a case note of  
      AJB v R 
       [2007] NSWCCA 51; 169 A Crim R 32 which both confirmed the correctness of that approach and developed it.  
       
       
      In both  
      AJB 
       and  
      MJR 
       particular attention was directed to the proper approach to the specification of the non-parole period in cases where the offences were committed prior to the introduction of the  
      Sentencing Act 
      . As Howie J observed in  
      AJB 
      , a non-parole period under the  
      Probation and Parole Act 
       was usually somewhere between a third and a half of the length of the sentence, which might itself be a practice that is sufficient to constitute special circumstances justifying departure from the statutory ratio fixed under the present regime. As his Honour said at [37], this Court ‘should endeavour to apply the practice that existed in 1982 in specifying a non-parole period because that practice would favour the applicant’.” 
      
    68 There was further discussion of those practices in Bradbury v R [2008] NSWCCA 93 and AJB v R [2007] NSWCCA 51.69 Here the legislature has specified the kinds of acts constituting and differentiating between intercourse and assault. I will reflect that distinction in the penalties to be imposed. I have referred counsel to the summary of cases and comparable sentences in this area in Australian Sentencing Digest [401] and [405] Carter, Butterworths 1985 (and supplement) as to the range of sentences for these and comparable matters in the 1983/4 period. As a general proposition, the penalties imposed were substantially lower than they are now for comparable matters.70 I propose to adopt that approached as outlined to base the non-parole period as being 60% of the head sentence consistently with the approach I have adopted in relation to my finding of special circumstances.2. What is the proper approach to the specification of the non-parole period (see R v Risby [2008] NSWDC 300 at 50): 
     
     “The regime of sentencing in that period of time was governed by the  
     Parole of Prisoners Act 
      1966. Remissions of either 1/3 or 1/4 were applied to the head sentence but not the non-parole period. This necessitated setting non-parole periods that were short enough to allow a sufficient period for parole with the head sentence being substantially reduced by executive action. It was not until the  
     Sentencing  
     Act 1989 that there was any across the board statutory stipulation of the proportion of a sentence that was ordinarily to be represented by the non-parole period. No allowance was made for the remission system when sentences were imposed. It has recently been held that when a court now sentences for offences committed when the earlier regime applied, no regard should be had for the fact that sentences in those days were reduced by operation of the remissions system: see  
     Bradbury v R 
      at [24] and  
     AJB v R 
      at [31] – [33].” 
    71 R v Moon (2000) 117 A Crim R 497 at 71: 
     
      
      “When sentencing an offender for offences committed many years earlier and where no sentencing range current at the time of offending can be established, the court will by approaching the sentencing task in this way effectively sentence the offender in accordance with the policy of the legislature current at the time of offending and consistently with the approach adopted by sentencing courts at that time.” 
      
    3. What has been the impact of delay (see R v Risby [2008] NSWDC 300 at 46)? 
     
     “It is relevant to the manner in which I assess the objective gravity of the offences of indecent assault and committing acts of indecency. In July 1981 the law relating to heterosexual sex offences was substantially amended. Prior to then, an act of penile/vaginal intercourse amounted to rape and all other forms of penetrative intercourse could only be prosecuted as an indecent assault. That means that the range of conduct that could amount to an indecent assault was wider, and included more serious conduct, than it did after the 1981 reforms. An act, which might now be seen to fall in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, for example, would previously have been lower in the range. Alternatively, an act that might now be prosecuted as a more serious offence would previously have been something that tended to be in the upper echelons of seriousness as an offence of indecent assault, or an act of indecency.” 
    Impact of delay72 Here there has obviously been a substantial delay between the offences and the sentence. 73 That delay has worked to the advantage of the offender in that he has been able to demonstrate his continuing good character during that intervening period from the mid-1990s, which I take into account.74 Balanced against that is that the offender has had these matters hanging over his head for some considerable period of time. However that must be viewed in relation to his continuing denial of these offences.Delay75 In R v LTP [2004] NSWCCA 109, Dunford J said: 
     
      
      “The mere passage of time between the committing of the offences and the disclosure of the offences and apprehension of the offender is of little weight as a factor in mitigation of penalty.” 
      
    76 This is not a matter in my view where delay mitigates the penalty. There was no perceived threat of detection: R v Virgona [2004] NSWCCA 415, particularly where the offender had the opportunity to raise these matters if he wanted to make a complete disclosure to the extent of his criminality given the totality of the police investigations in 1996.Age of the victim77 The age of the victim is an important factor in assessing the criminality of the offender although care must be taken not to double count this aspect given that the maximum penalty implicitly recognizes the harm such offences cause to victims of this age.78 In R v Rapley [1999] NSWCCA 302 at [15] it was made clear that the older age of the offender, the absence of a criminal record, and the fact that offences may occur spontaneously are common features of many cases where children are subject to sexual abuse by adults. A sentencing decision that does not involve a period of fulltime custody where these factors are present, either individually or collectively, will stand for nothing.79 Over the years the courts have been clear to say that sexual assaults upon young children, particularly by people who stand in a position of trust to them, must be severely punished and heavy custodial sentences are generally essential. That relates also to offences of indecent assault, not necessarily sexual intercourse. Ordinarily, a custodial sentence is appropriate for indecent assaults, but that is not necessarily required or inevitable in every case. That is the gravamen of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Mark Sullivan, (unrep. NSWCCA, 20/10/1989). 80 In MLP v R [2006] NSWCCA 271, Kirby J (with whom Grove and Hislop JJ agreed) said: 
     
      
       
      ""One of the submissions which has been made is, because of her age, it would not necessarily fall into the middle of the range. That is, she was between nine and ten years of age at the time, but I do not believe that is a correct approach I could take. The charge itself relates to any child under ten years of age and the victim was under ten years of age. I accept that you may get a situation where you have a very young child where it could be a severely aggravating factor in deciding where it comes in the range, but it seems to me that what I have got to do is have a look at the overall effect of all those facts to see where it falls in the range of this sort of offence."" 
      
    81 I have adopted this approach in relation to this matter.82 In R v AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 575, Simpson J said this (Howie J agreeing): 
     
      
      “Age of the victim is relevant in the assessment of objective gravity in that, generally, the younger the victim, the more serious might be the offence.""  
      
    83 In Shannon v R [2006] NSWCCA 39, Howie J (Mason P and Barr J agreeing) said: 
     
      
      “The age of the child is clearly a relevant consideration and the younger the child, the more serious the offence. It was an element of each of the offences in the present case that the child was between the ages of 10 and 16 at the time of the sexual intercourse, but that does not mean that a judge cannot take into account the age of the child falling within that range.  
      
     
     
      
      “Further, although the section is, as the Judge recognised, concerned to protect the vulnerable, it does not follow that a judge cannot take into account the particular vulnerability of the child by reason of the child's young age or other circumstances other than the child's age. For example, in the present case the judge would have been entitled to find that the complainant was particularly vulnerable by reason of her age, the fact that her father was seriously ill such that she felt she could not complain to her parents, and because the applicant knew that she was susceptible to his sexual advances because of her infatuation with him.” 
      
    84 Here the complainant was particularly vulnerable by reason of her age and the fact, known to the offender, that her father had recently died.85 In FV v R [2006] NSWCCA 237, the following was endorsed by McClellan CJ at CL and Hoeben J: 
     
      
      “The age of the victim is an important consideration in determining the objective seriousness of the crime and whether it falls within the mid range. But it does not follow that, because age is relevant and because the section contemplates a range of ages, an offence against a child approaching the age of 10 cannot be regarded, or should not be regarded, as being within the mid range. The section is concerned with the protection of the vulnerable from sexual exploitation and violation. No doubt, as a generalisation, the younger the child the more defenceless and vulnerable. 
      
    86 Here the offender exploited the victim’s age and her vulnerable situation.87 Relevant factors referred to in those decisions and that are not exhaustible include matters such as whether the act was committed as part of a pattern or history of abuse (R v AJP at [20]) and the age and relative maturity of the victim as well as her capacity to protest (FV v R [2006] NSWCCA 237 at [59]).Relevant law and sentencing regime88 General deterrence is an important factor I must take into account here – particularly to demonstrate that whenever these matters occur, an offender will ultimately be brought to justice. Personal deterrence is a factor but not of great significance given my finding that there is little chance of re-offending.89 In accordance with the principles established in Ibbs v R (1987) 163 CLR 447, I have looked for authorities on sentences for crimes of this nature, which are relevant at the time, in other words, going back to the mid-1980s and earlier. 90 Where the acts involve penetration, some forms of penetration can be regarded as more serious than others. Here there was digital penetration, that was clearly painful, but no penile penetration.91 What does seem to me to be relevant is the clear principle which the Courts, then and now, have expressed that, even where we have, as here, an older age person who has no criminal record and the fact that offences may occur spontaneously without any degree of planning - which seems to characterise these particular offences - those indeed are the characteristics of many offences of sexual abuse by adult members of families and extended families. 92 The previous good character of an offender attracts less weight in cases involving sexual assaults upon children than other types of offences. However the offender was, on the evidence, particularly the references tendered, a person of good character and standing in the community, his business, his church, and his peer group. He has lost that standing.Registration pursuant to the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 20004. The fact that the offender will need to be registered pursuant to the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 is not considered as a matter in mitigation, per Latham J in R v KNL [2005] NSWCCA 260.Relevant authorities93 Shannon v R [2006] NSWCCA 39: The offender pleaded guilty to three counts of sexual intercourse (the acts were two counts of fellatio and one count of penile/vaginal penetration – two of the acts occurred on one occasion; the offences were committed over a short period of time in 2000). The offender was a neighbour. He was sentenced to a sentence of imprisonment for five years with a non-parole period of three years. The Court of Criminal Appeal held that although the sentence was high it was within the Judge’s discretion to impose such a sentence.94 R v LTP [2004] NSWCCA 109: The offender was convicted following a trial of one count of sexual intercourse with a person between 10 and 16. The offences occurred in 2000 when the victim was aged 12. The offender was sentenced to imprisonment for six years with a non-parole period of four and a half years.95 R v Totten [2003] NSWCCA 207: The offender was sentenced for an offence of aggravated indecent assault (the aggravation being that the victim was under 16) and sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 16 under authority (cunnilingus). The offender was sentenced to imprisonment for eighteen months for the aggravated indecent assault and for a concurrent term of imprisonment for five years and four months with a non-parole period of four years for the sexual intercourse. The offences occurred between 1996 and 1998.96 R v Gould [1999] NSWCCA 177: The offender pleaded guilty (after the trial had started) to one count of indecent assault and one count of sexual intercourse (fellatio) with child between 10 and 16, the offender being in authority. The offences occurred between 1983 and 1987. The Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the sentence of seven and half years with a non-parole period of five years for the charge of sexual intercourse.97 R v White [1999] NSWCCA 366: The victim was a friend of the offender’s daughter. The offender, on the first occasion, rubbed the complainant’s vagina. On the second occasion he inserted his finger into her vagina and then his penis, causing pain and bleeding. The offender was sentenced to a fixed term of one year, a concurrent fixed term of two years and a concurrent period of eight years (minimum term of five years and an additional term of three years (taking into account various Form 1 matters). Mason P, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, said: “If I may say so, the sentences imposed were, if anything, on the light end of the relevant spectrum.”98 Nelson v R [2007] NSWCCA 221 (Latham J, with whom Tobias JA and Matthews AJ agreed): The CCA allowed an appeal against a sentence of 14 months with a non-parole period of eight months imposed upon a plea to an offence of “indecent assault female” pursuant to the now repealed s76 of the Crimes Act 1900. The offence, having been committed in 1972, carried a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment. A fixed term of 4 months was substituted on re sentence. 99 In Nelson, a discussion as to the sentencing practices prevailing in 1972 and how the court was to be guided by them. The court held [at 17] that his Honour “was to be guided by the maximum penalty, as an expression of the legislature’s view of the gravity of such offences at that time, and by the nature of the conduct proscribed”: R v Moon (2000) 117 A Crim R 497 at 511; R v MJR (2002) 54 NSWLR 368; AJB v R [2007] NSWCCA 51.100 AJB v R [2007] NSWCCA 51: The applicant pleaded guilty to five counts of indecent assault (contrary to s 76 of the Crimes Act – carrying a maximum penalty of six years) over a period of three years from 1979 upon his stepdaughter who was aged between six and a half and 10 years at the time of the offence. He was sentenced to an overall term of four years imprisonment with a non-parole of three years.101 R v Moon (2000) 117 A Crim R 497: The applicant pleaded guilty to four offences of indecent assault (forcing the victim to masturbate him) committed between 1966 and 1971. The victim was aged between 9 and about 15 years of age. The applicant had no criminal history and had not offended since. He was remorseful. For each offence he was sentenced to a minimum term of two years with an additional term of eight months, all sentences to be concurrent.102 I have also had regard to the range of sentences set out in relation to similar sentences for similar conduct on the Public Defenders’ website as well as the maximum penalty established for the offence - R v Trevanna [2004] NSWCCA 43 per Barr J; R v George [2004] NSWCCA 247.Aggravating/Mitigating factors: s21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) ActAggravating factors103 Consistent with counsels’ submissions, I find that there was limited planning and premeditation in relation to any of the offences. There is no evidence that the offender actively participated in inviting the victim to his home on those occasions. However there is no evidence of threats or violence other than that implicit in the acts themselves.Mitigating factors104 Defence counsel submits that the offender is of an advanced age (73), has ill health, has performed community work, is unlikely to re-offend, and that he took steps after the previous convictions to get counselling. I agree with those submissions.Rehabilitation and remorse105 As has often been said, rehabilitation must be preceded by an acknowledgement of wrongdoing and an acceptance that there should be a different approach to behaviour patterns. 106 The Crown submits that there is no evidence of any remorse or contrition before the Court, and in relation to the 1996 matters, in his evidence at trial the offender sought to diminish his conduct, blame the victims, and mitigate the seriousness of his offending. The Crown further submits that the offender displayed little insight into his offending - a matter that therefore undermines the prospects of his rehabilitation. 107 Given the offender’s age, his medical conditions and the legal proceedings he has been through in the 1990s and with the trial, I think there is little likelihood of any re-occurrence of offences such as these. Since 1996 he has ensured that whenever he has been around young children that he is not alone with them so that nothing untoward can occur. There is no evidence to the contrary. His personal circumstances are not such where he would be likely to come into close contact with young girls of this or similar age.JIRS statistics108 I have considered the relevant statistics produced by the Judicial Commission for offences under this section narrowed to the fields of pleas of ‘not guilty’, offender aged over 70, two counts. Consideration 109 Here the events took place on two occasions - the first over a continuing period of a weekend. There was a considerable disparity between the offender and the victim in terms of power and authority, age, and life experience, as well as in physical terms including height and weight.110 The victim was entitled to trust a man many years her senior who she knew to be a friend of her mother, as well as the environment of the accommodation that he had provided to her. The victim’s mother was also entitled to rely on the offender’s hospitality.111 The scene of the assault was a reasonably isolated farm and, more specifically, a separate barn and the area around it, away from where the victim’s mother and other adults were staying. 112 Counsel for the offender submits that, at the time of the offences, the victim was of sufficient age to make a complaint and had considerable opportunity to do so. This ignores the reality of the place and perceptions of an 11 and then 13-year-old who had recently lost her father (which was known to the offender) and who was going through strained emotional conditions. There was only one victim, the acts were opportunistic, without planning, and were committed in two time periods over a year apart, suggesting that the offender had no particular attitude towards this victim. 113 He further submits that the objective level of overall criminality ought to be seen as being in the lower range. For the reasons set out elsewhere in these remarks, I do not agree.Findings of criminality 114 In my view, the appropriate range of criminality is mid to low range.115 Defence counsel also submits that there is no evidence of either short or long term injury to the victim, either physical or mental, except the victim’s own statements that she suffered some pain at the time and remains upset about thoughts of the offences. Again I do not agree, particularly given the victim’s presentation at trial and her comments in her statements and the victim impact statement.116 Here the offences were aggravated by reason of the fact that the victim was under 16 years although that is an element of the offences and therefore not to be double-counted in accordance with the De Simoni principles. The offences were further aggravated by the fact that the accused was in a position of trust, both as a trusted friend of the victim’s widowed mother and the owner of the property to which the victim had been invited.117 I agree with the Crown’s submissions that the offender was much older than the victim and opportunistically was often alone with her. As a significantly older man with whom the victim was staying, he occupied a privileged position. He was imposing in demeanour and physically intimidating. The offences were also brazen. They were committed whilst other people were in close proximity or in the house nearby. The offences also occurred over a period of time in which the appellant had the opportunity to reflect upon his conduct and the damage that he was occasioning. 118 He took advantage of the situation to form a highly inappropriate sexual relationship with a child. He engaged in repeated criminal behaviour of a serious kind separated and repeated over two periods.Sentencing options119 Neither a periodic detention order or a community service order is available for the offender and, in any event, would not be appropriate for a case such as this with these facts. In addition, I do not consider that either a suspended sentence or the period of a bond is appropriate to give effect to the requirements, in particular, of general deterrence. I note, and agree with, the concerns expressed in the pre-sentence report (exhibit S4) that Mr Fischer’s continuing claim to innocence would make it difficult to assess any intervention or strategies that may be warranted or considered appropriate. 120 I also take into account that, as at 1983/1984, the offender was effectively a first time offender. Concurrency/accumulation121 The victim was the same in relation to all offences. All the offences occurred at the same premises in essentially the same manner. The offences took place over different periods of time – a period of days in 1983, and a separate period of days in 1984.122 The Crown submits that there should be a significant accumulation of the sentences imposed, particularly for the sentences for the separate visits by the victim to the offender’s property.123 Counsel for the offender submits that it is appropriate for the sentences to be served concurrently despite the 15 months between offences as they took place in the same location with the same victim in a similar fashion.124 The relevant principles were stated in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA; 168 A Crim R 41 at 27 as to whether one sentence can comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offences. 125 In my view there need to be a degree of partial accumulation to reflect the separate acts, the time periods between the acts, and that the 1984 act involved a repetition of that earlier conduct. The second offence establishes that the first matter was not an aberration. Given what occurred in 1996, these acts cannot be regarded as being isolated. The period of partial accumulation to reflect these factors should be 12 months.Special circumstances126 I need to consider if there are special circumstances warranting an adjustment to the ratio which the non-parole period bears a relationship to the term of the sentence defined by s. 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, that is, the non-parole period must not be less than three quarters of the term.127 It was submitted that there should be a finding of special circumstances based on the offender’s age, his medical condition, and his prospects for rehabilitation. I agree.128 The partial accumulation of the sentences is also something I should take into account. Here, in my view, the ratio that the non-parole period bears to the head sentence should be 60%.Sentence129 Following the jury’s verdict, the offender was convicted on each count.130 The offender has been deemed unsuitable for a Community Service Order and ineligible for a Periodic Detention Order.131 The sentence in relation to each count is as follows:Count 1 – indecent assault132 The offender is sentenced to a period of 6 months imprisonment to commence 27 February 2009 and to expire 26 August 2009.Count 2 – sexual assault133 The offender is sentenced to a period of 3 years imprisonment to be served concurrently with count 1 to commence 27 February 2009 and to expire 26 February 2012 with a non-parole period of 2 years to commence on 27 February 2009 and to expire 26 February 2011.Count 4 – sexual assault134 The offender is sentenced to a period of 3 years imprisonment to be served concurrently with counts 1 and 2 to commence 27 February 2009 and to expire 26 February 2012 with a non-parole period of 2 years to commence on 27 February 2009 and to expire 26 February 2011.Count 6 – indecent assault135 The offender is sentenced to a period of 6 months imprisonment to be served concurrently with counts 1, 2, and 4 to commence 27 February 2009 and to expire 26 August 2009.Count 7 – sexual assault136 The offender is sentenced to a period of 3 years imprisonment, with a partial accumulation of 12 months with counts 2 and 4, to commence 27 February 2011 and to expire 26 February 2014 with a non-parole period of 1 year to commence 27 February 2011 and to expire 26 February 2012.137 The total effect of this sentence is that the offender is sentenced to 5 years imprisonment to date from 27 February 2009 and to expire 26 February 2014 with a non-parole period of 3 years to commence 27 February 2009 and to expire 26 February 2012.138 The offender is therefore eligible for parole on 26 February 2012.Parole139 I recommend that on his release to parole, his parole be subject to the following conditions:- that he be of good behaviour;- that he notify the Probation and Parole Service of his address, housing details, and the circumstances of his accommodation;- that he comply with all directions of the Probation and Parole Service, including as to the monitoring of his mental health issues.- that copies of Dr Norris’ reports and recommendations in relation to his medical and other treatment accompany these orders to the Department of Corrective Services.140 I also recommend that he be considered for referral to Forensic Psychological Services for assessment and case management strategies if available at the prison.141 I also recommend that he be placed in protective custody for at least three months and until the full impact of his medical treatment regime can be assessed in a custodial environment.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Buddin J. 
     
      
    2 JAMES J: I agree with Buddin J. 
     
      
    3 BUDDIN J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him in the District Court. The applicant originally pleaded guilty in the Local Court to four separate charges of supplying drugs and adhered to those pleas when he appeared for sentence. 
     
      
    4 Charge 1 involved the deemed supply of MDMA in the form of twenty ecstasy tablets which had a total weight of 4.99 grams. Charge 2 involved the deemed supply of methylamphetamine with a total weight of 3.31 grams. Charge 3 involved the supply of 0.1 – 0.2 grams of crystal methylamphetamine or “ice” and Charge 4 involved the applicant knowingly taking part in the supply of 0.08 grams of methylamphetamine or “base”. Each of those offences attracts a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 2,000 penalty units.  
     
      
    5 The sentencing judge took into account when sentencing the applicant four offences of possessing a prohibited drug and one offence of goods in custody which related to a sum of $396.35 in cash which was found in the applicant’s possession. 
     
      
    6 In respect of Charge 4, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of 6 months imprisonment to date from 16 May 2008 which was the date he went into custody. In respect of Charge 3, he was sentenced to a fixed term of 6 months imprisonment to date from 16 August 2008. In respect of Charge 2, he was sentenced to a fixed term of 6 months imprisonment to date from 16 November 2008. In respect of Charge 1 and taking into account the Form 1 matters, a non-parole period of 7 months to date from 16 February 2009 and ending on 15 September 2009 was fixed. The total sentence imposed is due to expire on 15 June 2010. The effective non-parole period is thus one of 1 year 4 months (16 months) and the total sentence is 2 years 1 month (25 months). The applicant’s release date to parole is accordingly 15 September 2009. 
     
      
    7 The factual background to these offences, which is not in dispute, can be briefly stated. On 5 January 2007 police observed three people sitting in a parked car. The applicant was in the driver’s seat. In the front passenger seat was a young woman named Asha Wyles and seated behind her was a man named Matthew Barnes. Mr Barnes was seen to hand a cigarette packet to the applicant. When a police officer approached the vehicle he saw that the applicant was holding a cigarette packet. Ms Wyles was observed holding a set of scales on top of her right leg. Located inside the cigarette packet was a clear plastic bag which was wrapped inside another clear resealable bag containing 20 ecstasy tablets which weighed, as I have said, 4.99 grams (Charge 1). Also located inside the cigarette packet was one small clear resealable bag containing another clear resealable bag which in turn contained 1.83 grams of methylamphetamine (the first of the Form 1 matters). 
     
      
    8 The occupants of the vehicle were removed from it and when police searched the applicant they discovered three ecstasy tablets weighing 0.74 grams inside a container in his top pocket. In the same container police located two clear resealable sachets containing 0.16 grams of methylamphetamine. The applicant’s possession of those two quantities of drugs gave rise to the second and third matters on the Form 1 document. The fourth offence on the Form 1 arose from the discovery of an amount of $396.35 which was located in the applicant’s back pocket. That money was believed to have been obtained from the supply of drugs. 
     
      
    9 The applicant then directed the attention of police officers to other drugs. He said that “there is base [or methylamphetamine] on the floor”. On the floor behind the driver’s seat and centre console of the vehicle police located a clear resealable sachet containing 3.31 grams of methylamphetamine (Charge 2). Located on top of the centre console was a set of scales. Police also located 8.7 grams of cannabis in a clear plastic resealable bag which was discovered inside a zippered case that was near the front passenger seat (the possession of those drugs gave rise to the fifth and final matter on the Form 1 document). 
     
      
    10 The applicant was taken to a police station where he was interviewed. He told police that prior to their arrival he and his co-offender had been to an address in Redfern where he had supplied Ms Wyles with about 0.1 – 0.2 grams of crystal methamphetamine or “ice” for which he received $300 (Charge 3). The applicant also informed police that when they arrested him he had been about to supply Mr Barnes with the rock substance known as methylamphetamine or “base” which weighed 0.08 grams (Charge 4). He also said that Ms Wyles had been holding the scales in preparation for him weighing the drugs. 
     
      
    11 The applicant gave evidence that he was going to provide the ecstasy tablets to a friend who would pay him later. He said that the three ecstasy tablets located in his top pocket were for his personal use. 
     
      
    12 The applicant was aged 34 at the time of the offences and is now 36. He had little contact with his biological parents and was adopted when he was 3. However when the applicant was about 10 difficulties arose with his adoptive parents. His adoptive parents made arrangements for the applicant to have contact for the first time with his biological mother and sister. Subsequently his adoptive parents terminated that contact and since that time the applicant has had no contact with his biological family. 
     
      
    13 A report from Mr Watson-Munro, a forensic psychologist, was in evidence. He reported that the applicant told him that the cessation of contact with his biological mother had led him to experience feelings of abandonment and confusion. Those feelings were apparently exacerbated when shortly thereafter the applicant was sent away to boarding school in Bathurst. Upon finishing school the applicant returned to Sydney where he took up employment for about 2 years with his father as an electrician. At various times he has been employed in real estate, security work and the car industry. At the time of the offences he was working in a panel beating shop and was also delivering pizzas. At the time of sentence he was casually employed as a landscape gardener.  
     
      
    14 The applicant has never married and has no children. He informed Mr Watson-Munro that because of his anxiety and depression he found it difficult to maintain employment and also relationships. The sentencing judge accepted that the applicant was addicted to “ice” at the time of these offences and that he was motivated to supply drugs to feed his own habit. Nevertheless his Honour noted that there was some discrepancy in the evidence as to precisely how long the applicant had been addicted to “ice” and the circumstances in which he had acquired a significant dependency upon it. Mr Watson-Munro reported that the offender had told him that he had been addicted to amphetamines which he had started using in his late twenties. In more recent times the applicant told him that he had become addicted to “ice”. In evidence the applicant told the sentencing judge that he had begun using “ice” only after moving in to share a house with a woman named Natalie. This had occurred, he said, about 8 months prior to his arrest. The applicant said that he began to deliver drugs for her and in return he received a “couple of points of drugs” a day as well as petrol money. The pre-sentence report also stated that the applicant began heavy amphetamine use only after meeting Natalie (by which time he was of course considerably older than his late twenties). Until then his drug use had been confined to the occasional use of amphetamines, a fact which prompted the author of that report to conclude that the applicant did not appear to have a significant drug history. 
     
      
    15 Since his arrest the applicant had made various endeavours to address his drug problems. To that end, although he did not complete the course, he did spend 2-3 months in The Bridge drug rehabilitation program conducted by William Booth House and thereafter attended Narcotics Anonymous meetings at Matthew Talbot Hostel on a weekly basis. The applicant gave evidence that he had stopped using drugs after attending The Bridge program. 
     
      
    16 The applicant had no criminal record as an adult and accordingly the sentencing judge treated him as a man of prior good character. In all the circumstances his Honour concluded that the applicant had “favourable prospects of rehabilitation”. That was one of the factors which led the sentencing judge to make a finding of “special circumstances”. 
     
      
    17 It was common ground that the applicant pleaded guilty to these offences at the earliest available opportunity. For that reason, the sentencing judge extended to him a discount “by a figure at the top of the range as identified by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Thomson & Houlton”. His Honour also found that the applicant was remorseful and that, in respect of some of the offences, he had made a voluntary disclosure to the police, a consideration which entitled him to a further discount on sentence. The sentencing judge also took into account in the applicant’s favour that he had provided what was described as “valuable information” to police upon his arrest. That information resulted in a search warrant being executed at premises occupied by the person whom the applicant nominated as his cannabis supplier. A quantity of cannabis was seized from those premises with the result that that offender was placed on a bond in the Local Court for supplying cannabis. The applicant gave evidence that as a result of his disclosures to police he was assaulted in the street by his supplier’s associates. The applicant also supplied information about other persons involved in the supply of amphetamine and ecstasy but that information was assessed by police as being of no value. Nor was the applicant prepared to provide information about his amphetamine and ecstasy supplier. An overall discount of 30% was extended to the applicant to reflect the fact that he had both pleaded guilty and had provided assistance to the authorities. 
     
      
    18 The applicant told the author of a pre-sentence report that he had committed the offences solely in order to finance his and his then girlfriend’s drug use and that the drugs were supplied only to people within their immediate circle of friends. The sentencing judge was not disposed to accept that claim. Although his Honour found that the applicant was at the lower end of the drug distribution network he nevertheless concluded that “his role was important and essential in that drug distribution network”. At one stage during the proceedings the sentencing judge described the applicant as operating a “drug supermarket”. 
     
      
    19 Although the sole ground of appeal that was notified in the Notice of Appeal was a contention that the sentences were manifestly excessive, a number of individual complaints were raised both in written submissions and at the hearing of the application. It is convenient to deal with each of those complaints. 
     
      
       
      Alternatives to full-time imprisonment 
       
      
    20 It is contended that the sentencing judge erred in failing to consider alternatives to full-time imprisonment. The starting point for this submission was the fact that the applicant had been assessed as being suitable for either community service or periodic detention by the author of the pre-sentence report. The complaint is that his Honour must have overlooked those alternatives because there is no reference to them in the Remarks on Sentence. The applicant also placed reliance upon this court’s decision in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 in which reference was made to s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Act) which prohibits a court from imposing a sentence of imprisonment unless the court is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no other penalty is appropriate. It is further contended that the sentencing judge erred in regarding himself as, in effect being bound, in the light of authorities such as R v Gu [2006] NSWCCA 104, to impose a full-time custodial sentence.  
     
      
    21 The sentencing judge referred to Gu as supporting the well-entrenched principle that in the absence of exceptional circumstances a full time custodial sentence ought to be imposed whenever the offender has been substantially involved in the supply of prohibited drugs. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        With perhaps the exception of the deemed supply of ecstasy charge, when one considers the supplies the subject of the three other charges before me in isolation, one may not necessarily come to the conclusion that the offender was substantially involved in the supply of prohibited drugs. However, it is impossible to look at each of the four supply charges before me in isolation from each other. When the number of supply offences and the variety of drugs supplied are taken into account, one must inevitably come to the conclusion that the offender was substantially involved in the supply of prohibited drugs, even though he was not to make any financial profit from it. In my view, the fact that he had a disturbed upbringing and the fact that he commenced to use illicit drugs upon [sic] a background of depression and anxiety and the fact that he has favourable prospects of rehabilitation, do not individually or in combination establish exceptional circumstances such that a full time custodial sentence would not be appropriate. 
        
       
       
        
        I am unable therefore to accept the submission of [counsel] who has appeared on behalf of the offender, that it would be appropriate in this case to suspend the sentence. 
        
       
      
    22 In that passage his Honour explained with conspicuous clarity precisely why nothing but a full-time custodial sentence was called for. It is thus readily apparent that his Honour did consider what other sentencing options may have been available before deciding that none of them would adequately meet the circumstances of the present case. That conclusion, and the findings which led to that conclusion, were well open to the sentencing judge. I would reject this complaint. 
     
      
       
      Discount for assistance 
       
      
    23 As I have already said, the sentencing judge allowed a combined discount of 30% for the pleas of guilty and the assistance which the applicant provided to authorities. Although his Honour did not quantify the discount which he allowed for the pleas of guilty he did, as I have said, indicate that he would reduce the otherwise appropriate sentence “by a figure at the top of the range as identified … in R v Thomson and Houlton”. From that remark the applicant infers that a discount of 25% was extended to him for the pleas of guilty and that therefore a discount of only 5% was allowed for his assistance to authorities. That discount, it was submitted, was insufficient to reflect the fact that the applicant had provided information which led to the arrest of his cannabis supplier, as a direct result of which, he asserted, he had been assaulted. 
     
      
    24 The sentencing judge’s approach in providing a combined discount for the two aspects of the matter, namely the plea of guilty and the assistance to authorities, was not only appropriate but it was in conformity with well-established authority. 
     
      
    25 In R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 Gleeson CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        It must often be the case that an offender's conduct in pleading guilty, his expressions of contrition, his willingness to co-operate with the authorities, and the personal risks to which he thereby exposes himself, will form a complex of inter-related considerations, and an attempt to separate out one or more of those considerations will not only be artificial and contrived, but will also be illogical. (at 228) 
        
       
      
    26 Accordingly, the ultimate question is thus whether it has been demonstrated that the overall discount of 30% is manifestly excessive. The sentencing judge had careful regard, in assessing the weight to be allowed for the applicant’s assistance, to the matters set out in s 23 of the Act. Due allowance had to be made for the fact that the applicant provided information to the police about his cannabis supplier, and that he had apparently suffered retribution for doing so. However, the applicant was not entitled to the type of leniency that he would have attracted had he been prepared to give information about what he also knew concerning the activities of other persons in the drug distribution business. Nor was there any suggestion that he had undertaken to give evidence against any other persons. Nor, as the sentencing judge pointed out, was there any evidence that as a result of providing this information the applicant would be required to serve his sentence in harsher conditions than would normally be the case. In short, the present circumstances were well removed from the type of case in which a combined discount of 40% to 50% is called for. I would reject this complaint.  
     
      
       
      Special circumstances 
       
      
    27 The complaint which is made is that although the sentencing judge found “special circumstances” his Honour did not “substantially alter” the proportion which the non-parole period bore to the head sentence. It was also contended that a longer period of supervision was called for given the applicant’s long standing addiction to drugs and the fact that he had already taken successful steps on the path to rehabilitation. 
     
      
    28 The effective non-parole period of 16 months imposed upon the applicant represents 64% of the overall sentence of 25 months and thus constitutes a departure of more than 10% from the normal statutory ratio. The question of whether or not “special circumstances” are made out essentially involves an exercise of discretion. So also is the associated question of what practical significance a finding that special circumstances exist has upon the relationship that the non-parole period bears to the head sentence: see generally R v El-Arja [2009] NSWCCA 8. I am not persuaded that error of a kind that would warrant appellate intervention has been established. I would reject this complaint. 
     
      
       
      Accumulation/Totality 
       
      
    29 It is common ground that the sentencing judge had proper regard, in the manner in which he structured the sentences, to the principles enunciated in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. What is contended however is that the level of accumulation has led to an aggregate sentence which is manifestly excessive particularly given, it is submitted, that the “offences all occurred in the same event”. 
     
      
    30 Although in a sense the offences all occurred during one episode, clearly enough a number of separate offences involving the supply of different kinds of drug were committed by the applicant during that episode. As a consequence, individual sentences which reflected that state of affairs were called for. The sentencing judge sought to accommodate the various sentencing considerations by imposing, in respect of each offence, a sentence which was partly concurrent and partly cumulative. That entailed an exercise of discretion to be made by the sentencing judge in accordance with the relevant principles: see R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66; Elmir v R [2009] NSWCCA 22 at [52]. I do not discern any error in the sentencing judge’s approach either in the process which his Honour undertook nor in the result at which he arrived which would warrant appellate intervention.  
     
      
    31 Moreover, and even allowing for his favourable antecedents, his pleas of guilty and assistance to the authorities and his position as a user/dealer, I am not persuaded given the nature and extent of the applicant’s involvement in the business of supplying drugs that the sentences imposed upon him were, either individually or in their overall effect, manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      Parity 
       
      
    32 That leaves the question of parity. As I observed earlier, Ms Wyles and Mr Barnes were arrested at the same time as the applicant. Ms Wyles pleaded guilty to knowingly take part in the supply of methylamphetamine or “base”. She was convicted and fined $200 and placed on a s 9 bond. That offence arose from her having held the scales in order to assist the applicant in the supply of drugs. Mr Barnes pleaded guilty to two charges of possession of prohibited drugs. He received two concurrent bonds. He was also dealt with for an offence of supplying a small quantity of ecstasy, a matter with which the applicant was not charged. The sentencing judge concluded that the question of parity did not arise because the applicant’s level of criminality was “far greater” than that of Ms Wyles and Mr Barnes and that he was “far more deeply entrenched in drug supply” than the others. 
     
      
    33 It was properly conceded on behalf of the applicant that “strict parity considerations” did not apply. It was nevertheless submitted that the sentences imposed upon the applicant were disproportionate to those of the other offenders both of whom had records for drug offences. In this context the applicant also highlighted the sentence which had been imposed upon his cannabis supplier. 
     
      
    34 The nature and extent of the applicant’s role in this enterprise entitled the sentencing judge to conclude that his conduct was of a quite different kind from the criminality alleged against the other offenders. That difference was highlighted by the fact that the applicant was the only one of the three offenders to be dealt with in the District Court a factor which exposed him to the much higher penalties available in that jurisdiction. Furthermore, the sheer number and the relative seriousness of the offences of which the applicant was convicted served only to reinforce the difference between his circumstances and that of the other offenders. I would reject this complaint. 
     
      
    35 I propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

     Neil Scott CHARLESWORTH v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 ALLSOP P: I agree with Kirby J.2 KIRBY J: Neil Scott Charlesworth (the appellant) was arraigned upon an indictment containing two counts. The first was a charge of aggravated robbery, contrary to s 95 of the Crimes Act 1900 (“the Act”) (maximum penalty: imprisonment 20 years). The terms of the indictment are important. The charge was expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. On or about 25 March 2006 at Wyong in the State of New South Wales, did rob (JC) of his property, namely, a Commonwealth Bank Key Card and mobile phone and at the time of such robbery did maliciously inflict actual bodily harm upon (JC).” 
        
       
      
    3 The second count was a charge that the appellant aided and abetted a co-offender, Lindsay Hearn, in the offence of aggravated detention for advantage, contrary to s 86(2) of the Act (maximum penalty: imprisonment 20 years). The indictment was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “2. Lindsay Hearn on or about 26 March 2006 at Wyong in the State of New South Wales did, without consent, detain (JC) with the intention of obtaining an advantage, namely to steal property, and immediately beforehand actual bodily harm was occasioned to the said (JC) and that 
        
       
       
       Neil Scott Charlesworth 
       
       
        
        on the day and year aforesaid at Wyong in the State of New South Wales was present aiding, abetting and assisting the said Lindsay Hearn to commit the said serious indictable offence.” 
        
       
      
    4 The charges arose out of the events of 25 and 26 March 2006. On 14 September 2006, in the Wyong Local Court, Mr Charlesworth pleaded guilty to both offences. He was committed for sentence to the District Court. There was, however, a defect in the way in which the charges had been framed. Mr Charlesworth was rearraigned on 17 November 2006 in the Gosford District Court. He again pleaded guilty. He was then remanded in custody for sentence. 
     
      
    5 The matter came before O’Connor DCJ in Gosford on 15 March 2007. Mr Charlesworth gave brief evidence. The solicitor appearing for him drew his attention to the terms of a Probation and Parole Report. The examination was as follows: (T 4) 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You’re aware that the presentence reports at page 4 indicates that and I’ll read, ‘Of more concern is that Mr Charlesworth sees himself as a victim and does not view any of these actions as more than being caught up in it’. Is that true? 
         
        A. No.” 
        
       
      
    6 Mr Charlesworth added that he was not a brave man and was intimidated by Lindsay Hearn. His attention was drawn to the presence of the victim in court. The appellant then gave the following evidence: (T 5) 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Is there anything you wish to say to the victim? 
         
        A. Yes I’m terribly sorry for not stopping it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’re sorry for assisting in it, assisting to playing your part. Are you sorry for that? 
         
        A. Yes I’m terribly sorry for that yeah.” 
        
       
      
    7 On 4 May 2007, O’Connor DCJ sentenced Mr Charlesworth as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: 
         A non parole period of two and a half years commencing on 6 April 2006 and expiring on 5 October 2008 and a balance of term of two and a half years commencing on 6 October 2008 and expiring on 5 April 2011; 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: 
         A non parole period of three years commencing on 6 April 2008 and expiring on 5 April 2011 and a balance of term of two years commencing on 6 April 2011 and expiring on 5 April 2013. 
        
       
      
    8 The total sentence was 7 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 5 years. 
     
      
       
      The Notice of Appeal. 
       
      
    9 The notice of appeal against conviction relied upon a single ground, expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is a miscarriage of justice as the appellant, upon the admitted facts, could not in law have been convicted of the offences charged.” 
        
       
      
    10 The application for leave to appeal against sentence identified the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance in relation to the sentence imposed on the co-offender Lindsay Hearn for the robbery of (JC) and detaining him for advantage. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance in relation to the sentence imposed on the co-offender Brett Molloy for the offence of aiding and abetting Lindsay Hearn and the applicant to detain (JC) for advantage. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The sentences for the aggravated robbery and aiding and abetting detain for advantage are manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
       
      The sentencing proceedings. 
       
      
    11 In the sentencing proceedings the Crown, with the consent of the appellant, tendered the Crown brief, which included an agreed statement of facts. His Honour, in his remarks on sentence, said this: (ROS 2) 
     
      
       
        
        “I find those facts proved beyond reasonable doubt for the purpose of sentencing the offender. I provide a copy of the agreed statement of facts to the Reporting Services Branch and request that they be incorporated in these remarks on sentence.” 
        
       
      
    12 The agreed statement was lengthy. It is, nonetheless, fundamental to the argument of the appellant on this appeal. It described the events of the evening of 25 March 2006 and the morning of 26 March 2006 in respect of all three offenders. There were a number of episodes, not all of which involved the appellant. The first concerned the robbery of the victim (who will be referred to as “JC”). The agreed facts were in these terms: (Exhibit A) 
     
      
       
        
        “During the evening of the 25th March 2006 Charlesworth was at the residence of Jacqueline Sturch. At about 8.30 pm Brett Molloy came by with Lindsay Hearn. After consuming some alcohol Molloy and Hearn said that they were going to Sydney. Charlesworth agreed to go with them. At the time he believed that they were going to steal something. They left in Hearn’s vehicle (white Commodore) and Hearn drove. Charlesworth was seated in the back of the vehicle and Molloy was seated in the front passenger’s seat. The three males drove south on the F3 Freeway. 
        
       
       
        
        About 11.20 pm (JC) was driving his motor vehicle south along the F3 Freeway between Morisset and Ourimbah on his way home from work. At the time he was working as a night manager at Subway, Morriset. The complainant suffers from Aspergers syndrome. At this time Hearn’s white Holden Commodore sedan (RFG-852) commenced to follow his vehicle. 
        
       
       
        
        Hearn flashed his high beam lights at the complainant’s vehicle. Believing something may have been wrong with his vehicle or thinking the occupants of the vehicle required help, the complainant pulled his vehicle into the breakdown lane of the Freeway and stopped. It is to be noted that Neal Waters was also travelling the F3 Freeway this evening and he, too, was tailed by a white commodore constantly flashing its headlights from low to high beam. 
        
       
       
        
        After the complainant’s vehicle had become stationary in the breakdown lane of the F3 Freeway, Hearn alighted from the driver’s seat of his vehicle and approached the complainant. Both Charlesworth and Molloy remained seated in the vehicle. At this time Charlesworth believed that Hearn intended to steal money from the complainant (Q/A 143). The complainant later told police that Hearn identified himself as a plain clothes police officer and ordered the complainant from his vehicle. Hearn then walked the complainant to the rear of his vehicle and told him to place his hands on the rear of the car. Hearn then ordered the complainant to produce his driver’s licence as he had been ‘speeding’. The complainant, believing Hearn to be a police officer, complied. 
        
       
       
        
        The complainant became suspicious and requested to see some identification. Hearn flicked open his wallet and upon seeing no form of identification in the wallet the complainant became worried. Hearn told the complainant that he had to pay a fine for speeding and wanted to know how much money he had in his possession. The complainant said that he had no money. Hearn then demanded the complainant’s licence and snatched it from the complainant’s hand. During this time both Charlesworth and Molloy were still in their vehicle. Hearn then returned [to] the white Commodore and spoke with Molloy and Charlesworth and gave the complainant’s driver’s licence to Molloy. At this time both Charlesworth and Molloy were still seated in the vehicle. It is at this time that Charlesworth became aware that Hearn had identified himself as a ‘Constable’ of police. Charlesworth told police that Hearn indicated to him and Molloy that he (Hearn) had to  
        ‘kill’ 
         the complainant. Charlesworth believed that this was because the complainant would have the licence number of Hearn’s vehicle.” 
        
       
      
    13 The account continued, describing events which culminated in Hearn savagely kicking the victim: 
     
      
       
        
        “Hearn then returned to where the complainant was standing and stated  
        ‘You’ve got to pay a fine, if you have got no money then you will have to pay with your key card’.  
        Hearn then grabbed his wallet from his hand and then pushed the complainant, causing him to fall over a guard rail on the side of the Freeway. The complainant then got to his feet, returned to his vehicle and started to drive away. Hearn then returned to his vehicle and all three then followed the complainant, flashing their headlights at him. When the complainant refused to pull over, Hearn drove his vehicle in front of the complainant’s car, coming to rest at a 45 degree angle forcing the complainant to stop his vehicle. 
        
       
       
        
        At this point all three got out of the Commodore. Whilst Hearn approached the complainant Charlesworth and Molloy discussed whether they should  
        ‘stop’ 
         Hearn and they approached the complainant and Hearn. Charlesworth heard Hearn demand money from the complainant and Charlesworth then said to the complainant …;  
        ‘just give him your money and you can go’. 
         Hearn then opened the driver’s door of the complainant’s vehicle, kicked the complainant to the right side of his face and Charlesworth ran off. The complainant placed his right hand over his face to protect himself and then Hearn kicked the complainant a second time, hitting him in the right hand. The force of the first blow cause the teeth of the complainant to lacerate through the flesh under his bottom lip. The complainant was bleeding profusely from the wound under his mouth but Hearn then forced him to the passenger seat. Hearn then got into the driver’s seat and drove off. Molloy followed Hearn in the white Commodore.” 
        
       
      
    14 This was the material relied upon by the Crown to support the first count, that of aggravated robbery. 
     
      
    15 It will be noticed from this account that, after Hearn kicked the victim in the face the first time, Mr Charlesworth ran off. He ran up the freeway to the Westfield Shopping Centre where he arranged for his girlfriend to pick him up. He then returned to her home at Gorokan.  
     
      
    16 The victim’s ordeal, however, was far from over. There followed a sequence in which the appellant was not involved. It was described in the agreed statement as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Hearn drove the complainant to the Toukley area and ordered the complainant down so he could not see out of the vehicle. During this journey Hearn demanded that the complainant supply him with his PIN number to his Key Card. Whilst driving along Hearn also threatened the complainant. Molloy was still following the complainant’s vehicle at this stage and Hearn drove the complainant to an area underneath the Wallarah Point Bridge. 
        
       
       
        
        Hearn then forced the complainant to perform oral sex upon him. Hearn then ordered the complainant to lick his anus. Fearing for his safety, the complainant complied with Hearn’s demands. Hearn then ordered the complainant to take his pants off and ordered the complainant to get on top of him. Hearn then forced his penis into the anus of the complainant. During this time the complainant was bleeding from his earlier wounds and Hearn then ordered the complainant to again perform oral sex on him. At some point Molloy left the area in Hearn’s vehicle.” 
        
       
      
    17 It was clear from other material that Molloy witnessed the oral sex which Hearn ordered the victim to perform. 
     
      
    18 The three offenders again came together at the appellant’s girlfriend’s home at Gorokan. The agreed facts described the circumstances in which the victim’s key card was used to obtain money from his bank account: 
     
      
       
        
        “Hearn then drove the complainant and his vehicle back to Cornwall Avenue Gorokan. At this time Charlesworth and Molloy had both returned to the property, separately. Molloy’s vehicle (blue coloured Mitsubishi Magna, RQX 494) was also at this property. As Hearn arrived he told the complainant (who was still in the vehicle):  
        ‘If you try anything fuckin stupid I will kill your family. Don’t think any of these people are going to help you.’ 
         Hearn again threatened the complainant and demanded to know his PIN number. The complainant then gave Hearn the correct PIN and Hearn recorded the number in the complainant’s mobile phone. 
        
       
       
        
        Hearn entered the premises and told Charlesworth and Molloy that he had the complainant’s key card and PIN number and that they needed to go to the bank. Charlesworth told the police that Hearn had told him that the complainant had given him the PIN number. Charlesworth noticed at the time that Hearn had blood on his clothing. The group then travelled in Molloy’s Magna to the St George ATM at Lakehaven. Charlesworth was driving the motor vehicle because Molloy was unlicenced and did not want to be pulled over by the police. Hearn obtained some cash for himself and gave Charlesworth $200.00 and Molloy $250.00. Charlesworth told police that when he received this money he thought  
        ‘let’s go play the pokies’ 
         (Q/A 295).” 
        
       
      
    19 The victim’s vehicle was a hatchback, with a rear compartment. The statement of facts described what then occurred, although the appellant, at this point, was not aware that the victim was still in the vehicle. The statement included these words:  
     
      
       
        
        “The three then travelled to the Caltex Service Station at Lakehaven. All this time the complainant was still in the back of his vehicle at Cornwall Ave, unbeknownst to Charlesworth. The three were captured on CCTV placing fuel into the vehicle and entering the service station. Whilst in the store the CCTV footage shows Hearn wearing a white and red ‘Holden’ t-shirt with blood down the front of it. Hearn also attempted to use the store’s Eftpos facility and was captured on the CCTV utilising the complainant’s mobile phone to retrieve the PIN number. 
        
       
       
        
        The group then left the service station and returned to Cornwall Avenue, where Charlesworth enters the premises and gives a pack of cigarettes to his girlfriend. At this time Hearn returned to the complainant’s car (where he had parked it earlier in Cornwall Ave). At this time the complainant was still in the back of the vehicle and Hearn demanded to know how to increase the limit on the card, Hearn said;  
        ‘I will kill your family, or I will kill you’.  
        Hearn then ordered the complainant to lie down in the back seat of the vehicle. There is no suggestion at this time that Charlesworth knew that the complainant was in the vehicle.” 
        
       
      
    20 The appellant then became aware of the complainant’s presence. This is the material upon which the Crown relied in support of the second count, the charge of aiding and abetting Hearn in the detention of the victim for advantage: 
     
      
       
        
        “They all then left for a local hotel (‘The Grand’). Charlesworth and Molloy travel in Molloy’s vehicle and Hearn followed in the complainant’s vehicle. Upon arriving at Wyong Hearn parked the complainant’s vehicle in a car park near the river. He then said to the complainant;  
        ‘Stay in the car, were I’ve parked, these people are part of a biker gang, if you do anything stupid they will shoot you on the spot.’ 
          
        At the time of Hearn saying this, Charlesworth and Molloy were about ten feet away in Molloy’s vehicle. Charlesworth tells the police he heard some of what Hearn said at this point but did not make any inquiries for the safety of the complainant. 
        
       
       
        
        The three then went into the Grand Hotel at Wyong, where they played the poker machines, using the money withdrawn from the complainant’s account earlier. The group remained at the hotel area for about one hour. 
        
       
       
        
        When the three left the hotel they went to get the complainant’s vehicle. Hearn returned to the complainant’s vehicle while Charlesworth and Molloy returned to Molloy’s vehicle. Hearn had told Charlesworth that he needed a blanket. Charlesworth and Molloy went back to Cornwall Ave, and Hearn followed them in the complainant’s vehicle. On route Hearn stopped a number of times and alight(ed) from the vehicle. Each time Hearn stopped the vehicle he threatened the life of the complainant and his family should he try to escape. Hearn then returned to the premises at Cornwall Avenue Gorokan. Charlesworth obtained a white sheet from the premises and gave this to Hearn who ordered the complainant to place it over himself. The complainant at this time was still in the hatch area of his vehicle. The three offenders then got into the complainant’s vehicle and drove off. All three were in the front of the vehicle – Hearn drove the vehicle, Charlesworth sat in the middle and Molloy was on the passenger side. During this journey Hearn said  
        ‘I’ve got to fill up. Don’t move or I will fuckin’ hunt down your family.’ 
         The car then slowed down and as they pulled into a service station, Hearn asked the complainant;  
        ‘What type of fuel does the car take?’ 
         The complainant replied;  
        ‘Unleaded’ 
         and then Hearn asked;  
        ‘What side is the pump on?’ 
         The complainant replied;  
        ‘Passenger’s side’ 
        . The car was then filled with petrol and the complainant was eventually taken to the Foreshore Reserve, Canton Beach.” 
        
       
      
    21 The statement continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Charlesworth told police that he did not look at the complainant during any of the journey because he did not want to and ‘blocked’ this from his head (Q/A 501). However he knew he was all covered with the sheet and was lying down in the back of the vehicle. He also told police that he had noticed the state of Hearn’s clothing and noticed blood on Hearn’s ‘T’ shirt. 
        
       
       
        
        When they arrived at Canton Beach, Hearn took the complainant out of the vehicle. At this point the complainant was covered by the sheet. Hearn and the complainant walked down to the long reeds on the edge of Tuggerah Lakes, whilst Charlesworth and Molloy watched on. 
        
       
       
        
        Soon Hearn returned to the vehicle and all three drove off. They went first to Morisset to try and buy some marijuana and then they went back to Cornwall Ave. After this the group went to the Commonwealth Bank and tried to use the complainant’s debit card again. Hearn told the other two that there was no money in  
        ‘there’ 
        . Charlesworth states to police that he then decided to leave and he walked away from Hearn and Molloy. He tried to make a phone call at the public phone box. This was not successful but Hearn and Molloy tried to  
        ‘get me back in the car’. 
         Charlesworth told police that he wanted to leave and caught a bus away from the area.” 
        
       
      
    22 Mr Charlesworth’s departure ended his involvement in these events. The statement of facts described what happened to the victim thereafter in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whilst this was occurring the complainant was still at Canton Beach. Hearn had ordered the complainant to remain in the long grass or he would be killed, believing this, the complainant remained still for about an hour and when it started to become light he jumped into Tuggerah Lake, and waded through the water until coming out onto Wilfred Barrett Drive. Shaun Robinson was driving past at the time and saw the complainant and stopped. Police and ambulance were then called.” 
        
       
      
    23 The statement concluded as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “About 11.25 am on Sunday the 26th of March 2006 the complainant’s car was found well alight at Peace Park at Gorokan; the same park in which the sexual assaults upon the complainant took place. The vehicle was extensively damaged by fire. Charlesworth knew of the damage to the complainant’s vehicle as he told police that Hearn and Molloy had arrived at his house late in the evening and said that they had  
        ‘just burnt the car out’  
        (Q/A 596). 
        
       
       
        
        On the 6th April 2006 Charlesworth handed himself into police. He indicated that he had read what had occurred in the newspapers and said he had nothing to do with the sexual assault upon the complainant. He had talked it over with his girlfriend (Sturch) and eventually decided to speak with the police about his involvement. Molloy also surrendered to the police after some discussions with his family, but Hearn left the area and went to the ACT where he was extradited and returned to New South Wales. Hearn did not participate in a record of interview with police but both Charlesworth and Molloy did participate in records of interview.” 
        
       
      
    24 Let me turn to the grounds of appeal, dealing first with the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
       
      Were the admitted facts capable of supporting Count 1: Aggravated Robbery? 
       
      
    25 A plea of guilty is an admission by the accused of the essential elements of the offence (R v O’Neill [1979] 2 NSWLR 582; (1979) 1 A Crim R 59). Indeed, a plea has been described as the most cogent admission of guilt that can be made (R v Sagiv (1986) 22 A Crim R 73 at 81). Nonetheless, in certain circumstances, it can be set aside on appeal. In  Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120, Kirby P (Grove and Newman JJ agreeing) said this: (at 121/2) 
     
      
       
        
        “This Court has power to set aside a conviction recorded following a plea of guilty: see  
        Forde 
         [1923] 2 KB 400 at 403;  
        Gower v Ross  
        [1959] SASR 278;  
        Stewart 
         [1960] VR 106;  
        Foley 
         (1963) 80 WN (NSW) 726. From these and other cases it is clear that a court will entertain an appeal against such a conviction, notwithstanding a guilty plea, if it appears: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) that the appellant did not appreciate the nature of the charges or did not intend to admit that he was guilty of them; or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) that the appellant, upon the admitted facts, could not in law have been convicted of the offence charged: see esp  
        Caruso 
         (1988) 49 SASR 465 at 489; 37 A Crim R 1 at 26. 
        
       
       
        
        For good reasons, courts approach attempts at trial or on appeal in effect to change a plea of guilty or to assert a want of understanding of what was involved in such a plea with caution bordering on circumspection. This attitude rests on the high public interest in the finality of legal proceedings and upon the principle that a plea of guilty by a person in possession of all relevant facts is normally taken to be an admission by that person of the necessary legal ingredients of the offence: see  
        O’Neill 
         [1979] 2 NSWLR 582; (1979) 1 A Crim R 59;  
        Sagiv 
         (1986) 22 A Crim R 73 at 81.” 
        
       
      
    26 The appellant filed an affidavit in which he said that he relied upon his solicitor’s advice. His solicitor negotiated the plea on his behalf. The appeal was argued by his counsel, based upon paragraph (b) in Liberti. The following was said on his behalf: (AS: 10) 
     
      
       
        
        “26 … The agreed facts were substantially based on admissions made by the appellant in his ERISP. Detective Senior Constable Moir was of the opinion that these admissions were an accurate account of events and that he did not deflect his involvement in any way (R/S 3). The problem is that the offences charged are not supported by the agreed facts (or the admissions made by him).” 
        
       
      
    27 Each charge must be considered in turn. Count 1 charged aggravated robbery under s 95 of the Crimes Act 1900. The elements are conveniently set out in Howie and Johnson’s Annotated Criminal Legislation NSW in these terms (omitting alternatives, not material): (2008/2009 Ed: p787/8) 
     
      
       
        
        1. The accused with intent 
        
       
       
        
        2. took property 
        
       
       
        
        3. from the victim’s immediate control or presence 
        
       
       
        
        4. by the use of violence, or by putting the victim in fear; and 
        
       
       
        
        5. in circumstances of aggravation which involved the accused immediately before, at the time of or immediately after, the assault: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) intentionally or recklessly inflicting actual bodily harm to any person. 
          
         
        
       
      
    28 Count 1 was put to the sentencing Judge upon the basis of a joint criminal enterprise (T4: 15.3.07). A convenient statement concerning the nature of a joint criminal enterprise (approved in Osland v The Queen [1998] HCA 75; (1998) 197 CLR 316) was made by Hunt CJ at CL in Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545: (at 556/7) 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The law is that, where two or more persons carry out a joint criminal enterprise, each is responsible for the acts of the other or others in carrying out that enterprise. The Crown must establish both the existence of that joint criminal enterprise and the participation in it by the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        2. A joint criminal enterprise exists where two or more persons reach an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between them that they will commit a crime. The understanding or arrangement need not be express, and its existence may be inferred from all the circumstances. It need not have been reached at any time before the crime is committed. The circumstances in which two or more persons are participating together in the commission of a particular crime may themselves establish an unspoken understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement formed between them then and there to commit that crime. 
        
       
       
        
        3. A person participates in that joint criminal enterprise either by committing the agreed crime itself or simply by being present at the time when the crime is committed, and (with knowledge that the crime is to be or is being committed) by intentionally assisting or encouraging another participant in the joint criminal enterprise to commit that crime. The presence of that person at the time when the crime is committed and a readiness to give aid if required is sufficient to amount to an encouragement to the other participant in the joint criminal enterprise to commit the crime. 
        
       
       
        
        4. If the agreed crime is committed by one or other of the participants in that joint criminal enterprise, all of the participants in that enterprise are equally guilty of the crime regardless of the part played by each in its commission.” 
        
       
      
    29 Counsel for the appellant asserted that there was no basis upon which an inference could be drawn that Mr Charlesworth was complicit in a joint criminal enterprise to commit robbery with the infliction of actual bodily harm. According to the appellant, the Crown case at its highest was capable of supporting a charge that he was an accessory after the fact to robbery, in that he shared in the money withdrawn from the victim’s bank account, using the keycard at the ATM. 
     
      
    30 Counsel for the appellant, in submissions, analysed each paragraph of the agreed statement of facts. The agreement, when they left Gorokan, was to “steal something”. It was not an agreement to rob. It was submitted that it was certainly not an agreement to commit a robbery involving actual violence. When the victim was stopped, the appellant remained in the rear of the vehicle. He did nothing, according to his counsel, to assist or encourage Hearn. His failure to stop Hearn did not amount to complicity. Whilst the agreed statement contained general phrases such as “all three offenders then followed the complainant flashing their headlights at him”, the precise role of the appellant was made clear by the additional material which had been tendered. The answers he provided to the police furnished no basis for inferring that he had encouraged Hearn in his further pursuit of the victim (ERISP 140-142; 152-153). 
     
      
    31 It was further argued that the robbery was complete once the wallet with the keycard was taken by Hearn. The wallet was taken when the complainant was stopped the first time, at which time the appellant was still in the back of the car. When the victim was stopped a second time, after the pursuit, the appellant got out of the car (as did Molloy and Hearn) and addressed the victim saying, “Just give him the money and you can go”. The appropriate inference, according to the appellant, was that he was endeavouring to ensure the safety of the victim. It was not, it was submitted, an act intended to encourage or assist Hearn. In any event, no further property was stolen. If there was an offence, it was aiding and abetting an attempted robbery, which had not been charged. 
     
      
    32 Further, there was no evidence that the appellant could have foreseen the possibility of Hearn’s assault upon the victim, when he kicked the victim in the head. His Honour remarked, when sentencing the appellant, that he ran off immediately after because “no doubt he was alarmed” (ROS 2). 
     
      
    33 Nor was there evidence, according to the appellant, that Mr Charlesworth knew anything about the theft of the mobile phone. That occurred much later, when the victim was sexually assaulted by Hearn at a time that the appellant was not present. 
     
      
    34 Finally, a joint criminal enterprise to commit robbery with the infliction of actual bodily harm could not be inferred from the acceptance by the appellant of part of the proceeds when the PIN number was used to gain access to the victim’s bank at the ATM. Such evidence, at its highest, supported a charge of accessory after the fact to robbery. 
     
      
    35 The Crown answered these submissions by drawing attention to the issue. In the context of a plea of guilty, the issue was whether there was evidence capable of supporting the charges. That should not be confused with the question of whether, at a contested hearing, the offence had been proved. There was, according to the Crown, evidence in respect of each element. The robbery, from the viewpoint of the appellant, was not complete until he ran off. Alternatively, if the view were taken that the robbery was complete before the vehicle stopped for a second time, the indictment should have been amended. Whereas it alleged that the actual bodily harm was inflicted “at the time of such robbery”, if the robbery was complete it should have alleged that it was inflicted “after the time of the robbery”. The Crown, in written submissions, said this: (CS p 8) 
     
      
       
        
        “[28] … Whether it was ‘immediately after’ the robbery is a question of fact and degree in the light of all the evidence:  
        R v Attard 
         (unreported CCA 20.4.1993). The actual time between the two incidents is not stated in the agreed facts but the assault which caused the injury occurred after what appears to be a brief car chase and it would have been open to a Jury to conclude that it was ‘immediately after’. The offence would have been effectively the same and no miscarriage of Justice has been occasioned.” 
        
       
      
    36 The appellant, in a written reply, answered that submission in these words: (Reply p 2) 
     
      
       
        
        “2. As to C/s [28], if the appellant had stood trial on the present indictment and the Crown sought to amend the robbery count … so as to plead that the infliction of actual bodily harm occurred ‘immediately after’ the robbery rather than ‘at the time of’ the robbery, this amendment may have been allowed. If it was, this was a matter for the jury to determine. However, whilst it may have been open to a jury to be satisfied that the assault was occasioned immediately after the robbery, this is a matter of fact for the jury to determine. In this case no amendment was sought and the plea was entered to the charge alleging the aggravating circumstance occurred ‘at the time of the robbery’. It cannot be said that there was no miscarriage of justice.” 
        
       
      
    37 The Crown, when dealing with the sharing of money once the keycard had been used at the ATM, asserted that it was material from which an inference could be drawn that all three were part of the joint enterprise which included robbery with violence. 
     
      
    38 Dealing with these submissions, it should be said at once that there was no evidence that the appellant was party to stealing the victim’s mobile phone. On the agreed facts, that appears to have occurred later, after the appellant had run away. However, the theft of the phone was a particular of the indictment. The issue was whether there was evidence that the appellant was party to a robbery that concerned the wallet which included the keycard. 
     
      
    39 The agreed facts described the joint enterprise as the three men setting out for Sydney “to steal something”. Once Hearn had succeeded in stopping the complainant’s vehicle, and had alighted from the vehicle, the appellant believed, according to the statement of facts, that Hearn intended “to steal money from the complainant” (Q/A 143) (supra [11]). The stealing amounted to robbery. If one supposed that the wallet contained cash, and the proceeds had been distributed between the three, one would readily infer that there was a joint enterprise to rob. If there had been no money but a keycard, and the PIN number had been supplied by the victim and was later used, with the proceeds being distributed between the three, again one would readily infer a joint enterprise to rob. In the context of this case and the issue arising on this appeal, one would say that there was evidence to support the charge of robbery. 
     
      
    40 Here, the matter evolved in a different way. The victim had no cash. His wallet contained the keycard. Hearn snatched the wallet and pushed the victim over the guardrail. The victim got to his feet, returned to his car and drove off. Hearn then drove his vehicle (with Molloy sitting beside him and the appellant in the back seat) in pursuit. The victim was stopped for a second time. On this occasion all three got out. The appellant, whatever his precise motivation, made the demand: “Just give him your money and you can go.” (supra [12]). If the victim had handed over money, which had then been distributed between the three, again there would be evidence of a joint criminal enterprise to rob. Had he provided the PIN number for the keycard and all three went to the bank and obtained money, again there would be evidence of a joint criminal enterprise to rob. 
     
      
    41 There was, in my view, one robbery. Hearn, it may be noted, was charged with one count which, in his case, was the more serious robbery in company with wounding. His offence comprehended each phase of the robbery, the stopping of the victim the first time (when his wallet was snatched), pursuing him and stopping him a second time (when the wounding was inflicted) and, later, (in the absence of the appellant) securing by fear the PIN number for his bank account. 
     
      
    42 It would, I believe, be artificial to break up the offence into a series of robberies, or attempted robberies. If someone were stopped in the street and robbed, and then broke away and were chased and caught further down the street, where further demands were made, it would be reasonable in my view to regard that sequence as the one episode, and charge the one offence. In this case, the action of Mr Charlesworth in getting out of the vehicle and, in company, making a demand upon the victim for money, provided a basis for an inference as to his complicity, not only in respect of that demand but in respect of that which had gone before.  
     
      
    43 Here, the offence charged was aggravated robbery. Hence the Crown was obliged to prove that, as an incident of the joint enterprise to rob, Mr Charlesworth foresaw the possibility that actual bodily harm would be intentionally or recklessly inflicted upon the victim. Was there material capable of supporting that inference? I believe there was. Two things came to the notice of Mr Charlesworth concerning Mr Hearn when the victim was stopped on the highway on the first occasion. Both signalled that Hearn was prepared to use violence in pursuit of the primary objective, which was money. It will be remembered that Hearn left the victim standing at the rear of the vehicle whilst he spoke to Molloy and Charlesworth, who were inside the vehicle. He said that he would have to kill the victim. Mr Charlesworth assumed he said that because the victim knew the registration plate of his vehicle. Shortly after, Hearn snatched the wallet and pushed the victim over the guardrail. 
     
      
    44 The statement of facts does not say, in terms, that Mr Charlesworth saw that occur, although one would assume that the vehicle had windows. In the ERISP, the appellant was asked by the police what he saw. His answers were somewhat contradictory. There was, nonetheless, evidence from which it may be inferred that he did see Hearn push the victim over the fence. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q129 Front passenger. Yeah. And what happened then? 
         
        A. … And then he pulled him over, said he was Constable so and so. And then, and I was just sitting there in the car. And then Brett got out but he did, wasn’t doing, he wasn’t in on it. And Mick fuckin’, the next thing I seen he was over the railing, the, the young bloke was over the railing and Mick tackled him and then, and then from there he got, he got back in his own car and, and he drove off and then Mick pulled him over again. And then that’s when, yeah, and then that’s when I said, yeah, ‘cause the car was like that on the highway. 
        
       
      
    45 Later, Mr Charlesworth said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q145 OK. I think you said that at one stage you saw the young kid fall over the rail. Did you see how that happened? 
         
        A. No, no. ‘Cause I was in the back, I didn’t fuckin’, I was just thinking what’s going on, you know. 
        
       
       
        
        Q146 Right. So when that young kid’s fallen down the first time you’re still in the back of the car? 
         
        A. Yeah.” 
        
       
      
    46 There was, in my view, evidence in respect of each element of the first count (aggravated robbery). The plea should not be set aside. The appeal in respect of the conviction on that count should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Were the admitted facts capable of supporting Count 2: Detain for Advantage? 
       
      
    47 Count 2 charged the appellant with aiding and abetting Hearn in the offence of aggravated detention for advantage. The issue is the same as in respect of Count 1, that is, having pleaded guilty, was there material before the sentencing Judge capable of supporting each element of the offence? 
     
      
    48 The offence, broadly, involved two aspects. There must be evidence of the principal offence, as well as evidence that the appellant aided and abetted that offence. Hunt J in Stokes and Difford (1990) 51 A Crim R 25, said this: (at 37)  
     
      
       
        
        “To establish that an accused is an accessory to the commission of a crime by another person (whether or not he is a co-accused) by aiding and abetting him, the Crown must establish: 
        
       
       
        
        (1) the commission of that crime by the principal offender,  
        and 
        
       
       
        
        (2) that  
        the accused was present at the time when the crime was committed 
        ,  
        and 
        
       
       
        
        (3) that (subject to an exception which I discuss later) the  
        accused knew all the essential facts or circumstances 
         which must be established by the Crown in order to show that the crime was committed by the principal offender (whether or not the accused knew that they amounted to a crime),  
        and 
        
       
       
        
        (4) that, with that knowledge, he intentionally assisted or encouraged the principal offender to commit that crime. The accessory’s intention to assist or encourage the principal offender must be based upon that knowledge (emphasis added).” 
        
       
      
    49 His Honour elaborated upon the state of mind required in the case of an aider and abetter, referring to the High Court decision in Giorgianni v Regina (1985) 156 CLR 473. He said: (at [38]) 
     
      
       
        
        “Although some of the older authorities suggest that the accused need be aware of only the physical acts done by the principal offender, it is now clear that he must be aware also of the existence of any state of mind on the part of the principal offender which must be established by the Crown to show that the crime was committed by him.” 
        
       
      
    50 His Honour added: (at [39]) 
     
      
       
        
        “ ... it is strictly with the accessory’s awareness of the principal offender’s intentions for the future that he then encourages and assists him, rather than with his awareness (except in the loosest sense) of the actions done by the principal offender in the past.” 
        
       
      
    51 The offence of aggravated detention by Hearn, in the context of this appeal, involved the following elements: (cf Howie & Johnson (supra) p 748: s 86(2) Crimes Act) 
     
      
       
        
        “1. Hearn detained the victim, JC; 
        
       
       
        
        2. The detention was without the victim’s consent; 
        
       
       
        
        3. Hearn did this with the intention of obtaining an advantage; 
        
       
       
        
        4. Immediately beforehand, the offence of actual bodily harm had been occasioned to the victim.” 
        
       
      
    52 Here, although the appellant had witnessed Hearn kicking the victim in the face (thereby inflicting actual bodily harm), he then ran off. It was submitted by the appellant that the detention of the victim therefore began in his absence. There was no basis, in these circumstances, for suggesting that he had encouraged or assisted Hearn in that detention. He could only be liable once he became aware of Hearn’s detention and rendered assistance. Further, the appellant argued that, since the advantage specified was “steal property”, by the time the appellant became aware of Hearn’s continued detention of the victim, the property had already been stolen. The key card had been used and money withdrawn from the account. The offence was therefore complete. In written submissions, the appellant said this: (AS p10)  
     
      
       
        
        “25 ... The appellant’s assistance was to provide a sheet to conceal the complainant whilst Hearn drove him to a suitable venue to allow him his freedom. His actions are consistent with him being an accessory after the fact to a detention for advantage, rather than an aider and abetter.”  
        
       
      
    53 The Crown, in response, pointed out that the principal offence (detention for advantage) was a continuing offence (Davis v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 392). The detention arguably began when the victim was first stopped on the freeway, at a time that the appellant was present. It continued until his ultimate escape. According to the Crown, it was not necessary for the appellant to be present, aiding and abetting Hearn, for the whole time that the victim was detained. Even if the view were taken that the detention began after the victim had been kicked by Hearn, the appellant later became aware of his detention. He also became aware of the advantage which Hearn sought to derive from that detention. The advantage was specified as “steal property”. The property he intended to steal, according to the Crown, was either the victim’s car (as in fact occurred), or the further withdrawal of money from the victim’s bank account, through the ATM.  
     
      
    54 The appellant, in reply, stated that the Crown’s uncertainty as to the advantage arising through the detention of the victim, demonstrated that the advantage was really “a matter of speculation”. It highlighted the miscarriage of justice occasioned by the plea. The advantage, according to counsel for the appellant, could plainly not have been the car. Hearn returned to the Gorokan property driving the victim’s car. He had taken the vehicle without the owner’s consent. Even if there were uncertainty as to the point at which Hearn formed the intention of permanently depriving the victim of that vehicle, there was no advantage in terms of stealing the car through the continued detention of the victim. Indeed, the victim’s continued presence was, according to the appellant, a hindrance and inconsistent with an intention to permanently deprive the victim of that vehicle. 
     
      
    55 Further, it was said by the appellant that Davis (supra) had no relevance to the facts of this case. There was no question of accessorial liability in that case. 
     
      
    56 A number of issues arise from these submissions. When did the detention of the victim begin? Is it possible, as the Crown suggests, to view the facts as suggesting that his detention began, for the purposes of Count 2, when the vehicle was first stopped by Hearn on the freeway? I do not believe that view is open. The detention began, for the purposes of the indictment, after Hearn kicked the victim in the face. Count 2 charged that Hearn: 
     
      
       
        
        “ ... did, without consent,  
        detain (JC) 
         with the intention of obtaining an advantage, namely to steal property,  
        and immediately beforehand actual bodily harm was occasioned to the said (JC) 
         ...” 
         
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    57 What was the advantage which arose from the victim’s detention? I accept the appellant’s submission that detaining the victim in order to perfect the stealing of his car cannot be regarded as a possibility. Hearn drove the victim’s car from the location on the freeway where he had kicked JC. He returned to the house at Gorokan. He thereafter drove that vehicle throughout the evening. In other words, he had possession. In the course of the evening he addressed a number of questions to the victim, which were answered (whether the car took leaded or unleaded fuel and the location of the petrol tank). However, one would infer that he did so as a matter of convenience, instead of making his own investigation. The continued presence and detention of the victim was, as the appellant suggests, a disadvantage when it came to stealing the motor vehicle. 
     
      
    58 It follows that the only possible advantage from the continued detention of the victim arose from the repeated attempts by Hearn, Molloy and the appellant to obtain further funds from the victim’s bank account using the ATM. I will return to this issue below.  
     
      
    59 Before analysing the agreed statement of facts and the other material before the sentencing Judge, it may be useful to say something about Davis (supra). The accused and the victim in that case had been in a relationship which had ended. The victim thereafter obtained an apprehended violence order. Some months later the accused drove to the victim’s place of employment. As she arrived at work, he physically forced her into his vehicle. He then drove off, constantly reaching into the rear of the vehicle attempting to strike her in order to ensure that she lay on the back seat. He told her that he was taking her to Mt Druitt where she would be raped. He said that there was no-one there to protect her and he could kill her if he wished. He ultimately drove to a lonely track where he attempted to have sex with her. There was a physical altercation, after which he drove to Parramatta and allowed her to leave. 
     
      
    60 Howie J, referring to the English Court of Appeal decision in R v Reid [1973] QB 299; (1972) 2 All ER 1350 and to R v Campbell and Brennan [1981] Qd R 516, said this:  
     
      
       
        
        “64 Neither  
        Reid 
         nor  
        Campbell 
         supports the proposition that a taking ceases to be a taking at the moment that the kidnapper becomes criminally liable for the offence. The offence might at that moment be complete in law, because the taking has been completed for the purposes of proving the offence, but it is not necessarily complete in fact. Once it has been established that a person has been ‘taken’, in the sense that he or she has been compelled to go where he or she did not want to go, the ‘taking’ continues until the compulsion ceases. It does not cease merely because the person has been taken for a certain distance or for a certain time or even because the kidnapper has ceased to physically move the victim and has commenced detaining that person in the one place. In a real sense, the kidnapper is taking the victim, that is causing the victim to accompany him or her, for the entire duration of the time, however long it is, that the victim is, as a result of the kidnapper’s conduct, involuntarily detained in a place that is not the place where the victim was first detained. The taking begins with the detention and asportation of the victim, and only ends when the victim is released or ceases to withhold consent to the detention.” 
        
       
      
    61 Here, as mentioned, the appellant was not present when the victim was first detained. He became aware of the victim’s vehicle upon his return to Gorokan, where he linked up again with Hearn and Molloy. He was not aware, at that stage, that the victim was still inside that vehicle and had been threatened. He only became aware of the detention of the victim after the group had obtained money from the ATM and set out for the local hotel. On that journey they travelled in separate vehicles, Hearn driving the victim’s vehicle. Once they stopped, the appellant heard Hearn threatening a person at the rear of the vehicle. It may be inferred that he immediately realised that Hearn had detained the victim from the time he had taken his vehicle at the freeway. 
     
      
    62 After some time spent in the hotel, the group returned to Gorokan in the two vehicles. Before that return journey, Hearn told the appellant that he needed a blanket. Once at Gorokan the appellant obliged, providing a sheet. The sheet was given to Hearn, who then ordered the victim to cover himself as he lay in the back of the vehicle. All three then got into the victim’s vehicle, with Hearn driving. The agreed statement, it will be remembered, included these words: 
     
      
       
        
         “Charlesworth told police that he did not look at the complainant during any of the journey because he did not want to and ‘blocked’ this from his head (Q/A 501). However he knew he was all covered with the sheet and was lying down in the back of the vehicle. He also told police that he had noticed the state of Hearn’s clothing and noticed blood on Hearn’s ‘T’ shirt.” 
        
       
      
    63 They drove to Canton Beach where Charlesworth watched Hearn take the complainant to an area at the edge of the Tuggerah Lakes. Hearn then returned and the three drove off in search of marijuana. They then returned to the bank and tried once more to use the key card, although without success. The appellant, at this point, decided to leave, walking away from Hearn and Molloy. 
     
      
    64 On these facts there can be no doubt that the appellant provided Hearn with assistance. His assistance extended beyond simply providing the sheet. During the journey to the lake his presence, in company with Hearn and Molloy, assisted Hearn by deterring the victim from offering resistance. When providing that assistance, the appellant was aware that the victim had been detained without his consent after the vehicle had been stopped for the second time on the freeway. He was aware that Hearn had viciously kicked the victim in the face at that location. He had later seen blood on Hearn’s clothing. One would infer that he was aware that actual bodily harm had been inflicted immediately before the detention. 
     
      
    65 Was there evidence capable of establishing that Mr Charlesworth also was aware of Hearn’s state of mind in continuing to detain the victim? I believe there was. The victim had a bank account, which he could access by means of his key card, using his PIN number. Until the group had removed all money from the account, the victim was potentially useful in completing that objective. I infer that the appellant readily appreciated that common sense objective. It was argued that since the appellant was not present for the whole time that Hearn had detained the victim, the second requirement of Hunt J’s description of the offence in Stokes and Difford (supra) had not been satisfied (supra at [47]). It will be remembered that the second requirement was expressed by Hunt J in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “2. That the accused was present at the time when the crime was committed.” 
        
       
      
    66 However, that statement of the principle, I believe, requires refinement. In the context of the continuing offence of detain for advantage (s 86 Crimes Act 1900), it is enough, in my view, if the accused is present during some part of that detention and, knowing of that detention, provided assistance and otherwise satisfied the requirements as set out in the judgment of Hunt J in that case. 
     
      
    67 There was, in my view, evidence in respect of each element of Count 2 (aid and abet aggravated detention for advantage). The plea should not be set aside. It follows that the appeal against conviction in respect of both counts fails and should be dismissed. 
     
      
    68 Let me turn to the application for leave to appeal against sentence, dealing with each ground in turn. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: Parity with Hearn. 
       
      
    69 The major argument on this appeal concerned parity, which assumed the sentences were otherwise appropriate. 
     
      
    70 Hearn was plainly the principal offender. He pleaded guilty to an indictment which may be summarised as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: 
         Robbery in company with wounding (contrary to s 98  
        Crimes Act 
         1900) (maximum penalty 25 years imprisonment with a standard non parole period of 7 years). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: 
         Specially aggravated detention for advantage, the purpose being sexual gratification and stealing the victim’s property. The circumstances of special aggravation were that Hearn was in company with Molloy and Charlesworth and actual bodily harm was occasioned to the victim (contrary to s 86(3) of the Act) (maximum penalty 25 years imprisonment). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3: 
         Aggravated sexual assault (fellatio), the circumstance of aggravation being the infliction of actual bodily harm (contrary to s 61J(1) of the Act) (maximum penalty 20 years imprisonment with a standard non parole period of 10 years). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 4: 
         Aggravated sexual assault (anal intercourse), the circumstance of aggravation being the infliction of actual bodily harm (contrary to s 61J(1) of the Act) (maximum penalty 20 years imprisonment with a standard non parole period of 10 years). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 5:  
        Aggravated sexual assault (fellatio) in circumstances of aggravation being the infliction of actual bodily harm (contrary to s 61J(1) of the Act) (maximum penalty 20 years imprisonment with a standard non parole period of 10 years). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 6:  
        Indecent assault (forcing the victim to lick his anus) (contrary to s 61L of the Act) (maximum penalty 5 years imprisonment). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 7:  
        Malicious destruction by fire of a motor vehicle (contrary to s 195(1)(b) of the Act) (maximum penalty 10 years imprisonment). 
        
       
      
    71 Hearn also pleaded guilty to the following related offences on a s 166 Certificate: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Impersonating a police officer (maximum penalty 6 months imprisonment and/or a fine of $11,000). 
        
       
       
        
        2. Driving whilst disqualified (maximum penalty 2 years imprisonment with an automatic disqualification from driving for 2 years). 
        
       
       
        
        3. Obtain money by deception (3 counts) (maximum penalty 1 year imprisonment). 
        
       
      
    72 Mr Charlesworth, on the other hand, pleaded guilty to two offences, as set out above, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1:  
        Aggravated robbery (contrary to s 95  
        Crimes Act 
         1900) (maximum penalty 20 years imprisonment). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2:  
        Aiding and abetting Hearn in the offence of aggravated detention for advantage (contrary to s 86(2) of the Act) (maximum penalty 20 years imprisonment). 
        
       
      
    73 Counts 1 and 2 in Mr Charlesworth’s indictment, therefore, were the companion offences to Counts 1 and 2 in the Hearn indictment. Hearn, in each case, faced a more serious alternative in respect of each charge (where the maximum penalty in each case is 25 years imprisonment, compared to a 20 year maximum in respect of the charges faced by Mr Charlesworth). Recognising these differences, counsel for Mr Charlesworth sought to compare the sentences imposed upon each offender in order to demonstrate that Mr Charlesworth had a justifiable sense of grievance. The Crown submissions on this appeal included a useful table which enabled such a comparison:

    75 However, these were sentences imposed after allowing discounts to each offender. It will be remembered that the offences were committed on 25 and 26 March 2006. Once the victim reached safety, his ordeal received significant publicity. On 6 April 2006, Mr Charlesworth surrendered himself to the police. He described what had occurred. The police were satisfied that he held nothing back. He identified Hearn and Molloy and agreed to give evidence against each. Mr Charlesworth later pleaded guilty in the Local Court. His Honour allowed a 50 percent discount which was expressed to be for the plea of guilty and assistance (including, inappropriately, 5 percent for remorse) (cf R v MAK; MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; (2006) 167 A Crim R 159 at [44]). 
     
      
    76 Hearn was arrested in the ACT on 13 April 2006. He refused to be interviewed. He was then extradited to New South Wales. He later entered an early plea and was given a 25 percent discount (Hearn ROS: 23). Using these discounts to calculate his Honour’s starting point in each case, the comparison is as follows:

    77 The selection by his Honour of almost the same starting point for each offender ignored, according to counsel for Mr Charlesworth, important differences between them. It gave rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of Mr Charlesworth (Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606; (1984) 12 A Crim R 408; Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295; (1997) 94 A Crim R 397). 
     
      
    78 The Crown, in response, said that the Court should have regard to the end result, rather than any notional starting point (SZ v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 19; (2007) 164 A Crim R 249 at 257, approved in MacDonald v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 105 at [46]). The greater criminality of Hearn, according to the Crown, was recognised in the longer sentences imposed upon him. The real question was whether this Court could be satisfied that a less severe sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed (s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912).  
     
      
    79 I accept that for each offence the starting point in sentencing Hearn should have been significantly greater than in the case of Mr Charlesworth. First Hearn, as mentioned, faced a more serious alternative to the same offence on each count with a higher maximum penalty (25 years as opposed to 20 years). The robbery offence against Hearn included a standard non parole of 7 years.  
     
      
    80 Secondly, there were obvious differences between the role which each played in the commission of each offence. Hearn led at every stage. It was Hearn who threatened the victim and later viciously assaulted him, inflicting significant injuries including a fracture of the cheek bone. The appellant was largely passive. He got out of the vehicle (as did Molloy) when the victim was stopped a second time and then addressed certain remarks to him. The words he used may suggest that he had mixed motives. He told the victim to pay and that he would then be allowed to go. One may infer that Mr Charlesworth recognised Hearn’s potential for violence and saw payment as in the victim’s interest as well as his own. The difference between the position of Hearn and that of Mr Charlesworth was even more stark in the context of the detention offences, as the indictment recognised. Hearn was the principal offender. Mr Charlesworth had a supporting role. He was not aware of the victim’s presence, nor the demands that had been made upon him, until towards the end. 
     
      
    81 Thirdly, there were also striking differences in the subjective cases of each offender, again favouring the appellant. The appellant had never been to gaol. He had a criminal record which his Honour described as “not of a serious nature” (ROS: 9). He had been convicted of offensive behaviour and fined. In February 2003, he was fined for possessing equipment for administering prohibited drugs, possessing such drugs and self administering them. His Honour said this: (Charlesworth ROS: 9) 
     
      
       
        
        “... I am of the view that his antecedents will not materially effect the sentence to be imposed, other than perhaps to confirm that he has an addiction to illicit drugs.” 
        
       
      
    82 Hearn, in contrast, had a criminal record which his Honour described as “extensive”. He had been convicted of offences involving dishonesty and violence in New South Wales, the ACT and Queensland. On a number of occasions he had served terms of imprisonment. His Honour said this: (Hearn ROS: 16/17) 
     
      
       
        
        “The current offences represent a marked escalation in his criminal behaviour. His record is such that it does disentitle him to leniency. It also illustrates that the current offences are not an uncharacteristic aberration, but represent a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law.” 
        
       
      
    83 Hearn had no remorse. There was nothing to mitigate his offences except his plea of guilty (Hearn ROS: 22). Mr Charlesworth, in contrast, showed remorse from the moment he handed himself to the police. His Honour accepted that his remorse was genuine (Charlesworth ROS: 3). He also accepted that Mr Charlesworth was alarmed by the level of violence displayed by Hearn towards the victim, and that was the reason he ran off (Charlesworth ROS: 10). His Honour further accepted that Mr Charlesworth was unlikely to reoffend (Charlesworth ROS: 10). Because of the assistance provided to the Crown, Mr Charlesworth was in protection and was subject to a number of restrictions. 
     
      
    84 The use by his Honour, in these circumstances, of approximately the same starting point when fixing each sentence was erroneous. I believe this Court should intervene. It is unnecessary to deal with Ground 3, manifest excess. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: Parity with Molloy. 
       
      
    85 In view of the conclusion reached on Ground 1, it is unnecessary to consider Ground 2 at length. However, it is instructive, in view of the issues that remain, to look at sentences imposed upon Molloy and the remarks on sentence. It will be remembered that Mr Charlesworth was the first to go to the police (6.4.2006), almost two weeks after the offences had been committed. Hearn was arrested on 13 April 2006. On 16 April 2006, Molloy presented himself to a police station. He agreed to be interviewed and to provide assistance if required. He was committed for trial on 19 October 2006 in respect of the charges of “specially aggravated kidnapping, aggravated robbery and malicious damage, being the destruction of the motor vehicle” (Molloy ROS: 11). The trial was set down for 7 May 2007. One infers that there were discussions before the trial between the prosecution and counsel for Molloy, culminating in a fresh indictment and pleas of guilty to two charges. The two charges may be summarised as follows: (cf Molloy ROS: 1) 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1:  
        Accessory after the fact to Hearn detaining the victim for advantage (contrary to s 86(1)(b) and s 350  
        Crimes Act 
         1900) (maximum penalty 5 years imprisonment). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2:  
        Aid and abet Hearn and Charlesworth (in company) to detain the victim for advantage (contrary to s 86(2)(a) and s 345  
        Crimes Act 
         1900) (maximum penalty 20 years imprisonment). 
        
       
      
    86 Molloy also asked the sentencing Judge, O’Connor DCJ, to take account of the offence of malicious damage to property (being the destruction of the car by fire) when sentencing on Count 2. That offence (under s 195(1)(b) Crimes Act) carried a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    87 The agreement reached between the Crown and counsel for Molloy was, in some respects, odd. The Crown, perhaps understandably, may have had misgivings concerning its ability to prove a joint enterprise which included Molloy in respect of the aggravated robbery. He had been present as part of the group, but unlike the appellant, had not addressed a demand to the victim. It is not entirely clear from the remarks on sentence what conduct was comprehended by Count 1 (accessory after the fact to Hearn detaining for advantage). Presumably it was Molloy’s obedience to Hearn’s direction to “follow” once Hearn took the wheel of the victim’s car, forcing the victim into the passenger’s seat. Molloy drove Hearn’s car and ultimately returned to Gorokan. However, that conduct might equally have been dealt with under Count 2, aiding and abetting Hearn in detaining the victim for advantage. Molloy certainly knew the victim was still in the car, and later witnessed the first sexual assault by Hearn upon the victim (Molloy ROS: 4/5). 
     
      
    88 The Crown, in written submissions, again produced a table which provided guidance as to the charges against each offender and the sentences imposed.

    89 The end result was that Mr Charlesworth was sentenced to a term of 7 years overall, with a non parole period of 5 years. Mr Molloy was sentenced to 8 years overall, with the same (5 year) non parole period. Each had the benefit of a finding of special circumstances. However, the reduction in the statutory ratio was significantly less in the case of Mr Charlesworth (71 percent) than in the case of Mr Molloy (62.5 percent). 
     
      
    90 The sentences in each case were derived after allowing a discount for pleading guilty and a further discount for assistance. The discounts varied and were as follows: 
     
     Charlesworth – 50% 
     
     
     Molloy – 35% 
    91 Applying these discounts, the starting point in each case in respect of the count they had in common (Count 2: aiding and abetting detention) was as follows: 
     
     Charlesworth – 10 years 
     
     
     Molloy – 12 years 
    92 The sentencing Judge considered parity between Messrs Molloy and Charlesworth. He saw Mr Charlesworth as the least culpable and Hearn, naturally, as the most culpable. Molloy therefore was in the middle. That was a common sense assessment on the facts overall, rather than an assessment based upon the different charges which each faced. 
     
      
    93 Because of the significant differences in the indictments presented against each offender, comparison between the two is difficult. Count 1 in the Molloy indictment was a much less serious charge than the aggravated robbery charge to which Mr Charlesworth pleaded guilty. Even a comparison between the charge they had in common is difficult because of the Form 1 offence which his Honour was obliged to take into account when sentencing Molloy. The destruction of the vehicle by fire in order to destroy evidence of their involvement in these crimes was a significant matter.  
     
      
      Resentence. 
       
      
    94 An affidavit of Mr Charlesworth was tendered, which is relevant to resentencing. It provides insight into his progress since his incarceration. He has used his time well. He works fulltime in textiles and has undertaken various courses. His affidavit included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “7. I attend AA every Tuesday which has given me some insight into my abuse of drugs and alcohol. I will never use drugs again. It was crazy. I can’t believe that at the age 32 years old I started using needles. It was very stupid.” 
        
       
      
    95 I adopt the sentencing Judge’s discount of 50 percent for the early plea and for the assistance provided. I also adopt his Honour’s findings that Mr Charlesworth has good prospects of rehabilitation and that there are special circumstances. 
     
      
       
      Orders. 
       
      
    96 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. The appeal against conviction dismissed. 
       
       
      2. The application for leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
       
      3. The appeal allowed. 
       
       
      4. The sentences imposed upon the applicant by O’Connor DCJ on 4 May 2007 are quashed and, in lieu thereof, the applicant is sentenced as follows: 
       
       
        
        Count 1: 
         To a non parole period of 2 years commencing on 6 April 2006 and expiring on 5 April 2008, with a balance of term of 2 years commencing on 6 April 2008 and expiring on 5 April 2010. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2:  
        To a non parole period of 2 years commencing on 6 April 2007 and expiring on 5 April 2009, with a balance of term of 2 years commencing on 6 April 2009 and expiring on 5 April 2011. 
        
       
       
       The first date that the applicant will be eligible for parole is 6 April 2009.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was indicted on 2 counts. The first count alleged that on 18 November 2005 at Mullumbimby he did wound Daniel Murray with intent to murder him. The second count was that on the same day he maliciously wounded Daniel Murray with intent to do grievous bodily harm to him. By consent of the parties the trial proceeded before Black DCJ without a jury. 
     
      
    2 The appellant was acquitted of the charge of wounding with intent to murder but convicted of the malicious wounding charge. He appeals from that conviction. 
     
      
    3 The issues at the trial were confined. Because the appellant had been drinking, excessively, on the night of the offence his counsel submitted that by reason of his intoxication the Crown could not prove that he had the required capacity to carry out either offence. The trial judge found that the appellant had the relevant capacity. There were then issues as to whether or not the appellant had the necessary intent to carry out either offence. The trial judge found that the Crown could not prove that the appellant had an intention to murder but was persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that he maliciously wounded Daniel Murray with intent to do grievous bodily harm to him. 
     
      
    4 The issues on the appeal were confined. The finding that the appellant had the relevant capacity was not challenged. However, it was submitted that his Honour’s findings in relation to intention were in conflict and, having been acquitted of the attempted murder count, his Honour should have returned a verdict of not guilty in relation to the malicious wounding count. It was further submitted that having regard to the relevant facts a guilty verdict on the second count was not open. 
     
      
       
      Relevant facts 
       
      
    5 The appellant operated a travelling entertainment business and on 18 November had spent the day setting up rides for the show at Bangalow. Mr Murray was an employee of the appellant and had worked with him for some months. During the course of the day on 18 November 2005 the appellant consumed significant quantities of alcohol and at the end of the day asked the victim to drive him back to Mullumbimby where they were staying. Mr Murray was sharing with another person a caravan provided for them by the appellant. 
     
      
    6 After they arrived at Mullumbimby Mr Murray consumed some alcohol and retired early to bed. The appellant continued drinking. Mr Murray went to sleep and was awakened sometime between 2 and 3 in the morning by the appellant who had forced his way through the door of the caravan. The appellant asked where the light switch was and Mr Murray said it was near the door. Mr Murray thought the appellant had come in for a cigarette but the appellant said that was not what he wanted. Mr Murray said the appellant climbed onto the bed, kneeled over him and with his legs either side of him put his right hand on Mr Murray’s forehead. He then grabbed the knife and cut Mr Murray’s throat. The appellant then said: “You’re an unfortunate soul and you must die.” After saying this the appellant again cut Mr Murray’s throat. 
     
      
    7 Soon after the appellant’s partner, Kim, came in and asked the appellant what he was doing. The appellant apparently said he was cutting Mr Murray’s throat. Kim asked for the knife which the appellant gave to her. Kim then left the caravan and organised for Mr Murray to be taken to hospital where he was treated and later discharged. 
     
      
    8 The evidence was that after the appellant had cut Mr Murray’s throat he continued to sit there saying that he would remain until Mr Murray died. There was no apparent motive for the killing although the appellant told a psychiatrist, who subsequently diagnosed the appellant with serious depression, that he had committed the crime with the intention that he would be sentenced to imprisonment where he would be relieved of his personal difficulties.  
     
      
    9 The evidence made plain that the appellant was drunk on the night in question. However, Mr Murray gave evidence that he was not unsteady on his feet. The trial judge also found that he was able to position himself on top of Mr Murray, take a knife and deliberately cut his throat on two occasions. The knife used by the appellant was a “Leatherman”, a sophisticated form of pocket knife. Although the evidence did not directly support this finding, his Honour concluded that in order to use the knife the appellant must have opened it to reveal the blade. His Honour was satisfied that the appellant’s actions were conscious and deliberate and that he appreciated that by applying the knife to Mr Murray’s throat he was doing so with sufficient force as to be likely to cause serious bodily harm. Accordingly his Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “So, having reviewed all that evidence, I am satisfied that the Crown have negatived the assertion on behalf of the defence that the alcohol consumption of the accused was such as to prevent him from being able to form any specific intent, and it falls upon me now to return to the indictment to consider the necessary elements.” 
        
       
      
    10 Although the Crown submitted that the appellant’s acts were deliberate and that the trial judge should conclude that he had the intention to murder from the expression by Mr Murray of the words “You’re going to die” and “I’ll sit here while you die” his Honour was not satisfied that the Crown had established to the relevant standard that the appellant intended to kill Mr Murray. His Honour said:  
     
      
       
        
        “… cutting anybody across the throat with a knife sharp enough to be capable of inflicting those injuries, is a very serious and worrying act, but applying the burden of proof, I was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has established there was an intent to murder, so as far as count 1 is concerned, I find the accused not guilty.” 
        
       
      
    11 With respect to the second count his Honour was satisfied that the wounding was unlawful. His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “To cut somebody’s throat with a knife, having opened it, and then referring to the possible consequences, which I accept were said, namely that death might result, clearly indicates, in my view, a realisation that grievous bodily harm had resulted is hardly surprising, and it shows, in my view, to enable me to express the opinion that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time the accused wounded Daniel Murray, he did intend to do grievous bodily harm to him, and insofar as it is necessary to ascribe any motive, I think the state of his anger and frustration at his own situation and predicament, partly caused by other circumstances, partly caused by his own activities in relation to gambling and drink, led him to a frame of mind where he was going to vent it on somebody, and Mr Murray was the unfortunate person to receive it. So while there was a lack of specificity about the victim, there was no lack of specific intent as to what he was going to do, and the fact that that may have been an irrational action is perhaps accounted for by the alcohol, but that was not such as to negative the ability to form any specific intent. In the light of all that, I find the accused guilty on count 2 of this indictment.” 
        
       
      
    12 The conclusion which his Honour formed in relation to count 2 was open. In my judgment a finding of intention to inflict grievous bodily harm was not inconsistent with a finding that the appellant did not have an intent to kill. Although his Honour’s reasons were criticised, because there was no evidence that he had actually opened the knife to release the blade, I am not persuaded that this significantly impacts upon the conclusion which his Honour expressed. As the knife was a “Leatherman” the blade would have to have been released at some point for the appellant to have been able to inflict the wounds which he did on Mr Murray’s throat. However, beyond that the fact that the appellant found his way to Mr Murray’s caravan, forced the door, positioned himself on top of him and then used the knife, not once but twice, to inflict cuts to the throat supports a finding that he had an intent to injure Mr Murray. This finding is further supported by the fact that when his wife, Kim, came to the caravan and asked for the knife the appellant gave it to her in a voluntary act. Although undoubtedly the appellant was significantly affected by alcohol a finding that he nevertheless could form the relevant intent and had formed the relevant intent was open to his Honour and was correct. Having reviewed for myself the whole of the record of the trial I am satisfied that the appellant was rightly convicted. 
     
      
    13 In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.

      Introduction 
       
       
      On 31 March 2004 the applicant was convicted in the District Court of two counts of aggravated sexual assault under s 61J of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 committed upon the same victim in the course of one episode on 26 April 2002. The maximum penalty is twenty years’ imprisonment. In respect of the first charge, in which the aggravation was threatening the victim with a knife, the applicant was sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of six years. In respect of the second charge, where the aggravation comprised assaulting the victim and occasioning actual bodily harm to her, he was sentenced to seven years with a non-parole period of five years. The latter sentence commenced eighteen months after the commencement of the former and thus the effective sentence was one of eight years and six months’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of six years and six months. The applicant had been on bail until the date of his conviction, which was specified as the commencement date of his imprisonment.  
       
      
    4 The applicant filed a notice of intention to apply for leave to appeal against his sentence on 2 July 2004. The Registrar of the Court granted a number of extensions for filing the application, the last of which expired on 15 March 2006. Ultimately, the application was filed on 12 August 2008, years out of time. It was necessary, therefore, that the applicant seek the leave of the Court to proceed. The applicant’s solicitor has provided an affidavit explaining why the delay occurred. It is sufficient to say that, although this matter was regrettably conducted with a substantial degree of inefficiency, the applicant was not, as I see the case, responsible for this. Accordingly, I would grant an extension of time sufficient to permit the application for leave to appeal to proceed. 
     
      
    5 The applicant also seeks to tender fresh evidence which, it is contended, is relevant to the proper assessment of the appropriateness of his sentence and, if admitted, should lead to its reduction. The Crown opposes the reception of this material.  
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    6 The following summary is taken from the reasons for sentence and, for the purposes of this appeal at least, is not disputed in any significant respect by the applicant although some matters are contended to have greater importance than was ascribed to them by the learned sentencing judge. As I have said, both offences were committed in the course of a single episode that occurred on 26 April 2002. The applicant and the victim had met in a public area in Redfern where they began talking and drinking together. The victim accepted the applicant’s invitation to go to the boarding house where he was then living to continue drinking. On the way, they stopped to buy some beer. After drinking the beer and smoking some cannabis, they began to engage in consensual sexual conduct although the applicant had difficulty in obtaining an erection. He then began to hit the victim around her head, turned her over and attempted anal intercourse. She screamed out and said, “Don’t”, whereupon he produced a knife and, holding it to her throat threatened to cut her. He still could not manage an erection, however, and turned her over once more forcing her to take his penis into her mouth. After this, the applicant punched and head-butted the victim’s face. For some time after the assault, the applicant did not did not allow the victim to leave the room without him, although later, on the pretext of her need to go to the bathroom, she obtained his permission to leave and then managed to attract the attention of another resident in the boarding house. With his help, she was able to leave and immediately rang the police. 
     
      
       
      The applicant’s case on sentence 
        
       
      
    7 The victim’s evidence in the trial was that the applicant had punched her many times to the face. The applicant’s case both to the jury and on sentence was that the photographs taken by police showed merely a swollen cheek and eye and, therefore, that the victim had greatly exaggerated the extent of the violence. The same point was submitted here (though rather by passing comment) by Mr Ramage QC on the applicant’s behalf. 
     
      
    8 Amongst other explanations for his conduct, the applicant claimed that at the time of the offences he was intoxicated by alcohol and cannabis combined with the ingestion of a prescribed drug, Rivotril, which he was taking for sleeplessness. The matters were discussed in a report from a psychologist, Mr Smith, which was tendered on sentence. That report noted the applicant as having told Mr Smith –  
     
      
       
        
        “At the trial I was found guilty of forced oral sex and putting my finger in her anus. Both of these things happened but nothing was forced. It was the effect of the Rivotril. I didn’t mean anything to happen to her. I snapped when I could not perform and she said something to me.” 
        
       
       
      Summarising the position, Mr Smith said –  
       
       
        
        “The offender after saying that he was deeply remorseful for what he did that night and how much he regretted what had happened said: 
         
          
           
          ‘I had no intention to harm her or do anything she did not want to do. I take the blame.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        He then went on to blame the effect on the Rivotril and said that he had been told that its effect was that a person could just snap for no reason. “ 
        
       
      
    9 Also tendered on sentence was a pre-sentence report containing the usual information (to which I will later refer) but also the following passages, cited in the sentencing judge’s reasons –  
     
      
       
        
        “He also indicated that he believes that he hit the victim, although not as often as she had claimed, for calling him names. He denies his sexual offending behaviour.” 
        
       
       
        
        [The author went on:] “Given what appears to be an at least partial denial, the concept of regret would not seem to be relevant and was only discussed minimally.” 
        
       
      
    10 The sentencing judge, having cited the passages I have quoted from Mr Smith’s report, noted that counsel for the applicant had relied a great deal on the expression of remorse which it contained as showing that he accepted responsibility for his offence but concluded that “it is so heavily qualified by blame-shifting and self-justification when read in context with the balance of the report that it is, in my mind, but a feigned expression of remorse”. Dealing with the alleged exaggeration of the victim of the number of blows inflicted by the applicant, her Honour observed that in none of the material tendered on sentence did the applicant acknowledge the use of the knife as an element of the first sexual assault.  
     
      
       
      The fresh evidence  
       
      
    11 Tendered on the appeal was an affidavit by the applicant describing his treatment by a Dr Singh, general practitioner, for ongoing depression, insomnia and drug and alcohol abuse. This affidavit contains much that was, in substance, before the sentencing judge. It contains the additional information that Dr Singh had prescribed Rivotril but that, after about a month, the applicant had started to increase his ingestion of that medication without informing Dr Singh that he was doing so and without his advice. The affidavit gives details about the effects of taking Rivotril on the day of the offence, claiming that he felt he was becoming drowsy and confused. He claimed that he was “extremely affected by the combination of drugs and alcohol…[and accordingly had] a limited memory of the evening…but I do remember feeling like my behaviour changed suddenly and for no reason”. The applicant claimed that he had provided this information to his solicitors and requested that an expert’s report be obtained. The date of these instructions is not stated but, as I read the affidavit, it seems to have occurred well after the applicant was sentenced and were given in the context of the proposed appeal. Other matters are referred to in the affidavit which do not call for comment.  
     
      
    12 The fresh evidence relied on is a report of Professor Starmer. This report deals generally with the effect of alcohol, cannabis and Rivotril. In particular, following a detailed discussion of the effect of Rivotril the report states –  
     
      
       
        
        “7.9 Unforeseeable reactions  
        may occur 
         when alcohol and clonazepam [i.e. Rivotril] are taken together. On  
        rare occasions 
        , when clonazepam has been taken with alcohol or other central nervous system-active drugs, the individual has manifested unusual or disturbed behaviour of which he/she has no later recollection. The spectrum of reported effects includes hallucinations, acute excitation, confusion, agitation, unusual dreams and sleep disturbances…  
        
       
       
        
        7.10  
        Occasionally 
         benzodiazepines produce paradoxical stimulant effects and can provoke aggressive and hyperactive behaviour and exacerbate seizures in epileptics. Outbursts of rage and violent behaviour have also been reported after clonazepam, especially in anxious patients. These paradoxical effects have been attributed to dis-inhibition of behaviour which is normally suppressed by social restraints, fear or anxiety …” [Italics added.] 
        
       
      
    13 Professor Starmer’s conclusion was that the “exact interactive consequences of his drug-taking” could not be predicted but that “the spectrum does include a possible paradoxical reaction to benzodiazepines [including Rivotril]” [italics added]. 
     
      
    14 The Crown tendered a report by Dr Judith Perl, a pharmacologist from the Clinical Forensic Medicine Unit of the NSW Police Force which, in substance, did not dispute the opinion of Professor Starmer but pointed out that the most likely effect of the high dose of Rivotril claimed by the applicant to have been ingested on the day in question “would have been to produce significant sedation”.  
     
      
    15 It was submitted by Mr Ramage QC that Professor Starmer’s evidence – not sought to be controverted by Dr Perl – significantly supported his case that the violence inflicted on the applicant occurred when he had “snapped” and that this was caused or significantly contributed to by the unforeseen consequences of Rivotril ingestion. Since this is a matter which is relied on by the applicant in mitigation of the gravity of his offence, it was a matter which it was necessary to be proved on the balance of probabilities. The mere proof of a possibility, for obvious reasons, does not suffice. At the same time, it seems to me that the sentencing judge accepted that the applicant had “snapped”. Even had the report of Professor Starmer been adduced before her, I do not think it could have provided an adequate evidentiary basis for concluding that this was, or probably was, the result of his having taken Rivotril. Moreover, this “snapping” was proffered as an explanation for the assaults occasioning actual bodily harm but not in mitigation of the production of the knife.  
     
      
    16 In my view, the evidence sought to be relied on is of such little cogency, having regard to the issues on sentence, that it ought not to be received and I would reject it. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    17 The applicant was thirty-one years of age when he committed the offences. Leaving aside a number of convictions for driving offences, in 1990 he was convicted of assault and placed on a recognizance for twelve months. He was also convicted of indecent assault but the resulting prison sentence was reduced on appeal to a good behaviour bond for three years, in respect of which he was required to subject himself to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. He told Mr Smith that this offence was committed when he was drunk in the course of being given a lift home by a female friend. He said he grabbed her breasts and then took her handbag following a heated argument, this latter act resulting in a stealing charge. He later committed further offences and was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment for breaching the bond. In 2001, the applicant was convicted of breaching an apprehended violence order and sentenced to three months’ imprisonment, suspended on his entering into a good behaviour bond for three months. In May 2003, he was convicted of breaching an apprehended violence order, apparently in February of that year and again in May of the same offence with a further three months’ suspended sentence imposed. These offences were explained by the applicant to Mr Smith. The applicant said that, whilst the mother of his girlfriend was dying he felt that his girlfriend was not paying him sufficient attention and so, one night after he had been drinking, he had an argument with her and kicked in her mother’s screen door. Each of the mother and girlfriend took out an apprehended violence order which he confessed to breaching five times, culminating in July 2001, when he broke into the mother’s house when she was not there and waited for her to come home. For this breach he was given a nine-month sentence, which was suspended. As it happened, that sentence expired at midnight on 26 April 2002, the day of the present offences. It was therefore not regarded by the sentencing judge as having been in operation at that time.  
     
      
    18 The learned sentencing judge observed in relation to these matters –  
     
      
       
        
        “The offender appears…to have little respect for the law as evidenced by his serial breaches of the apprehended violence orders obtained by his ex-girlfriend and her mother.”  
        
       
       
      The applicant complains that, in fact, his girlfriend’s mother had not obtained an AVO against him. However, Mr Smith’s report recounts his stating –  
       
       
        
        “One night I lost it; I had a beer to drink and we had an argument and I kicked her mother’s screen door…they got an AVO…then I broke it five times because she wanted time out and I was afraid I would lose her so I would go to her work or to her home … “ 
        
       
       
      There is nothing in this complaint and this would be so even if the sentencing judge erred as submitted.  
       
      
    19 The applicant also complains that a statutory application made by the applicant’s then girlfriend in March 2003 stating that she did not want to pursue the breaches of the orders because she was suffering from pre-menstrual syndrome at the time and, accordingly, had acted irrationally, was not tendered before the sentencing judge. Since the gravamen of the judge’s remarks was not directed to the reasons for the orders but the fact that they were repeatedly disobeyed, this material was irrelevant.  
     
      
    20 I have referred to the sentencing judge’s scepticism of the extent and genuineness of the applicant’s remorse. In his affidavit the applicant said that he had prepared a letter of apology for the purpose of his sentencing hearing which he showed to his barrister, Mr Wetmore. The applicant complains that Mr Wetmore did not use it in his submissions or tender it. This letter has not been produced and, in his affidavit dealing with other aspects of the proceedings (read by the Crown on the appeal), Mr Wetmore does not advert to it. However, use of such material is very much a matter of judgment. Often the terms of the letter do not assist an offender. The report of the psychologist referred to the remorse expressed by the applicant. The failure to use the letter does not suggest that the proceedings in any way went awry. I do not regard this complaint as significant.  
     
      
    21 So far as the applicant’s personal history is concerned, it is sufficient to summarise the sentencing judge’s remarks in this regard. Her Honour noted that the applicant was born in Australia of parents who emigrated from Turkey, that he reported having a good relationship with his mother and sister although it seemed that his father abused alcohol and was violent towards the applicant and his mother, obliging his mother to take out an apprehended violence order which his father frequently breached. The applicant was educated to year 10 at school and, having obtained his school certificate, worked in telecommunications, completing various certificates and further education courses associated with that work. He had worked as a sub-contractor in cable television installation. The applicant commenced smoking cannabis in his early teens and began to drink at about fifteen. At nineteen, he started using amphetamines and, as I have already mentioned, claimed that at the time of the commission of the offences he had been drinking, smoked large amounts of cannabis and taken Rivotril. Her Honour summarised Mr Smith’s opinion that the applicant had demonstrated features of a dependent personality when his girlfriend wanted to suspend their relationship while her mother was dying and increased his cannabis and alcohol consumption at this time. Mr Smith assessed the applicant as having high levels of personal skills for work and social life despite this emotional dependence. She noted Mr Smith’s view that the applicant needed counselling for what Mr Smith described as “depressiveness”. Her Honour referred to Mr Smith’s view that the applicant had the “insights to live a positive and productive lifestyle”. 
     
      
    22 It seems to me that the sentencing judge dealt with the subjective material adequately in the circumstances, although Mr Ramage submitted that her Honour’s scepticism about the extent of the applicant’s remorse was unjustified. In my view Her Honour’s opinion was entirely reasonable. 
     
      
       
      Other complaints 
       
      
    23 Mr Ramage QC submitted that the sentencing judge failed to take into account the physical and mental condition of the applicant as demonstrated by his claimed intoxication. It was submitted that this is a case in which that intoxication should mitigate the offence because the applicant was induced thereby to act out of character. In light of the applicant’s previous history, there is no basis for the submission that he acted out of character and, indeed, the gravamen of the very detailed report by Mr Smith is contrary to the contention. Her Honour noted the intoxication, as I have already mentioned, but as it could not, in the circumstances, be a significant mitigating factor, it seems to me that no more was required. There is no basis for thinking, at all events, that the sentencing judge did not consider the possible significance of intoxication on the question of culpability.  
     
      
    24 In written submissions it was contended that the sentencing judge erred in her estimation of the criminality involved. This argument was advanced by reference to strong remarks made by her Honour during submissions by Mr Wetmore on sentence. Her Honour’s remarks were in my view an apt response to counsel’s submission, which sought to minimise the criminality of the sexual assaults by contending that because they were not of themselves associated with physical injury, the offences were less serious.  
     
      
       
      Manifest excess 
       
      
    25 Overall, Mr Ramage QC submitted that the sentence imposed was unduly harsh, relying generally on the matters which I have already discussed together with statistics prepared by the Judicial Commission. Mr Ramage concedes that the total sentence was within the range demonstrated in these statistics but submits that, taking into account all the circumstances, the overall head sentence and non-parole period was too severe. I do not accept this submission. In my view, the conclusions drawn by the sentencing judge as to the particular relevant sentencing considerations were correct and that, overall, her Honour’s conclusion as to the appropriate sentences to impose was well within her discretion.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    26 I propose that leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant pleaded guilty to one count that contrary to s 23(2)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 she: 
     
      
       
        
        “On 11 January 2007, at Fairfield in the State of New South Wales did cultivate a number of prohibited plants, to wit, 189 cannabis plants, which was not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited plant.” 
        
       
      
    2 The maximum penalty for the offence is fifteen years imprisonment. The applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 months with a further term of two years. 
     
      
    3 The offence was detected when police executed a search warrant at domestic premises owned by the applicant. Inside the premises the police found cannabis plants of various size together with fans, transformers, air filters and heat lamps used for the cultivation of the plants. Electrical wiring including transformers was provided to the premises. In the laundry of the house the police located a garbage bag containing 3.415 grams of cannabis. 
     
      
    4 When interviewed the applicant admitted that she owned the premises. She ultimately said that she had lived there with her 12 year old daughter for the past two years but had vacated the premises in May or June 2006 and rented them to a woman. She was unable to provide any details of this person to the police. She said that when she returned to the premises on an occasion in mid 2006 she saw the plants in the house and she watered them. Initially she told the police she was not aware that they were cannabis plants however she later told the police that she knew they were cannabis and had kept them because she was in debt. 
     
      
    5 The applicant admitted that she had watered the plants, used chemicals on the plants and obtained smaller cannabis plant cuttings from larger cannabis plants. She told the police that the soil which was found in the house was for the purpose of the plants. When asked what she had intended to do with the plants she said she did not know. However, she also said that she was in debt and that she would get a lot of money if she “did it.” The street value of the plants found by the police was estimated to be $378,000. 
     
      
    6 The applicant maintained that she was not the owner of the plants but rather was to be paid money for their maintenance. The sentencing judge was sceptical of this story particularly having regard to the fact that no details of the woman said to be the original owner of the plants could be provided by the applicant. 
     
      
    7 The applicant was born in Vietnam in 1964. She was 44 years old at the time of sentencing. She fled Vietnam in 1988 and came to Australia in 1990 with her partner and their two young children. The family lived in Canberra for about five years after their arrival and then came to Sydney. Because of her partner’s abusive behaviour and gambling they separated in 1993. Her former partner continued to provide financial support until the middle of 2006 when he returned to Vietnam, married another woman, and withdrew any further financial provision. 
     
      
    8 The applicant’s father lived in Vietnam. He died in 2006 which it would seem had a significant impact upon the applicant. The applicant owned the house where the offence was committed. However, the property has since been sold and before sentencing the applicant was living with one of her children who is still at school in a friend’s premises. 
     
      
    9 The applicant pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and accordingly the sentencing judge allowed her a discount of 25% to reflect the utility of the plea. His Honour concluded that the applicant was engaged in a substantial illegal commercial venture and that her criminality fell a little below the middle range of offences provided by the statute. The sentencing judge considered the circumstances of the applicant’s dependent child and was conscious of the hardship which may be occasioned to her if the applicant was sentenced to a period of full time custody. However, his Honour did not conclude that those difficulties were such as to justify a sentence which did not involve a prison term. 
     
      
    10 The applicant originally filed three grounds of appeal. However, the first ground was abandoned at the hearing. The applicant pressed an argument that the judge erred by finding that there was no alternative to full time custody and that otherwise the sentence was manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    11 The offence committed by the applicant was serious. The applicant was involved in using her property to a very substantial extent to grow cannabis which was obviously for the purpose of sale. She was not herself a user and sought to exploit the facilities for commercial gain. At the time of her arrest she had cultivated 189 cannabis plants. If she had been discovered with in excess of 200 plants she would have been convicted of the greater offence of cultivating a large commercial quantity of plants which carries an increased gaol term. 
     
      
    12 This Court has on more than one occasion emphasised that persons who are found guilty of cultivating cannabis plants as part of a commercial endeavour can, in the ordinary course expect a custodial sentence. The relevant principles were discussed by Spigelman CJ in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209. In R v Puke (unreported, NSWCCA 19 September 1997) Smart J said that those involved in the hydroponic cultivation of cannabis for profit must expect to receive full time custodial sentences. There is a similar statement by Hope JA in R v Tedesco (1982) 7 A Crim R 430.  
     
      
    13 It was submitted to this Court that the applicant was a “mere crop sitter.” In my judgment that submission must be rejected. The inevitable conclusion from the available evidence is that even if she did not initiate the enterprise she took it over and maintained the activity for the purpose of selling marijuana for profit.  
     
      
    14 I accept that the applicant has had a difficult life. It will never be easy for someone of limited education who by force of circumstances becomes a refugee and is required to settle in another country. When that person’s circumstances are further exacerbated by difficulties in her domestic relationship the problems are greater. However, whatever be the difficulties such a person faces, our community does not tolerate the cultivation of illegal drugs and their propagation within the community. In my judgment the personal circumstances of the applicant did not justify a finding which entitled the sentencing judge to impose a sentence other than one of full time imprisonment. 
     
      
    15 With respect to the sentence imposed statistics from the Judicial Commission which were provided to this Court indicate that the non-parole period, in particular, was at the upper end of the range of sentences usually imposed. However, there is nothing to suggest that the sentence was outside the permissible range. The submission that the sentence was manifestly excessive must be rejected. 
     
      
    16 Although I would grant leave to appeal, the appeal should be dismissed.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: A Delaware company (known as Nu-Tec) and two of its directors sued the Australian Broadcasting Corporation for defamation in respect of two television programmes broadcast in 2005. The claim suffered a setback when the ABC discovered that Nu-Tec had been a “void” corporation under Delaware law since before the broadcast of the matters complained of. The apparent consequence was that it had no legal ability to retain lawyers or commence proceedings, and was perhaps not capable of being defamed. Those matters had obvious implications for the solicitor on the record for the plaintiffs, Mr Rex Bayliss. 
     
      
    2 The problem was compounded when the proceedings came on for trial. The trial was aborted when counsel for the plaintiffs made incorrect and inconsistent statements to the Court which created confusion as to whether the corporate plaintiff was indeed the company incorporated in Delaware, where its status was described as void, or a company of the same name incorporated in Nevada. Two days after the hearing, Mr Bayliss confirmed that the corporate plaintiff was, and always had been, the Delaware company.3 The ABC seized on those issues and made a series of offers to settle the proceedings out of court. Those offers were made in conjunction with robust warnings directed to Mr Bayliss as to the risk of personal costs orders being made against him if the proceedings continued. At the same time, a number of applications were made to the Court for costs orders against Mr Bayliss in respect of the corporate plaintiff’s claim and the aborted trial. 4 Mr Bayliss has now ceased to act for the plaintiffs and has moved to have the ABC punished for contempt. He contends that the ABC’s conduct was an interference with the due course of justice because it was inherently likely to bring improper pressure to bear on him and ultimately prevent him from continuing to act for the plaintiffs in the proceedings.  
     
      
    5 Three preliminary issues have arisen in respect of the contempt motion. The first is whether the ABC should be required to produce documents in response to a notice to produce issued by Mr Bayliss. Mr Bayliss acknowledges that the notice seeks documents which would ordinarily be protected by client legal privilege but contends that no privilege attaches to the communications in question because they were made in furtherance of the contempt: see s 125 Evidence Act 1995.  
     
      
    6 The second issue is whether the ABC should be directed to file and serve the affidavits upon which it intends to rely in advance of the hearing of the contempt application. This issue arises because the contempt alleged is criminal contempt. The third issue is whether the ABC should be directed to provide written submissions in advance of the hearing. 
     
      
       
      Background  
       
      
    7 It is appropriate to record the procedural context in which the present issues arise. The matters complained of were broadcast on 21 and 22 March 2005. The proceedings were commenced on 17 March 2006. A trial pursuant to s 7A of the Defamation Act 1974 commenced with a jury on 24 October 2007. That trial was aborted due to confusion as to the identity and status of the corporate plaintiff arising from statements made to the Court by counsel for the plaintiffs, Mr Dibb.  
     
      
    8 The doubt regarding Nu-Tec’s corporate status prompted the ABC to file a notice of motion in Court on 24 October 2007 (the ABC’s first motion) seeking separate trial of the question of Nu-Tec’s standing to maintain the proceedings. The motion sought an order that the proceedings brought by Nu-Tec be dismissed and an order that the ABC’s costs of the proceedings brought by Nu-Tec be paid by Mr Bayliss on an indemnity basis. The basis for seeking those costs against Mr Bayliss was that he had no retainer from Nu-Tec (since it had no legal power to commence and maintain the proceedings). 
     
      
    9 The plaintiffs were not ready to meet those issues. Mr Dibb sought time to obtain instructions and investigate whether the Delaware corporation did indeed have power or standing to bring the proceedings. The jury was discharged and the hearing vacated.  
     
      
    10 On 18 March 2008, the ABC filed a notice of motion seeking orders that the plaintiffs and Mr Bayliss pay its costs thrown away by reason of the vacation of the s 7A trial, payable forthwith and, alternatively, an order that the plaintiffs pay those costs and that Mr Bayliss indemnify the ABC in respect of the payment of those costs. 
     
      
    11 The separate trial of the question whether Nu-Tec had standing to maintain the proceedings came before me for hearing on 28 April 2008. The ABC argued that, by operation of Delaware law, Nu-Tec’s charter became void on 1 March 2005 (before publication of the matters complained of) for non-payment of franchise taxes. The ABC contended that, as a result, all powers conferred by law on the company were inoperative and that accordingly it had no power to sue. 
     
      
    12 At the outset of that hearing, Mr Dibb sought an adjournment on the basis that Mr Bayliss had been hampered in his preparation for the hearing by the existence of the allegations that he may be personally liable for costs. Mr Bayliss was separately represented on that occasion and did not join in the application. I refused to grant the adjournment. Mr Curtin, who appeared for Mr Bayliss, then made an application under r 7.29 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules for an order either dispensing with the obligation to serve notice on the plaintiffs of his intention to file a notice of ceasing to act, or abridging the time for service of that notice. I refused that application. 
     
      
    13 Mr Curtin also filed a notice of motion for orders that the ABC’s motion seeking the costs of the aborted trial from Mr Bayliss be struck out and that the ABC be permanently restrained from seeking the orders sought or its costs referred to in that motion. The motion also sought an order that the ABC be permanently restrained from seeking the costs of the proceedings commenced at the suit of Nu-Tec. Mr Curtin did not contend, however, that I should not proceed to determine the question of Nu-Tec’s power to sue.  
     
      
    14 On 1 May 2008, I held in favour of the ABC on the question of Nu-Tec’s standing and dismissed the proceedings brought by it: Nuclear Utility Technology & Environmental Corporation Inc v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2008] NSWSC 841.15 On 29 May 2008, Mr Bayliss filed a notice of ceasing to act for each of the three plaintiffs. He says that he ceased to act because of the conflict of interest between him and his clients arising out of the ABC’s present applications for costs. The two directors have not appeared since. 
     
      
    16 In light of my decision given on 1 May 2008, the ABC replaced its motion dated 18 March 2008 with a notice of motion filed in court on 13 June 2008 consolidating all of its applications against Mr Bayliss, the two directors and Nu-Tec for the costs of the proceedings brought by Nu-Tec and the costs thrown away by reason of the vacation of the s 7A trial (the ABC’s second motion).  
     
      
    17 At that point, the competing positions of the ABC and Mr Bayliss were as follows. The ABC contended that both Mr Bayliss and the plaintiffs were liable for the costs of the proceedings brought by Nu-Tec and the costs thrown away by reason of the aborted s 7A trial. It sought payment of those costs forthwith, assessable on an indemnity basis. Mr Bayliss contended that the very making of those applications against him placed him in an untenable position, ought not to have been made or foreshadowed until the conclusion of the proceedings at the suit of the remaining plaintiffs (the two directors) and should, by reason of its having been made prior to the conclusion of the proceedings, be permanently stayed.  
     
      
    18 It was common ground that I should determine Mr Bayliss’ application first and a timetable was fixed for the preparation for hearing of his motion. The orders made included directions requiring the ABC to file and serve affidavits and submissions. However, on 25 June 2008, Mr Bayliss filed a notice of motion seeking to have the ABC punished for contempt of court. The notice of motion annexed a statement of charge as required by Part 55 rule 7 of the Supreme Court Rules. Eleven discrete charges were identified.  
     
      
    19 Mr Bayliss alleges that the conduct complained of constitutes an interference with the due administration of justice, which is a criminal contempt. The relief sought in the contempt motion includes orders of the kind sought in Mr Bayliss’ earlier motion filed in Court on 28 April 2008 (that the ABC’s motion be struck out and that the ABC be permanently restrained from seeking the orders sought or the ABC’s costs referred to in its motion). That relief is now sought as the appropriate punishment for the alleged criminal contempt (cf Part 55 rule 13 SCR). Alternatively, it is sought as the appropriate remedial order to be made if the Court is not satisfied of the contempt, but is satisfied that the threat of a personal costs order ought not to have been deployed until after the conclusion of the hearing of the proceedings.20 The ABC submitted that, in those circumstances, the contempt motion would require the Court to hear a criminal proceeding and a civil proceeding simultaneously. It was submitted that such an approach would be contrary to authority and a misuse of the Court’s processes.  
     
      
    21 Mr Bayliss acceded to that submission and consented to have the hearing of the alleged criminal contempt separated from the hearing of the relief sought on a civil basis. It was common ground that the contempt application should be determined before any other outstanding issue in the proceedings.  
     
      
       
      Notice to Produce 
      
    22 The Notice to Produce, in broad summary, seeks production of documents recording “legal or other advice” received by the ABC from its lawyers and instructions given by the ABC to its lawyers in relation to the settlement negotiations and costs applications said to constitute the contempt. As I have noted, Mr Bayliss acknowledges that, were it not for the matters raised by him, the ABC would be entitled to claim client legal privilege in respect of at least some of those documents. However, he contends that the privilege is lost under s 125 of the Evidence Act because the communications were made in furtherance of the commission of the offence of contempt. 
     
      
    23 Subsection (2) of s 125 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(2) For the purposes of this section, if the commission of the fraud, offence or act, or the abuse of power, is a fact in issue and there are reasonable grounds for finding that:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) the fraud, offence or act, or the abuse of power, was committed, and 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) a communication was made or document prepared in furtherance of the commission of the fraud, offence or act or the abuse of power, 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          the court may find that the communication was so made or the document so prepared.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    24 The issue for my determination is whether there are reasonable grounds for finding that the ABC has committed the offence of contempt of court. The parties have agreed that, if that element is satisfied, the Court should then inspect the documents, or representative samples of them, so as to determine whether there are reasonable grounds for finding as to each that it amounts to a communication made or a document prepared in furtherance of the commission of that offence.  
     
      
    25 It is well established that what is required in order to displace a claim of client legal privilege on the grounds of misconduct is a clear statement of the offence alleged and some prima facie evidence that it has some foundation in fact: see Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 3; (1997) 188 CLR 501 at 556.6 per McHugh J; Zemanek v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [1997] FCA 1016 at 5 per Hill J; Kang v Kwan [2001] NSWSC 698 at [36] - [37] per Santow J; Lewis v Nortex [2002] NSWSC 1245 at [8] per Hamilton J. 
     
      
    26 Mr Bayliss bears the onus of proving that the privilege does not apply to the documents sought. The evidence does not have to prove that the communication was made in furtherance of the commission of an offence, but it must establish a prima facie case that the communication was so made: Propend at 556.6 per McHugh J. In the present case, there is no dispute as to the sufficiency of the evidence. The area of contest is the legal question whether there are reasonable grounds for concluding that the conduct complained of amounts to contempt. 
     
      
       
       
       
      Evidence of contempt 
       
      
    27 Mr Bayliss swore an affidavit setting out the conversations and other conduct of which he complains. Much of that was evidence of settlement negotiations but it was not objected to by the ABC (cf s 131 Evidence Act).  
     
      
    28 The issue of Nu-Tec’s power to sue was first raised in the proceedings in July 2007. The ABC sought production of Nu-Tec’s incorporation records after becoming aware that Nu-Tec was not a registered foreign corporation in Australia. It appears that the records produced disclosed that Nu-Tec was incorporated in Delaware and that its status as a corporation was described as “void”. In due course the ABC obtained a copy of a certificate from the Secretary of State of Delaware certifying that Nu-Tec was “no longer in existence and good standing under the laws of the state of Delaware having become inoperative and void the first day of March AD 2005 for non-payment of taxes”. 29 On 2 October 2007, over three weeks before the date fixed for the s 7A hearing, the ABC sent Mr Bayliss a copy of the certificate and expressed its view that Nu-Tec did not have standing to issue or pursue the proceedings against the ABC. The letter also contended that Mr Bayliss could not have any valid retainer in relation to Nu-Tec. The letter put Mr Bayliss on notice that if he was unable to establish that he held a valid retainer, the ABC would apply for indemnity costs against his firm. On a without prejudice basis, the ABC offered to settle the proceedings on the basis that judgment be entered for the ABC in relation to the claims of each of the plaintiffs with no order as to costs. That offer was open for acceptance until 4pm on 5 October 2007. The letter concluded by inviting Mr Bayliss to explain the true position if it was thought that the ABC was mistaken as to its understanding of Nu-Tec’s status. Mr Bayliss did not respond to that letter. 
     
      
    30 On 9 October 2007 the ABC served an offer of compromise under Part 20 of the UCPR on the same terms. That offer was open for acceptance until 5pm on 17 October 2007, after which only four working days remained until the trial was due to begin.  
     
      
    31 Mr Bayliss does not allege that there was any impropriety in those offers. The first charge of contempt identified in the statement of charge arises from a telephone call made to Mr Bayliss on 12 October 2007 by Mr Stephen Collins, head of the ABC’s legal department, and Mr Joe Patterson, a lawyer employed by the ABC. The evidence of Mr Bayliss was that they had the following conversation: 
     
      
       
        
        “ABC Lawyers: Can we resolve this matter? The first plaintiff has no standing to bring these proceedings and should withdraw immediately. If you proceed and the Court finds the company to be non-existent you run the risk that costs orders could be made against your firm. We have been upfront about what we have discovered. If you discontinue now the ABC will not press for such costs orders against your firm, but if you press on we will seek such costs orders. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Bayliss: I am awaiting instructions. 
        
       
       
        
        ABC Lawyers: We are concerned about your position.” 
        
       
      
    32 Mr Bayliss was very troubled by that conversation. He construed it as an attempt to exert pressure on him personally to bring about a resolution of the proceedings. 
     
      
    33 The second charge of contempt arises from a letter dated 16 October 2007 from Mr Collins to Mr Bayliss in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “We have put you on notice that the first plaintiff has no corporeal existence and did not have the ability to issue proceedings when these proceedings were commenced. The first plaintiff also did not have the power to engage solicitors to act on its behalf and is therefore unlikely that your firm has or ever had a valid retainer. 
        
       
       
        
        We have been open about these matters and have given your clients the opportunity to withdraw this proceeding on the basis that judgment be entered for the defendant with no order as to costs. That offer will expire on 17 October 2007 at 5.00pm. 
        
       
       
        
        We put you on notice that, in the event our offer is not accepted, the ABC will make an application for indemnity costs of the proceedings against your firm personally, should it be found that the first plaintiff does not have the capacity to bring these proceedings.” 
        
       
      
    34 Mr Bayliss said he read that letter as an attempt by the ABC to influence any advice he gave to his clients in relation to the offer of settlement. He said that the offer created a potential conflict of interest and put him under “some personal pressure” in acting for the plaintiffs. 35 Later in the day on 16 October Mr Patterson called Mr Bayliss and they had the following conversation: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Patterson: Have you got instructions to our faxed letter of 16 October?  
        
       
       
        
        Mr Bayliss: No I’m still waiting to hear from Counsel and my clients. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Patterson: Don’t forget the offer expires tomorrow.”  
        
       
      
    36 That conversation is the basis for the third charge of contempt. Mr Bayliss found the conversation threatening in the context of the letter and the earlier conversation. He said that he received instructions from his clients in respect of the letter of 16 October and that, “consistent with those instructions, [he] did not contact the ABC prior to the expiry of the offer”.37 At the hearing on 24 October 2007, counsel for the plaintiffs, Mr Dibb, initially stated to the Court that the first plaintiff was not incorporated in the state of Delaware but was in fact a corporation of the same name incorporated in the state of Nevada. He subsequently stated to the Court that there was uncertainty as to whether the first plaintiff was the entity incorporated in Delaware or the entity incorporated in Nevada. During the discussion of that issue in the absence of the jury, the ABC filed its motion seeking a separate hearing of the question of Nu-Tec’s power to sue. The fourth charge of contempt is based on the third prayer for relief in that motion, which seeks an order that the ABC’s costs of the proceedings brought by Nu-Tec be paid by Mr Bayliss on an indemnity basis.  
     
      
    38 On the evening of the aborted trial, another lawyer employed by the ABC, Mr Jonathan Duhs, wrote to Mr Bayliss informing him that the ABC had incurred very considerable costs which it thought would be payable on an indemnity basis. The letter continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Further, if the first plaintiff is [the Delaware company] we will be seeking those costs from your firm on the basis that your firm cannot have a valid retainer from that corporation and because that corporation has no standing to bring and maintain the proceedings. Alternatively, if you assert that the first plaintiff is [the Nevada company] - which we do not accept is the case - we will be seeking those costs from that corporation and/or your firm on the basis that the ABC understood that the first plaintiff was the company registered in Delaware because of the representations made to it by you on behalf of your clients during the course of the proceedings. You should be aware that in the circumstances the ABC has every intention of executing whatever costs are made in its favour in relation to this matter.” 
        
       
      
    39 The letter concluded with a “final attempt to settle the proceedings” on the basis of judgment for the ABC and deeds of release from both the Delaware company and the Nevada company. The offer was silent as to legal costs. It was expressed to be open for acceptance until 5.00pm on Friday 26 October 2007. Mr Bayliss felt threatened by that letter and perceived the threats in respect of costs orders against him, coupled with the offer of settlement, as an attempt to influence his advice to his clients in relation to the offer. 
     
      
    40 In a further letter dated 26 October 2007, Mr Duhs reminded Mr Bayliss that the ABC’s offer expired that day. Mr Bayliss replied seeking clarification as to the position in respect of legal costs. By separate letter, he confirmed that the corporate plaintiff “is and has always been [the Delaware company].” Mr Duhs confirmed by telephone that the offer was on the basis that there be no order as to costs. He expressed the view that it was a generous offer in the circumstances. Mr Bayliss responded that it was not very attractive to them. Later that day, Mr Duhs called Mr Bayliss to say that the offer was extended to be open until midnight. Mr Bayliss responded that there was nothing he could do about the offer at that hour. The two letters and two phone calls by Mr Duhs are relied upon by Mr Bayliss as the basis for the fifth charge of contempt. 
     
      
    41 The sixth and seventh charges of contempt rest on two further letters from Mr Collins to Mr Bayliss. On 29 October 2007, Mr Collins wrote to Mr Bayliss asking him to explain, in light of his confirmation that the corporate plaintiff was the void Delaware company, the basis on which he claimed to have a retainer to act for that company. Mr Bayliss does not appear to have responded to that request at any stage. The letter concluded with an open offer to settle the proceedings on the basis that the two directors’ claims be dismissed, that the motion to dismiss Nu-Tec’s claim proceed unopposed, that the directors pay $15,000 towards the ABC’s costs and that Mr Bayliss’ firm agree to pay the costs of the entire action on an indemnity basis in the event that the directors defaulted in payment of the $15,000. The offer was expressed to remain open until noon the following day. 
     
      
    42 After that offer lapsed without response, Mr Collins made a further offer on 30 October 2007 on the same terms, except that the amount sought from the directors was $25,000. Mr Bayliss said those offers put him under further personal pressure, since they involved him as a party to the proposed settlement. He felt that the ABC was trying to target him personally to exert pressure on him. He does not appear to have responded to the offers.  
     
      
    43 There was no further correspondence until 13 March 2008 when the ABC wrote to Mr Bayliss asking whether he and his clients would agree to pay the ABC’s costs thrown away by reason of the vacation of the s 7A trial, on an indemnity basis, payable forthwith and on the basis that they were jointly and severally liable. The letter foreshadowed an application to the Court in the absence of agreement. Mr Bayliss felt further pressure under that threat to act other than objectively in his clients’ interests. He said that, “whereas the status of the first plaintiff might have been resolved if the relevant taxes had been paid, this threatened costs order was not defendable on the same ground”. That letter is the foundation for the eighth charge of contempt in the statement of charge. 
     
      
    44 Mr Bayliss replied, suggesting that it was premature to determine the costs question until “after the status of the first plaintiff has been resolved”. The ABC initially disagreed and stated that it intended to pursue the application. The ninth charge of contempt is that the ABC “refused Rex Bayliss’s suggestion that the adjournment costs application be determined after the status of the first plaintiff was resolved”.  
     
      
    45 The ABC proceeded to send Mr Bayliss the notice of motion dated 18 March 2008 and a supporting affidavit. The tenth charge of contempt is based on the claims against Mr Bayliss in that motion for the costs thrown away by the adjournment of the trial. 
     
      
    46 The ABC later conceded that the determination of the separate question as to the standing of the corporate plaintiff may obviate the need for a hearing of its application seeking the costs thrown away (since those costs would be part of the costs the ABC would claim if the Court dismissed Nu-Tec’s proceeding). The parties agreed that the separate question as to Nu-Tec’s standing should be heard before any issues as to costs. As already noted, after the separate question had been determined in favour of the ABC and the proceedings brought by Nu-Tec dismissed, the ABC consolidated all of its claims for costs in its second motion. The final charge of contempt is based on the relief sought against Mr Bayliss in the second motion.  
     
      
      Are there reasonable grounds for a finding of contempt? 
      
    47 Mr Curtin acknowledged that the costs applications made against Mr Bayliss by the ABC had a proper basis “in their genesis”. What was improper, he submitted, was the timing of the threats and the applications made, the vigour with which they were pursued, the tone of the communications and the mixing of the threatened costs applications with settlement offers.  
     
      
    48 As noted by Mr Curtin, contempt can be committed by a solicitor exerting improper pressure on an opponent, whether what is threatened is lawful or unlawful conduct: see Bhagat v Global Custodians Ltd [2002] NSWCA 160 at [35 ] - [37]. Mr Curtin submitted that the conduct of the ABC, although lawful, amounted to improper pressure. He noted that contempt may be established by a series of acts considered collectively as a course of conduct: see Farahbakht v Midas Australia Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 1322 at [24] per Brereton J.  
     
      
    49 However, the conduct of the ABC must also be considered in the context of the events to which it responded. It is necessary to have regard to all of the circumstances of the case in order to determine whether the pressure sought to be applied can be described as improper: see Bhagat at [38].  
     
      
       
      The timing of the costs applications against Mr Bayliss 
       
      
    50 Mr Curtin did not contend that the only proper time to make an application for a personal costs order against a legal practitioner is at the end of the substantive proceedings. However, he did submit that the authorities warn quite strongly against making an application before that time. He cited Orchard v South Eastern Electricity Board [1987] 1 QB 565 at 577G per Donaldson MR and at 580E per Dillon LJ; Levick v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2000] FCA 674; (2000) 102 FCR 155 at [43] per Wilcox, Burchett and Tamberlin JJ and Lemoto v Able Technical Pty Limited [2005] NSWCA 153; (2005) 63 NSWLR 300 at [194]. 
     
      
    51 Mr Curtin placed particular emphasis on the decision in Lemoto. He submitted that the Court of Appeal has said in that case that the most appropriate time to make an application for a personal costs order against a solicitor is after the conclusion of the substantive proceedings. 
     
      
    52 I do not discern from the decisions relied upon by Mr Curtin any general principle that it is inherently improper to make or foreshadow an application for costs against an opposing solicitor before the conclusion of proceedings. The particular remarks relied upon by him were obiter and were made in a different context.53 In Orchard, the English Court of Appeal rejected an appeal seeking a costs order against a firm of solicitors that had acted for a legally aided plaintiff in a claim against the South Eastern Electricity Board. The plaintiff had alleged in the underlying proceedings that electricity escaping under his house had heated water in the earth so that it turned to steam and penetrated the house. The plaintiff’s complaints were described by the Court as “weird in the extreme” but had been supported by expert evidence: at 572.H and 573.F per Donaldson MR. The basis for the costs application was that it could be inferred that the solicitors had failed to comply with a statutory duty to inform the legal aid authorities of the circumstances and prospects for success of the plaintiff’s claim. It was in that context that Dillon LJ expressed concern at the prospect:  
     
      
       
        
        “that a practice should develop whereby solicitors for defendants endeavour to browbeat solicitors for legally aided plaintiffs into dropping their client’s cases - or into procuring revocation of the relevant legal aid certificates - by threats that the defendants will seek to hold the plaintiffs’ solicitors personally liable for the costs of the litigation” (at 580E).  
        
       
       
      His Lordship expressed the view that such conduct might be contempt of court (at 581A).  
       
      
    54 In Levick, the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia upheld a costs order made against solicitors who had advanced points that were not seriously arguable. The Full Court shared the concerns expressed by Dillon LJ and Donaldson MR and stated its agreement with the view that “browbeating” solicitors with threats of personal costs orders might amount to contempt: see [35], [36] and [43]. The Court noted, however, that “it is equally important to uphold the right of a court to order a solicitor to pay costs wasted by the solicitor’s unreasonable conduct of a case”: at [44]. 
     
      
    55 In Lemoto, the Court of Appeal set aside a costs order that had been made against a solicitor under s 198M of the Legal Profession Act 1987 for acting in proceedings that were without reasonable prospects of success. McColl JA observed at [194] that she also shared the concern expressed by Dillon LJ in Orchard, although her Honour did not expressly refer to the question whether such conduct might amount to contempt. In the passage at [193] relied upon by Mr Curtin, McColl JA said, by way of “general observation” about the Court’s jurisdiction under Division 5C of the Legal Profession Act:  
     
      
       
        
        “[T]here is a real risk if s 198M applications are made immediately after proceedings have concluded (which I accept is the most realistic time for any such application) that the client may be prejudiced if the legal practitioner ceases to act because of a perceived conflict of interest leaving the client unable to secure advice as to the prospects of a successful appeal from the person most familiar with the proceedings.” 
        
       
       
      Hodgson JA agreed with the orders proposed by McColl JA and “substantially agreed” with her Honour’s reasons. Ipp JA agreed with McColl JA and Hodgson JA. 
      
    56 I do not think her Honour’s remarks were directed to the propriety of making an application before the conclusion of the proceedings. Her Honour simply recognised that, in practice, a successful party wishing to make such an application will usually make it immediately rather than holding off so as to enable his opponent to consider the merits of an appeal with an unclouded mind.  
     
      
    57 The concern expressed in Orchard recognises the peculiar difficulty of predicting the course of any litigation. A legal practitioner might responsibly and comfortably form the opinion that a case has reasonable prospects of success, but lack the will or the confidence to back that view with his own money. The vice warned against by Dillon LJ is the exploitation of such doubts to the detriment of financially weak clients.  
     
      
    58 A claim for “retainer costs” or other costs thrown away by past default is in a different category. As submitted by Mr Sheahan, who appeared with Mr Dawson for the ABC, seeking such costs does not put pressure on a lawyer to question his judgment and abandon the client but only to explain past conduct. 59 The ABC’s applications invoke s 99 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005, which provides for liability of legal practitioners for costs incurred:  
     
      
       
        
        “(a) by the serious neglect, serious incompetence or serious misconduct of a legal practitioner, or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) improperly, or without reasonable cause, in circumstances for which a legal practitioner is responsible.” 
        
       
      
    60 The Court’s power under s 99 is an important aid to the overriding purpose of the Act (s 56). It provides a sanction against solicitors whose conduct of the proceedings has caused a party to incur unnecessary costs, and a remedy for those who have incurred those costs. I do not accept that it is inherently improper to invoke that power while the proceedings remain on foot. 
     
      
    61 Of course, it does not necessarily follow that the threats and applications made by the ABC were not improper. The propriety and appropriate timing of such conduct will always depend on all of the circumstances of the case. 
     
      
       
      Conduct leading up to the s 7A hearing 
       
      
    62 The improper pressure in the present case is alleged to have commenced with the telephone call made by Mr Collins and Mr Patterson to Mr Bayliss on 12 October 2007. In that conversation, it was said that if the proceedings were discontinued, the ABC would not press for any personal costs order against Mr Bayliss but that if the case continued, an order would be sought. That threat was repeated in the letter dated 16 October 2007, with the added warning that the costs would be sought on an indemnity basis.  
     
      
    63 Mr Bayliss contends that those threats created a conflict between his interests and those of his clients and improperly placed him under pressure to prefer his own interests. Mr Curtin submitted that the position of the two individual plaintiffs was unrelated to that of the void company and that they should not have been linked in the settlement offer. 64 The ABC’s threat to press for a personal costs order against Mr Bayliss if the proceedings continued followed its discovery of what appeared to be cogent evidence that Nu-Tec was not a company duly incorporated with power to sue in its corporate name. If the ABC’s understanding was correct, it followed inexorably that Mr Bayliss did not have a valid retainer from one of the three plaintiffs. As submitted by the ABC, the usual order in such cases is that the solicitor must pay so much of the other party’s costs as are attributable to the company being made a party: Harry Bagg’s Liquidation Warehouse Pty Ltd v Whittaker (1982) 44 NSWLR 421 at 430G per Powell J. That is not a legal rule, but “the outcome which would usually be produced in a sound exercise of discretion”: Zimmerman Holdings Pty Ltd v Wales [2002] NSWSC 447 at [10] per Bryson J, approved in Hillig v Darkinjung Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] NSWCA 147 at [51] to [52] per McColl JA, Beazley and Giles JJA agreeing. I see no impropriety in making an application for such costs at the time when an order is sought dismissing the proceedings brought by the company.  
     
      
    65 Further, the ABC was entitled to assume that, since the other two plaintiffs claimed to be directors of Nu-Tec, they bore a measure of responsibility for the circumstances giving rise to the retainer issue: cf Harry Bagg’s at 431C. That proposition is ignored in Mr Bayliss’ contention that the position of the individuals should not have been linked in the settlement offer.  
     
      
    66 The ABC had sent Mr Bayliss a copy of the evidence it had obtained and had invited him to say whether it was mistaken in its understanding of Nu-Tec’s status. That correspondence had been met with a stony silence. The parties were hurtling towards a three-day jury trial. The ABC’s lawyers had identified an important threshold question that had the potential to throw the trial off the rails, but Mr Bayliss would not engage with them on that topic. 
     
      
    67 In those circumstances, although I accept that the reminder of the threat to pursue Mr Bayliss for costs was calculated to put pressure on him, I do not think it could reasonably be concluded that the pressure was improper. In my view, the ABC was entitled to be concerned about the apparent inattention within the plaintiffs’ camp to the issue it had raised. It was not improper to seek to sharpen Mr Bayliss’ focus by firmly reminding him of his responsibility to see that costs were not being improperly incurred.   
     
      
    68 I do not accept that the ABC created the conflict of interest. As submitted by Mr Sheahan, a solicitor is in a position of potential conflict as soon as there is a challenge to his retainer. 
     
      
    69 Mr Curtin contended that the terms of the conversation complained of made it explicitly clear to Mr Bayliss that his personal financial position would be improved if the plaintiffs accepted the offer of settlement. He submitted that it cannot be other than improper to exert pressure on a solicitor in relation to his private interests in order to achieve a settlement. 
     
      
    70 I do not accept that submission. Plainly, there could well be impropriety in exerting pressure on a solicitor in relation to personal interests that were entirely collateral to his conduct of the litigation, but I do not think the position can be stated so simply in respect of issues arising directly from the solicitor’s role in a case.  
     
      
    71 It is an inescapable feature of legal practice that the conduct of litigation touches the personal interests of the solicitor on the record. Mr Sheahan noted that conflicts of interest in relation to costs are endemic to most relationships between solicitor and client. He cited the obvious example that an early resolution of a claim deprives a solicitor of the fees he stood to earn during a contested hearing. For legal practitioners who accept instructions on a speculative basis, the conflict is even more acute. Section 56 of the Civil Procedure Act itself exerts pressure on a solicitor in relation to his private interests by demanding that he prefer the interests expressed in the overriding purpose. 
     
      
    72 The potential liability of a solicitor under s 99 is one of the many matters that may affect his personal interests. The solicitor on the record in proceedings governed by the Civil Procedure Act has a personal interest in maintaining that he has complied with the professional obligations recognised in that section. The potential conflict between that interest and the interests of the client is inescapable. It exists in every case as a result of the power recognised in s 99, not as a result of anything said by an opposing solicitor.  
     
      
    73 A recurring feature of the ABC’s settlement offers was that it was prepared to forego any entitlement to an order for costs against Mr Bayliss under s 99. That was a focal point of the conflict of interest faced by Mr Bayliss, but not its cause. When the offer was made, the events that would determine whether Mr Bayliss was vulnerable to be held liable under s 99 had already occurred and were known to Mr Bayliss and his clients but not to the ABC. The need for him and his clients, when considering the offer, to assess their respective responsibility for the problem that had arisen and the implications of those matters for the claim of each plaintiff was not a problem of the ABC’s making. As submitted by Mr Sheahan, it was part of Mr Bayliss’ professional responsibility to be able to deal with the conflict without sacrificing his clients’ interests. 
     
      
    74 The position would be different had the threats to seek a personal costs order been baseless. However, for the reasons I have indicated, I am satisfied that there was a proper basis for threatening such an application. I am not satisfied that there was any impropriety in the telephone call of 12 October 2007 or the letter dated 16 October 2007. 
     
      
    75 The third charge of contempt is based on the telephone call made by Mr Patterson on 16 October 2007 when he asked Mr Bayliss whether he had instructions in respect of the offer and reminded him that it expired the following day. On that issue, Mr Curtin adopted the statement of Lord Diplock in Attorney-General (UK) v Times Newspapers Ltd [1974] AC 273 at 311B that “parties to litigation are entitled to the same freedom from interference in negotiating the settlement of a civil action as they are from interference in the trial of it.” 
     
      
    76 I do not think that Mr Patterson’s call amounted to interference in the negotiation of the settlement. As submitted by Mr Sheahan, the call seems to have been completely innocuous. In my view, it was proper for Mr Patterson to follow up the issue of settlement when the time for intensive preparation for the trial was well upon them. 
     
      
    77 The fourth charge is based on the notice of motion filed in Court on 24 October 2007. Mr Curtin submitted that the third prayer for relief was calculated or inherently likely to bring about the result of preventing Mr Bayliss from acting for the plaintiffs as it gave rise to “a real sensible possibility of conflict” between his interests and those of his clients, and was at the very least inherently likely to interfere with his objectivity as their solicitor. For the reasons discussed above, I reject the notion that it was the ABC that created the conflict. In my view, it was not inappropriate for the ABC to make the application when it did. That there was a proper basis for the application was only confirmed by the events at the hearing on 24 October 2007. 
     
      
       
      The offers made after the hearing 
       
      
    78 Mr Bayliss’ complaint in respect of the several communications in the week following the hearing focussed on the persistence and threatening tone of that correspondence. The first is the letter sent by Mr Duhs on the evening of the trial. The propriety of sending a letter in those terms must be viewed in context. The section 7A hearing was, as Mr Sheahan put it, “forensic mayhem.” Making due allowance for the fact that Mr Bayliss is constrained from explaining how that occurred, the ABC was, on any view, entitled to be indignant at the events that had unfolded that day. Mr Duhs’ letter was, in my view, a fair statement of the position that had been reached as a result of those events. I see no impropriety whatsoever in the further letter sent on 26 October 2007, nor in the telephone conversations of that day. 79 As to the letters dated 29 October and 30 October 2007, Mr Curtin submitted that these were a continuation of the earlier process with the added vice of making Mr Bayliss a party to the proposed settlement agreement. As already noted, it is accepted that there was a proper basis for seeking costs against Mr Bayliss. The proposition appears to be that it was improper to seek to resolve all issues in the proceedings, including the claim against Mr Bayliss, in a single settlement offer. 
     
      
    80 Mr Sheahan submitted that the proposed term that would require Mr Bayliss to indemnify the ABC if the two directors failed to make their contribution to the costs was no more than a device calculated to ensure that he would insist that the money was available from his clients before completing the settlement. 
     
      
    81 In the context of what had gone before, that subtlety may have been lost on Mr Bayliss. In my view, the offers contained in those two letters placed excessive emphasis on Mr Bayliss’ exposure to liability for costs and were unfortunate in that respect. However, I do not think there are reasonable grounds for concluding that they amounted to contempt. No doubt, the terms of the offers reflected the ABC’s frustration at the shambolic events of the previous week and the plaintiffs’ silence in the face of its many offers. Mr Bayliss was an experienced litigator. There is no suggestion that he had any particular vulnerability: cf Bhagat at [49] per Spigelman CJ and at [54] per Ipp JA. The letters introduced no new conflict. In my view, the Court should be slow to treat a genuine offer to resolve all issues in legal proceedings as amounting to contempt of Court.  
     
      
      The application for costs thrown away 
       
      
    82 There was no further correspondence until March 2008 when the ABC asked Mr Bayliss to pay the costs of the adjourned s7A hearing. Mr Bayliss says that request was inherently likely to cause him to cease to act. However, as already noted, Mr Bayliss has accepted that there was a proper basis for the application. As I understand his position, the alleged impropriety lies in the timing. 
     
      
    83 For the reasons I have already given, I do not think it is inherently improper to seek costs under s 99 before the conclusion of the proceedings.  
     
      
    84 The statements by counsel for the plaintiffs that caused the trial to be vacated were made in the presence of Mr Bayliss and he had made no attempt to have them withdrawn. He had been on notice, since at least 2 October 2007, of the need for him to clarify the issue of Nu-Tec’s status prior to the hearing. There was plainly a proper basis for the ABC to seek its costs thrown away, before it incurred any further costs defending the claim, after it appeared that he had failed to do so. 
     
      
    85 The issue whether the application, having been made, should be entertained at that stage was a matter for the Court. The fact that Mr Bayliss says he acted at all times on advice and instructions which he is constrained from disclosing is a compelling consideration in favour of postponing the hearing of the application. In my view, however, there was no impropriety in making it. I do not think there is any substance in Mr Bayliss’ allegations of impropriety in respect of the ABC’s applications for the costs thrown away by the vacation of the trial. 
     
      
    86 A discrete complaint made by Mr Bayliss was that the application made by the notice of motion dated 18 March 2008 was unnecessary because the ABC had separately sought the costs of the proceedings commenced by Nu-Tec which would include the costs of the vacated trial. The ABC’s refusal to agree with the suggestion that the costs issues should be postponed until after the hearing of the separate question is relied on as a separate charge of contempt. In my view, that complaint reflects an unduly precious approach. If the ABC’s applications involved some duplication, or the solicitors disagreed as to the order in which they should be heard, those were issues of the kind that frequently arise in litigation and which solicitors must take in their stride. In my view, the contention that the ABC’s position on those issues was improper conduct amounting to contempt is completely unsustainable. 
     
      
    87 A further complaint made by Mr Bayliss is that the ABC was claiming the costs against Mr Bayliss and the two directors jointly and severally. Mr Curtin submitted that this was “an assertion that was wrong in law and therefore false”. I do not accept that submission. Whether or not there was any support in authority for the claim to have the costs payable jointly and severally, it cannot be said to have been improper to make the application.88 I am not satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for concluding that any of the conduct complained of, considered either individually or as a course of conduct, amounted to contempt.  
     
      
       
      Should the ABC be directed to serve affidavits and written submissions in advance of the contempt hearing? 
       
      
    89 The ABC consented to the directions requiring it to file and serve affidavits and written submissions in respect of Mr Bayliss’ original motion. The question arises whether those directions remain appropriate in the face of his application to have the ABC punished for contempt. 
     
      
    90 Contempt out of court committed in connection with proceedings in the court is a common law offence punishable summarily by the court in its inherent jurisdiction: John Fairfax & Sons Pty Ltd v McRae (1954-1955) 93 CLR 351 at 360.9. The recognition of jurisdiction to deal summarily with contempts other than those in the face of the court is generally accepted as being based on historical error (discussed in Miller, Contempt of Court, 3rd Ed at 3.01 to 3.07 and Arlidge, Eady & Smith on Contempt at 1.51 to 1.56) but its existence is now beyond doubt: James v Robinson (1963) 109 CLR 593 at 600.7 to 602.1; Re Colina & Anor; Ex Parte Torney [1999] HCA 57; (1999) 200 CLR 386 at [12] – [14].  
     
      
    91 The summary jurisdiction to punish for contempt in this Court is governed by the Supreme Court Act and Part 55 of the Supreme Court Rules: Fraser v R (No 2) (1985) 1 NSWLR 680 at 692D per McHugh JA; DPP (Cth) v Sexton [2008] NSWSC 352 at [9] per Howie J. There are statutory provisions and rules that govern proceedings in which the Court is exercising its summary jurisdiction in proceedings “under any Act” (Part 5 of Chapter 4 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and Part 75 SCR) but those provisions do not apply when the court is exercising its summary jurisdiction at common law: Sexton at [11].  
     
      
    92 There is no express rule as to whether affidavits should be served in advance of the hearing by a party against whom an application for punishment for contempt is made under Part 55. Rule 8 provides that the evidence in support of the charge shall be by affidavit, but is silent on the topic of evidence from the person against whom the application is brought. 
     
      
    93 In that context, the parties accepted that the question whether the ABC should be directed to serve affidavits in advance of the hearing is a matter within the discretion of the Court. In my judgment, the ABC should not be required to serve any material in advance of the trial in the present case. Mr Bayliss has, by his application, assumed the role of a prosecutor. The onus of proving the guilt of the ABC rests on him and never shifts to the ABC: EPA v Caltex (1993) 178 CLR 447 per McHugh J at [30].  
     
      
    94 Mr Curtin submitted that the days of trial by ambush are over, but it is not Mr Bayliss who is now on trial. The application, although brought only against the ABC, rests on allegations of improper conduct on the part of three legal practitioners employed by the ABC.  
     
      
    95 Mr Curtin relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal in Athens v Randwick City Council [2005] NSWCA 317; 64 NSWLR 58 where the Court noted that the procedure in contempt proceedings is not the same as in a criminal trial: at [62] and [89] (citing Witham v Holloway (1995) 183 CLR 525). The relevant passage in Witham appears at 534.6 per Brennan, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ, where their Honours said: 
     
      
       
        
        “However, to say that proceedings for contempt are essentially criminal in nature is not to equate them with the trial of a criminal charge. There are clear procedural differences, the most obvious being that criminal charges ordinarily involve trial by jury, whereas charges of contempt do not.”  
        
       
      
    96 As I read that passage, their Honours were referring only to the distinction between trial on indictment and proceedings that are disposed of summarily.97 In Athens, the Court held that it had been within the discretion of the trial Judge to refuse to entertain a “no case” submission in a contempt case at [90]. In that case, however, the contempt alleged was disobedience to an order of the Court. Those proceedings were accordingly properly described as civil proceedings, even though the criminal standard of proof applied.  
     
      
    98 The contempt alleged by Mr Bayliss against the ABC is a criminal contempt. If the disposal of that proceeding should be just and efficient, as contended by Mr Curtin, that should not be at the expense of according the ABC a fair process in accordance with the fundamental rules of the common law. I do not think the ABC should be compelled to disclose its evidence in defence of the charge. 
     
      
    99 In the circumstances, I will not direct the ABC to serve written submissions in advance of the hearing. It has already served detailed submissions on the legal question whether the conduct identified in the statement of charge amounts to contempt. Since the ABC is not to be directed to serve its evidence in advance of the hearing, there would in my view be no utility in its being directed to serve any further submissions. 
     
      
    100 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      1. I note that I am not satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for finding that the ABC has committed the offence of contempt. 
       
       
      2. I direct the ABC to inform Mr Bayliss within 14 days of any claim of client legal privilege in respect of any document sought in his notice to produce dated 14 August 2008. 
       
       
      3. I dismiss the application by Mr Bayliss for a direction requiring the ABC to file and serve affidavits and written submissions in respect of the contempt application.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BUDDIN J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal from a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court. Following his plea of guilty to a single count of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 10 years with an overall sentence of 15 years imprisonment. At the relevant time s 61J(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 listed seven circumstances of aggravation. The circumstance of aggravation upon which the Crown relied in the present case was the infliction of actual bodily harm. The maximum penalty for the offence is 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 10 years is applicable to it. The sentence was ordered to commence on the date of the applicant’s arrest from which time he has been in continuous custody. 
     
      
    2 The facts of the matter are not in dispute and may be briefly stated. The victim, who was aged 16, was walking alone along a street in Coffs Harbour at about 10 pm on 10 June 2005 when the applicant ran out from behind some bushes. Without warning, he punched her above her right eye and grabbed her arm. He then forcibly dragged her towards a nearby building. The victim resisted but she was overcome by the applicant. The applicant placed his hand over her mouth and nose, and said, “If you don’t shut up I’m going to kill you”. The applicant continued dragging the victim to a nearby building. Once they were underneath the building, the applicant threw the victim onto the ground. He then lay on top of her and again placed his hand over her mouth. He said to her, “If you’re lucky, I’ll let you breathe through your nose”. Shortly afterwards, the applicant removed his hand. The victim screamed and kicked the applicant in the groin. The applicant responded by punching the victim in the left eye and said to her, “If you don’t shut up I’ll break your nose”. 
     
      
    3 The applicant then pulled off his pants. He then removed the victim’s pants and underwear. The victim saw that the applicant had an erect penis. He said to her “You want it don’t you?” The applicant forced his erect penis into the victim’s vagina and had sexual intercourse with her for about 5 to 10 minutes, without using a condom. The sound of a siren was then heard, and the applicant got off the victim. The applicant spoke briefly to the victim before running away. The victim dressed herself and walked back to the road, where she was met by the police. She told them that she had been sexually assaulted. 
     
      
    4 The victim was taken to hospital where she was medically examined. The victim was observed to have bruising to her left eye, grazing and contusions to her right temple and grazes to her knees and back. She was also noted to be very shaken. 
     
      
    5 A covert DNA sample was obtained from the applicant in October 2006. Subsequent analysis indicated that there was a match between the applicant’s DNA and the DNA found on a vaginal swab taken from the victim. When the applicant was arrested and charged he voluntarily provided police with a buccal swab. 
     
      
    6 The applicant was born on 17 March 1987 and is now aged 21. He was just over 18 when he committed these offences. The evidence revealed that the applicant had had an extremely dysfunctional childhood. He is the youngest of 6 children. There was considerable domestic violence in the home and there were also allegations that the applicant’s father had sexually assaulted two of the applicant’s older sisters. When the applicant was about 8 years old, his mother died following a long battle with bowel cancer. The applicant remained living with his father after his mother’s death. Following his mother’s death, the applicant’s father significantly increased his consumption of alcohol. 
     
      
    7 When the applicant was 9 years old, his father detonated a large explosion outside the Coffs Harbour DOCS office, causing substantial damage to that office and a neighbouring building. As a result, the applicant’s father was convicted of various offences and sentenced to a lengthy term of imprisonment. The applicant was thereafter placed into the full-time care of DOCS. Over the years that followed, the applicant was placed into various foster homes in NSW, Adelaide, Canberra and Queensland. Some of his foster carers abused him. When he was 10 years old, the applicant was hit by a car as a result of which he sustained a broken leg and concussion. When he was 11 years old, the applicant began drinking alcohol. His schooling was disrupted and he also experienced learning difficulties, apparently due to his having Attention Deficit Disorder. At some stage, the applicant was placed on medication for his condition but he refused to continue taking it. He attended a number of schools but received little education and is barely literate. He eventually left school in the second term of Year 7.  
     
      
    8 The applicant’s foster home arrangements finally broke down when the applicant was 14 or 15 years old. DOCS then accommodated the applicant in a motel where he lived by himself. From about that time the applicant began to drink very heavily and to abuse illicit drugs. Dr Allnutt diagnosed the applicant as suffering from a “chronic adjustment disorder characterised by a fluctuating depressed mood”. The applicant has been employed only very intermittently. 
     
      
    9 Ms Annette McGowan, who was the applicant’s former DOCS caseworker, gave evidence during the course of the sentencing proceedings. She regarded herself as being the applicant’s surrogate mother. She said that she became involved in the applicant’s care when she transferred to the Coffs Harbour DOCS office in about 2001. She said that she had maintained contact, in a personal capacity, with the applicant even after he turned 18. She had also visited the applicant in gaol whilst he was on remand for this offence. Ms McGowan gave evidence that she had noticed a “dramatic change” in the applicant’s maturity and attitude about 6 months after the commission of the offence (that is about 10-12 months before he was charged). She thought “he’d grown up considerably” in this time. Up until then the applicant had appeared to her to have “a very big chip on his shoulder”. Ms McGowan said she was prepared to continue assisting the applicant after his release from custody. 
     
      
    10 The applicant has a criminal record which commenced in 2004 when he was placed on probation in the Children’s Court for malicious damage to property and resisting an officer in the execution of duty. In 2005, in respect of two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, the applicant was ordered to perform 200 hours of community service. In the same year he was placed on a bond for a period of 18 months for offences of malicious damage to property and intimidating an officer in the execution of duty. The applicant was thus on conditional liberty at the time the present offence was committed. In October 2005 in the Children’s Court the applicant was ordered to perform a further period of community service for driving offences. In 2006 he received small pecuniary penalties for behaving in an offensive manner, failing to quit premises and two counts of stalking or intimidation.  
     
      
    11 When initially spoken to by police, the applicant denied any involvement in the offence. When the matter was first listed for trial, the applicant pleaded not guilty but the trial did not then proceed. He did however subsequently enter a plea of guilty. The sentencing judge was disposed to accept, as an explanation for the delay, the need for the applicant’s legal representatives to examine his fitness to be tried. The plea of guilty of course had the tangible benefit of relieving the victim from the ordeal of having to give evidence. In any event, the sentencing judge allowed the applicant a discount of 20% from the otherwise appropriate sentence for his plea of guilty. 
     
      
    12 The sentencing judge found that whilst on remand the applicant had been assaulted on several occasions and that, as a consequence, his time in custody had been “a fairly terrifying experience”. At least one of those attacks appears to have occurred even though the applicant was in protective custody at the time. His Honour observed that the applicant still entertained fears about attacks from other inmates. His Honour also accepted that the applicant had indicated a preparedness to seek counselling in order to address his offending behaviour.  
     
      
    13 A psychologist, Dr Kathryn Wakely, administered a number of tests to the applicant. She said that according to static 99, which is an actuarial instrument designed to estimate the probability of recidivism, the applicant was assessed as being “within the high range of risk of sexual reoffending”. It is common ground that his Honour erred in referring to that risk as “very high”.  
     
      
    14 His Honour was also prepared to accept that the applicant had expressed “some slight upset about this girl” although he was not prepared to extend any leniency to the applicant for having demonstrated remorse. 
     
      
    15 The sentencing judge explained his view of the objective gravity of the offence in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        I said on a previous occasion I cannot think of anything worse, any greater nightmare for a woman, than to be dragged from a street by a complete stranger, forced under a building and then raped. Apart from the risk of getting some horrible infection, the risk of serious injury and death must have been something that weighed upon that poor unfortunate girl while all this was happening, and probably ever since. It is, I suppose, not difficult to imagine that she would, for the rest of her life, be very scared about walking on her own anywhere at all. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        It is, in my opinion, worse than many similar offences because of the degree of force and violence, the threat of death, and the fact it was penile rape on a sixteen year old. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown has submitted this was an offence which would be regarded, or should be regarded as more serious than the mid range offence. I agree. It is hard to work out what is a worst category offence, because anything can be worse than something else. One can never get to an end of things that could be worse than somebody else’s version of a criminal offence. But in my view, this assault, and these facts, make it an offence which is of the worst type. He has pleaded guilty, he has to be given a discount for that. I do not have to impose a standard non parole period because he has pleaded guilty. However, I take the view that he is a particularly dangerous individual, and in his case that standard non parole period just happens to co-incide with my view of what the minimum period of imprisonment should be. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Some benefit is given to him for his youth , and of course the sentence is fixed having regard to the 20 percent discount. 
        
       
       
      Ground 1 
       
       
      His Honour erred in his characterisation of the offence as being an offence “of the worst type 
      ” 
       
      
    16 There can be no doubt that the offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty revealed criminality of a high order. Any offence involving a sexual assault upon a young person, particularly in circumstances such as the present case, is deserving of the community’s condemnation. The penalties available for such offences reflect that view. In R v AEM (Snr), KEM and MM [2002] NSWCCA 58 this Court observed that “[i]t must be stressed that all members of our society including our young people must be free to lawfully use the streets without fear of being subjected to either physical or sexual assault. The long term effects of the trauma invariably encountered by victims of this form of attack are well documented” [at par 94].  
     
      
    17 There were a number of features of the present case which bore on the objective gravity of the offence and the sentencing judge quite properly took them into account. For example, although the infliction of actual bodily harm was an element of the offence, the victim was nevertheless exposed to a number of physical assaults. She was also subjected to verbal threats. Her humiliation would inevitably have been increased by the applicant’s offensive remark to her that “you want it, don’t you?” It is also to be recalled that the victim was only 16. Furthermore, the applicant was on conditional liberty at the time of the offence.  
     
      
    18 Nevertheless, there were a number of matters upon which the applicant was able to rely which served to ameliorate the otherwise appropriate sentence. Prominent amongst them were his plea of guilty, his youth and his apparent immaturity, his troubled early life and the precarious circumstances in which he was serving his sentence. Moreover, although he had prior convictions, none were of a sexual nature. There was also evidence that he had began to mature and that he was prepared to undertake programs which would enable him to address his offending behaviour. 
     
      
    19 It is trite law that an appellate court should not lightly interfere with a sentencing judge’s assessment of where a particular offence lies in the range of objective seriousness. The authorities which support that proposition are conveniently collected in this Court’s decision in Boney v R [2008] NSWCCA 165 [at 105], a case in which this Court nevertheless intervened and substantially reduced sentences for a variety of offences which largely involved instances of sexual assault. In doing so the Court found that the sentencing judge in that case (who by coincidence is the same judge who sentenced the present applicant) had erred in his assessment of the objective gravity of many of the offences in question and in particular had erred in characterising certain of the offences as “offences of the worst kind”. Hulme J, who wrote the leading judgment and with whom the other members of the court agreed, reached that conclusion after a “comparison with many offences against these sections with which the courts have to deal” (at par 111). 
     
      
    20 Section 61J(2) relevantly provided at the time that: 
     
      
       
        
        circumstances of aggravation 
         means circumstances in which:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) at the time of, or immediately before or after, the commission of the offence, the alleged offender maliciously inflicts actual bodily harm on the alleged victim or any other person who is present or nearby, or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) at the time of, or immediately before or after, the commission of the offence, the alleged offender threatens to inflict actual bodily harm on the alleged victim or any other person who is present or nearby by means of an offensive weapon or instrument, or 
        
       
       
        
        (c) the alleged offender is in the company of another person or persons, or 
        
       
       
        
        (d) the alleged victim is under the age of 16 years, or 
        
       
       
        
        (e) the alleged victim is (whether generally or at the time of the commission of the offence) under the authority of the alleged offender, or 
        
       
       
        
        (f) the alleged victim has a serious physical disability, or 
        
       
       
        
        (g) the alleged victim has a serious intellectual disability. 
        
       
      
    21 It is well established that in seeking to establish the present offence the Crown may rely upon one or more circumstances of aggravation in addition to that which is specifically identified in the charge. It was in that context that counsel for the applicant pointed out that there were a number of circumstances of aggravation identified in s 61J which did not feature in the commission of the present offence. 
     
      
    22 As this court said in R v Twala (unrep, 4 November 1994, NSWCCA) “to characterise any case as being in the worst case category, it must be possible to point to particular features which are of very great heinousness and it must be possible to postulate the absence of facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime (as distinct from subjective features mitigating the penalty to be imposed)” [at p3]. 
     
      
    23 That said, I have not overlooked that in Veen v The Queen (No2) (1988) 164 CLR 465, a majority of the High Court after observing that the maximum penalty is intended for the worst category of case, said “[t]hat does not mean that a lesser penalty must be imposed if it be possible to envisage a worse case: ingenuity can always conjure up a case of greater heinousness” [at 478].  
     
      
    24 It is of course always ultimately a matter for a sentencing judge to assess where a particular matter lies on the scale of objective gravity, but in my view a sentencing judge should be loathe to determine that a case falls into the worst category in circumstances in which no submission to that effect has been made by the Crown. The representative of the Crown appearing on sentence in the present case submitted that the offence “should be regarded as more serious than the mid-range offence”.  
     
      
    25 In all the circumstances I am persuaded that the sentencing judge erred in going beyond the characterisation of the offence that was advanced by the Crown. Serious as the current offence is, it was simply not open in my view for the sentencing judge to conclude that it fell into the worst category of case. I would uphold Ground 1. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 The sentence was manifestly excessive 
       
      
    26 At the forefront of the applicant’s submission in respect of this ground was the contention that the sentencing judge’s starting point for the present sentence, before the discount for the plea of guilty was applied, must have been a sentence of imprisonment of 18 years 8 months. Counsel submitted that when it was borne in mind that the maximum penalty was 20 years imprisonment, and that proper account had to be taken of the other favourable subjective features of the applicant’s case, the starting point adopted by his Honour indicated that the ultimate sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    27 To further demonstrate the point that the sentence was manifestly excessive, the applicant also called in aid statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission for the period between February 2003 and December 2007. The limitations of that kind of statistical information are well-known. That is not to say however that in a particular case that it has no utility. 
     
      
    28 What that material reveals is that of the 89 offenders dealt with during the relevant period, 87 received sentences of full-time imprisonment for this offence. Of those 87 offenders, 80% received total sentences of between 4 and 12 years imprisonment. Only one offender, who was also sentenced for other matters, received a sentence longer than 14 years imprisonment. Of the 45 offenders, who like the applicant, were sentenced to non-consecutive terms of imprisonment, 80% received total sentences of between 3 years 6 months and 10 years imprisonment. None of those offenders received a total sentence longer than 14 years. Of those 45 offenders, 80% received non-parole periods of between 2 and 7 years and none received a non-parole period longer than 9 years. From that material it can be deduced that the total term and the non-parole period imposed on the applicant are the longest non-consecutive terms imposed for this offence since the introduction of standard non-parole periods.  
     
      
    29 Closer analysis of the statistical information reveals that, in the relevant period, 22 offenders have been sentenced to full-time imprisonment after having been convicted at trial. Even more revealing is the fact that both the total term and the non-parole period imposed on the applicant were longer than any sentence imposed on any offender after trial since the introduction of the standard non-parole period. The applicant, it is to be recalled, not only pleaded guilty but had other factors that he could rely upon to mitigate the otherwise appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    30 In short, the statistical material to which I have referred serves to confirm my own initial impression that the sentence imposed upon the applicant was manifestly excessive. In forming that impression I have also paid some regard to what may be loosely described as comparable cases, including the decision of this court in Doherty v R [2006] NSWCCA 133, to which our attention was drawn in oral submissions. Accordingly, I would uphold Ground 2. 
     
      
    31 In view of the conclusion which I have reached in respect of the two grounds of appeal, it is necessary for the court to intervene and resentence the applicant. In considering what sentence should now be imposed, I have had regard to an affidavit affirmed by the applicant. It reveals that he remains in protective custody but that he is otherwise progressing satisfactorily. In his affidavit, the applicant also indicates that he is ashamed of his actions.  
     
      
    32 The various features of the case to which I referred earlier incline me to the view that the present offence lies above the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind. Nevertheless, in light of the applicant’s plea of guilty and the other favourable matters of a subjective nature upon which he is entitled to rely, I am of the view that it is appropriate to depart from the standard non-parole period. In so concluding I am acutely aware of the fact that it nonetheless takes its place as “a reference point, or benchmark, or sounding board or guidepost”: R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 [at 122]. 
     
      
    33 It is appropriate to make a finding of “special circumstances” to enable the applicant to have the benefit of an extended period of supervision in the community. That will enable him to continue to address his various problems following his release from what is his first sentence of imprisonment. In structuring the sentence I would maintain the same proportion between the non-parole period and the overall term that the sentencing judge selected. 
     
      
    34 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1 Grant leave to appeal. 
       
       
      2 Allow the appeal. 
       
       
      3 Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court. 
       
       
      4 In substitution therefore sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of 8 years to commence on 3 December 2006 with a total term of imprisonment of 12 years to commence on 3 December 2006. The total term will expire on 2 December 2018 and the non-parole period will expire on 2 December 2014 on which date the applicant will be eligible for release on parole. 
       
      
    35 GROVE J: I agree with the judgment of Buddin J. I wish only to comment upon two aspects which attracted my attention in the sentence imposed below. I am conscious of the precautions that need to be taken about the use of statistics but it has to be said that it was surprising that a youth of 18 would have been the recipient of the longest recorded sentence that those statistics show.36 The second matter that required examination was the circumstance of the parliamentary prescribed maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment but the starting point chosen by his Honour was obviously only one year and four months less than the maximum.37 With those matters noted, and for the reasons given I agree with the orders Buddin J proposes.38 PRICE J: I agree with Buddin J and the additional comments of Grove J.39 GROVE J: The orders therefore will be as proposed by Buddin J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: This is a Crown appeal asserting the manifest inadequacy of sentence. The challenge is against a decision of Adams J in an application to redetermine an existing life sentence pursuant to Schedule 1 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, whereby his Honour declined to set a specified term for the sentence but set a non parole period of 25 years. Mr Frearson SC, Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, who appeared with Ms Girdham for the appellant informed the Court that it was not sought that the order fixing a non parole period be set aside in its entirety so as to effectively imprison the respondent for his natural life but it was sought that there be a non parole period fixed greater than 25 years. In an exchange with the Bench Mr Frearson suggested that an order which “adds a number of years, perhaps four, to the non parole period” would be appropriate. 
     
      
    3 The background, which includes a multiplicity of serious crimes having been committed by the respondent is complicated and it would be less than candid not to state that some imprecision which permeates the proceedings at first instance gave some initial concern. Having regard to the applicability of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (pursuant to clause 8 of Schedule 1) there exists a power of remitter if such is needed however, as acknowledged by Mr Frearson and for reasons to which I will turn, the issue for this Court reduced into a comparatively narrow compass and the appeal can be determined despite the existence of some imprecision. 
     
      
    4 The respondent was born on 22 April 1955. His first recorded appearance was before a Children’s Court in 1971 for stealing a motor vehicle. On 3 September 1980 he was convicted at Sydney District Court for supplying a prohibited drug and sentence was deferred upon his entering a recognizance to be of good behaviour for three years. On 26 February 1982 he was convicted, again at Sydney District Court, of armed robbery and he was called up for breach of the recognizance which he had earlier entered. For the armed robbery he was sentenced to four years hard labour with a non-parole period of one year commencing on 24 February 1982 and for the offence upon which he was called up, to two years hard labour with a non-parole period of twelve months.  
     
      
    5 It follows that the parole period was current when the respondent committed the next three offences although he was obviously in custody when he committed the third of them.  
     
      
    6 The respondent was arrested on 29 June 1983 and charged with the murder of John Mitchell on 18 June 1983 at Whale Beach and with committing on the same date and at the same place an assault upon and an attempted robbery of a quantity of cocaine from Bruce Kitamura whilst the offender was armed with a revolver. That revolver was used to kill Mr Mitchell. An alleged co-offender was arrested on 2 July 1983.  
     
      
    7 On 27 November 1983 the respondent was in custody at 12 Wing of the Metropolitan Remand Centre at Malabar. Another inmate was Anthony William Cameron who died on that day as a result of narcotic (heroin) poisoning. As I shall later describe, Cameron was the victim of the second murder committed by the respondent. 
     
      
    8 In November 1984 the respondent and the alleged co-offender were tried at Central Criminal Court before O’Brien CJ of Cr D and a jury for the offences committed at Whale Beach in 1983. The alleged co-offender was acquitted by the jury but the respondent was found guilty on both counts. On 11 March 1985 the respondent was sentenced to penal servitude for life on each count. O’Brien CJ of Cr D noted the recommendation by the jury for leniency and expressed his view that there were two reasons for it. First, he said that he had observed an emotional reaction by some of the jurors at the time the verdicts were returned and, second, he noted that assertions had been made by the respondent that he had “accidentally shot a drug dealer”. In fact Mr Mitchell and his fiancée were innocent house guests staying overnight on their way to Bellingen and they knew nothing of the clandestine activity of drug dealing which Kitamura conducted at the premises. An appeal by the respondent against the conviction and sentence was dismissed in this Court on 2 May 1986.  
     
      
    9 In the meantime, on 28 February 1986 the respondent was charged with murdering Anthony William Cameron at Malabar on 27 November 1983. He was tried before Enderby J and a jury and in April 1987 he was convicted. On 28 May 1987 his Honour imposed upon him a further sentence of penal servitude for life. An appeal was dismissed by this Court on 8 April 1991.  
     
      
    10 It should be observed that, absent significant diminution of culpability by mitigating circumstances, pursuant to the then s 19 of the Crimes Act 1900 penal servitude for life as punishment for murder was mandatory. 
     
      
    11 Following the passage of the Sentencing Act 1989 it became possible, subject to conditions, for prisoners serving existing life sentences to apply for the setting of determinate impositions. This procedure was similar to and has now been replaced by Schedule 1 to the 1999 Act. As above recounted, the respondent was in custody serving three life sentences. 
     
      
    12 The respondent made an application which was refused by Allen J on 18 August 1995. In expressing his reasons his Honour referred to the murder at Malabar as “a cold, calculated, deceitful assassination”. He concluded that it would not be safe to release the respondent into the community and that he had not been at that point rehabilitated, however he added that there were some signs that progress towards rehabilitation may be underway. He anticipated that at a renewed application there might be a better opportunity to measure any rehabilitation.  
     
      
    13 A further application was heard and dismissed by Adams J on 19 November 1999. His Honour ordered that the respondent be restrained from making another application for a period of two years. He found that the killing of Mr Mitchell fell within the category of worst cases of murder, that the killing of Cameron was “a cold blooded, pre planned murder for reward”. He expressed the opinion that were he then resentencing the respondent he would have made an order so as to require the respondent to serve the term of his natural life, but he was mindful of the statutory requirement to consider matters, especially progress towards rehabilitation, with the benefit of hindsight. Although he considered that the respondent had shown no remorse, he found that it was possible to discern the commencement of genuine rehabilitation. 
     
      
    14 A new application came again before Adams J on 28 March 2008. On 4 July 2008 his Honour redetermined the sentences imposed for the murder and robbery at Whale Beach and set a non-parole period in respect of the murder at Malabar. For the murder of John Mitchell the respondent was resentenced to a term of twenty six years imprisonment commencing on 29 June 1983 and expiring on 28 June 2009 with a non-parole period commencing on 29 June 1983 and expiring on 4 July 2008. For the assault whilst armed and the attempted robbery of Kitamura the respondent was resentenced to a total term of twenty five years two months imprisonment commencing on 29 June 1983 and expiring on 28 June 2008 with a non parole period commencing on 29 June 1983 and expiring on 4 July 2008. 
     
      
    15 This appeal does not challenge the redeterminations of the sentences in respect of the murder of Mr Mitchell and the attempted robbery of Kitamura. His Honour expressed as his reason for departing from the statutory proportion between total term and non-parole period in these resentences that he did not consider it appropriate to impose sentences which would substantially exceed the period which the respondent had already served. Although no challenge against these redeterminations is made, the commission of the offences remains relevant. 
     
      
    16 Clause 3(1) (b) of Schedule 1 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “3 (1) In considering an application in relation to an existing life sentence, the Supreme Court is to have regard to: 
        
       
       
        
         (a) …. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) all offences, wherever and whenever committed, of which the offender has been convicted……” 
          
         
        
       
      
    17 Adams J observed that the sentence of life imprisonment originally imposed for the offence involving Kitamura was most unusual. It would have been unlikely that it would have been imposed if that offence had been committed in isolation but in 1985 it was not unusual for sentences for multiple offences to reflect criminality in total, a practice which is now contrary to the approved approach of individual assessment specified in the later decision of the High Court in Pearce v The Queen 1998 194 CLR 610. 
     
      
    18 In relation to the murder of Cameron which is the subject of this appeal, earlier mention was made to what was referred to as imprecision. It was the Crown case that the respondent had been approached by a fellow prisoner named Lo Surdo who feared that Cameron was going to give evidence against him at a forthcoming trial and the respondent agreed to murder Cameron in return for payment by way of a pound of heroin. On 27 November 1983 the respondent provided Cameron with a substitute which purported to be but was not in fact heroin. Cameron either snorted or injected the substance, which of course did not have the desired effect and when Cameron complained the respondent then gave him some heroin of very high purity, which Cameron then either snorted or injected with fatal consequence. Some time after Cameron’s death the respondent in conversation with another prisoner, Crawford, and later again in a conversation with a former prisoner Murray, who was visiting him, said that he had killed Cameron for Lo Surdo. These assertions by the Crown were recited in a document entitled “Statement of Facts” prepared and served on the respondent in accordance with the procedure which has been adopted for dealing with applications of this kind. A Notice of Reply to the Statement of Facts, signed by a solicitor acting for the respondent stated, inter alia, that “the applicant (respondent) accepts that the Statement of Facts sets out the Crown case.” That language obviously avoided an acknowledgement of the truth of the Crown allegations. Senior counsel for the respondent pointed out that the Statement of Facts was couched not only in terms of Crown allegation but also recounted extracts from the unsworn statement at trial of the respondent, in which he denied the conversations with Murray and Crawford and said that he had no transaction with Cameron and was not responsible in any way for his death. 
     
      
    19 Although the documentation of the respondent was in terms abovementioned, at the commencement of the hearing before Adams J senior counsel stated that the “notice of reply indicated that the applicant accepts the statement of facts set out in the Crown case and appended the report of Professor Bell and the report of Dr Khan”. Clearly that reference to the statement of facts must be understood as excluding the recitation relating to the respondent’s case at trial which would traverse the verdict. However, some obscurity was later introduced when, in the context of discussion about the “contract” to kill Cameron and the disputation by the respondent recorded for example in an interview with Dr Khan counsel said “and we say there is a key distinction here because the applicant (respondent) is not accepting the Crown case. He is accepting that he told lies and that put him where he is today and he told lies about his involvement with Mr Cameron’s death.” 
     
      
    20 The intent of the procedure requiring the production of a Statement of Facts is obviously to enable a judge being required to consider redetermination to have a foundation of facts when it is inevitably going to be many years after the events when an application can be made and it would be impossible to re-assemble witnesses. Nor was the procedure designed to allow retrial of the issue of guilt. I am conscious that there are now few pre-1989 impositions of life sentence which have the potential to be brought before the Court for redetermination, but I have detailed what happened in this instance in order to specify that the documentation should not be drafted so as to enable avoidance style of “pleading”. It is plain from the construct of the schedule that the issue of guilt is not to be retried and if it is intended to dispute collateral facts not traversing the verdict, the ambit of the dispute should be delineated. What happened in the present case demonstrated why as a matter of practicality this needs to be done. 
     
      
    21 Obviously the respondent could not, and did not, rely upon his unsworn statement at trial which amounted to a denial of guilt. On 18 August 1995 he gave evidence before Allen J but this was limited in its focus essentially to matters of post conviction conduct and the likelihood of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    22 However, on 28 March 2008 the respondent again gave evidence, on this occasion before Adams J, and his evidence in chief included: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. When you conducted your trial you were in complete denial? 
        
       
       
        
         A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
         Q. You were in 12 wing on that day, where (sic) you? 
        
       
       
        
         A. Yes I was. 
        
       
       
        
         Q. And you were using heroin? 
        
       
       
        
         A. Yes I was. 
        
       
       
        
         Q. And you were the person, one of the people in the gaol who had a syringe? 
        
       
       
        
         A. Yes I was. 
        
       
       
        
         Q. And it was your syringe that was responsible for Mr Cameron’s death? 
        
       
       
        
         A. Yes it was. I take responsibility for that foolish action. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: 
        
       
       
        
         Q. What foolish action? 
        
       
       
        
         A. Having that syringe and I shared it with him. That was the direct cause of his death. 
        
       
       
        
        HAESLER: 
        
       
       
        
         Q. Do you tell his Honour that so far as the allegations by the prisoner informants and informers that you still can’t accept what they say as being the truth either? 
        
       
       
        
         A. No, no. I think they said what they thought would assist him to get out of gaol which couldn’t have been further from the truth. 
        
       
       
        
         Q. But by telling lies and going into denial back then you have to accept, don’t you, that you can’t reverse time? 
        
       
       
        
         A. No, I accept the jury’s verdict and I am responsible for the death of Anthony Cameron. 
        
       
       
        
         Q. And you are, in a way--? 
        
       
       
        
         A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
         Q. -- even on your own version of events? 
        
       
       
        
         A. Yes 
        . 
        ” 
        
       
       
       And in cross examination: 
       
       
        
        “Q. Mr Main, just a moment ago you spoke about the death of Mr Cameron? 
        
       
       
        
         A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
         Q. And you said that you felt responsible. What did you mean when you said that you felt responsible? 
        
       
       
        
         A. If I had not let him use the syringe he would not have had the injection that killed him. 
        
       
       
        
        ….. 
        
       
       
        
         Q. What do you think about your responsibility? 
        
       
       
        
         A. It’s hard to explain. I feel responsible. If I hadn’t done that he would still be alive today probably. 
        
       
       
        
         Q. Are you saying you feel responsible because you were reckless in what you did? 
        
       
       
        
         A. Yes in lending him the syringe and using the heroin with him. It was a direct cause of his death. ” 
        
       
      
    23 That evidence, if accepted and despite the equivocal acknowledgement of “responsibility”, contradicted the respondent’s guilt of murder whether intentional or as a result of reckless indifference. In his reasons Adams J, under a heading “Facts” summarized the Crown allegations above set out, referred to the respondent’s denial in his unsworn statement at trial and concluded “the jury accepted the evidence of the informers and the applicant (respondent) was convicted.” His Honour later stated that “the applicant (respondent) gave some brief evidence about his involvement in the Cameron death, saying that he shared the syringe with him and that this was the direct cause of his death.”  
     
      
    24 The Crown correctly pointed out that this version of “sharing the syringe” is contradictory of the evidence of Crawford and Murray that the respondent had said that he had done the killing “for Charles Lo Surdo”. Although it is imprecise, his Honour’s statement (which appears in the extract which is about to be cited) that he could scarcely evaluate the respondent’s present evidence as against that of the informants (Crawford and Murray) is taken to indicate an acceptance of the latter for the purpose of sentence redetermination. 
     
      
    25 Adams J stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “The particular substantial aggravating matters here are that this was the second murder committed by the applicant and that it appeared that the applicant acted at the instance of another criminal to prevent the victim from giving evidence. A complicating feature is that the applicant has now given a sworn account of how Mr Cameron met his death. It will be recalled that the Crown case, which relied on prison informants, was that the applicant had told them that Mr Cameron was killed in order to prevent him from giving evidence on behalf of the Crown in an impending prosecution. The accused’s initial denial that he had been in 12 Wing at the relevant time was contradicted by prison officers who placed him there at the material time. If the jury accepted their evidence and concluded that, indeed the accused was present despite his earlier denial, and considered that his later acceptance that he was there was opportunistic they may well have rejected the whole of his account for that reason. Moreover, in accepting that the applicant admitted his involvement in the death of Mr Cameron, as asserted by the informers, it was not necessary for them to have positively accepted the whole of that evidence which, having regard to its character, was inherently unreliable. It is scarcely possible for me to evaluate the applicant’s present evidence as against that of those informants. 
        
       
       
        
        At the same time, the applicant did not explain in his evidence here – although he was not asked either by his own counsel or by the prosecutor – how it was that Mr Cameron died from an overdose or whether he was aware of Lo Surdo’s apparent interest in the victim’s demise – and one can think of other issues upon which (if this matter were really controversial) the applicant might have been cross-examined. Certainly, he made himself available for that cross-examination. I think it implicit in his evidence, and he was not cross-examined on this aspect, that he provided the syringe but not the heroin. At the same time, this account is far from convincing and, of course, he has a motive for minimising his involvement. Nevertheless, I think I should accept the submission of Mr Haesler SC for the applicant that, without going behind the verdict, there is room for doubt that the death of Mr Cameron was quite the cold, calculated, planned murder of a would-be witness as I had previously thought. I am also minded to accept that the applicant was himself affected by having taken heroin at the time he shared his syringe with Mr Cameron. ” 
        
       
       
      
    26 I would comment in passing that I would not, with respect, accept a proposition that the evidence of a prison informer is necessarily inherently unreliable. A warning that evidence from such a source may be unreliable is required at common law and pursuant to statute, but this is only required if the evidence is unfavourable to an accused. It demonstrates that such evidence should not be categorized as inherently unreliable that such a requirement is absent in the event that the evidence is favourable to an accused: R v Robinson [2003] NSWCCA 188. 
     
      
    27 Although his Honour’s expression is inconclusive, his reference to the implication in the respondent’s testimony that he supplied the syringe but not the heroin is contradictory of his Honour’s apparent acceptance of the Statement of Facts which included the statement that, “when Cameron complained that the substance did not have the desired effect the applicant gave the victim the pure heroin which once again he either snorted or had injected.” It must be accepted that the respondent supplied the heroin to Cameron and it is on that basis that the alleged inadequacy of sentence should be gauged. 
     
      
    28 In this Court senior counsel for the respondent expressly accepted that he could not resist the proposition that the killing of Cameron was a “worst case murder”. That could hardly be the situation if the respondent was simply “responsible” for sharing a syringe in the fashion which he described in the testimony to which his Honour referred. But the evidence was not inconsistent with the proposition that the respondent was himself affected by an injection of heroin and that there was room for doubt that the respondent’s crime was “quite the cold, calculated, planned murder of a would be witness” as he had previously thought when dealing with the earlier application. 
     
      
    29 The Crown submitted that Adams J underestimated the objective gravity of the offence. As is indicated in the foregoing, there are included in his Honour’s remarks observations which suggest an assessment of some matters in a more favourable light for the respondent than the Crown case of killing for the promised reward of a parcel of illicit drug. Whilst greater precision and therefore clarity would be desirable, an exercise to attempt to reconcile the assertions of the respondent reflecting a lesser culpability with the higher culpability contended by the Crown is unnecessary if it be the case that intervention by this Court is not called for even though the Crown case is accepted. 
     
      
    30 It was also submitted that his Honour placed too much weight on the prospect of rehabilitation. It is not contended that it was erroneous to perceive some such prospect. The weight which is given to something which is predicted but cannot be determined because of its inherent future nature is obviously a matter upon which estimates may differ. The assessment by Adams J is not shown to be wrong. In any event, as later reference will show, the actual release of the respondent will be conditional upon demonstration, inter alia, to the parole authority that the respondent has at a time in the future when it is a matter for deliberation that he can lead a normal, lawful life, in other words that rehabilitation is achieved as distinct from forecast. 
     
      
    31 The categorization of the killing in the worst case class is reflected in the determination to leave the life sentence in place. Whilst this Court is not bound by concessions such as that in the exchange earlier mentioned, the issue effectively reduced to whether this Court should intervene to increase the non parole period for, in accordance with it, something in the order of four years. Although the foregoing reveals what I have described as imprecisions and some obscurity concerning the conclusiveness of findings at first instance, the issue as articulated by the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions was appropriate and this Court is in a position to rule upon it. That is undertaken on the assumption of the correctness of the Crown allegations of fact, critically that the killing was performed for a “contracted” payment of a pound of heroin. 
     
      
    32 For comparison purposes counsel have helpfully produced a schedule of redeterminations of pre-1989 life sentences made either pursuant to s 13A of the 1989 Act or Schedule 1 of the 1999 Act. This schedule refers to the setting of non-parole periods (or expressions of minimum term) in connection with a life sentence which is to remain in place, thus exposing an offender to the potential of revocation of parole during the term of his or her natural life. 
     
      
    33 It suffices to refer briefly to only some of these to demonstrate that the non-parole period set by Adams J is not inconsistent with sentencing pattern and appears to be within the range of the sound exercise of sentencing discretion. If that be so the ground of appeal that it was manifestly inadequate in terms of the non-parole period must therefore fail.  
     
      
    34 Some of the relevantly comparable instances which have been scheduled are as follows:  
     
      
    35 McCafferty (15 October 1991). The offender stabbed or shot three strangers on different occasions. He had some mental problems but a defence of mental illness was rejected at trial and diminished responsibility was not available. On redetermination a non-parole period of 20 years. 
     
      
    36 Rees (12 August 1993). The offender shot two men during a robbery as well as a police officer who came to make enquiries and he wounded a second officer who was attempting to arrest him. He was convicted on three counts of murder and one count of malicious wounding with intent to avoid apprehension. On redetermination a non-parole period of 27 years. 
     
      
    37 Hitchins (12 June 1993). The offender robbed and stabbed a taxi driver with co-offenders. Later he robbed another taxi driver with a different co-offender placing the victim in the boot of the vehicle and setting fire to it. Convicted on two counts of murder. On redetermination a non-parole period of 24 years. 
     
      
    38 Lyttle (6 March 1996). The offender set fire to a hotel killing fifteen people and injuring twenty two. Indicted and convicted on four counts of murder. Evidence showed that he had lit four other fires at about the same time. On redetermination a non-parole period of 28 years. 
     
      
    39 Robinson (28 November 1997). The offender shot two people, a seventy four year old woman and her fifty three year old son. He did this for financial gain. Whilst in custody he was convicted of conspiracy to murder a witness in a forthcoming trial. On redetermination a non-parole period of 16 years. 
     
      
    40 Picknell (10 November 1998). The offender participated in a raid in company upon a boatshed. Both the caretaker and a police officer who came to investigate were shot dead. The offender in the course of time was released on licence but licence was revoked and he was returned to custody. Upon redetermination for sentences on two counts of murder a non-parole period amounting to approximately 24 years was set.  
     
      
    41 Constantiou (4 June 1999). The offender committed a series of robberies on older men, three of whom died as a result of mugging. Some of the offences were committed in company and on one occasion by the offender alone. A redetermination at first instance of a life sentence with a non-parole period of 30 years was varied on appeal to a total term of 35 years with a non-parole period of 25 years.  
     
      
    42 In addition to that material the Court was supplied with a tabulation of what were described as redeterminations in respect of “contract/gangland killings”. All of them can be distinguished from the situation of the respondent in that they related to single offences but in no case was a non parole period exceeding 25 years imposed and this applied to only two of them. In most of these cases the non-parole period was considerably less than 25 years.  
     
      
    43 It is important to stress that the high level of criminality exhibited by the respondent in his multiple offences remains reflected in the maintenance of the head term of imprisonment for life. The specification of a non-parole period merely sets a date of eligibility and does not imply a probability of release. The setting of a non-parole period establishes only a date upon which release is possible. Whether actual release in fact occurs is dependent upon a decision of the parole authority which is obliged pursuant to s 135 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 not to make an order for parole unless it is appropriate, having regard, inter alia, to the need to protect the safety of the community and the likelihood of the respondent being able to adapt to normal lawful community life. It is also obvious, but if the respondent is granted parole and breaches any of its conditions he is liable to be returned to custody at any time during his lifetime, having regard to the over-arching and remaining indeterminate head sentence.  
     
      
    44 The non-parole period is compatible with those set for crimes of a similar level of seriousness to those of the respondent. Even if what have been referred to as imprecisions in the remarks on resentence by Adams J should be categorized as error, this Court retains a lively discretion to dismiss a Crown appeal contending inadequacy of sentence. In all the circumstances I would, if required, invoke that discretion and dismiss this appeal.

     ADEELS PALACE PTY LTD v MOUBARAKADEELS PALACE PTY LTD v BOU NAJEM 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Giles JA. 
     
      
    2 GILES JA: The appellant conducted a business under the name Adeels Palace at premises at Punchbowl, the awning over the entrance to the premises describing it as “ Reception Restaurant”. It held a New Years Eve function at the premises on 31 December 2002-1 January 2003, attended by members of the public on payment of an admission price. In the early hours of 1 January 2003 a dispute on the dance floor escalated, and came to involve a fight between the respondent Mr Anthony Moubarak and a Mr Danny Abbas. Mr Abbas left the premises and returned with a gun. Mr Moubarak and the respondent Mr Antoin Bou Najem were shot.  
     
      
    3 The respondents brought proceedings against the appellant in the District Court, claiming damages for negligence or breach of contract.  
     
      
    4 Sorby DCJ held that the appellant was liable in negligence to the respondents and rejected its contention that Mr Moubarak had been contributorily negligent. His Honour held that the appellant owed the respondents “a general and wide duty … to take care to avoid injuries caused by the unlawful actions of patrons (or invitees) on the premises during the course of the evening of 31.12.02 and early hours of 1.1.03”, and that the duty of care was breached because the appellant’s security arrangements at the time of the function were “far short of what reasonable care and skill required in all the circumstances”. He held that the inadequacy materially contributed to, and so caused, the injuries suffered by the respondents. He did not deal with the alternative basis of liability in contract.  
     
      
    5 Mr Bou Najem’s damages were agreed at $170,000, and Mr Moubarak’s damages were assessed at $1,026,682.98.  
     
      
    6 By its notices of appeal the appellant challenges duty of care, breach and causation. It also complains of the admission of parts of the reports of Mr Richard Jennings tendered by the respondents as expert evidence and the rejection of the report of Dr John McMahon tendered by it as expert evidence. It does not appeal in relation to the assessment of Mr Moubarak’s damages.  
     
      
    7 By notices of contention the respondents seek to uphold the judgments in their favour on the basis of a differently formulated duty of care or alternatively on the basis of liability in contract. 8 For the reasons which follow, in my opinion the challenges to duty of care, breach and causation fail, and there were no errors in the evidentiary rulings material to the result in the proceedings. It is not necessary to consider the notices of contention. The appeals should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      The premises 
       
      
    9 The premises were within a building standing on the street alignment. From the photographs, double doors at the street entry led to stairs up to a landing, the stairs then turning and ascending to another landing and then turning again and ascending to an upper floor level where there were doors into a large room. Within the room there was a seating area for tables and chairs, a bar along the wall on one side of that area, and an adjacent dance floor and a stage in front of the dance floor. There was an opening to a kitchen at one end of the bar, and an office in one corner of the room. 
     
      
    10 As indicated by the bar, the premises were licensed. The licensee at the time was Mr Simon Bazouni, a director and the secretary of the appellant. His co-director was Mr Fouad Kouzi. The licence was an “on-licence (restaurant)”, permitting the service of alcohol together with food between 12 noon and 4 am. The licence stated a seating capacity of 295 persons for the premises.  
     
      
    11 An approval from Bankstown Council authorised the operation of the premises as a place of public entertainment, with a capacity of 283 persons, also between 12 noon and 4 am. Conditions attached to the approval, but it was not suggested that there was breach of the conditions material to the respondents’ proceedings. 
     
      
    12 While it operated as a restaurant, Adeels Palace was often referred to as a nightclub. In a police statement taken after the events at the New Years Eve function Mr Karim El Baz described it as “a nightclub and restaurant that serves Lebanese food”, to which he and his wife went every Saturday night sometimes with their daughters. Ms Olivia Baz described it as “a nightclub which caters for people of Arabic origin, you can get finger food there or you can order dinner”. Her parents went there every Saturday. Mr Moubarak had been going to Adeels Palace since he was a child, and as an adult went with friends and family sometimes on a Saturday night. He said he went without his family “when it was pretty much a nightclub and a restaurant then it turns pretty much a nightclub”.  
     
      
    13 On some occasions the premises were operated as a reception centre for weddings and christenings, and Mr Moubarak said that he had been there for birthday parties. Mr Kouzi said that there were also “community parties or concert; whatever”, but that most buck’s nights were refused.  
     
      
       
      The New Years Eve function 
       
      
    14 The function was attended by a large number of persons. The trial judge said that the exact number was not disclosed in evidence, but there were some estimates. Mr Bou Najem referred to 250 to 300 persons, although it is not clear whether this was his estimate or what someone told him about the capacity of the premises. Mr Moubarak estimated over 400 persons. Whatever the number, Mr Moubarak said that the premises were “packed out, people everywhere”, and Mr Bou Najem said the premises were full up with people sitting and standing. 
     
      
    15 Many family groups attended, with ages ranging from children to the elderly. There were a number of long tables, and the photographs in evidence show that the room was crowded with revellers. There were a band, singers and entertainers during the function. The bar was operating for the sale of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, and waiters brought bottles to the tables.  
     
      
    16 The admission price was $60 per person, which included food but not alcohol. It was payable on entry at a desk on the first landing. Mr Moubarak said he was not given a receipt, Mr Bou Najem said that he was given a receipt, but there was no evidence of terms of entry or the conditions on a receipt.  
     
      
    17 Mr Moubarak arrived with his girlfriend at about 10.30 on the evening of 31 December 2002. There were other members of the public outside the premises, but no one he understood to be connected with Adeels Palace. He paid $120 at the desk, where two women were sitting. The women were not in uniform. He went up into the reception/restaurant room, and joined friends and family seated at a table.  
     
      
    18 Mr Moubarak knew the “owners”, Mr Kouzi and Mr Bazouni, and saw them in the room. Mr Kouzi came to his table to greet his father, himself and his family, and he saw Mr Bazouni seated at another table: they made eye contact and toasted each other from a distance. Apart from the “owners”, he saw only patrons.  
     
      
    19 At some time after midnight Mr Moubarak and his girlfriend went outside for some fresh air, and returned after about 20 minutes. The two women were no longer at the desk, nor was anyone apparently connected with Adeels Palace at the street entry doors or the entry to the reception/restaurant room. Mr Kouzi was the cook and spent his time in the kitchen, but he came back to join the Moubarak family at their table and was having a drink with them when the dispute on the dance floor began. 
     
      
    20 Mr Bou Najem gave evidence through an interpreter, and perhaps for that reason his oral evidence was less extensive that that of Mr Moubarak. He arrived at Adeels Palace at about 11 pm on 31 December 2002. He paid $60 to a woman at the desk on the landing and went in. He joined some friends at a table. He also knew Mr Kouzi, and saw him “everywhere with the people”, talking and celebrating. 
     
      
       
      The dispute and the shooting 
       
      
    21 At about 2.30 am on 1 January 2003 there was a dispute between a number of women on the dance floor. There were a lot of people on the dance floor – Mr El Baz estimated a hundred - and loud music. The occasion for the dispute is not particularly clear, and does not matter.  
     
      
    22 The participants in the dispute included Mr Moubarak’s sister, Layla (or Leila). To Mr Moubarak’s eyes, other women were attacking his sister and her friend, and he got up from the table where he was sitting, went to the dance floor, and took his sister back to the table. He said that he, his father and Mr Kouzi, “all got up at the same time” and that the three of them went to separate the disputants.  
     
      
    23 However, the dispute escalated. Mr Moubarak “heard more screaming then I started seeing people gathering in crowds, and I started seeing chairs getting thrown”. He “starting hearing things breaking, sounded like glass”.  
     
      
    24 From what was said in the police statements, quite a number of men were involved. It was an ugly scene. The statement of Ms Mansour spoke of Mr El Baz being knocked to the floor and kicked, and - 
     
      
       
        
        “11 I then moved back to our table which was located near the back exit door and I noticed about 20 or 30 males approach our table. One of the males in the group who I would describe as being of Lebanese appearance, in his late forties, grey hair, about 168 cms tall, slim build. He was wearing black pants and a grey top. I called the police on my mobile. He looked at me, pointed at me and me motioned with his finger across his throat as if to cut it and said, ‘Your dead.’ I felt very scared and intimidated by his actions. I said, ‘Fuck you’. He then started to run towards me. When he approached me I fell backwards and Olivia tried to stop him. I fell to the ground. He tried to grab me while I was on the floor. I kicked out with both feet and hit him but I don’t know where. I got up and some other males pushed him away. I saw a fight break out between about 20 males near the back exit door. The male that tried to grab me then went around a table and grabbed a bottle of Pepsi and threw it at me. It missed me and I ran away. 
        
       
       
        
        12 There were still fights going on amongst the 20 or so guys. I did not know any of them. A male who is one of the owners of the club approached us and set [sic], ‘Get out here.’ I left out the back exit and I saw some guys in a white car. It was dark and I don’t know what they looked like. The driver of the car said, ‘Hurry up and get out of here because there is going to be guns’.” 
        
       
      
    25 Mr Moubarak saw his father in a far corner attempting to calm things down, and went to get his father. On the way he felt a person grab his wrist. He pulled away, and the person “took a swing at me”. Mr Moubarak “punched him back”, striking him in the face. They exchanged punches two or three times. Mr Moubarak was distracted by a chair thrown at him, which he threw back. He saw the person with whom he had been trading punches leave “towards the exit”, with blood on his face.  
     
      
    26 The trial was conducted on the basis that the person was Mr Abbas, and I will hereafter refer to him by name. 
     
      
    27 Mr Moubarak returned to comfort his mother. He heard people screaming and more glass breaking. He and his mother went towards the kitchen. He heard someone scream out, “He’s got a gun”, and as they were walking into the kitchen he looked back and saw Mr Abbas – whom he recognised by “his size; his appearance; the blood on his face” – with a gun in his hand. Other people were running into the kitchen. Mr Moubarak left the kitchen. He heard gunshots in the kitchen. He took cover. He saw Mr Abbas come out of the kitchen, with the gun, and thought that Mr Abbas was looking for him. Mr Abbas pointed the gun at Mr Moubarak and shot him in the stomach. 
     
      
    28 The gunshots in the kitchen takes the narrative to Mr Bou Najem. He said that he became aware of something happening on the dance floor, and got up. He could hear people screaming and could “see things being thrown like chairs and plates”. He saw people running and they looked scared. He started to walk back to his table, and while he was doing so he heard someone yell, “Gun, gun, run away”. He went straight to the kitchen with a number of other people. He slipped and fell, and as he was getting up saw a man in front of him pointing a gun at him. The man had blood on his face. Again it was common ground that the man was Mr Abbas. He pleaded with Mr Abbas not to shoot him, saying “please, please, please don’t shoot me, I did not do anything, why do you want to shoot me”. Mr Abbas shot him in the leg.  
     
      
    29 The detail and span of events according to Mr Bou Najem differed from that according to Mr Moubarak, and understandably enough neither gave a full account of Mr Abbas’ movements. Mr Moubarak did not give evidence of Mr Abbas leaving the premises and returning, and Mr Bou Najem did not give evidence of Mr Abbas’ movements prior to the encounter in the kitchen. No other witness gave evidence of Mr Abbas leaving the premises and returning with a gun. However, some agreed facts at the trial included - 
     
      
       
        
        “8. During the function there was a physical altercation upon the defendant’s premises at about 2.30 am involving many patrons. 
         
         
        9. The altercation involved items of furniture and glassware being thrown. 
         
         
        10. During the altercation the plaintiff [Mr Moubarak] and a Mr Danny Abbas exchanged punches. 
         
         
        11. The altercation involved, inter alia, the plaintiff and a Mr Danny Abbas, and resulted in blows being exchanged. 
         
         
        12. Soon after the altercation Mr Danny Abbas exited Adeels Palace. 
         
         
        13. Having exited Adeels Palace Mr Abbas re-entered soon after. 
         
         
        14. Upon re-entering Adeels Palace Mr Bou Najem was shot by Mr Abbas. 
         
         
        15. Shortly after Mr Bou Najem was shot, Mr Moubarak was then shot by Mr Abbas.” 
        
       
      
    30 Mr Abbas was charged with offences arising out of these events. He was found guilty, but he successfully appealed and a new trial was ordered (see R v Abbas [2006] NSWCCA 331). The evidence included a letter stating that the Director of Public Prosecutions had directed that there be no further proceedings against him. The common basis remained that the assailant was Mr Abbas.  
     
      
       
      The security arrangements 
       
      
    31 Going first to security arrangements in general, the agreed facts included - 
     
      
       
        
        “7. At all material times a Mr Mohamed Zraika worked for Adeels Palace as licensed security staff.  
         
         
        … 
         
         
        17. Adeels Palace operated a system of closed circuit television cameras on the premises (10 cameras).” 
        
       
      
    32 There was no further evidence of the monitoring of the security cameras or their other use in the control of incidents at the premises, and it appears that they only recorded footage of locations within the premises. One of the expert’s reports described CCTV footage, said to be of very poor quality. The report included - 
     
      
       
        
        “5. Camera three seems to show a constant flow of persons into the club (up the stairs) and post incident, persons making their exit. It does seem to show a person entering at 1828 whom the Plaintiff has identified as ‘the shooter’ and three minutes later this suspect leaving the club again with others. Two minutes later he re-enters the club with friends and a few seconds later the Plaintiff enters the premises with his girlfriend.  
         
         
        6. At 1842 the suspect is seen to run out of the club and one minute later he re-enters again running up the stairs. As he runs up he is seen to be carrying an object in his hand and possibly trying to tuck it into his belt or pocket. This object could be a handgun but the tape quality is not good enough to be sure. At 1845 the suspect leaves the restaurant for the final time and one minute later the Plaintiff is carried out.” 
        
       
      
    33 Camera three was said to show the staircase down to the street entry doors. Even if the time on the footage be corrected to the early hours of 1 January 2003, the comings and goings within a few minutes are hard to reconcile with the other evidence. It was said later in the report that it is difficult to identify one individual from another.  
     
      
    34 The trial judge said - 
     
      
       
        
        “19 Tendered as part of both Plaintiffs’ case on liability was some very poor quality CCTV recording some of the events at Adeels Palace on 31.12.02 and early hours of 1.1.03. The footage was relevant on the question of security in that it showed that such cameras existed on the premises but as to whether they were intended to be preventative or merely provided a visual record of what had occurred in parts of Adeels Palace is not clear. Part of the tapes did show the assailant Mr Abbas leaving Adeels Palace after midnight with many others and returning a short time later. The CCTV tapes tendered, as far as could be seen, did not reveal the presence of security staff on that part of the video tendered.” 
        
       
      
    35 The CCTV footage was not played on appeal. What was shown on it does not seem to have been greatly relied on at the trial, and was not prominent on appeal. 
     
      
    36 Mr Zraika did not give evidence. Mr Kouzi agreed that Mr Zraika was “employed by Adeels to work at Adeels Palace”, although he was “not sure, whether there’s a contract or not” and said that Mr Bazouni dealt with security staff “most of the time”. Mr Bazouni did not give evidence. There was an astonishing nil return to a subpoena to the appellant requiring the production of documents which would have shed light on its engagement of security staff. 
     
      
    37 Mr Kouzi said, in general terms, that security staff were mainly present for every function, and that “security always at the door downstairs”. His evidence included - 
     
      
       
        
        Q. Obviously from your point of view as an owner you would accept that it was important to have security outside the doors at street level? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Because it was important to control who and in what circumstances could come onto the premises firstly? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And who left the premises secondly? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And with respect to those who left the premises, whether or not it was desirable for them to be able to return to the premises thirdly?  
         
        A. They wouldn’t have a clue if these coming back or not. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. If they’d been causing trouble, like the man you say you put out on the street - 
         
        A. Yes  
        
       
       
        
        Q. – whether they should be allowed back. 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. For example, if somebody had blood running down their face, having been involved in some kind of altercation, you would expect the security to take steps to prevent the return of such a person onto your premises? 
         
        A. True.” 
        
       
      
    38 Mr Moubarak did not recall seeing uniformed security guards when he went to the premises for weddings and christenings, but thought there had been security guards when he went for a drink with his friends. They had not been uniformed or wearing badges in the manner of other establishments he had been to. It may be that Mr Kouzi had in mind occasions other than weddings and christenings; in any event, he agreed that it was the practice on previous occasions when functions were to go through to 4 am “to have two solidly built security officers positioned on the street”. The reasons, he agreed, were to deter trouble makers from coming onto the premises, and to assist in the removal of troublemakers from the premises, and he added to look after the cars in the carpark. 
     
      
    39 Mr Kouzi said that there had been “one or two” incidents on earlier occasions, which he described as “just a couple of guys talking to each other and I just escorted one of them out”. Putting aside what seems to have been a euphemism, it is apparent that Mr Kouzi rather than security staff attended to the incidents. However, he was the cook and, apart from “meeting and greeting”, spent his time in the kitchen; he was not a substitute for security staff if security staff were required.  
     
      
    40 Turning to the particular New Years Eve function, the evidence included a letter from the appellant’s solicitors responding to a letter from Mr Moubarak’s solicitors requesting particulars of its defence. The letters were tendered in the respondents’ cases. The questions and their answers were - 
     
      
       
        
        1. Q. If it is asserted that the Defendant had security guards, how many guards is it asserted that the Defendant had on the premises?A. There were at least two security guards retained by the Defendant on the evening your client was allegedly injured. In addition, the proprietors of the business actively participated in the performance of security work on the premises. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Q. What were their designated duties?A. Generally speaking, both guards were assigned to the front door during the early part of the evening. Thereafter, 1 guard was directed upstairs to monitor the patrons whilst the other remained at the front door for the purpose of ensuring unwanted patrons did not come inside. 
        
       
       
        
        3. Q. Did they eject the perpetrator of the act?A. Unknown.  
        
       
       
        
        4. Q. If so, how was it that he was allowed to return to the premises?A. Unknown. 
        
       
       
        
        5. Q. What steps were taken by the Defendant to exclude patrons who had been ejected?A. Ensuring that ejected patrons were refused entry to the Defendant’s premises was the responsibility of the security guards. 
        
       
       
        
        6. Q. What was the Defendant’s policy in relation to ejected patrons?A. Generally speaking, a patron ejected from the premises was not allowed to re-enter. 
        
       
       
        
        7. Q. Did the Defendant at all times have staff securing the door, noting that it was New Years Eve?A. See above. 
        
       
      
    41 The trial judge found that “on the evening of 31.12.02 and early hours of 1.1.03 there were no security staff present at Adeels Palace” (at [52]). This finding was not challenged on appeal. An expert’s report tendered by the appellant referred, presumably on instructions, to it being unfortunate that “an incident during trading resulted in the licensed crowd controller withdrawing from work”. From the balance of the report, this seems to have been a reference to Mr Zraika, but was not borne out in the evidence. 
     
      
    42 The respondents relied on the letters, and other evidence of the general presence of security staff, as evidence that security arrangements of the kind stated in the particulars were recognised by the appellant as necessary for the New Years Eve function. 
     
      
       
      Prior incidents 
       
      
    43 There had been New Years Eve functions on a regular basis, every year. Mr Kouzi did not recall any “problems in terms of crowd violence or any other disturbance” at prior functions. He said that there had been “a few incidents” at Adeels Palace, although he could not recall whether anyone had been seriously injured. No incident book was kept.  
     
      
    44 The respondents tendered COPS reports, of which the trial judge said - 
     
      
       
        
        18 … These records reveal that Adeels Palace and environs had been the focus of police attention because of reported violence. These reported events occurred on 12.12.98, 17.1.99, 31.7.99, 20.2.2000 and 1.1.02.” 
        
       
      
    45 The reports recorded eight incidents over the period December 1998 – April 2000. They amounted to the following. 
     
      
    · At about 3 am on 13 December 1998 three persons “at the location for a function” were “involved in a brawl with other patrons unknown to them”. They did not want police action but “wanted to take civil action against security guards for taking no action”. 
     
      
    · At about 4 am on 17 January 1999 a person was drinking at Adeels Palace with colleagues, and - 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “Two Lebanese males approached the table that the victim and friends were at. One of the POI’s started to abuse one of the victims friends in Lebanese. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The victim has then told POI 1 to relax and the POI has said, ‘What, do you want a bullet in your head?’ POI 1 has then started to punch the victim numerous times to the face and body. POI 2 has also punched the victim during the fight. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Security staff from the club have attempted to break up the fight and the victim has then left the club.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    · At about 12.30 am on 1 August 1999 a man who had been at a bucks party at Adeels Palace left the function and while on the footpath outside the premises took a pistol from an ankle holster and fired two shots into the air. He and others with him went back inside. This was reported by “security of Adel’s [sic] Palace”. The police attended. When the man and others came out to board a hired bus, the man tried to hide the pistol and holster, but it was found. He told the police he was “just being a dickhead”. He was not licenced to hold the pistol. The reports included “premises has intel for firearms”, but this was not explained. 
     
      
    · At about 1.30 am on 20 January 2000 a “brawl” broke out within Adeels Palace. One of the reports recorded “riot occurring – chairs being used as weapons”, and another that “[d]uring the fight one of the owners of the restaurant has received five centimetre cut to his head”. The fight “spilled out onto the street”, and one of the men produced a pistol and fired three shots into the air. The police believed that this was not a shooting attack but “an attempt to make persons in the area panic whilst fleeing the club after the attack”. 
     
      
    · A report for 6 March 2000 was concerned with a licensed premises inspection. It was noted that the security officer was not displaying his security licence as required. The report was otherwise concerned with a suspected illegal immigrant. 
     
      
    · A report for 10 March 2000 was also concerned with a licensed premises inspection. The security guard, identified as Mr Zraika, was not wearing his licence. Two other persons were found “standing on either side of the doorway acting as security guards”. They were unlicensed and one was an illegal immigrant. 
     
      
    · At about 2.20 am on 7 May 2000 a patron went outside, saw two men leaning on his cousin’s car, and told them not to do so. He was later told by a security guard “not to go down stairs as there were a number of people down there and that him and his cousins should not go down there as there might be a fight”. It was later found that someone had kicked and damaged “his” car. 
     
      
    · At about 9 pm on 4 April 2000 shots were fired outside Adeels Palace, and it was later found by a person who had parked his car at the location that it had two gunshot holes. 
     
      
    46 As to the particular New Years Eve function, Mr Kouzi agreed that in the early hours of 1 January 2003, a good deal of time before the shooting, the police attended at the premises in relation to a complaint “concerning behaviour of some patrons at your premises”. He said that he was called out from the kitchen and “escorted the bloke – that he was making the argument – out and I have said that prior to this.” This may have been the occasion earlier mentioned, although at that point in his evidence Mr Kouzi does not seem to have been referring to this New Years Eve function.  
     
      
    47 Mr Moubarak did not recall an earlier incident at the particular function. COPS reports recorded an anonymous call to the police at 1.43 am on 1 January 2003 reporting a “large brawl” with “20 males fighting” at Adeels Palace, and that when the police attended they found no-one fighting and “persons were dispersed by PO”. Another report at 1.44 am was of 20 people in the street “after a party making a noise”. This incident, whatever it was, appears to have been in the street, and its connection with what Mr Kouzi spoke of is unclear, but there was some connection with the premises. 
     
      
       
      The expert evidence 
       
      
    48 The respondents relied on three reports of Mr Jennings, a licensed security consultant. The appellant relied on a report of Mr Tony Zalewski, experienced in public safety, security and related areas. The report of Mr Zalewski responded to Mr Jennings’ reports. The reports were lengthy, and as I have indicated there was complaint as to the admission of parts of Mr Jennings’ reports. In addition, the appellant sought to rely on the report of Dr McMahon, a clinical psychologist, and complained on appeal that the judge had rejected the tender of that report.  
     
      
    49 The most convenient course is to set out from the trial judge’s reasons the passages he extracted from the reports of Messrs Jennings and Zalewski when coming to his finding of breach of duty.  
     
      
    50 The extraction was - 
     
      
       
        
        “54 Both the Plaintiffs and the Defendant called experts. For the Plaintiffs, Mr Richard Jennings, a licensed security consultant was called and his reports tendered [Ex P]. In his first report of 5.10.04 at p 10 Mr Jennings said: 
         
         
          
          ‘The most common duties designated for security officers at restaurant/nightclub type premises in 2002/3, would most commonly include: 
          
         
        
       
      
    · One or more officers standing at the entry door checking the age, sobriety, dress conformity, behaviour and demeanour of person attempting to enter the premises (as per the Liquor Act and Responsible Service of Alcohol regulations). 
     
      
    · One or more officers in the immediate vicinity of the dance floor, where they may be capable of intervening in any potentially confrontational behaviour before it may escalate into a major problem. 
     
      
    · One or more officers patrolling the licensed area generally monitoring any anti-social behaviour or actions contravening the Liquor Act or other regulation. This includes checking utility areas such as toilets to prevent drug trafficking or other problems in these secluded spots.’ 
     
      
       
        
        55. The exact number of patrons at Adeels Palace on 31.12.02 is not in evidence but I have accepted the evidence of both Plaintiffs that the premises was at full capacity, whatever the actual number might be. Mr Jennings bases his conclusion as to the actual number of security staff required at a function such as at Adeels Palace on 31.12.03, on information supplied by his solicitors, including the figure of 400 as to the number of persons Mr Moubarak estimated were at the function. He said at p 11 of his report: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The evidence before me at this time indicates that the restaurant had just one security officer on duty that night (as was allegedly their common practice on Saturday nights). If as alleged, there were 300-400 persons present in the restaurant/nightclub, then I cannot conceive of how one officer could possibly carry out all of the preventative and security intervention procedures which would be required of this number of patrons.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        He said further at p 12: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Based upon what I know of the restaurant’s operations on New Year’s even I would consider that they should have had at least six and possibly up to eight security officers on duty that night. The one or more on the door should have been carrying out a cursory search of all patrons entering aided by some sort of hand held metal detector to ensure firearms did not get in. There should have been at least three closely watching the dance floor depending upon how many person [sic] were on the floor at any one time but in such a position as to quickly see the first signs (verbal or physical) of a problem on that dance floor and being able to intervene within seconds to prevent escalation. Other security officers should have been checking the bar, toilets and other areas of the premises for problems. All of these officers should have been fully licensed under the Act and trained appropriately in the security of licensed premises. Written instructions should have existed which laid down their duties and responsibilities.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        In his report of 27.9.07 at paragraph 13 Mr Jennings said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ’13. With a proper security system in place, implemented by sufficient numbers of licensed security officers, then the person who eventually shot the Plaintiff should not have been permitted to leave and re-enter the venue, certainly without being thoroughly searched upon both entries. It appears as though this attacker left the venue specifically to get the gun, most likely from his car, and under these circumstances would not have been allowed to re-enter with that gun, if properly searched. It is alleged that this attacker had been involved in a fist fight with the Plaintiff and/or other patrons before he went out to get the gun and if there had been an effective security presence, this fact would have been noted and most likely the attacker been ejected without any chance of re-entry that evening.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        56. The Defendant’s expert was Mr Tony Zalewski. He said in his report [Ex 6] at paragraph 12: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ’12.1 A clear understanding between the venue and the security provider about its security arrangements. This generally involves a plan as to the duties to be performed by security personnel and the timing of performance of their duties. Although it is preferred such an arrangement is documented common industry practice is often informal and orally based. This does not mean the system is flawed, especially when the arrangement involves one or two staff rather than a formalised team;12.2 A plan to reduce the potential for incidents occurring in or around the venue including access control and managing incidents of intoxication or violence. Such an approach would typically involve alcohol service strategies; monitoring and supervision of patrons; a hierarchy of control involving responsible staff and management; a venue communication strategy, and liaison policy with external agencies including the police;12.3 Engaging and training staff with an ability to fully comply with the plan. Such training should include operational awareness, responsibilities of key stakeholders such as management and a range of preventative and reactive strategies.12.4 Planning and training for intervention when a problem or potential problem is identified to ensure minimal disruption to the environment and limiting the potential for injury to those who may be present or involved; and12.5 Ensuring staff are able to react appropriately during and after an incident to minimise the impact of an incident upon individuals or the venue operation. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        He was asked at paragraph 37: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ’37 Question 8 – what in your experience is the probability that six or eight security guards could control a fight which escalated within seconds from several women to fifty or more patrons throwing furniture and bottles?Had there been six or eight security staff immediately present and able to respond appropriately at the initial stages  
          it is possible that parties/individuals in conflict might have been separated and the incident controlled 
          . However, this is also contingent upon: 
          
         
        
       
      
    · The personnel being immediately present; 
     
      
    · The personnel are able to identify relevant persons in conflict; 
     
      
    · Are able to control those persons from a further escalation; 
     
      
    · Are able to prevent additional persons entering the melee; and  
     
      
    · Were in proximate location to work as a team rather than individuals.’ (emphasis added) 
     
      
       
        
        He further stated at paragraph 39 - 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ’39 My experience is that an escalation in these circumstances is very difficult to control irrespective of the numbers involved. In particular, those associated or related to active participants inevitably become involved, as either willing or unwilling participants. Many of these participants will try to defuse others however, this just becomes more confusing and generally results in fresh outbreaks as the conflicts snowball.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Mr Zalewski concluded: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ’55 In my opinion, the system of security explained for this venue was not inappropriate for a restaurant and function centre.  
          The venue operators had thought through their general security needs including managing conflicts on the upper level, instructing staff about intoxication and employing the services of security staff for access control purposes at the point of entry from ground level 
          . The fact an incident occurred that escalated is not something the venue could have reasonably foreseen in the circumstances. It certainly was not an incident that typically arose in the venue, especially within the period of about two years previously. There had also not been a previous incident of violence reported during New Years Eve celebrations.56 It is unfortunate an incident earlier during trading resulted in the licensed crowd controller withdrawing from work. This is not common and it would have been very difficult to engage the services of a replacement on such a busy night.’ (emphasis added)” 
          
         
        
       
      
    51 His Honour also referred at [58] to Mr Zalewski’s agreement in his oral evidence “on the need for ‘access controls’ as the ‘front line of defence’ the latter having the purpose of discouraging at least, if not preventing, the return of unruly or troublesome patrons who has [sic] left the premises”.  
     
      
    52 Two page references were given for Mr Zalewski’s agreement in his oral evidence. The evidence at the first of the pages was, in summary, his agreement that one of the purposes of having “two prominent persons on a door” would be to discourage a person trying to return, that if satisfied that a patron who had been in an altercation was the aggressor action would be taken to remove him from the premises, and - 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Having had him leave the premises with blood on his face, you would be particularly astute to do your best to prevent him coming back, wouldn’t you?A. If the circumstances warranted and allowed you to do that, yes.”  
        
       
      
    53 Mr Zalewski also agreed that it would be desirable to have staff “at the point of entrance and exit and also positioned at the spot where the patrons are participating in the event that is being conducted”. The evidence at the second of the pages to which the trial judge referred took this up, and was - 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. In any event, you would regard it as having been good practice for someone to have been so placed?A. Yes, it is good practice.HIS HONOUR: Q. To minimise risks?A. Yes.Q. Minimising risks also incorporates the concept of the deterrence if you’ve got somebody on the door?A. It can. Yes.” 
        
       
       
      Duty of care 
       
      
    54 The trial judge set out the competing submissions at length. They revolved around Modbury Triangle Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v Anzil [2000] HCA 61; (2000) 205 CLR 254 and whether it precluded recognition of a duty to take reasonable steps to prevent injury from violent, as distinct from intoxicated, patrons on licensed premises. However, his Honour did not conclude that the appellant owed the duty of care to the respondents by analysis or application of the decisions to which he was referred. His Honour said only - 
     
      
       
        
        “44 The general determinant of the existence of a duty of care is proximity which has been said to be a ‘broad and flexible touchstone’ ( 
        Cook v Cook 
         (1986) 162 CLR 376). In my view the duty arises in the Plaintiff’s case because the Plaintiffs were both invitees and contractual entrants to a licensed premises thus satisfying the proximity test and the Defendant owed a general and wide duty to the Plaintiffs to take care to avoid injuries caused by the unlawful actions of patrons (or invitees) on the premises during the course of the evening of 31.12.02 and early hours of 1.1.03.” 
        
       
      
    55 At least since Hill v van Erp (1997) 188 CLR 159 proximity has not been a determinant of the existence of a duty of care, even in cases of personal injury as distinct from economic loss: see for example Hill v van Erp at 177-8 per Dawson J, 188-9 per Toohey J, 210-11 per McHugh J and 237-9 per Gummow J; Pyrenees Shire Council v Day [1998] HCA 3; (1998) 192 CLR 330 at [238] per Kirby J; Perre v Apand Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 36 ; (1999) 198 CLR 180 at [27] per Gaudron J and [70]-[74] per McHugh J. McHugh J said in the lastmentioned case at [74] that “[t]he reason that proximity can not be the touchstone of a duty of care is that it ‘is a category of indeterminate reference par excellence’.” With respect, the trial judge’s reasoning is not consistent with current jurisprudence. 
     
      
    56 The appellant’s submissions on appeal, as at the trial, were founded on Modbury Triangle Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v Anzil, from which was taken the principle that the occupier of premises does not owe a duty of care in relation to the criminal conduct of third parties. It was submitted that, although an exception to this general principle had been recognised in the case of occupiers of licensed premises in cases such as Wagstaff v Haslem [2007] NSWCA 28; (2007) 69 NSWLR 1 and Collingwood Hotel Pty Ltd v O’Reilly [2007] NSWCA 155, there was no reason why the mere fact that the premises were licensed premises should bring a duty of care extending to guarding against the criminal conduct of third parties; for example, in the case of a small licensed café, or even in the case of a large number of patrons enjoying the facilities until a late hour (the example given was a legal Bench and Bar dinner, although that involved assumptions which need not be explored). The submissions did not draw the distinction which appears to have been drawn at trial between injury from intoxicated patrons and injury from violent patrons.  
     
      
    57 The appellant submitted “formally” that decisions of intermediate appellate courts in Australia which had held that an occupier of licensed premises over a duty of care in relation to the prevention of violent criminal acts by one patron against another were inconsistent with Modbury Triangle Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v Anzil and wrongly decided. It said that cases where such a duty of care had been recognised depended upon actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous propensities of a particular person or group of persons, and did not support a duty of care “prophylactically [to] provide dedicated security personnel against the possibility that there may be violent behaviour”.  
     
      
    58 The respondents submitted that Modbury Triangle Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v Anzil was a very different case, and that the present case fell within the recognised exception. They said that intoxication or actual or constructive knowledge of propensity for violent behaviour before the duty of care arose was “a stricture not discernable from any authority”, and that “it is the general nature of the activities being conducted on the premises and the element of control which gives rise to the duty”.  
     
      
    59 The difference between the parties was in part one of law and in part factual. The appellant’s position was that there could not be the duty of care unless there was knowledge of risk from a particular patron or group of patrons, and that there was no knowledge sufficient for that requirement at least until the fight between Mr Abbas and Mr Moubarak. The respondents’ position was that more general knowledge of a risk of violence from a patron or patrons, coupled with control over the violence occurring or leading to injury, could give rise to the duty of care, and that there was knowledge sufficient for that requirement.  
     
      
    60 There was a flow-on from the competing positions to the questions of breach and causation. The respondents’ case was that there should have been security staff who or whose presence would have controlled the dispute on the dance floor and re-entry by Mr Abbas, and so prevented the shootings. It was not clear that the appellant accepted that it owed duty of care in relation to the conduct of Mr Abbas from the time of the fight between him and Mr Moubarak, but it said that no duty of care called for prophylactic security staff and that the dispute escalated so quickly, and the shootings were so unexpected, that (security staff being out of consideration) there was nothing it should or could reasonably have done which would have prevented the shootings. The difference came down to one over a duty of care whereby security staff should have been present from the beginning of the function. 
     
      
    61 That does not mean that the question is whether there was a duty to have security staff present from the beginning of the function. A duty of care is not properly stated so specifically, see for example Brodie v Singleton Shire Council [2001] HCA 29; (2001) 206 CLR 512 at [309]; Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan [2002] HCA 29; (2002) 211 CLR 540 at [106]; Vairy v Wyong Shire Council [2005] HCA 62; (2005) 223 CLR 422 at [20]-[22] and [118]-[119; and particularly the discussion by Kirby J in Neindorf v Junkovic (2005) 222 ALR 631 at [50]. To do so, to adapt the words of McHugh J in Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan at [106], “invites error because it is likely to mix a question of law (whether a duty existed) with a question of fact (whether a breach occurred)”.  
     
      
    62 The duty of care, if extending to taking reasonable care to guard against injury to persons in the position of the respondents from the criminal conduct of third parties, was a duty to take reasonable care in the circumstances. Whether security staff should have been present from the beginning of the function went to breach – was that the reasonable response according to the balancing described in Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40? As was said by McHugh J in Vairy v Wyong Shire Council at [26], in relation to motorist’s duty of care - 
     
      
       
        
        “ … the duty owed by motorists to other users of the highway, for example, is expressed in terms of the duty to take reasonable care for the safety of other users of the highway having regard to all the circumstances of the case. The duty is not subdivided into categories such as a duty to keep a proper lookout or sound a warning or to keep a safe distance away from the car in front. In the particular circumstances of the case, failure to do one or more of these things may constitute a breach of the duty to take reasonable care. But they are not themselves legal duties for the purpose of the law of negligence.” 
        
       
      
    63 The appellant’s submissions may have accepted that the duty of care arose when the fight broke out between Mr Abbas and Mr Moubarak. This led the respondents to submit at one point that, upon knowledge of “either impending trouble or trouble which might escalate”, the duty of care recognised in cases such as Wagstaff v Haslem “descends and is activated”. They said that in the present case the duty of care descended “no later than the altercation between the women” but, in response to a question from the Court, “no earlier … than the earlier trouble during the night”.  
     
      
    64 These submissions departed from correct principle, and were not consistent with the respondents’ submissions in other respects. The appellant owed a duty of care to the patrons at Adeels Palace, at least as occupier. If it owed a duty to take reasonable care to protect patrons not only in relation to the physical state or condition of the premises, but also in relation to the criminal conduct of another patron or other patrons, the duty of care in the latter respect was owed at all times the patrons were on the premises in the same way as the occupier’s duty of care in relation to the physical state or condition of the premises was owed at all times the patrons were on the premises. The occupier’s duty of care did not spring up when a dangerous defect in the condition of the of the premises came about in the course of a function, nor if there were the further duty of care did it spring up when a fight presenting risk of injury to the patrons broke out. In either event there may have sprung up occasion to do something in discharge of the duty of care, but that is another matter. 
     
      
    65 In Modbury Triangle Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v Anzil the plaintiff was attacked and badly injured while walking to his car in the outdoor carpark of a suburban shopping centre. It was accepted that the defendant owed a duty of care to persons lawfully upon its premises, but it was held that the duty of care did not extend to taking reasonable care to protect persons in the position of the plaintiff from the criminal conduct of third parties. The essential basis of the holding was that the common law does not ordinarily impose liability for omissions, and that the knowledge and control which form the basis of an occupier’s liability in relation to the physical state or condition of land and which take the liability beyond liability for an omission are not present when the possibility of criminal behaviour on the land by a stranger is involved. Absence of control over the third party’s criminal conduct was at the heart of the decision, see at [29] per Gleeson CJ; [43] per Gaudron J; [108]-[114] per Hayne J. 
     
      
    66 However, it was recognised that there could be a duty to take reasonable care to prevent harm from the criminal conduct of a third party. Gleeson CJ referred at [30] to foreseeability of harm “attended by … a high degree of foreseeability, and predictability”, referring to “[t]he possibility that knowledge of previous, preventable, criminal conduct, or of threats of such conduct could arguably give rise to an exceptional duty”. His Honour said at [34] that it was unnecessary to express a concluded opinion. Hayne J said - 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        117  
        Established principle provides the answer to the present problem because it reveals that there is no duty to control the criminal conduct of others except in very restricted circumstances. Being an occupier of land should not be added to those exceptional cases, at least where the complaint that is made by the plaintiff is not about the occupier failing to control access to or continued presence on the premises. I would wish to reserve for consideration in a case in which they are raised the questions that are presented by a complaint of that last kind. Further, like Gleeson CJ, I would wish to leave open for consideration the appropriate approach in cases where an occupier has a high degree of certainty that harm will follow from lack of action.” (citations omitted) 
        
       
      
    67 The cases cited for the possible qualification concerning the occupier failing to control access to or to continued presence on the premises were Chordas v Bryant (Wellington) Pty Ltd (1988) 20 FCR 91 and Public Transport Corporation v Sartori (1997) 1 VR 168. In the first of these cases it was accepted that a hotel owner had a duty to take reasonable steps to protect a patron from the foreseeable risk of injury from the acts of another patron who was well affected by liquor, but it was held that there was no breach of duty because the other patron was not causing trouble or known to cause trouble or be aggressive in drink. In the second of these cases it was held that an employer’s obligation to provide a safe system of work extended to the safety of an employee, expected to use late at night an employee carpark which the employer had sought to make secure, who was injured by a trespasser when the gate was not properly locked. 
     
      
    68 There have been a number of other employee cases, before Modbury Triangle Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v Anzil (Chomentowski v Red Garter Restaurant Ltd (1970) 92 WN (NSW) 1070; Fraser v State Transport Authority (1985) 39 SASR 57) and afterwards (Kozjak v Fairfax Community Newspapers Ltd [2001] NSWCA 37; Pacific Access Pty Ltd v Davies [2001] NSWCA 218; Anderson v Hotel Capital Trading Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 28; Cheng Fung Pty Ltd v Heloui [2005] NSWCA 222; Coca Cola Amatil (NSW) Pty Ltd v Pareezer [2006] NSWCA 45; TAB Ltd v Beaman [2006] NSWCA 345). These cases have been applied to recovery by a cleaner from both his employer and the hotel he was required to clean when thieves held him up, treating the cleaner as in a relationship with the hotel akin to employment (English v Rogers [2005] NSWCA 327). They may be put aside, as the relationship of employer and employee brings special considerations.  
     
      
    69 There have also been a number of hotel or club cases, after Modbury Triangle Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v Anzil, recognising a duty of care to the effect of that accepted in Chordas v Bryant (Wellington) Pty Ltd. An early such case was Guildford Rugby League Football & Recreational Club Ltd v Coad [2001] NSWCA 139, in which it was held by Ipp JA, Rolfe AJA agreeing, that the club was in breach of the duty of care owed to a patron by failing to employ security guards on the particular evening. The duty of care was, however, conceded by the club, based on Chordas v Bryant (Wellington) Pty Ltd and the earlier decision of this Court in Oxlade v Gosbridge Pty Ltd (18 December 1988, unreported). 
     
      
    70 In Wagstaff v Haslem the plaintiff’s husband was assaulted by a fellow patron of a hotel and she was punched by the patron when she went to her husband’s aid. Basten JA, with whom Santow and Bryson JJA relevantly agreed, observed with reference to Modbury Triangle Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v Anzil that the basis of the duty said to be owed to her “must be found in the level of control exercised by the occupier over those on the premises and the occupier’s knowledge, or ability to know about, the condition of persons on the premises where liquor is being sold” (at [24]). Public Transport Corporation v Sartori was regarded as resting on the relationship of employer and employee (at [27]). Chordas v Bryant (Wellington) Pty Ltd was apparently accepted (at [29]-[30]), and it was noted that it had been applied in this Court in Oxlade v Gosbridge Pty Ltd on the basis that the hotel manager knew of facts requiring intervention in order to protect other patrons (at [32]). His Honour said (at [39]) that the duty of care might be stated - 
     
      
       
        
        “ … to include the following propositions, namely that: 
        
       
       
        
        (1) the duty arose in relation to the likely behaviour of a particular patron or group of patrons, 
         
         
        (2) whose presence at a particular time was or should have been known to constitute a source of danger to other patrons.” 
        
       
      
    71 In the subsequent hotel case of Spedding v Nobles [2007] NSWCA 29; (2007) 69 NSWLR 100 a licensee’s “duty of care owed to patrons in relation to the risks of violent behaviour of other patrons” was recognised, referring to Chordas v Bryant (Wellington) Pty Ltd and other cases; it was firmly tied to control, as distinct from a “special relationship” (at [49]-[50], [55] per Basten JA, with whom Beazley JA agreed and McColl JA agreed with a presently irrelevant reservation). In relation to control, Basten JA said at [50] - 
     
      
       
        
        “ … First, it is clear from the authorities which have upheld the existence of a duty of care owed by a licensee to patrons that that conclusion depends not on the existence of a “special relationship” recognised by law, but on the element of control. Although the  
        Liquor Act 
          
        1982 does not impose a statutory duty of care on licensees, enforceable by patrons, by conferring a power of control and an obligation to exercise that power, the statute provides the basis for a finding with respect to control, which in turn attracts the common law duty of care and informs its content. The relevant statutory provisions may be found in s 2A of the  
        Liquor Act 
          
        which identifies as a primary object of the statute “the minimisation of harm associated with the misuse and abuse of alcohol (such as harm arising from violence and other anti-social behaviour)”, in combination with s 103(1) which empowers a licensee or an employee of a licensee to “turn out, or cause to be turned out of the licensed premises”, any person who is intoxicated. The section authorises the use of “such reasonable degree of force as may be necessary” to turn a person out: s 103(3A). In addition, s 125 of the  
        Liquor A 
        ct 
          
        provides:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘125 Conduct on licensed premises 
          (1) A licensee shall not: … 
           
            
             
              
              (b) Permit intoxication, or any indecent, violent or quarrelsome conduct on his or her licensed premises’.” 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    72 In Collingwood Hotel Pty Ltd v O’Reilly Basten JA again delivered the principal judgment. His Honour said - 
     
      
       
        
        “21 The Appellants accepted that the relevant principles governing their potential liability in negligence for the deliberate acts of third parties were those explained by this Court in  
        Wagstaff v Haslam and Anor  
        [2007] NSWCA 28 and in  
        Spedding v Nobles; Spedding v McNally  
        [2007] NSWCA 29, applying, amongst other cases,  
        Chordas v Bryant (Wellington) Pty Ltd  
        (1988) 20 FCR 91 (FCAFC). These cases held that someone in the position of a hotel manager or licensee may be liable for injury to a patron caused by the deliberate and unlawful act of another patron. The duty which gives rise to this liability depends upon the capacity, and indeed the statutory obligation, of the hotel manager or licensee to control conduct on licensed premises, pursuant to ss 103 and 125 of the  
        Liquor Act  
        1982 (NSW). These provisions not only permit the licensee to “turn out, or cause to be turned out” any person who is intoxicated, and to use reasonable force to that end, but also impose an obligation on a licensee not to permit intoxication on licensed premises, an offence which is deemed to be committed by the presence of a person who is intoxicated on the premises, unless the licensee has asked the person to leave the premises, sought police assistance to remove the person and refused to serve the person alcohol: s 125. As will be seen shortly, there was a complaint that the relevant employee of the hotel believed that a number of patrons were sufficiently affected by alcohol to justify refusal of service, yet no steps were taken to eject those persons from the premises, until the relevant outbreaks of violence. However, it should be emphasised there is no statutory cause of action for breach of the  
        Liquor Act 
        , if such a breach occurred. Rather, the relevant duty to exercise reasonable care for the safety of patrons, depends upon proof that the hotel manager or licensee knew or ought to have known facts requiring intervention to protect patrons and, in those circumstances, failed to take reasonable steps to safeguard the plaintiff from a foreseeable risk of harm: see, generally,  
        Wagstaff  
        [2007] NSWCA 28 at [28]-[37].” 
        
       
      
    73 One of the cases to which Basten JA referred in Spedding v Nobles was Club Italia (Geelong) Inc v Ritchie [2001] VSCA 180; (2001) 3 VR 447, where the plaintiff was a police officer injured in a brawl at a club on the occasion of a debutante ball. It was said in that case that the facts “bear no resemblance to those in Modbury Triangle Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v Anzil” (at [34]), and that the assailant was allowed to misbehave “when he should have been kept under control by the club which had invited him onto its premises and allowed him to remain there for the purposes of its business” (at [36]). The duty of care was found as follows - 
     
      
       
        
        “[36] 
          
        Quite apart from what the expert and other evidence disclosed in this case, it is a matter of common sense and experience that, where liquor is to be sold to large numbers of people at nocturnal entertainments extending over a long period of time, there is a danger of drunkenness and violent and other offensive behaviour. There is a general recognition that the use of crowd controllers is usual and (given that there are to be such entertainments) appropriate. What the club was really doing here was, in the course of its business, creating a potentially dangerous situation on its own premises, as it recognised, even before the night began, by its engagement of five crowd controllers. Crowd controllers are there to control crowds; 
        5 
         they are there because of the danger that things will get out of control, notably, one might add, in relation to physical violence. As the regulations already referred to show, one of the functions of the crowd controller — again this is only a matter of common sense and common experience — is to assist in maintaining order by removing disorderly persons from premises. Persons in the position of the club realise that in the course of their business they are attracting potential trouble-makers to their premises, and they take steps to deal with the resulting danger of violent and other disorderly behaviour. If a person becomes drunk or criminally disorderly on their premises, then it is they who have invited the potential criminal to their premises and created the environment in which the criminal activity has occurred. They are under a statutory duty — we are not here concerned with rights of action for breach of a statutory duty — to expel drunk and disorderly persons and they recognise that they are under a responsibility to maintain order on their premises. 
        
       
       
        
        [37] 
          
        It is difficult to imagine a greater contrast between the facts of the present case and those of  
        Modbury 
        . The club concedes that it owed a duty of care to patrons to protect them against attacks by other patrons on the premises and that if the plaintiff in the car park here had been, not a member of the police force, but a patron, then no question would have arisen about the existence of a duty of care in relation to the kind of harm done. In our opinion a duty of care was owed to the plaintiff.” (citation omitted) 
        
       
      
    74 The duty of care in the hotel and club cases has been held to arise from the combined position that the manager or licensee “knew or ought to have known facts requiring intervention to protect patrons” and had “the capacity … to control conduct on licensed premises”, taking these phrases from the passage last cited from Collingwood Hotel Pty Ltd v O’Reilly. In Proprietors of SP 17226 v Drakulic [2002] NSWCA 381, (2002) 55 NSWLR 559 at [113] Heydon JA said of “cases like the Chordas case” - 
     
      
       
        
        “They recognise that the duty to take reasonable care to avoid a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury to lawful visitors owed by the occupier or person in control of a restaurant or other outlet for the on-site consumption of alcohol extends to the injuries caused by tortious or criminal acts of other lawful visitors. A justification for this is that it is highly foreseeable that some patrons may either arrive intoxicated or become intoxicated, and a segment of these may become violent.” 
        
       
      
    75 However, in Club Italia (Geelong) Inc v Ritchie at [44] the Court questioned whether that case was rightly characterised as one of harm arising from criminal conduct, suggesting that it was one of harm arising from a state of affairs created by the club. In like manner, I would question whether the duty of care presently under consideration is to be regarded as particular content of an occupier’s duty of care owed to persons who come onto the occupier’s land.  
     
      
    76 The link with occupier’s liability has particularly come about through the reference to Chordas v Bryant (Wellington) Pty Ltd in the reservation expressed by Hayne J in Modbury Triangle Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v Anzil, but it is not an essential link. The preferable approach, in my respectful opinion, is that the knowledge of facts requiring intervention to protect patrons may come from the nature of the establishment or the function to be conducted at the establishment, in the manner described in Club Italia (Geelong) Inc v Ritchie, and it is the foreseeability of injury from conduct on the premises plus the capacity to control the conduct, rather than the status of occupier, from which the duty of care comes. The status of occupier, of course, may be important because it provides the ability to control entry upon and conduct on the premises, but a licensee or manager of licensed premises may have control although not the occupier. That the conduct may be criminal is not of itself a bar. As was said in Club Italia (Geelong) Inc v Ritchie at [44] in relation to the state of affairs created by the club, “the club's position, as regards duty of care, might be no different if, instead of being attacked by a trouble-making ruffian, the plaintiff had been unintentionally struck by a peaceable patron defending himself against an assault, or accidentally knocked to the ground by non-violent patrons trying to avoid the melee.”  
     
      
    77 References in the cases to the licensee of premises does not mean that the duty of care can only be owed by the licensee. A licensee is frequently a natural person distinct from, although connected with, the person or corporation conducting the hotel or club, but through the licensee the hotel or club has the capacity to control the conduct of hotel patrons. So in Collingwood Hotel Pty Ltd v O’Reilly Basten JA referred to “someone in the position of a hotel manager or licensee”. Collingwood Hotel Pty Ltd was the occupier, the licensee was Mr Porter (at [16]): his Honour noted that their responsibilities were treated by the parties as the same (at [55]). In Wagstaff v Haslam the defendants were Mr Haslam, the licensee, and D & D Haslam Pty Ltd, the occupier of the premises. No distinction was drawn between them in relation to the duty of care. As has been seen, his Honour saw the basis of the duty said to be owed to the plaintiff in the control and knowledge of the occupier, and the licensee is often equated with an occupier. In Spedding v Nobles the cases to which there was reference for support for a duty of care owed “by licensees” to patrons in relation to the risks of violent behaviour of other patrons included South Tweed Heads Rugby League Football Club Ltd v Cole [2002] NSWCA 205; (2002) NSWLR 113, referring at [153] to the duty owed “by the occupier or person in control of a hotel, restaurant, bar or similar establishment”.  
     
      
    78 The cases to which there was reference also included TAB Ltd v Atlis [2004] NSWCA 322. TAB Ltd v Atlis was not a hotel case at all: the defendant was the occupier of a TAB outlet. Mason P said bluntly at [3] that the defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to patrons who came to its premises to place bets, the content of which extended “to the taking of reasonable measures to control rowdy and dangerous patrons whose activities had the potential to thereafter threaten the safety of other patrons”. Ipp JA, with whom Beazley JA agreed, said after referring to the duty of care as recognised by Mason P In Oxlade v Gosbridge Pty Ltd - 
     
      
       
        
        “35 Such a duty is capable of being extended in scope. In my reasons in  
        South Tweed Heads Rugby 
          
        League 
          
        Football Club Limited v Cole 
         (2002) 55 NSWLR 113 (with which Heydon JA and Santow JA agreed) I said (at 137, [152]):  
         
         
          
          ‘[The general duty on the part of the occupier to take reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable risk of injury to the entrant] ordinarily concerns risk of injury from the condition of the premises, but this is not an inevitable limitation on the scope of the duty. If, to the knowledge of the occupier, activities conducted on the premises bring about a risk of injury to the entrant, the circumstances may give rise to a duty of care wide enough to encompass a duty to take reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable risk of injury arising from those activities:  
          Canterbury Municipal Council v Taylor 
           [2002] NSWCA 24. Typically, the foreseeable risk of injury in such a case is the risk of physical injury directly caused by the known activities on the premises.’ 
           
          
         
        Nothing in the reasons of the High Court in this case ( 
        Cole v South Tweed Heads Rugby League Football Club Limited 
         (2004) 78 ALJR 933) is inconsistent with these remarks.  
         
         
        36 The opponent complains that the claimants negligently failed to control the continued presence of the two young men on the premises. The facts in the present case, therefore, differ fundamentally from  
        Modbury 
        . In fact they fall squarely within the possible exception to the rule in  
        Modbury 
         explained by Hayne J (at 293-294 [117]).  
         
         
        37 In  
        Modbury 
         Hayne J (at 292 [112]) observed that “[t]he occupier of land has power to control who enters and remains on the land and has power to control the state or condition of the land”. Hayne J remarked that that power of control established a relationship between occupier and entrant that could suffice to create a duty of care.  
         
         
        38 Accordingly, while it is true that no liquor was sold at the TAB, that is by no means conclusive of the question.  
         
         
        39 Foreseeability of harm is an important factor in this context. It is very much to the point that, by the time Mr Youngman spoke to the two men, he realised that their activities on the claimants’ premises constituted a risk of injury to the other patrons.” 
        
       
      
    79 The duty of care in the hotel and club cases can be owed in relation to violent behaviour, whether from intoxication of a patron or for other cause. Intoxication may be a common cause, and may be what brings occasion for intervention to protect other patrons, but it is not essential. The Liquor Act’s strictures have extended and extend to indecent, violent or quarrelsome conduct (see s 125 in the citation from Spedding v Nobles, and now Liquor Act 2007, s 73). In Oxlade v Gosbridge Pty Ltd Mason P referred to the duty to protect patrons “imposed on the manager of a hotel as regards intoxicated or dangerous customers” (emphasis added). Club Italia (Geelong) Inc v Ritchie had involvement of liquor, but the focus was on the known extreme aggressiveness of the assailant (described at [44] as “a trouble-making ruffian”). As has been seen, in Wagstaff v Haslem the duty of care was stated in terms of a patron or patrons whose presence was or should have been known “to constitute a source of danger to other patrons”. See also the citation from TAB v Atlis, above, and in Rooty Hill RSL Club Ltd v Karimi [2009] NSWCA 2 decided after the hearing of the present appeal the Court spoke at [33][35] of a duty to exercise reasonable care arising out of the intoxicated or dangerous condition of its patrons. 
     
      
    80 In accordance with these principles, for the reasons which follow in my opinion the duty of care owed by the appellant to patrons attending the New Years Eve function extended to taking reasonable care to guard against injury from intoxicated, unruly or violent (including criminal) behaviour of other patrons. That does not mean a duty owed to the intoxicated, unruly or violent patron or patrons to guard against injury to themselves, which is another matter and does not arise for consideration. 
     
      
    81 Adeels Palace was not a small licensed café, and for what it is worth the New Years Eve function was not a Bench and Bar Dinner. Although the function was attended by family groups and persons of a broad range of ages, that did not dictate the nature of the premises or of the function any more than what might be understood from the function in Club Italia (Geelong) Inc v Ritchie being a debutante ball. The function was also attended by many who readily joined in the dispute and, as the statement of Ms Mansour indicates, were offensively aggressive; indeed, that she was told that there were going to be guns suggests that resort to weapons was not unfamiliar to some patrons. The premises were filled to capacity, and very likely beyond capacity. Alcoholic liquor was readily available over the long period of the function, and Mr El Baz thought some patrons were drunk. The function should have been seen beforehand as having a potential for drunken or violent behaviour.  
     
      
    82 To an extent that potential is supported by the earlier incidents in the COPS reports. The March 2000 incidents may be put aside, and there had been no reported incidents for nearly two years. But the incidents in 1998, 1999 and January 2000 shed some light on the nature of the establishment, and its patrons, and even if the violence was in the street outside Adeels Palace it gave a guide to the kind of persons who were reasonably to be expected to be patrons within the premises.  
     
      
    83 These matters may not of themselves be significant, but of particular significance, in my view, is the appellant’s ordinary engagement of Mr Zraika, or according to Mr Kouzi two security staff, in order to deter troublemakers from coming onto the premises and to assist in the removal of troublemakers from the premises. Similarly significant is the appellant’s own assertion in the letters (although found to the contrary), of engagement of at least two security guards on the occasion of the New Years Eve function, one to monitor patrons inside and the other to keep unwanted patrons out. The appellant considered that there was a need to have security staff because troublemakers might try to enter or might have to be removed. Its own conduct reflected foresight of troublemakers, which would have included drunken or violent patrons. 
     
      
    84 The appellant had the capacity to control behaviour within the premises, through its director Mr Bazouni who was the licensee but also through its ability as occupier to control who entered and remained in the premises. This ability was ordinarily exercised by the presence of security staff.  
     
      
    85 In the circumstances of this case, then, there was foreseeable behaviour of a patron or patrons presenting a danger to other patrons and the capacity to exercise control over that behaviour. The duty of care owed by the appellant extended, in my opinion, to taking reasonable care to guard against injury to the respondents by the unlawful conduct of another patron or other patrons. 
     
      
       
      Breach of duty 
       
      
    86 I have set out the evidence of Messrs Jennings and Zalewski on which the trial judge came to his finding. He came to it as follows - 
     
      
       
        
        “57. There was no evidence before me as to what the ‘venue operators’ had instigated at the premises Adeels Palace by way of security. Nor was there any evidence of a ‘licensed crowd controller withdrawing from work’. The only evidence of security on the night of 31.12.02 was the evidence of the Plaintiffs (there was no security personnel present) and the co-owner of Adeels Palace at the time, Mr Kouzi, which was of limited assistance.58. In my view the expert opinion of both Mr Jennings (principally) and Mr Zalewski, the latter at least in evidence agreeing on the need for ‘access control’ as the ‘front line of defence’ the latter having the purpose of discouraging at least, if not preventing, the return of unruly or troublesome patrons who had left the premises  
         
        [T 344; 349], leads me to conclude that the security arrangements at Adeels Palace on the relevant evening was far short of what reasonable care and skill required in all the circumstances.” 
        
       
      
    87 The trial judge’s reasoning was not extensive, but is clear enough from the evidence of Messrs Jennings and Zalewski to which he referred. It did not depend upon acceptance of Mr Jennings’ opinion that there should have been six to eight security officers on duty and the detail of their locations and duties. The reasoning did not go beyond the need for planned security arrangements, including access control and managing incidents of intoxication or violence. That called for at least some security presence in a position to respond to an incident developing on the dance floor, but particularly (and also in Mr Zalewski’s opinion) for security staff for access control. There was no security staff. Mr Kouzi’s presence was inadequate. So there was breach. 
     
      
    88 The appellant submitted that there was no breach of duty because an available reasonable response to the risk of injury from violence of one patron to another was not to have any dedicated security personnel. It submitted that because it was a function attended by family groups, it could reasonably be thought that any incidents which might develop would be minor and able to be dealt with by staff other than dedicated security personnel, in the way Mr Kouzi said he had dealt with an incident by escorting out one of the couple of guys talking to each other. The appellant reiterated that mere numbers or service of alcohol did not make the New Years Eve function into one in which a more major incident was foreseeable. It referred to TAB Ltd v Atlis as a case when there was no question of dedicated security staff and it was held that there was no breach of duty: the manager could not reasonably have been expected to eject the offenders. 
     
      
    89 The appellant also said, although I do not think it of significance because it was not shown to be within their domains, that neither the Licensing Court nor the Council required that security staff be engaged at the premises. It drew attention to evidence from Mr Kouzi that after the incidents in the street he asked the police what more could be done to “make us feel safe about it” and the police told him “to put monitors”. Since at the time the appellant had security staff at the street entrance, I do not see that this assists it. 
     
      
    90 I have set out the passages extracted by the trial judge from the reports of Messrs Jennings and Zalewski, and the oral evidence of Mr Zalewski to which his Honour also referred. I deal later with the complaint of erroneous admission of parts of Mr Jennings’ report.  
     
      
    91 The appellant submitted that Mr Jennings’ report was infected by his view of a history of violent incidents at the premises, taken from the COPS reports including those at 1.43 am and 1.44 am on 1 January 2003. In his third report dated 27 September 2007 in particular, Mr Jennings purported to summarise the incidents and expressed the view - 
     
      
       
        
        “12 These incident [sic] clearly indicate to me that the proprietors of this venue should have been very well aware of the ongoing danger of serious violence inside or in the immediate locality of the venue (but involving their patrons), for at least five years prior to the shooting of the Plaintiff. In particular, they should have been aware that their patrons had an obvious propensity towards the use of firearms in settling the disputes, let alone the use of chairs and other weapons not commonly used by restaurant patrons to settle disputes.” 
        
       
      
    92 Mr Jennings’ summary lacked moderation. There was room for greater evidentiary objection to his reports, in this and other respects, than was taken, and it should be said that counsel for the respondents accepted that his evidence could properly be criticised.  
     
      
    93 However, in my opinion there remained available from Mr Jennings’ reports the need for access control as found by the trial judge, a need which Mr Zalewski’s evidence supported notwithstanding the conclusion in his report that the system of security as explained to him (but not borne out in the evidence) was “not inappropriate for a restaurant and function centre”. The system as explained to Mr Zalewski included employing security staff “for access control purposes at the point of entry from ground level”, and it is pertinent that his expressed agreement with “most of Mr Jenkins [sic] comments about access control and minimising the risk of a patron reentry” included agreement with Mr Jennings’ statement, “It was standard practice in the licensing and security industries at this time that person who had left voluntarily or been ejected from a venue, who have a history of violent [sic] or threat should not be allowed back in.” 
     
      
    94 In my opinion, no error has been shown in the trial judge’s finding of breach of duty. 
     
      
    95 The appellant submitted also that Mr Jennings’ opinion was infected by his references to Adeels Palace as a nightclub, and to it being in a local government area with statistically significant violent criminal behaviour. As I have described, a number of persons referred to Adeels Palace as a nightclub. Mr Jennings referred to it as a restaurant/nightclub, and I do not see any error. It was relevant, although perhaps of little weight, that the premises were within an area statistically suggestive of particular need for security arrangements, and I do not think Mr Jennings said more than that; see later in relation to objection to some of this part of the report.  
     
      
       
      The Jones v Dunkel inference 
       
      
    96 As I have said, Mr Kouzi gave evidence that Mr Bazouni dealt with security staff most of the time. Mr Zraika was ordinarily on duty for security purposes, but not on the night in question. Neither Mr Bazouni nor Mr Zraika gave evidence. 
     
      
    97 The trial judge said - 
     
      
       
        
        “22 [Counsel for Mr Moubarak] submitted that the arrangements for proceedings for security at Adeels Palace at the material time was central to the proceedings and was very much within the Defendant’s knowledge. The expert relied upon by the Defendant, Mr Zalewski, was asked, as disclosed in his report (Ex 6) to assume certain facts including, at paragraph 555 … ‘The operators had thought through their general security needs including managing conflicts on the upper level, instructing staff about intoxication and employing the services of security staff for access control purposes at the point of entry for ground level.’ 
        
       
       
        
        23 No such evidence was before me from either side, but such evidence was more likely to be the preserve of the Defendant particularly as the Defendant’s expert had, it is assumed, been provided with that information from the Defendant via its solicitors. I do not consider that drawing an inference that the evidence of Mr Zraika and principally Mr Bouzani was not going to assist the Defendant fill in a gap in the plaintiff’s case. The Plaintiff’s case is that there was no security staff on duty at Adeels Palace at the relevant times and in particular at the point of entry at ground level. In these circumstances I am prepared to draw the inference that evidence from Mr Bouzani and Mr Zraika would not have assisted the Defendant’s case in the central factual issues in the case, that is what were the security arrangements in place at Adeels Palace at the relevant time.” 
        
       
      
    98 There is a difficulty with the grammar and sense of the second sentence of [23], but the trial judge was prepared to draw the inference expressed in the last sentence of that paragraph. The appellant submitted that it was not clear what inference the trial judge actually drew, but that whatever it was he should not have drawn it, because Mr Bouzani had resigned as a director of the appellant in March 2003 and Mr Zraika “was either a former independent contractor or employee and equally available to be called by the respondents”. It referred to Claremont Petroleum NL v Cummings (1992) 110 ALR 239, in which it was held (at 259) that a former director of Claremont was equally available to both sides and the Jones v Dunkel inferences cancelled out. 
     
      
    99 Mr Bouzani was more than a director of the appellant, being principally responsible for its security arrangements at the time of the New Years Eve function. It is arguable that he would be expected to be called by the appellant, which was concerned to uphold the sufficiency of the arrangements he was in charge of, rather than the respondents: see various other tests stated by Glass JA in Payne v Parker (1976) 1 NSWLR 191 at 201-2. I do not think the evidence established whether or not Mr Zraika remained as a contractor to or employee of the appellant, but perhaps it would be inferred that by the time of the trial in November-December 2007 he had moved on, and at least in his case it may not have been correct to infer that his evidence would not have assisted the appellant’s case.  
     
      
    100 In either case, however, any inference drawn by the trial judge added nothing. Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 expresses available modes of reasoning. Despite the enthusiasm with which it is commonly invoked, reliance on it is often of little or no significance. An inference that the evidence of Messrs Bouzani and Zraika would not have assisted the appellant would not have counted against the appellant if its case had otherwise been accepted, see Manly Council v Byrne [2004] NSWCA 123 especially at [74]-[75] per Campbell J, although that does not arise. Nor could it make up for any deficiency in the respondents’ cases, and there is no indication in the trial judge’s reasons that what he said in the paragraphs I have set out had any effect on his decision-making. His Honour was called upon to evaluate the cases of the respondents, and of the appellant, on the evidence before him. He was drawn by counsel’s submission into a statement of no consequence, without expression of what might have been had Messrs Bouzani and Zraika given evidence.  
     
      
       
      Causation 
       
      
    101 As recorded by the trial judge, the respondents submitted - 
     
      
       
        
        “62. … that the inadequate provision of security arrangements by the Defendant (in particular access control) did, as a matter of robust common sense, materially contribute to the further violent conduct engaged in by Mr Abbas when he was able, freely without any monitoring or supervision, re-enter Adeels Palace and to do so armed with a weapon. He said the contribution of the inadequate (or non-existent) security was material (more than  
        de minimus 
        ) [sic] and can thus be regarded as causative. Further there was no evidence to support a conclusion that, had there been proper arrangements for security including access control, Mr Abbas would in any event have entered the premises successfully to conduct further violence.” 
        
       
      
    102 Also as recorded by the trial judge, the appellant submitted that causation had not been established because it had not been shown “that a reasonable response by the Defendant to any perceived risk would have had any effect on the gunman, Mr Abbas” (at [63]). This was amplified as the submission that - 
     
      
       
        
        “64. … it was speculative as to whether any of the security precaution by way of personnel would have any impact on quelling the fight in the reception area on level two of Adeels Palace or in deterring or dissuading or preventing the gunman ‘from proceeding with his desire to get a weapon and using it inside the venue as a reprisal for being punched by Mr Moubarak’.” 
        
       
      
    103 Observing that material contribution was sufficient for causation, the trial judge came to his conclusion - 
     
      
       
        
        “65 ... Mr Jennings said in his report of 27.9.07 at paragraph 13 to which I have referred said that with a proper security system in place (and he gave evidence as to what he considered that should be) ‘implemented by sufficient numbers of licensed security officers, then the person who eventually shot the Plaintiff should not have been permitted to leave and re-enter the venue certainly without being [thoroughly searched] on both entries … ‘. 
        
       
       
        
        66 I therefore find on the balance of probabilities that the failure of the Defendant to have an adequate or any security system and principally including security personnel in place on the evening of 31.12.02 and 1.1.03, materially contributed to injuries suffered by both Plaintiffs and the causative link is established. 
        
       
      
    104 The appellant submitted that the respondents’ submissions as set out by the trial judge could involve reversing the onus of proof, and that if the trial judge adopted those submissions there was error.  
     
      
    105 I do not think that the judge’s reasoning, which was but briefly expressed, reversed the onus of proof. It should be remembered that the agreed facts included that Mr Abbas left the premises and re-entered soon after. While Mr Jennings inferred that Mr Abbas had left the premises in order to get the gun, most likely from his car, it does not matter whether or not he carried the gun at all times. The critical matter, in the judge’s reasoning, was that on the probabilities Mr Abbas would not have been permitted to re-enter the premises if there had been a security presence providing access control.  
     
      
    106 In coming to his conclusion the trial judge did refer to Mr Jennings’ evidence of a proper security system with sufficient numbers of licensed security officers. I do not think his Honour intended to take up the six to eight security officers deployed as Mr Jennings had described. It was sufficient for his reasoning in relation to breach of duty to consider access control – one or perhaps two security staff providing access control as the front line of defence “having the purpose of discouraging at least, if not preventing, the return of unruly or troublesome patrons who has [sic] left the premises” (at [58]), cited more fully above). 
     
      
    107 Although not fully articulated by his Honour, the reasoning must have been as follows. From the evidence, security staff would have been aware of a significant fracas on the dance floor. Even if Mr Abbas had not been identified at the time as the man who had got into a fight with Mr Moubarak, the presence of blood on his face would have caused the security staff at the street entrance, particularly with knowledge of the fracas, to deny him entry, or at least to require that he submit to search as a condition of being permitted to enter. On the balance of probabilities, security staff at the street entrance would have deterred or prevented Mr Abbas’ re-entry, and he therefore would not have shot Mr Moubarak and Mr Bou Najem.  
     
      
    108 The appellant submitted to the effect that the dispute on the dance floor escalated so rapidly and unexpectedly that it was speculative that the presence of security staff would have quelled it, but that submission does not meet causation as was in my view found by the trial judge.  
     
      
    109 More relevantly, the appellant submitted that Mr Abbas was not acting rationally, and that both his irrationality and his determination were demonstrated by the fact that he shot Mr Bou Najem although Mr Bou Najem was not shown to have offended him and despite Mr Bou Najem’s plea not to shoot him. So, it was submitted, as a matter of common sense the presence of security staff would not have deterred Mr Abbas from obtaining a weapon and returning to use it inside the premises, he being “an obviously determined man, who was prepared, following a relatively minor physical altercation, to shoot someone he had never met before in front of many witnesses, apparently as a reprisal for merely being punched”. It was added that “the law recognises the arbitrary, capricious and unpredictable nature of a criminal’s behaviour”, referring to Modbury Triangle Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v Anzil at [30] per Gleeson CJ; [136] per Callinan J; Proprietors of SP 17226 v Drakulic at [132]-[139]; and Coca-Cola Amatil (NSW) Pty Ltd v Pareezer [2006] NSWCA 45 at [10], [131]-[146]; these, however, were general statements, and the present question is one of particular fact.  
     
      
    110 In short, the appellant submitted that the causation as found by the trial judge was no more than speculation. Its submissions went so far as to include that in his irrational and determined state Mr Abbas would have gained entry despite the access control by using his gun against the security staff. (It should be said that it was not suggested that the security staff should have been armed.) 
     
      
    111 I do not agree. In my opinion, the finding of fact was open to the trial judge, and was correct. The trial judge was called upon to decide on the balance of probabilities, and was entitled to regard use of force against the security staff as quite unlikely and to conclude that that presence would have had a successful deterrent or preventative effect. 
     
      
       
      Rejection of parts of Mr Jennings’ reports 
       
      
    112 I refer here to the parts of Mr Jennings’ reports other than those associated with the complaint of rejection of Dr McMahon’s report, to which I will come. Dr McMahon’s report went to causation. The appellant’s written submissions complained only of the admission of expert opinion evidence ”tendered by the respondents going to the issue of causation”, and most of the parts of Mr Jennings’ reports identified in the grounds of appeal did not go to the issue of causation. The appellant’s oral submissions went further, and are now considered. 
     
      
    113 The appellant objected to a sentence in para 18 of Mr Jennings’ report dated 5 October 2004 stating, “There is evidence that the Bankstown area of Sydney has, in recent years, developed a well founded reputation as a centre of the violent crime in this State, along with the Fairfield/Liverpool area”. The sentence was the preface to reference to a publication of the New South Wales Crime Statistics and Research analysing occurrence of violent crime over the years 1997 to 2000, and Mr Jennings said that he believed that “such data should have been considered when assessing and developing a security and safety management plan for the premises” with “higher than average physical security measures to compensate for these increased risks”.  
     
      
    114 The sentence to which objection was taken in its context could go no further than the underlying study, to which objection was not taken. The trial judge pointed this out when ruling on the objection. His Honour showed considerable doubt that the general level of crime in the area was relevant, but allowed the sentence with the observation that it was “a question of weight”. I have earlier referred to this. The evidence in the study was relevant, for the purpose indicated by Mr Jennings, although the sentence in question put a gloss on the data in the study which would have better been avoided. Weight was another matter. 
     
      
    115 The appellant objected to paras 19 to 24 of the same report of 5 October 2004. They appeared under the heading, “Principles of Security Officers’ Work at Licensed Premises”, and provided a discussion of availability of licensed security officers and common arrangements for their provision by security service providers.  
     
      
    116 The appellant’s objection at trial was that “[t]he principles of employment of security officers … have nothing to do with this case. This is all about licensing and so on”. It was elaborated on the basis that, because the respondents alleged that there were no security officers, the question of security officers was irrelevant. There was considerable debate, in the course of which counsel for the appellant said that there would be “evidence that there was security officers [sic] there up until a particular point in the evening”. That rather undermined the basis of the objection, which in any event was unsound – the respondents’ allegation that there should have been security officers was the occasion for the discussion. The trial judge said that the paragraphs “should stay in until such times as we hear further evidence about what security officers were there, if that’s going to be the evidence of the defendant”.  
     
      
    117 With hindsight, the debate was not particularly illuminating. The appellant did not call evidence that Mr Zraika (or any other security staff) had been on duty until an incident caused him to withdraw, but did not renew its objection to the paragraphs. In the result, the admission of the paragraphs does not appear to have played any part in the trial judge’s decision-making.  
     
      
    118 Some understanding of the availability and arrangements for provision of security staff was appropriate, although perhaps not in the detail given by Mr Jennings. In my opinion the trial judge took an appropriate course in the circumstances, but if there were error in the admission of the paragraphs it has not been shown to have caused a substantial (or any) miscarriage of justice: UCP Rules r 51.53.  
     
      
    119 The appellant objected to the second sentence of para 12 of Mr Jennings’ report of 30 November 2006. The complete paragraph read (the oddities in phrasing are in the original) - 
     
      
       
        
        “12 It was standard practice in the licensing and security industries at this time that person who have left voluntarily or been ejected from a venue, who have a history of violent or threat should not be allowed back in. It is a widely accepted principle that person voluntarily leaving a venue after a problem will often go to their cars and get weapons with which to carry out revenge attacks. This no re-entry rule must therefore be strictly adhered to stop those weapons getting back.” 
        
       
      
    120 The ground for the objection was not stated. The trial judge was at first against the admission of the sentence, saying, “I think I know what he’s trying to say but he’s not saying it”. Counsel for Mr Moubarak sought “leave to deal with the issue in chief”, and the trial judge said that he would “allow it in, to allow some evidence about it” and “[i]f you can’t meet what is said, it will go out.”  
     
      
    121 Mr Jennings was asked in chief for the “basis” on which he made the statement in the sentence, and explained that he had experience “where that sort of circumstance has occurred”. There was no objection to this evidence, nor were we referred to any subsequent mention of the status of the second sentence.  
     
      
    122 The appellant apparently acquiesced in the view that the problem lay in the basis for Mr Jennings’ assertion of a “widely accepted principle”. It was for the appellant to renew its objection, but it did not do so. Mr Jennings’ experience was relevant, it informed the sentence in question, and there is no basis for complaint on appeal. 
     
      
    123 The appellant objected to para 7 of Mr Jennings’ report dated 27 September 2007. It began, “The Police COPS record of violent events at or close to, the venue, prior to the shooting of the Plaintiff gives indication that the venue has a history of such violence.” There were then accounts, in context taken from the COPS reports, of incidents on occasions from December 1998 to January 2003. I have earlier referred to this, and to the conclusions to which Mr Jennings came in the following para 8 of the report. 
     
      
    124 The appellant objected on the ground that the first sentence in para 7 “is a matter for your Honour”, and that Mr Jennings did not have an advantage over the trial judge in reading the COPS reports. The objection was stated, “So it’s objectionable in form, your Honour”. The trial judge allowed the paragraph, observing that he thought “it’s his way of introducing the COPS evidence. That’s as far as it goes … “. 
     
      
    125 In providing his opinion Mr Jennings identified what for the purposes of his report was an assumption, a history of violence associated with the premises. The source of the assumption was explained, and had to be separately established by evidence. The COPS reports were separately tendered. They may or may not have made good the assumption, but the objection was not on the basis that they failed to make it good. In due course it was open to the appellant to submit that Mr Jennings’ opinion lacked foundation so far as resting upon the COPS reports, but that was a different matter. Given the basis of the objection, there was no error. 
     
      
    126 The appellant objected to part of para 10 of the report of 27 September 2007, so far as Mr Jennings expressed the belief that “this venue was in fact a ‘nightclub’ serving alcohol until the early hours of the morning with a history of violence”. The ground for the objection was not explained, but counsel for Mr Moubarak said it was “his commentary on the COPS report [sic]” and it appears to have been accepted that it was in the same position as para 7 of the report. 
     
      
    127 I do not think any error has been shown in these evidentiary rulings material to the result in the proceedings. 
     
      
       
      Rejection of Dr McMahon’s report 
       
      
    128 The appellant tendered Dr McMahon’s report for the opinions that Mr Abbas had demonstrated “a high degree of persistence against the present inhibiting factors”, that “there were identified situational factors to motivate violence, and cultural factors that condone violence”, and - 
     
      
       
        
        “Given the proximal nature of the assault by Mr Moubarak upon Mr Abbas and the degree of persistence displayed by Mr Abbas, in my opinion it is likely that despite the presence or intervention of unarmed security operatives Mr Abbas would have completed the assault with a firearm, either at the premises or outside the premises. He was suitably motivated to gather the weapon, that he likely would have engaged in concealment against casual inspection [sic].” 
        
       
      
    129 The trial judge rejected the tender of the report, after some discussion, essentially on the basis that “[t]his man is giving a psychological opinion about a person he’s never seen, based on facts and supposition that simply can’t be substantiated”. 
     
      
    130 The report of Dr McMahon was obtained by the appellant as a response to certain parts of Mr Jennings’ reports. The appellant was rather ambivalent on appeal concerning the rejection. It pointed to the admission, despite its objection, of portions of Mr Jennings’ reports which it said involved the implicit opinion “that the particular gunman would have been deterred or prevented by unarmed security personnel from returning to the premises and shooting the respondents.” It said that “either none of the evidence should have been admitted or only Dr McMahon’s evidence should have been admitted, on the basis that he was qualified to give evidence of that nature whereas Mr Jennings had no relevant qualifications, training or experience to opine on the reaction of the actual gunman to any particular security measures.” But it acknowledged that Dr McMahon’s evidence “was not of much probative value”, and its central position was that none of the evidence should have been admitted. 
     
      
    131 The appellant accepted that the trial judge’s decision on causation did not involve any apparent reliance on the relevant parts of the reports of Mr Jennings, and in my opinion there was no such reliance.  
     
      
    132 The relevant parts of Mr Jennings’ reports were – 
     
      
       
      (a) para 14 of his report dated 30 November 2006, reading - 
       
       
        
         
          
          “All of the above does no [sic: not] change or limit any of my original comments that this incident would most likely have not have occurred if the proprietors of the restaurant had adopted a proper system of security and safety as was in common use at that time and commensurate with the viable foreseeable risks”. 
          
         
        
       
       
      (b) the first sentence of para 15 of his report dated 27 September 2007 , reading - 
       
       
        
         
          
          “This Defendant, by all reasonable standards of security and safety accepted in the industry as at 2003, met none of the requirements of reasonableness which, if met, would almost certainly have deterred this crime from having occurred in the first place.” 
          
         
        
       
      
      
      (c) Para 17 of the report of 27 September 2007, in like terms to para 14 of the earlier report. 
       
      
    133 The trial judge admitted para 14 with the remark that it was “vague enough, general enough, perhaps to remain in. What weight I give it is a different matter.” The ruling as to para 15 is far from clear, apparently dependent upon further evidence “and then we’ll deal with that, whether it should stay in after that”. Counsel for the appellant accepted that para 17 was in the same position as para 14.  
     
      
    134 The better view may have been that, at least so far as expressing a view on causation, these parts of the reports should have been rejected. However, it is plain that the trial judge did not at the time see them as carrying weight as to causation, and when he rejected the report of Dr McMahon he observed, “That’s not to say … I haven’t got reservations about Mr Jennings, but I’ll hear in due course about that … “. Mr Jennings was not expressing (and could not express) an opinion on Mr Abbas’ psychological disposition, and it is quite clear, in my view, that the trial judge did not act upon such opinion as Mr Jennings expressed on whether Mr Abbas would have been deterred by a security presence at access control. If his Honour was in error in admitting the relevant parts of his reports, there was no substantial (or any) miscarriage of justice within r 51.53.  
     
      
    135 That sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander is not a principle of the law of evidence. A reading of the report of Dr McMahon makes clear that he came to his opinion with limited information concerning factors material to Mr Abbas’ propensity to violence – even his age was unknown. Dr McMahon described the “degree of certitude” of his conclusions as “moderate”, on the basis “that no examination proper had been made of the offender”, and qualified his opinion by stating that he was “unable to conclude regarding [Mr Abbas’] behaviour in the presence of metal detectors or other methods of inspection, or security in general” (emphasis added). In my opinion the report carried no weight and was correctly rejected. 
     
      
    136 Two observations are appropriate. First, it is desirable that the ground for an objection and, if reasons are given for the ruling, the basis of the ruling be clearly articulated; from the transcript, that did not always occur. Secondly, where the trial has been before a judge alone, complaint on appeal of erroneous admission (or rejection) of evidence should not be made unless there is some point to it in challenging the judge’s substantive decision; perhaps greater discrimination could have been exercised in the present case. 
     
      
       
      The result 
       
      
    137 I propose that the appeals be dismissed with costs. 
     
      
    138 CAMPBELL JA: I agree with Giles JA, but should state the basis upon which I agree with para [75]. 
     
      
    139 I accept that the duty of care arises from the foreseeability of injury from conduct on the premises, plus the capacity of the defendant to control the conduct. However, there are many cases in which the fact that the defendant is the occupier of the premises is of significant importance in it being foreseeable that injury could arise from conduct on the premises, and in the defendant having the capacity to control the conduct.  
     
      
    140 In the case of bodily injury arising from the physical state of the premises, it is often because the defendant is the occupier that it knows or ought to know about the physical condition of the premises, and thus that bodily injury arising from those deficiencies in the physical condition is reasonably foreseeable. It is often also because the defendant is the occupier that it has the opportunity to prevent bodily injury arising in that way, whether by fixing the defects or warning about them. 
     
      
    141 It is no different concerning bodily injury arising from the activities of other people on the premises. Having the continuing relationship with the premises that comes from being an occupier is often why the occupier knows, or ought to know, the type of conduct that persons who come to the premises could reasonably be foreseen to engage in, and the likelihood of them engaging in such conduct. Often it is the status of occupier that gives a defendant the opportunity to promote, on the premises, the carrying out of the type of activities from which the foreseeable injury arises. Often it is the status of occupier that confers on the defendant the capacity to control the conduct of people on the premises. In other words, the status of occupier can be very relevant to the reasons why a duty arises to take reasonable care to prevent bodily injury arising from the conduct of other people on the premises. However, it is not in itself the fundamental reason why the duty of care arises. 
     
      
    142 Here, the appellant organised the provision of food, drink and entertainment in a manner deliberately calculated to attract patrons to the premises. The type of activities carried on there involved numerous people gathering in close proximity to each other, at least predominantly for the purpose of social interaction, over many hours, in circumstances where alcohol was readily available. The availability of alcohol is part of the reason why a duty of care exists, even though it is not shown to have played any prominent part in the way the respondents’ harm arose in this particular case. The history of the club, as well as the inherent probabilities of the type of activity being carried on in the club (of the type explained in the extract from Club Italia set out at para [73] of Giles JA’s judgment), made it reasonably foreseeable that the patrons would include the potentially troublesome and violent. 
     
      
    143 In a hotel the proprietor can influence the way patrons conduct themselves by measures like aiming to attract a particular market segment (through matters such as décor, facilities, entertainment offered, and pricing policy); having security staff identifiable as such whose presence in itself can have a deterrent effect; having visible security cameras that act as a reminder that the acts of patrons will not go unobserved and unrecorded; having trained and competent bar staff and security personnel instructed to act in a way calculated to prevent trouble arising or to defuse trouble if it seems to be brewing; and having procedures and security staff that result in troublemakers being removed. However hotels are usually the sort of premises that any adult can enter if minded to do so, and multiple entrances to the premises are quite common. The Appellant had even greater capacity for control than most hotel proprietors have because at the Appellant’s premises, public entry was permitted only through one set of doors at street level, which led up a set of stairs, and only upon payment of admission. 
     
      
    144 I agree with the order proposed by Giles JA.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hall J. 
     
      
    2 HALL J: The applicant by notice dated 5 June 2008, seeks the leave of this Court to appeal against sentences imposed on him by the District Court of New South Wales on 30 November 2007. 
     
      
    3 He pleaded guilty in the Local Court at Burwood on 15 August 2007 to two counts of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, contrary to s.97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    4 In the application for leave to appeal, the following two grounds were relied upon:- 
     
      
       
        
        (1) The sentence imposed upon the applicant in respect of the second charge was manifestly excessive, in circumstances where his Honour gave too much weight to the offence to be taken into consideration. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The sentence insufficiently reflected his Honour’s finding of special circumstances. 
        
       
       
      The offences 
       
      
    5 The charges to which the applicant pleaded guilty were as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: Robbery whilst armed – 19 February 2007 
         
        Section 97(1) Crimes Act  
        1900 
         
        Maximum penalty: 20 years’ imprisonment 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: Robbery whilst armed – 19 February 2007 
         
        Section 97(1) Crimes Act  
        1900 
         
        Maximum penalty: 20 years’ imprisonment 
        
       
       
      Sentences imposed 
       
      
    6 The individual sentences imposed were as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: 
        
       
       
        
        A fixed term of two years’ imprisonment commencing on 15 March 2007 and expiring on 14 March 2009. [The applicant’s date of arrest was 15 March 2007]. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: 
          
        Taking into account Form 1 matter 
        
       
       
        
        A term of five years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years commencing on 15 March 2008 and expiring on 14 March 2011. 
        
       
      
    7 Accordingly, the sentence imposed with respect to Count 2 was accumulated one year after the commencement of the sentence imposed with respect to Count 1. 
     
      
    8 A charge of robbery in company (on 17 February 2007) was taken into account on a Form 1 in respect of the sentence imposed for Count 2. 
     
      
    9 The total effective sentence, therefore, was a period of six years imprisonment and an effective non-parole period of four years imprisonment commencing on the date of the applicant’s arrest, 15 March 2007. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    10 The facts of the offences in chronological order as summarised in the Crown’s written submissions were as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (1) Robbery in company, 17 February 2007: Form 1 matter 
       
       
        
        “3. On Saturday 17 February 2007 at about 3:15 pm Ankesh Dhingra (aged 19) was on a train traveling  
        [sic] 
         from Cabramatta to the city via Bankstown when the applicant approached the victim who continued to talk on his mobile phone. Moments later the applicant moved across the aisle and sat on the other side of the train. His juvenile co-offender AEH then sat directly opposite the victim. The victim finished his call and was holding his mobile phone. AEH then said ‘Do you want it the easy way or the hand way? Give my your phone and wallet’. AEH snatched the phone from the victim’s hand, and the applicant and AEH left the train. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The victim got off the train at Campsie station, where he contacted the police and reported the incident. 
        
       
       
        
        5. The victim’s mobile phone service was used shortly after the offence to call three different numbers. The three numbers were all found in the applicant’s phone book.” 
        
       
       
      (2) Robbery whilst armed, 19 February 2007: Count 1  
       
      
    11 The facts of this offence are as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “6. On 19 February 2007 at 12:20pm Akhtar Hussain (aged 37) caught a train from Wiley Park to Strathfield on his way to work. He sat in the upstairs section of the carriage, where he was the only passenger. 
        
       
       
        
        7. CCTV footage from Wiley Park station shows the applicant and AEH loitering at the station with a third unidentified male before boarding the victim’s train. The applicant was wearing a red sleeveless t-shirt with ‘Vikings’ written across the chest. 
        
       
       
        
        8. As the train left Wiley Park station the applicant and his juvenile co-offender AEH entered the victim’s carriage from the carriage in front. The applicant sat directly opposite the victim and AEH sat directly behind the victim. 
        
       
       
        
        9. AEH leaned close to the victim and held a knife to the back of the victim’s neck. AEH said, ‘You want the easy way or the hard way? Give us the money’. The victim said, ‘I only have twenty dollars’. AEH said, ‘if you will not give me the money I will slice you. Give it, give it’. 
        
       
       
        
        10. While this was happening the applicant was looking at the victim and looking around the carriage. The applicant also said, ‘Give it, give it’. 
        
       
       
        
        11. The victim removed $85 in cash from the pocket of his pants. AEH grabbed the money from the victim’s hand and then held the knife in front of the victim’s face. The victim described the knife as a 20 centimeter  
        [sic] 
         folding knife with a sliver blade and black handle. 
        
       
       
        
        12. At this point the train stopped at Punchbowl station. The applicant and AEH ran out of the train and left the platform. They were recorded by CCTV footage at Punchbowl station. 
        
       
       
        
        13. The victim immediately reported the incident to a City Rail employee by telephone.” 
        
       
       
      (3) Robbery whilst armed, 19 February 2007: Count 2 
       
      
    12 The facts of this offence are as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “14. On 19 February 2007 at about 1:05pm Mr Ryan Bernardo (aged 25) boarded a city-bound train at Bankstown station. He sat in the centre of a carriage containing five or six other people. He had with him a bag containing a tripod and a second bag containing a camera and some lenses. He was playing with one of the lenses. 
        
       
       
        
        15. At Punchbowl station the applicant entered the victim’s carriage with his co-offender Safi Merhi. CTV footage from Punchbowl station shows the applicant and Merhi boarding the train empty-handed. 
        
       
       
        
        16. Merhi sat opposite the victim, put his arm on the chair in a relaxed fashion and looked at what the victim was doing. The applicant sat next to the victim, with the victim’s bags on the seat between them. 
        
       
       
        
        17. Merhi said, ‘What are you doing?’ The victim relied, ‘I am just playing around with the lens’. Merhi asked, ‘Where are you going?’ The victim said, ‘I am going to work, in the city’. 
        
       
       
        
        18. During this conversation the applicant took hold of the victim’s tripod bag. The applicant asked ‘What’s this for?’ The victim said, It’s a tripod bag’. The applicant asked, ‘For videos or photos?’ The victim replied, ‘Photos’. 
        
       
       
        
        19. Merhi then said, ‘Do you want to do this the easy way or the hard way?’ Merhi motioned to the applicant. The victim said that the applicant was holding a knife with a 10cm blade in his right hand and was pointing the knife at him. The applicant held the knife low, about 40cm from the tripod bag. 
        
       
       
        
        20. Merhi said, ‘Give me your money’. The victim said, ‘I don’t have any’. Merhi said ‘Give me your wallet’. The victim handed his wallet to Merhi, which contained the victim’s Visa card and driver’s license. 
        
       
       
        
        21. Merhi then said, ‘Give me your phone’. The victim said, ‘I am not sure where it is’. The victim then grabbed the bag containing his camera, jumped up onto the seat, climbed over the back of the seat and fled into the next carriage, where he attempted to attract the attention of the train guard. The applicant and Merhi did not follow the victim. 
        
       
       
        
        22. The applicant and Merhi left the train at Wiley Park station. As the train was leaving the station the victim saw someone on the platform carrying his tripod bag. CCTV footage from Wiley Park station clearly shows the applicant carrying the tripod bag while Merhi was looking through the wallet. 
        
       
       
        
        23. The victim remained on the train and spoke to the train guard. He reported the offence to police a short time later and provided a statement that afternoon.” 
        
       
      
    13 The sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence observed (remarks on sentence, p.6):- 
     
      
       
        
        “Those facts clearly disclose the commission of three very serious offences by the offender within a three day period. The offences of armed robbery and robbery in company are offences not only against property but also against the person. Armed robbery, in particular, is perceived by everyone as a life threatening situation, particularly when the offender is holding a knife and it is for this reason that the offence is regarded so seriously by the legislature, the courts and the community.” 
        
       
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    14 The sentencing judge noted that the applicant was born in Australia on 12 November 1982 and that he was therefore 24 years of age at the time of the offences. 
     
      
    15 A pre-sentence report dated 30 October 2007 recorded that he was the fourth oldest of six children and that prior to his arrest he had been living with his family. He had left school during Year 11, completed hairdressing and carpentry courses and had a trade certificate in aluminium glazing. 
     
      
    16 The report noted that the applicant acknowledged a long-term problem with illicit drugs and, to a lesser extent, alcohol. The history was that he had commenced smoking cannabis at 19 years of age and became a regular user. He claimed to have started using cocaine at age 20 and became addicted to it. At age 21, he began using the drug crystal methamphetamine hydrochloride or “ice”. It was noted that he had undertaken drug and alcohol programmes whilst in custody. 
     
      
    17 He gave evidence at the sentencing hearing and wrote a letter dated 13 October 2007 which became Exhibit 3 and in which the applicant set out matters concerning himself, the death of his grandfather and its effect on him, his drug-taking and other matters. In the letter he also expressed his regret and remorse. 
     
      
    18 The probation report recorded that the applicant was remorseful and took full responsibility for his offences. 
     
      
    19 The report also recorded the applicant as having travelled to Lebanon in 2006 and there being exposed to traumatic experiences including the bombing of houses and people being killed and injured. This history had also been recorded in a report by Dr Olav Nielssen, psychiatrist, dated 16 October 2007. 
     
      
    20 Dr Nielssen diagnosed the applicant as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of a “near death experience” and “exposure to traumatic events in a war zone”. As the sentencing judge observed, Dr Nielssen had not clarified what the “near death experience” was. 
     
      
    21 In his sentencing remarks, the sentencing judge observed that Dr Nielssen also diagnosed substance abuse disorder, adjustment order and possible traumatic brain injury. 
     
      
    22 His Honour considered that Dr Nielssen’s reference to brain injury was entirely speculative and no weight was placed upon it. 
     
      
    23 There was also tendered before the sentencing judge reports of Mr Tim Watson-Munro, consultant forensic psychologist, dated 1 November and 12 November 2007. 
     
      
    24 The sentencing judge placed significance on the fact that the reports of Dr Watson-Munro did not refer to the applicant having suffered any trauma as a result of exposure to events in the war in Lebanon in 2006. Mr Watson-Munro, it was noted, referred to an escalation in the applicant’s drug use in 2006 after having lost his job and the death of his grandfather. 
     
      
    25 The sentencing judge also noted Mr Watson-Munro’s reference to the applicant’s drug use as affecting his emotions and judgment and that, at times, he was experiencing symptoms of a drug induced psychosis. 
     
      
    26 For reasons set out in the remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge was not satisfied that the applicant had been exposed to the war experiences to which he claimed in the 2006 year. He noted, in this respect, inconsistencies in the history given to Mr Watson-Munro and the failure by the applicant to refer to such experiences in his letter to the Court (Exhibit 3). Accordingly, his Honour did not accept the diagnosis made of a post-traumatic stress disorder, having regard, in particular, to the inconsistencies in the applicant’s historical accounts. 
     
      
    27 The sentencing judge went on, however, to state that, even if the applicant had been exposed to the trauma of war and the near death experience in 2006 (remarks on sentence, p.13):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… I do not accept that those circumstances reduce his criminal culpability in the commission of these offences. He made a deliberate decision to escalate his drug use and he is therefore responsible for the consequences of his decision and his actions. There is no evidence that his depression is causally related to the commission of the offence.” 
        
       
      
    28 His Honour went on to state that the applicant’s convictions for prior offences did not entitle him to the leniency afforded to a first-time offender. 
     
      
    29 He then added (remarks on sentence, p.14):- 
     
      
       
        
        “The two armed robbery offences are aggravated by the fact that they were committed in company. I accept Mr Coroneos’s  
        [sic] 
         submissions that relevant mitigating factors applying to all offences are that the loss caused by the offence was not substantial and that the offences were not part of a planned or organised criminal activity.” 
        
       
      
    30 The sentencing judge accepted that prospects for rehabilitation were positive and that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend in a similar manner. 
     
      
    31 In relation to the early plea of guilty, the applicant was held to be entitled to a discount of 25%. 
     
      
    32 The issue of parity was then addressed in the remarks on sentence. The sentencing judge found that the applicant was a co-offender with Merhi in respect of the armed robbery offence for which Merhi was sentenced but not for the two counts of robbery in company for which Merhi was also sentenced. 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
       
      Ground 1: The sentence imposed upon the applicant in respect of the second charge was manifestly excessive, in circumstances where his Honour gave too much weight to the offence to be taken into consideration. 
       
      
    33 The submission on behalf of the applicant was that the sentence imposed for Count 2 was excessive, his Honour, it was contended, having given too much weight to the Form 1 matter. 
     
      
    34 In support of the applicant’s submission, Mr Lange of counsel placed reliance on the guideline decision in Regina v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 in respect of offences of armed robbery. 
     
      
    35 The guideline range specified in Henry for such offences is between four to five years’ imprisonment. In that case, the Chief Justice identified the relevant category of case for the purpose of determining a guideline as that which includes the following characteristics:- 
     
      
       
      (1) Young offender with no or little criminal history. 
       
       
      (2) Weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury. 
       
       
      (3) Limited degree of planning. 
       
       
      (4) Limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof. 
       
       
      (5) Victim in a vulnerable position such as a shop keeper or taxi driver. 
       
       
      (6) Small amount taken. 
       
       
      (7) Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case. 
       
      
    36 Spigelman CJ stated in Henry (supra) that sentences for an offence of the kind identified by the above characteristics should generally fall between four and five years for the full term. In this respect, however, the Chief Justice observed that the seven characteristics identified above did not represent the full range of factors relevant in the sentencing exercise and that many of the characteristics contained within themselves an inherent variability. 
     
      
    37 In the present case, the applicant was, as earlier noted, aged 24 years at the time of the offence and, although not unknown to the criminal justice system, had not previously been involved in offending of the kind in question in the present application. It was contended on his behalf that the robberies did not involve more than a limited degree of planning. I consider, however, that there is some merit in the submission made on behalf of the Crown that although there was a finding that the offences were not part of a planned or organised criminal activity, nonetheless the applicant and his co-offender would appear to have travelled on trains for the purpose of robbing travellers and, in respect of the two armed robbery offences, doing so whilst armed with a knife for the purpose. 
     
      
    38 Mr Lange, in his written submissions (paragraph 5), observed that the Henry guideline was predicated upon the assumption that the offender entered a late plea of limited utilitarian value. He stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… it is now accepted doctrine that the seventh characteristic identified by the Chief Justice refers to a late plea in respect of which the guideline range in  
        Henry  
        has been taken as having allowed a discount of only 10%.” 
         ( 
        Regina v Sundar 
         [2005] NSWCCA 93 at [17] per Tobias JA, citing  
        Regina v Hemsley 
         [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [30] 
        
       
      
    39 The submission was that where the offender, as in the present case, entered a plea of guilty at the earliest reasonable opportunity, the significant utilitarian value was such that the appropriate range based on the Henry guideline was between three years and four months (40 months) and four years and two months (50 months). These figures were arrived at by removing the 10% discount from the range specified in Henry (supra) and instead applying a discount of 25%. 
     
      
    40 The submissions for the applicant acknowledged that the reference to the direct applicability of Henry (supra) by the sentencing judge indicated that he was aware of the need to adjust the range of four to five years’ imprisonment. In that respect, reference was made to a passage in the remarks on sentence at 17 as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I take into account, however, that the guideline applies to a late plea of guilty, and as I have already said, the offender pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity in the Local Court. That means there must therefore be an appropriate adjustment to the guideline.” 
        
       
      
    41 Mr Lange contended that it was, accordingly, plain that the sentencing judge envisaged a sentence of imprisonment of between 40 and 50 months in respect of the second charge. 
     
      
    42 In consequence the submission was the sentencing judge must have increased the sentencing range by between 10 months and 20 months in considering the Form 1 matter and that this approach demonstrated error. This inferred increase in the sentence was arrived at by calculating the difference between the starting sentence (of between 40 and 50 months) and the term of imprisonment ultimately imposed in respect of Count 2 (that being five years or 60 months). 
     
      
    43 Accordingly the submission was:- 
     
      
       
        
        “9. At the very least, his Honour increased the sentence imposed upon by  
        [sic]  
        the applicant by 10 months, which was inappropriate where the offence was merely placed on a Form 1. See  
        Attorney-General’s Application under s.37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 
         (2002) 56 NSWLR 146, 162 at [66] per Spigelman CJ.  
        (emphasis added): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ‘The effect of inclusion on a Form 1 is to give the offences so included a  
            significantly lower salience  
            in the sentencing process. There will be an obvious advantage, and hence a greater incentive to admit guilt, where the Form 1 procedure is employed.’” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    44 However, it is also to be noted that the Chief Justice in Attorney-General’s Application under s.37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No 1 of 2002) (2002) 56 NSWLR 146, also observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The position, in my opinion, is that, although a Court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The Court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence,  
        which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged 
        . The second is the community’s entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has, in fact, been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence …”  
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    45 The Form 1 matter and the first and the second charges all occurred within a few days of one another. The Form 1 matters, as noted above, occurred on Saturday 17 February 2007 and the two armed robbery offences occurred some two days later, 19 February 2007. It is clear that these events all occurred as a course of conduct by the applicant. That is not a matter without significance in evaluating the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
    46 I consider that this is a case in which specific or personal deterrence was an issue of importance to the sentences imposed. The commission of the three offences by the applicant amounted to a course of conduct by the applicant and the sentencing judge was, accordingly, entitled, by reason of that conduct, to give greater weight to the question of personal deterrence than might otherwise have been the case. 
     
      
    47 Accordingly, I do not consider that it has been established that his Honour did give undue weight to the matter on the Form 1 as contended on behalf of the applicant. The objective seriousness of the offence in Count 2 was at a high level and when the circumstances of the Form 1 matter are taken into account, I do not consider that the sentence imposed in respect of that offence was, on the bases argued, manifestly excessive. The sentence was, in my opinion, within the sentencing range. Ground 1 should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The sentence insufficiently reflected his Honour’s finding of special circumstances 
       
      
    48 As to the second ground of appeal, it was claimed that the overall sentence imposed insufficiently reflected his Honour’s finding of special circumstances (such finding warranting a departure from the normal proportion of the non-parole period as against the total term of sentence) 
     
      
    49 As noted by the applicant, whilst the individual sentence in respect of Count 2 produced a ratio of 60% (thus departing from the statutory ratio of 75%), the overall sentence imposed having regard to the effect of accumulation between the two offences, departed from the statutory ratio to a lesser extent, producing a ratio of 66%. 
     
      
    50 In considering whether the difference between the ratio of 60% in respect of Count 2 and the ratio of 66% in respect of the accumulated counts evidenced error, reliance was placed upon observations in Regina v DBN [2005] NSWCCA 435 at [33] wherein Rothman J observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In circumstances where a sentencing judge deliberately fixes a non-parole period which is less than the statutory ratio described in s.44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, it will be assumed that that ratio is to be reflected in the overall sentence ratio, unless the judge expressly signifies otherwise. 
        
       
      
    51 The applicant submitted there was nothing to suggest his Honour had intended for the lower ratio of 60% to apply to the sentence imposed for Count 2 alone rather than in respect of the accumulated sentences for both counts. 
     
      
    52 As the Chief Justice observed in Regina v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534 at [73], the finding of special circumstances involves, firstly, a question of fact and, secondly, an exercise of judgment to determine that the special circumstances justify a lower proportion in the relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence. The Chief Justice also observed that there are well known restraints on an appellate court interfering with decisions of that character. 
     
      
    53 In the present case it is clear, in my opinion, that the sentencing judge had specific regard to the offences as part of a course of conduct and, whilst making a finding of special circumstances, explicitly accumulated the sentence in respect of Count 2 to operate 12 months into the fixed term sentence imposed in respect of Count 1. The end result of his Honour’s approach still gave effect to the finding of special circumstances insofar as the ratio of non-parole to total effective sentence was of the order of 66%, producing a shorter non-parole period of approximately six months than would have been the case had the statutory ratio of 75% been applied. 
     
      
    54 I am of the opinion that Ground 2 is, in essence, seeking to establish error in respect of what is a judgment involving matters of evaluation and discretion, I do not consider that error of a kind, in the circumstances of this case, would justify appellate intervention. I am of the opinion that this ground should be rejected. 
     
      
    55 In conclusion, I observe that his Honour was clearly mindful of the facts and circumstances pertaining to each offence and that each was a serious one. I consider that the offences warranted the effective non-parole period of four years with a total effective sentence of six years. I respectfully consider that his Honour’s exercise of judgment was appropriate and that the applicant’s need for supervision on parole was an important matter to be taken into account in sentencing him both in his own interests and in the interests of the community. 
     
      
    56 Accordingly, I propose the following orders:- 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal granted. 
       
       
      (2) Appeal dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by Studdert AJ on 4 April 2008. The sentence imposed was for the offence of manslaughter committed on 26 January 2007; and it was a non-parole period of five years nine months to date from 27 January 2007 with a balance of term of one year nine months, making up a total sentence of seven years six months. The non-parole period expires on 26 October 2012, and the head sentence expires on 26 July 2014.  
     
      
    2 The applicant stood trial in the Supreme Court at Newcastle on 18 February 2008, before his Honour and a jury, charged with murder. He offered to plead to manslaughter when arraigned, but his plea was not accepted. After the trial had proceeded for a day and a half, the prosecutor accepted the plea. The applicant was re-arraigned, he pleaded not guilty on the indictment to murder but guilty of manslaughter; and the plea was accepted and the jury discharged.  
     
      
    3 In subsequent exchanges, it was indicated to the sentencing judge that the Crown had accepted the plea to manslaughter on the basis of provocation.  
     
      
    4 The facts of the offence are set out as follows in the judgment of the sentencing judge:  
     
      
       
        
        [3] The victim of the crime here to be considered was Brett John Crittenden. He suffered fatal injuries when stabbed by the offender on the night of 26 January 2007. The stabbing took place in the grounds of a private residence at 52 Elsiemer St, Long Jetty. The offender stabbed the deceased using a kitchen knife, with a blade some 21 centimetres long and with a handle approximately 13 centimetres long. After the stabbing the deceased was taken by ambulance to Gosford Hospital, where he died. 
         
         
        [4] A post-mortem examination was carried out on 28 January 2007 and this led to the preparation of a report from Associate Professor Lyons, dated 14 May 2007 in which the author recorded his post-mortem findings and it is convenient to refer to these findings. The doctor found four areas of wounding. There was wounding to the axilla, the back and the temple areas, but the wounds there were superficial and the doctor opined, and I accept, that they did not significantly contribute to death. The significant wounding was to the abdomen and I record the doctor’s findings concerning the wounding in this area: 
         
         
          
          At post mortem, it was observed that this man had a stab wound to the front of the abdominal wall on the left lower side. This wound ran almost vertically downwards from front to back and extended through duodenum, jejunum, bowel and mesentery and had transacted both the portal vein and superior mesenteric artery. This had resulted in extensive haemorrhage into the upper gastrointestinal tract, the retroperitoneal space and the abdominal cavity. This was considered to be the wound which led to death, and the  
          pathophysiological mechanism of death was hypovolaemic shock secondary to acute blood loss 
          . 
          
         
         
          
          (Emphasis added) 
          
         
         
        [5] The post mortem findings reviewed above were not challenged and I accept them. I find that the cause of death was as expressed by Associate Professor Lyons and that the offender was responsible for all the stab wounds described. 
         
         
        [6] The premises where the deceased met his death were owned by a man named Darren Taylor. At the time of the killing the offender was living at that address. Present at the address when the offender stabbed the deceased was Karen Crittenden, who was in a relationship with Darren Taylor. Karen Crittenden had been married to Jon Crittenden, the deceased’s brother. That marriage had failed by 2000 and thereafter Karen Crittenden formed a relationship with the deceased. That relationship came to an end to be followed by the relationship with Darren Taylor, which had been on foot for some two years by the time the deceased met his death. 
         
         
        [7] On the night of the 26th of January 2007 Darren Taylor was absent from his home, but Karen Crittenden was there and staying overnight. Karen Crittenden gave evidence before the offender’s plea was accepted, and I accept her evidence as I now summarise it. 
         
         
        [8] This witness was disturbed as she lay in bed by the arrival home of the offender, who announced that he had brought a friend, Brett, home with him and he sought Karen Crittenden’s permission to play some music. Thereafter Karen Crittenden went out to see the offender and his companion and she recognised the companion as Brett Crittenden, the person with whom she had had the previous relationship. Karen Crittenden made it plain that her former de facto husband could not remain in the house and the offender asked him to leave. The deceased was unhappy to do so, but he did leave the house. However he did not leave the grounds. The evidence given by Karen Crittenden established that after the deceased left the house he became really angry, seemingly because he had been asked to leave. He invited the offender to leave the house and to go out to where the deceased was in the driveway, so that he could fight him. According to Karen Crittenden the offender expressed reluctance, saying he did not want to fight. However, the offender did join the deceased and there was some pushing and shoving, neither man losing his footing or being hurt. 
         
         
        [9] Karen Crittenden gave evidence that she sat on the landing at the top of the steps into the house and it was from this point that she observed what thereafter occurred. This witness said that the deceased came up to her and put his face close to her, leaning forward with one foot still on the ground and the other on the bottom step. He said to her, “I’ll stab you” and repeated the threat three times. He was clutching a can of bourbon in one hand and holding onto the railing beside the steps with that hand, whilst with the free right hand he pointed his right index finger at her. The witness became aware that the offender passed her on the steps and went into the house. Her evidence was that the deceased was still in the position earlier described and shouting at her when the offender reappeared. Karen Crittenden saw the offender make a movement with his right hand and make contact with the deceased. When he drew the hand back the witness saw that the offender was holding a knife and the deceased touched his stomach and said, “I’ve been stabbed”. The witness saw the deceased turn his back on the offender, who thereupon stabbed him again in the vicinity of the left shoulder blade. After the deceased fell the offender said, “I love you Karen and no one threatens my mate’s missus and gets away with it” or words to that effect. 
         
         
        [10] The offender promptly admitted to the police he had stabbed the deceased. He told police at the scene: “I stabbed him. He was going to stab the lady. I got in first. I stabbed him straight up the guts twice.” Later whilst in the dock at the police station, following his arrest, the offender volunteered a further admission as to his responsibility for the stabbing. 
         
         
        [11] The evidence discloses that before the deceased and the offender arrived at the premises at 52 Elsiemer St they had been drinking together at the Long Jetty Hotel. 
         
         
        [12] The offender apparently invited the deceased back to the residence and there is no reason to doubt that his intention in doing so was to have a drink there with the deceased and to listen to some music. The offender had been drinking a great deal, but Dr Giuffrida was dismissive of the significance of this in the report to which I shall shortly refer. This was because of the offender’s heavy use of alcohol leading to high tolerance to alcohol. I heed Dr Giuffrida’s opinion to this effect. 
        
       
      
    5 The sentencing judge noted the following:  
     
      
       
        
        [15] I am asked to proceed to sentence the offender upon the basis that his crime is that of manslaughter by reason that his conduct in killing the deceased was committed under provocation. This was the basis upon which the Crown conveyed its willingness for the acceptance of the plea proffered by the offender and Ms Davenport, has addressed her submissions to the Court, on the basis that the crime committed was manslaughter by reason of provocation. 
         
         
        [16] It follows from this that the offender is to be considered to have acted at least with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Indeed his conduct in stabbing the deceased in the manner in which he did compels the conclusion that the offender acted with that intent. The Crown very properly did not invite the Court to find that the offender acted with intent to kill. I find on the evidence that the offender stabbed the deceased with the intention of causing him grievous bodily harm. 
        
       
      
    6 He then recorded features of the applicant’s background:  
     
      
       
        
        [18] The offender was born on the 15th of April 1958. He was the eldest of four children and to Dr Allnutt, who examined him in September 2007 he described his father as a difficult man and he gave a history of being exposed to some physical violence by his father. The offender left school at the age of 16 years having finished Year 10. He did work principally of an unskilled nature thereafter and appears to have worked spasmodically until 1986, from which time he was on a disability support pension. To Dr Giuffrida he gave a history of a spinal injury with resultant disability and this may be the basis for the disability pension, although this is by no means clear.  
         
         
        [19] The offender was involved in a number of failed relationships and was in an unsettled relationship at the time of the commission of this crime. The offender attributed his failed relationships to his alcohol dependence.  
         
         
        [20] The offender has a criminal record, which extends back to 1977. It is not a grave record: it contains offences of dishonesty and in 1978 a sentence of imprisonment was imposed for a stealing offence. Otherwise however, his offences appear to have been dealt with by way of recognisance or fine and in 2004 the offender was disqualified from driving for a period of three years. Significantly for present purposes, the only real offence of a violent type resulted in a conviction for assault in 1984. For that offence a monetary penalty only was imposed.  
         
         
        [21] The offender’s record is not such as to be regarded as an aggravating factor under s 21A of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
        .  
         
         
        [22] There was an event in Perth on 1st July 1978, which resulted in the offender becoming the recipient of a bravery award in January 1979. Material has been placed before the Court by way of newspaper reports as to what occurred (Ex 2). In addition, a copy of the media statement published in conjunction with the award by the Australian Honours and Awards Secretariat on 18th of January 1979 is attached to a letter of Deborah Bowden, dated 19 October 2007 (part of Ex B) and this reads as follows:  
         
         
          
          Mark Forrest, 8 Kinkuna Street, Busby, NSW  
           
           
          On 1 July 1978 at about 9.30 p.m. Mr Forrest witnessed a fight between two men on a street corner in Perth, Western Australia. The assailant was armed with a knife and had already inflicted severe wounds on the victim, who later died as a result.  
           
           
          Mr Forrest went to the aid of the victim and grappled with the attacker, who then menaced him with the knife before breaking loose and running off. Although slightly injured himself, Mr Forrest gave chase but the assailant escaped.  
           
           
          Mr Forrest displayed considerable bravery in attempting to defend the victim and apprehend his attacker. 
          
         
         
        [23] This was a noteworthy episode which assumes significance in the present context having regard in particular to the psychiatric assessments carried out by Dr Giuffrida and by Dr Allnutt. The content of the reports of these psychiatrists bears upon the issue of provocation, and the reports call for close attention.  
        
       
      
    7 The sentencing judge considered reports of Dr Giuffrida and Dr Allnutt, and he concluded:  
     
      
       
        
        [31] On either expert view the episode in Perth in 1978 bore upon the offender’s conduct on the 26th of January 2007 and however his disorder be labelled, the offender had a disorder directly relevant on the issue of provocation. 
        
       
      
    8 The sentencing judge then referred to the evidence of Karen Crittenden:  
     
      
       
        
        [32] Karen Crittenden impressed me as a truthful and generally reliable witness and in her evidence described conduct by the deceased relevant to the issue of provocation: (i) the witness described the deceased as appearing to be angry when he invited the offender to join him outside the house to fight him; (ii) according to the witness, the deceased remained angry after the offender expressed his unwillingness to fight him; (iii) the witness described the deceased’s behaviour subsequently as being angry and threatening and as he leant over the witness he threatened to stab her. 
         
         
        [33] I refer to the cross-examination of Karen Crittenden when she was asked about the content of statements made to the police at p 101: 
         
         
          
          Q — And if I could ask you to go, please, to page 3 of that statement at paragraph 20? 
           
           
          A — Yes. 
           
           
          Q — There you say that in fact what Brett was saying to you when he was leaning over you was, “I’ll stab you, don’t think I won’t because you know I will, I’ll stab you”? 
           
           
          A — Yes. 
           
           
          Q — And you say further down that he repeated that threat a number of times? 
           
           
          A — Yes. 
           
           
          Q — And he continued saying the threat whilst Mark was inside? 
           
           
          A — Yes. 
           
           
          Q — And he wasn’t saying that quietly, was it, he was yelling that at you? 
           
           
          A — Yeah, he was in my face, yes. 
          
         
         
        [34] Karen Crittenden said the offender was only in the house for a short time before he returned and the stabbing occurred. She said that when the offender came back outside the deceased was still in the same position leaning over her and shouting in her face.  
         
         
        [35] I accept the evidence of Karen Crittenden as above summarised and it has a direct bearing upon the issue of provocation.  
        
       
      
    9 The sentencing judge then made the following finding of fact:  
     
      
       
        
        [36] Having reflected upon the evidence given by Karen Crittenden and the expert assessments of the psychiatrists in this matter, I find that at the time he stabbed the deceased the offender was acting under provocation, and the offender is to be sentenced therefore for the crime of manslaughter. 
        
       
      
    10 The sentencing judge referred to the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Alexander (1994) 78 A Crim 141, and proceeded to consider in turn the degree of provocation offered, the lapse of time between the provocation and the loss of self-control, and the degree of violence displayed by the offender.  
     
      
    11 The sentencing judge noted that the applicant had offered to plead guilty to manslaughter four months after the commission of the crime, and he allowed a discount of 25 per cent from the sentence he would otherwise have imposed. The sentencing judge accepted that the applicant’s expressions of contrition and remorse were genuine.  
     
      
    12 The sentencing judge referred to a number of cases in which sentences for manslaughter had been imposed, and imposed the sentence stated above, after saying this:  
     
      
       
        
        [58] Ms Davenport submitted that I should find special circumstances because this sentence will represent the first substantial period of time that the offender has spend in custody and because the offender needs treatment for his panic and anxiety attacks identified by the psychiatrists. I am not persuaded that I should find special circumstances here. I am satisfied that the offender is not likely to offend again and that his prospects of rehabilitation are good. These of course are matters which I take into account in his favour. However, I do not consider that the offender will require a longer period of supervision on parole than that which will be provided for in the sentence I am about to impose. Moreover I do consider in all the circumstances of this case that the offender should not serve any less a period in custody than that which I am about to set. 
        
       
      
    13 The applicant seeks to rely on the following grounds of appeal:  
     
      
       
        
        1. The trial judge failed to assess adequately or properly the gravity of the provocation and the applicant's response to it, having regard to the applicant's own history and psychiatric conditions.  
         
         
        2. The trial judge failed to have regard to the fact that on the facts established this was also a case of excessive self defence.  
         
         
        3. By reason of the matters set out in Grounds 1 and 2 the sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the objective gravity of the offending.  
         
         
        4. The sentencing judge failed to have adequate or proper regard to the applicant's history and psychiatric conditions in assessing the applicant's subjective case.  
         
         
        5. The sentencing judge erred in failing to find special circumstances such as to bring about a reduction in the non parole period against the head sentence.  
        
       
      
    14 Mr Game SC for the applicant said that there was a single overall argument, to the effect that the sentencing judge did not fully appreciate and did not adequately take into account the combined effect of:  
     
      
      (a) The incident which had occurred to the applicant in Perth on 1 July 1978;  
      (b) The psychological aftermath of that incident; and  
      (c) The particular impact that the deceased’s conduct had on the applicant, in the peculiar circumstances in which the applicant found himself.  
      
    15 In written submissions for the applicant, Mr Game referred to aspects of the sentencing judge’s reasons, and continued:  
     
      
       
        
        19. It is against that background that the findings in paragraphs [31] and [36] were made. However, important questions and issues remained unaddressed and were not accounted for, or adequately accounted for, in the findings that his Honour made when applying himself to the questions posed by Hunt CJ at CL in  
        Alexander 
         (here see remarks at [38]-[42].  
         
         
        20. First, it is explicit from the report of Dr Giuffrida, and (it is submitted) not capable of rejection based on Dr Allnutt, that the applicant suffered a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, a panic disorder and an associated ""Dissociative Episode"" which materially contributed to the applicant's perception and response to very extreme circumstances in which he found himself.  
         
         
        21. His Honour appears to have thought that it was not necessary to resolve how ""his disorder"" was ""labelled"" (remarks para [31]). Putting aside ""labels"" this subject was at the heart of the assessment of the applicant's culpability.  
         
         
        22. The applicant's own past history together with the mental disorders he developed associated with the earlier traumatic events, was central to an assessment of the gravity of the provocation as perceived by him (on this see  
        Green v R 
         (1997) 191 CLR 335) and loss of self control due to ""fear"" can be an expression of provocation just as much as ""anger"" (see  
        Van Der Hoek v R 
         (1986) 161 CLR 158 per Mason J at 168). In this way it also goes to the loss of self control. These are two central tenets of provocation and they should fall within the realm of the issues contemplated by Hunt CJ at CL in  
        Alexander 
        .  
         
         
        23. Yet it is apparent from the remarks (particularly at para [39]) that the only practical way in which this material was taken into account in assessing the gravity of the offending was that the applicant was to be sentenced on the basis that he was ""entitled"" to have the Court approach this question on the basis that the offender entertained that perception [ie, that the deceased had access to a knife by means of the use of which he was in a position to carry out his threats towards Karen Crittenden] at the time he stabbed the deceased"" (para [39]).  
         
         
        24. It is significant also that nowhere else did his Honour, in consideration of the appellant's ""subjective case"", give any consideration to this mitigating history and powerful psychiatric case.  
         
         
        25. There is a further aspect to this subject. Early in these submissions it was noted that self defence was raised in defence counsel's opening but provocation was not raised. It is also fair to say that the defence submissions on sentence focused on provocation but not self defence. Section 421 of the  
        Crimes Act 
         which deals with excessive self defence and provides that self defence which is not, objectively speaking, ""a reasonable response in the circumstances"" as the accused ""perceives them"" results in guilt, for manslaughter and this is a statutory overturning of  
        Zecevic v DPP 
         (1987) 162 CLR 645 and reinstatement of  
        Viro v R 
         (1978) 141 CLR 88; see on this  
        R v Katarzynski 
         [2002] NSWSC 613.0.  
         
         
        26. Although counsel did not advance the matter as one of self defence (which would lead to an acquittal) or excessive self defence (manslaughter), the fact is that the sentencing judge's own acceptance of the applicant's history to Dr Giuffrida and Dr Allnutt amounts to a finding of ""excessive self defence"" or very close to it. Whether it does in fact do so is perhaps not something that must necessarily be decided here.  
         
         
        27. What should have been taken into account on sentence (whether or not s 421 was satisfied) was that ""provocation"" was not a full account of the circumstances in which the applicant found himself. There was also a very significant element of defence of another which was best described as ""excessive self defence"". In short, on the evidence, the applicant did believe that it was necessary to do what he did to defend Ms Crittenden even although within the words of the section the response was ""not a reasonable response in the circumstances"" as he perceived them.  
         
         
        28. In the result there has not been an adequate assessment of the applicant's culpability. The full extent of the provocation and the applicant's response to it was not properly assessed both in the context of ""provocation"" and ""excessive self defence"". The applicant's psychiatric disorders were given insufficient weight and were not properly assessed by his Honour. This same material was not considered or considered in any adequate way on the applicant's subjective case.  
         
         
        29. The applicant's sentence should be re-assessed and reduced accordingly. The head sentence and the non-parole periods should both be reduced. In addition, or alternatively, there should be a finding of special circumstances and a reduction down of the non parole period which is currently 76% of the head sentence. 
        
       
      
    16 In oral submissions, Mr Game submitted that the measure of gravity of the provocation must have regard to the special sensitivity of the accused: see Green v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 334 at 372. Mr Game submitted that the sentencing judge’s finding at [40] that the degree of provocation “should be assessed as significant, but by no means extreme” did not give effect to this principle, having regard to what the sentencing judge had said in the previous paragraph:  
     
      
       
        
        [39] It is not clear precisely what the offender’s perception was about the threat of the knife attack by the deceased. The offender had been with the deceased earlier in the hotel and they then went to the premises where the attack took place. The clothing worn by the deceased would not have been capable of concealing a knife: he was wearing nylon football shorts which had no pockets, and a singlet which was also without pockets. Any knife that the deceased had, if there was one, would have to have been in the backpack he was wearing. The offender gave the detailed but confused account of events to Dr Allnutt which the doctor has referred to at pp 10–15 of his report. The offender also gave the account to Dr Giuffrida about the events and circumstances leading up to the stabbing recorded by Dr Giuffrida at pp 7–8 of his report. I will not record those accounts here but the evidence does not make it clear that the offender believed that the deceased was actually holding a knife when the offender stabbed him. The deceased was not armed with a knife, and the lighting where the attack took place was good enough for the offender to have seen this to have been the case. Nevertheless the deceased was angry, he was shouting and he was threatening Karen Crittenden. In the circumstances, having regard to the psychiatric assessments, the offender is entitled to have the court approach the issue of provocation on the basis that the offender entertained the perception that the deceased had access to a knife by means of the use of which he was in a position to carry out his threat towards Karen Crittenden. Further, the offender is entitled to have the court approach this question of provocation on the basis that the offender entertained that perception at the time he stabbed the deceased. 
        
       
      
    17 Mr Game submitted that the sentencing judge did not sufficiently acknowledge the effect of the psychiatric evidence, particularly Dr Giuffrida’s evidence that, at the time of the offence, the applicant underwent a dissociative episode in which he re-experienced the original traumatic incident of 1978 when the victim was stabbed and bled to death, which was superimposed on what was actually occurring before him; that the applicant suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder reducing his ability to control himself; and that the applicant acted selflessly and without thinking in defence of Ms Crittenden and probably himself.  
     
      
    18 Mr Game submitted that the danger in which Ms Crittenden stood in his perception was a further matter of mitigation which the sentencing judge should have taken into account and did not.  
     
      
    19 I note that the applicant did give evidence at the sentence hearing, and that in addition to expressing his remorse, he gave only the following evidence concerning the circumstances of the offence:  
     
      
       
        
        Q. If I could just briefly take you back to the night, you told Dr Giuffrida and Dr Allnutt that at the time that the events started unfolding, in particular when Mr Crittenden was threatening Karen Crittenden, threatening to stab her, that you had flashbacks to events that had occurred in 1978 in Perth?  
         
        A. Yeah, that’s correct.  
         
         
        Q. Was that true?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. When you came down the stairs with the knife and saw Mr Crittenden still standing over Karen, did you again have any flashbacks about the events that had occurred in July 1978?  
         
        A. I did, yes.  
        
       
      
    20 There was no cross-examination on this evidence.  
     
      
    21 In this evidence, the applicant did not suggest that the history he gave to Dr Giuffrida was different from and more accurate than the history given to Dr Allnutt; and the history given to Dr Allnutt suggested that the flashbacks to 1978 did not last for any length of time and did not have a major impact on him. In submissions to the sentencing judge, the applicant’s counsel made no suggestion that one history was more accurate than the other; and in my opinion there could be no error by the sentencing judge in not addressing that issue.  
     
      
    22 I note also that the history given to both psychiatrists suggested that at the time the applicant believed the deceased had a knife and was about to use it to stab Ms Crittenden; but the applicant did not give any evidence to that effect, and when the sentencing judge asked the applicant’s counsel whether she was asking him to make a finding that the applicant had a perception that the deceased was holding a knife, the applicant’s counsel responded that it was not necessary “because it’s based on provocation” (presumably, referring to the finding of manslaughter and/or the submission as to the applicant’s culpability).  
     
      
    23 Thus, the case was not presented to the sentencing judge on the basis that it was one of self-defence, or that the verdict of manslaughter was appropriate because it was a case of excessive self-defence; and in my opinion, there was no error by the sentencing judge in not addressing that issue, or in the way he addressed the issue of whether the appellant believed the deceased had a knife.  
     
      
    24 In my opinion also, the reasons of the sentencing judge do not suggest that he failed to have regard to the special sensitivity of the applicant, or erred in assessing the provocation as significant but by no means extreme.  
     
      
    25 Thus, in my opinion, no error has been shown in the reasoning of the sentencing judge, having regard to the way the matter was conducted before him; and in my opinion, it cannot be said that the result arrived at by the sentencing judge was manifestly excessive. Also, while it may have been open to the sentencing judge to find special circumstances, the view of the sentencing judge that the parole period was adequate and appropriate was one which was open to him.  
     
      
    26 For those reasons, in my opinion, the following orders should be made:  
     
      
      (1) Application for leave to appeal against sentence granted.  
      (2) Appeal against sentence dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J : I agree with Latham J. 
     
      
    2 BLANCH J : I agree with Latham J. 
     
      
    3 LATHAM J : The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Nield (the Judge) on 10 July 2008 following a plea of guilty to an offence of Breaking and Entering with Intent to Steal (s 113(1) Crimes Act 1900). That offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. The applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 15 months with a balance of term of 5 months. 
     
      
    4 The sole ground of the appeal is that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance arising out of the sentence imposed upon a co-offender for the same offence. The co-offender, Tien Cong Nguyen, pleaded guilty in the Local Court and received a sentence of 6 months imprisonment. Mr Nguyen’s severity appeal to the District Court resulted in the suspension of that sentence. 
     
      
    5 The offence was committed at 1:30am on 20 May 2007. The applicant and his co-offender, using a crowbar, broke into a garage underneath a unit complex in Marrickville. The residents called police who apprehended the applicant. Approximately 12 bags were found outside the garage in the common area. The applicant maintained to police that the garage door was already open when he arrived and he denied knowledge of a pair of white gloves, which were found at the scene, bearing traces of the applicant’s DNA. The applicant claimed to have been visiting a friend in the unit complex that night. The applicant was charged with Aggravated (in company) Break, Enter with Intent to Steal. 
     
      
    6 The applicant maintained a plea of not guilty to that charge, and to the alternative charge of Breaking and Entering with Intent to Steal, until the first day of a trial set down for 18 February 2008. On that day he pleaded guilty to the lesser charge. The Judge afforded the applicant a 15% discount for the utilitarian value of the plea, which was in my view generous. 
     
      
    7 The co-offender, by way of contrast, made admissions to police upon his arrest and pleaded guilty to the offence at the first available opportunity in the Local Court. The co-offender’s prints were found on the crowbar. Mr Nguyen’s criminal history was more extensive than the applicant’s and contained 5 previous offences of a like nature, albeit some 10 years ago. The applicant is 5 years older than Mr Nguyen, although that is of no relevance given that both offenders are middle-aged. Their respective criminal histories commenced at the same time and each consist largely of minor property and drug offences. There is nothing to suggest that their subjective circumstances were materially different. 
     
      
    8 However, the applicant’s criminal history was problematic, to say the least. The applicant had been convicted of 7 counts of Break, Enter and Steal since 1993, the last occasion being in the year 2000. A sentence of 4 years imprisonment for Supply Prohibited Drug was completed in October 2006. Thus, the applicant committed the instant offence within 7 months of concluding his parole. 
     
      
    9 These matters were canvassed by the Judge in his remarks on sentence. Specifically, his Honour doubted that parity was relevant to the sentencing exercise, because the applicant was being dealt with on indictment, and the sentence imposed upon the co-offender but varied in the District Court was, in his view, manifestly inadequate. The applicant agrees that the sentence was lenient. I am of the view that, whilst the sentence imposed by the magistrate was within an appropriate range, the subsequent suspension of that term of imprisonment rendered the ultimate penalty manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    10 The applicant does not contend that the Judge fell into error or that his sentence is manifestly excessive. This matter raises the same issues as the decision of this Court in R v Doan [2000] NSWCCA 317, wherein Grove J (with whom Spigelman CJ and Kirby J agreed) said :- 
     
      
       
        
        This poses a following question of whether the principle of parity operates so that the sentences, acknowledged to be within appropriate range, received by the appellant should be reduced to or towards the inadequate sentences received by the co-offender.  
         
        18 In  
        Lowe 
         Brennan J rejected the notion that where one right and one wrong sentence were perceived, a court should address the situation by producing two wrong sentences: @ 617 and see  
        R v Stroud 
         1977 65 Cr App R 150. However Mason J said that the correct principle was “that a court of appeal is entitled to intervene when there is a manifest discrepancy such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance, by reducing a sentence, which is not excessive or inappropriate considered apart from the discrepancy, to the point where it might be regarded as inadequate” : @ 613-4. Dawson J (with whose reasons Wilson J agreed) said:  
         
        “But justice should be even-handed and it has come to be recognized both here and in England that any difference between the sentences imposed upon co-offenders for the same offence ought not be such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the offender with the heavier sentence or to give the appearance that justice has not been done ……………. This has led to the variation of sentences by courts of appeal in order to reduce the disparity between sentences separately imposed upon co-offenders even where the sentence varied was not in itself excessive. The cases suggest that there has been a greater reluctance in England than here to vary the longer sentence in such a situation. There is always the dilemma that in order to eliminate the disparity the Court may have to reduce a sentence which it regards as proper in itself because of an inadequate sentence imposed upon a co-offender. To do so, it has been observed, is to compound the error. The view has been expressed in England that a court should not interfere unless the disparity is gross or glaring and the circumstances are ‘most exceptional’ ………. The decisions in this country to not appear to be quite as restrictive as this but on any view the interference of a court of appeal is not warranted unless the disparity is such that the sentence under appeal cannot be allowed to stand without it appearing that justice has not been done. The difference between the sentences must be manifestly excessive and call for the intervention of an appellate court in the interests of justice……….” @623-4. 
         
        19 Synthesis of these views confirms that a decision to make any reduction is discretionary. Recognizing this Hunt CJ at CL (James J agreeing, Smart J dissenting) said:  
         
        “The issue is whether the particular sense of grievance (or injustice) is a legitimate one. There is in my view, a stage at which the inadequacy of the sentence imposed upon the co-offender is so grave that the sense of grievance engendered can no longer be regarded as a legitimate one”:  
        R v Diamond 
         unreported CCA 18 February 1993. 
         
        ……………………………………………………………………………. 
         
         The judgments in  
        Lowe 
         dealt with the discretion to intervene possessed by an appellate court but a similar discretion must be possessed by a sentencing judge when faced with manifestly inadequate sentence imposed upon a co-offender whose culpability and circumstances were equivalent.  
         
        
       
      
    11 I would add to these observations, those of Johnson J (Giles JA and Hoeben J agreeing) in R v Wei Pan [2005] NSWCCA 114 at [35] :- 
     
      
       
        
        Where there is a degree of disparity so as to invite a reduction in the sentence imposed, it is not necessary for the Court of Criminal Appeal to intervene if the result of doing so is to produce a sentence disproportionate to the objective and subjective criminality involved:  
        R v Boney 
         [2001] NSWCCA 432 at paragraph 15. A stage can be reached at which the inadequacy of the sentence imposed upon the co-offender is so great that the sense of grievance engendered can no longer be regarded as a legitimate one:  
        R v Diamond 
         (Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 February 1993, unreported, BC9302054);  
        R v Boney 
        , above, at paragraph 16. 
        
       
       
      See also  
      Melikian v R  
      [2008] NSWCCA 156 at [35]. 
       
      
    12 The Judge’s exercise of discretion has not been demonstrated to have miscarried. I see no basis for the intervention of this Court. The fact remains that the applicant chose to deny responsibility for the offence until he entered his plea of guilty. He did not give evidence on sentence and his account of his personal life and drug treatment was described by the Probation and Parole report as “discrepant”. His criminal history did not justify the extension of any leniency. Any lesser sentence than the one imposed would produce a result that is disproportionate to the applicant’s criminality.  
     
      
    13 I propose granting leave to appeal, but dismissing the appeal.

    IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL  CCA 2008/16242 GROVE J BLANCH J LATHAM J 13 February, 2009 
     
     Regina v Tony John RANIGA 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1 GROVE J: The Court is in a position to deal with this matter and I ask Justice Blanch to give judgment.2 BLANCH J: The Crown appeal is pursuant to s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1912 against a sentence imposed on the respondent in the District Court at Sydney on 5 December, 2008. The respondent had entered pleas of guilty to one charge of robbery in company under s97(1) of the Crimes Act, 1900 which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and a second count of aggravated robbery under s95 Crimes Act, 1900 which also carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. On the first count (and taking into account two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on a Form 1 committed on the same day) the sentencing judge deferred passing sentence on condition the respondent enter into a bond under s9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999 for a period of four years. On the second count he was convicted but no punishment was imposed pursuant to s10(A) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999.3 The offences occurred in the early hours of the morning of 15 December, 2007. The respondent had been out drinking with three other offenders Faafua, Absolum and Wihongi. The other offenders and the respondent were part of a group of about eight males who were seen to be fighting amongst themselves and affected by intoxicating liquor at Hurstville. The first assault on the Form 1 occurred at 3.35 a.m. when Vangel Toitov was walking towards the group of males. The respondent said to him “What the fuck are you looking at?” The victim did not reply and the respondent punched him to the face causing bruising and swelling to his right cheek. He then punched the victim to the lip causing further bruising. The victim then escaped. 4 The second assault on the Form 1 occurred when the victims Phillip Kok and Cheyne McFarlene-Child were outside a store in Forest Road, Hurstville. The respondent said to McFarlene-Child “Take off your beanie”. He refused and the respondent punched him to the left side of his face causing pain and redness. The victim ran off. 5 The robbery in company contained in the first count occurred when the respondent said to Phillip Kok at the same location “Take off your glasses.” The victim said he could not see without them and the respondent then punched him to the face and head two or three times causing him to fall to the ground. While he was on the ground the respondent continued to punch him. At that stage an unknown co-offender kicked the victim to the head. The respondent took from the victim a Sony Playstation Portable and a mobile phone. He looked through the victim’s wallet but did not remove any items but he did ask the victim “What’s your PIN?” The victim did not reply. 6 The group of males then left that area and walked up the escalator leading to Hurstville railway station where the offence in count 2 was captured by CCTV. The footage depicts the respondent scuffling with Wihongi and then the victim Luke Dilosa walked past talking on a mobile phone. Without warning the respondent punched the victim to the face and grabbed his shirt causing it to tear. He yelled at the victim “Give me your fucking phone” and hit him again. There was then a scuffle between the victim and the respondent which moved behind a wall. For a period all four men were in the vicinity of the victim and the victim said he was hit again and he thought by more than one person. He took his phone out of his pocket and threw it away from him. The scuffle then moved back in view of the CCTV camera which shows the other three men walking away but the respondent still assaulting the victim.7 At the hearing before the sentencing judge, Faafua and Wihongi also appeared for sentence but they entered a plea of guilty to affray in full satisfaction of the indictment and they were each released on a bond to be of good behaviour.8 The respondent entered pleas of guilty on an indictment presented to the Court at the time of sentencing. The submission by the Crown is that the sentence in respect of the first count and the failure to impose any sentence on the second count is manifestly inadequate. It is pointed out that this Court has recognised that the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 applies to offences of robbery in company: see R v Murchie (1999) 108 A Crim R 482 and R v Lesi [2005] NSWCCA 63. It is also pointed out in respect of the two matters which appear on the Form 1 that this Court said in Attorney General’s Application under s37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No. 1 of 2002 (2002) 137 A Crim R 180 that the entire point of the process is to impose a longer sentence than would have been imposed if the primary offence had stood alone and that it is wrong to suggest the additional penalty should be small and said sometimes it will be substantial.9 The Crown also points out that this Court has accepted that the guideline judgment in R v Henry (supra) applies to offences under s95 which is the second count: see Azzi v R [2008] NSWCCA 169 and R v Tortell and Tsegay [2007] NSWCCA 313.10 In the guideline judgment in R v Henry supra at page 380 it was said that in a category of cases which contain the following features: 
     
      
      “(i) Young offender with no or little criminal history; 
      
     
     
      
      (ii) Weapons like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury; 
      
     
     
      
      (iii) Limited degree of planning; 
      
     
     
      
      (iv) Limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof; 
      
     
     
      
      (v) Victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver; 
      
     
     
      
      (vi) Small amount taken; 
      
     
     
      
      (vii) Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case” 
      
    a full term of imprisonment of between four and five years would generally be appropriate. That decision was arrived at taking into account many years of previous experience in the Courts and it has been the practice of the Courts since then to continue to be guided by that assessment of the criminality in these cases. The guideline judgment went on at page 386 to say that non-custodial sentences: “… should be restricted to the exceptional cases to which the authorities have always referred.”11 The sentencing judge justified the decision not to impose a sentence on the basis that there were exceptional circumstances in this case. The respondent was a young man said by the judge to be aged 19 at the time of sentence. He was in fact 20 at that time but was 19 at the time of the offences. He had no prior criminal history. His parents were born in Fiji but migrated to Australia as teenagers and the respondent and his four brothers were born in Australia. The respondent and his family are active members of the Pentecostal Church and he is a band leader for their congregation. The sentencing judge heard evidence from the respondent’s father and the Pastor of his church and he was satisfied the actions of the respondent were out of character. In order to find exceptional circumstances in this case the judge took into account submissions that the respondent was unlikely to re-offend and that he had taken positive steps to overcome his binge drinking. It was also submitted that the fact that he had been drinking “blunted any intent which he might have had”.12 The judge also referred to the opinion of Dr Westmore that he appeared insightful and remorseful and that “…his risk of re-offending is negligible to non-existent if he does not abuse alcohol again.” He went on to quote Dr Westmore’s opinion that “… in prison I would consider him to be a prisoner at risk, certainly from a psychological perspective. That is because he does not have antisocial personality traits or an antisocial personality disorder, conditions frequently found in the general and longer term prison population. Those people may have an adverse influence on Mr Raniga’s psychology.”13 In considering the offender’s responsibility for his actions, the question of his intoxication is of some significance. He has always maintained that he was so drunk he cannot remember any of his actions and has portrayed the offences as having occurred after he had drunk 24 Jim Bean mixed cans. On the other hand he was aware enough on the night to make the various demands on his victims which I have reported in the facts and he was walking around the streets of Hurstville.14 The question for this Court is whether all of these factors are so exceptional as to lead to the result that a non-custodial penalty or any penalty short of full-time imprisonment would be appropriate. In my view they are not. The counts on the indictment are serious offences which carry maximum penalties of 20 years and in respect of the first count the two charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm must be given proper evaluation. There is a strong community entitlement for sentences for these offences to reflect the principles of general deterrence. It is true in this case there are strong subjective features and full weight should be given to his youth, lack of criminal history, plea of guilty, that he is unlikely to re-offend, that he has good prospects of rehabilitation and that he has shown remorse. 15 A factor which appears to have been significant in the sentencing judge’s reasons is the expression of opinion by Dr Westmore of the possible psychological harm in sending the respondent to gaol. That can be said in respect of anyone who is sent to gaol and it is particularly true of people going to gaol for the first time. It is an unfortunate consequence of imprisonment but it is an inevitable result when the inmates of prisons are people who have committed criminal offences. It is not an exceptional feature peculiar to this case.16 The failure to impose any penalty on the second count is properly conceded by the respondent to be an error. It is difficult to envisage any situation where it would be appropriate not to impose any penalty for an offence which has a maximum penalty of 20 years. When s10A was introduced into the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999 in 2007 the Second Reading Speech indicates it was to “… overcome situations where inappropriate sentences have been imposed such as fines of 50 cents.” It is clear from the Second Reading Speech the purpose was to introduce an option for nominal sentences to be imposed. It cannot be used to overcome the injunction in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 624 where it was said in the joint judgment of McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ: 
     
      
      “A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of accumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality.” 
      
    17 It is of course necessary to bear in mind the principle of double jeopardy when dealing with a Crown appeal and to recognise that the respondent has already been through the sentencing process and is now required to go through it again. However, in spite of that, I believe the appeal by the Crown should be allowed and the orders in the District Court should be quashed. In that case it will be necessary to re-sentence and in doing that the sentence to be imposed will be significantly less than it might otherwise have been because of the double jeopardy. 18 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
      1. allow the appeal; 
      
     
     
      
      2. quash the orders of the District Court deferring sentence on the first count and not imposing a sentence on the second count; 
      
     
     
      
      3. on the first count, sentence the respondent to a non-parole period of six months with a balance of term of 18 months to date from today and in doing that I take into account the two matters on the Form 1. That non-parole period will expire on 12 August, 2009; 
      
     
     
      
      4. on the second count, impose a non-parole period of three months from 13 August, 2009 and a balance of term of 12 months and order his release to parole on 12 November, 2009 under the terms of supervision specified in the Schedule to the  
      Sentencing Act 
      . 
      
    19 GROVE J: I agree.20 LATHAM J: I also agree.21 GROVE J: The orders of the Court, therefore, will be as proposed by Justice Blanch.

    3 KIRBY J: On 21 April 2008, Mathew Peter Clarke (the applicant) was arraigned before Coolohan DCJ and a jury on a charge of aggravated indecent assault (contrary to s 61M(1) Crimes Act 1900) (maximum penalty; imprisonment 7 years). The circumstance of aggravation was that the victim was a young woman less than 16 years old. Mr Clarke pleaded not guilty. On 23 April 2008, after a short trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. On 18 June 2008, Coolohan DCJ sentenced Mr Clarke to imprisonment with a non parole period of 12 months (18.6.2008 to 17.6.2009), the balance of the term also being 12 months (expiring 17.6.2010). Mr Clarke seeks leave to appeal against that sentence. 
     
      
    4 Before going to the notice of appeal, I should first describe the circumstances in which the offence was committed. 
     
      
       
      The incident. 
       
      
    5 The complainant was a young woman aged 14½ years. Her half sister was the partner of Mr Clarke. Mr Clarke and his partner had been together for about six years. There were three children and his partner was pregnant. The complainant and her siblings were in the habit of visiting the household and sometimes staying overnight. On 23 January 2007, the complainant and her older brother (aged 17) went to the home of Mr Clarke and their sister. The brother was with a friend. Mr Clarke, his partner’s brother and the friend began drinking. The complainant occupied herself with the children. After the children had fallen asleep, the complainant also went to sleep in the same room. His Honour, in his remarks, described what then happened in these words: (ROS 3) 
     
      
       
        
        “She said that she woke up with the offender touching up her nightie trying to get into her undies. She said that he was ‘just groping me and then touched my boobs, like got inside my like bra and my top’. The victim told the offender to get out and threatened to hit him if he did not get off her. She said that the offender asked to give her a kiss to which she replied, ‘No you are my sister’s boyfriend, get out now’. 
        
       
       
        
        The victim said that at the time she was wearing a blue nightie with underpants and a bra. She said that the offender touched her on the outside of her underpants but on the inside of her bra squeezing her left breast. The offender left the bedroom and the victim went and woke her brother. She wanted to go home but he had been drinking, so she stayed with him that night, and went home the next morning. She told her mother and the matter was duly reported to police.” 
        
       
      
    6 His Honour added: (ROS 3) 
     
      
       
        
        “In cross examination, when questioned about the area of or near her vagina which she said was touched by the offender, she described it as being just down from where ‘your undies go near your belly and just up from the clitoris’. She was asked a question, ‘So was that on your pubic area?’, answer, ‘Yes, yes’. She confirmed that it was on the outside of her underwear.” 
        
       
      
    7 His Honour determined that there were two circumstances of aggravation. First, the assault was a breach of trust (s 21A(2)(k) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999) (“the Act”). Secondly, as a consequence of the assault, the complainant had suffered substantial emotional harm, arising mainly, one gathers, from the rupture of family relations after the complainant went to the police (s 21A(2)(g) of the Act). 
     
      
       
      The Notice of Appeal. 
       
      
    8 The notice of appeal relied upon the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 1:  
        His Honour failed to give sufficient consideration to the strong subjective features of the appellant. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 2:  
        That his Honour failed to properly consider alternatives to full time custody. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 3:  
        That his Honour erred in considering some factors and placing too much weight on the Victim Impact Statement dated 6 June 2008. 
        
       
      
    9 It is convenient to begin with Ground 3 and then to consider Grounds 1 and 2. Grounds 1 and 2, in substance, carry the suggestion that his Honour erred, imposing a sentence which was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: The Victim Impact Statement. 
       
      
    10 No complaint was made concerning the finding that the offence amounted to a breach of trust. Such a breach was asserted by the Crown before the sentencing Judge and acknowledged by counsel for Mr Clarke (T 6: 16.6.08). Counsel for the applicant on this appeal did not suggest otherwise. Mr Clarke was not the complainant’s parent. However, the complainant was the sister of his partner, and a guest in his house. A position of trust is not limited to parental or spousal relationships (R v MAK [2005] NSWCCA 369; De Rosa v Western Australia [2006] WASCA 57; (2006) 162 A Crim R 344 at 359). 
     
      
    11 However, error is asserted in respect of the finding that the complainant suffered substantial emotional harm. The Crown tendered a Victim Impact Statement which was admitted without objection. The complainant said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “Since the incident that happened to me concerning Matthew Clarke, I have been unable to have contact with my 4 nieces one of whom I have never met. I have also been unable to have contact with my sister ... who I was always in close contact with. I have been worried about threats that have been made to me, this has caused much sadness. ... ” 
        
       
      
    12 The statement added that the complainant was worried about seeing Mr Clarke and her sister at her place of work, and had been afraid of Mr Clarke when she gave evidence. She had had counselling. On the basis of this material, his Honour said this: (ROS 4) 
     
      
       
        
        “... I should say that in her evidence in the trial, the victim gave evidence along these lines and there can be no doubt that there is some significant harm consequent upon the commission of this offence in the way that she describes.” 
        
       
      
    13 In substance, two complaints were made by the applicant concerning that finding. First, there was the question of causation. The emotional harm must be caused by the offence (s 21A(2)(g) of the Act). Here, according to the applicant, it was not the offence, that is, the conduct of Mr Clarke towards the complainant, that had caused her upset, so much as the disruption to the family that had followed her complaint concerning his conduct. That material, according to the applicant, should not have been given weight by the sentencing Judge, even though it was not the subject of objection. Secondly, before his Honour could characterise the harm as “substantial”, it had to be significantly more deleterious than that which an ordinary person would have experienced in the circumstances, since some emotional harm can be assumed (R v Youkhana [2004] NSWCCA 412, per Hidden J at [26]). It was submitted that, when the Victim Impact Statement was viewed in the appropriate light, that is, excluding indirect consequences arising from the complaint, the harm to the complainant could not be characterised as substantial emotional harm. 
     
      
    14 Dealing first with the question of causation, the harm to the victim must be limited to those consequences which were intended or reasonably foreseeable (R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193, per Howie J at [25], although see limitation in Siganto v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 656 at 667, [35].). It was predictable that, where a person such as a father or step father, or a person in the position of Mr Clarke in relation to his partner’s sister, indecently assaulted or sexually molested another person, the victim may complain. If there were a complaint, emotional harm and the potential for rupture to family relationships may occur. In my view, the harm occasioned by the offence is not limited to the physical or emotional reaction by the complainant to the assault itself.  
     
      
    15 Moving to the second issue, the characterisation by his Honour of the emotional harm as “substantial”, there can be no question that the victim suffered some emotional harm. His Honour, as the trial Judge, had the advantage of seeing the complainant give evidence. He formed a view as to the degree of harm. Whilst he was not obliged, on this material, to find substantial harm, I believe it was open to him to do so. Because, in my view, he was entitled to take into account the disruption to the family for the reasons given, he did not base his view upon irrelevant considerations. No error of the sort identified in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 has been suggested. 
     
      
    16 I would dismiss Ground 3. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: Insufficient weight given to the strong subjective case. 
       
      
    17 Mr Clarke did not give evidence on sentence. He was, however, interviewed by the Probation and Parole Service. A report was prepared. That report, together with seven references from various people including his employer, constituted his subjective case as set out in his Honour’s remarks.  
     
      
    18 Mr Clarke was, at the time of sentence, a man aged 29 years. Despite the separation of his parents, he had had a normal childhood. He was described as a relatively gifted student, both academically and as a sportsman. However, he left school having obtained the School Certificate and thereafter held a number of unskilled labouring jobs. At the time of sentence, he was employed as a pool cleaner. His employer spoke very highly of him (ROS 6). The Probation and Parole report included these words: (p 1)  
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Clarke has been with his current partner for approximately 6 years. Together the two are raising four children – the two youngest being his biological children. Mr Clarke’s partner has described him as a supportive partner and loving father to all of their children.” 
        
       
      
    19 Mr Clarke had a minor criminal history. He had been convicted of malicious damage as a child and placed on a recognisance. His only other convictions related to driving whilst affected by alcohol, for which he had been fined and disqualified from driving for a period. His Honour made the following finding in the light of this material: (ROS 6) 
     
      
       
        
        “... I think it can be concluded from what was said in those references, and because of the offender’s lack of any significant criminal history, particularly for like offences, that this offence was entirely out of character.” 
        
       
      
    20 However, Mr Clarke continued to deny the offence. The Probation and Parole report included the following comment, which his Honour accepted: (p 2) 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Clarke appears to have enjoyed the benefits of a loving and supportive family environment during his formative years and has managed to maintain these positive family ties throughout his adult life. It is also clear that his current relationship continues to provide him with a positive and nurturing family environment.  
        Despite the existence of such pro-social community ties the offender’s continual denials of guilt remain problematic for any future intervention and rehabilitation. 
        ” 
        
       
       (emphasis added) 
       
        
       
      
    21 His Honour plainly took these matters into account. He said this: (ROS 8) 
     
      
       
        
        “ ... Having given the matter careful consideration, and giving due allowance to the strong subjective factors, I am of the view that the appropriate sentence is one comprising a non parole period of twelve months with a full term of two years.” 
        
       
      
    22 Counsel for the applicant complained that his Honour failed to give the applicant’s strong subjective case sufficient weight. However, as the Crown said in its written submissions, these were matters for his Honour to evaluate. His Honour was obliged to form a judgment. The submission that evidence was not given “sufficient weight” inevitably encounters the difficulties described by Latham CJ in Lovell v Lovell (1950) 81 CLR 513 (recently reaffirmed in Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 330). Latham CJ in Lovell said this: (at 519) 
     
      
       
        
        “... The references in the various authorities on this matter to a failure to give sufficient weight to relevant considerations should not be understood in such a sense as to entitle an appellate tribunal to deal with an appeal from an order made in the exercise of a discretion in the same way as in the case of an appeal from any other order. If completely irrelevant considerations have been taken into account and they have really affected the decision the case is clear, and the order, though made in the exercise of a discretion, should be set aside. Similarly, if relevant considerations are plainly ignored the same result follows. But when the appellate tribunal is considering questions of weight it should not regard itself as being in the same position as the learned trial judge. In the absence of exclusion of relevant considerations or the admission of irrelevant considerations an appellate tribunal should not set aside an order made in the exercise of a judicial discretion (as to which see  
        Sharp v Wakefield 
          
        [1891] AC 173 at 179)  
        unless the failure to give adequate weight to relevant considerations really amounts to a failure to exercise the discretion actually entrusted to the court.” 
        
       
       (emphasis added) 
       
      
    23 Here, plainly his Honour’s evaluation of the evidence could not be characterised as amounting to a failure to exercise his discretion. 
     
      
    24 I believe there is no substance in Ground 1. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: Failure to consider non custodial alternatives. 
       
      
    25 The applicant pointed to the obligation under s 5(1) of the Act to consider alternatives to imprisonment. That obligation, as Howie J pointed out in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [25], was the preliminary question which the Court must address. It was a question, according to the applicant, which acutely arose in the context of this case by reason of the nature of the offence, the strong subjective case, and the statistics in relation to this offence maintained by the Judicial Commission. According to those statistics, 56 percent of offenders charged under s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act went to gaol. A high proportion of the remainder had their sentences suspended. The applicant drew attention to the words of the Court in Regina v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, where the following was said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[116] The nature of the offences included in the Table is such that only rarely will sentences involving an alternative to full time custody be appropriate. However, there is nothing in the Act, to indicate any intention to confine the available sentence, for a Table offence, to one of full time custody, provided that a non-custodial sentence would be a proper sentence upon the particular facts of the case. In fact, subject to appropriate reasons being given s 54C(1) of the Act expressly contemplates that alternatives to full time custody will continue to be available.” 
        
       
      
    26 It was submitted by the applicant that his Honour had denied the possibility of any alternative other than a full time custodial sentence in his concluding remarks when he said this: (ROS 8) 
     
      
       
        
        “ ... It seems to me in the light of the standard non parole period that the only possible sentence in relation to this matter is one involving a period of full time custody.” 
        
       
      
    27 Here, his Honour certainly considered alternatives to a full time custodial sentence. They were canvassed in submissions by counsel on the day Mr Clarke was sentenced. Counsel then appearing for Mr Clarke urged his Honour, if he believed a custodial sentence appropriate, to suspend that sentence. Mr Clarke, by reason of his crime, was ineligible for periodic detention (s 65B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999) and had been assessed as unsuitable for community service in the Probation and Parole report. These matters were referred to by his Honour in the course of his remarks (ROS 5). 
     
      
    28 So it is clear, I believe, from his remarks as a whole, that his Honour, in the passage set out above, was simply saying that in the circumstances he had identified, a full time custodial sentence was appropriate. The offence was serious, although below the mid range (ROS 4). The touching had been transitory and the offender had retreated. Nonetheless, the standard non parole period remained an important guidepost as to the sentence which should be imposed (ROS 8). That guidepost, in that context, suggested a custodial sentence.  
     
      
    29 In my view, there was no error. The sentence was within the available range. I would also dismiss Ground 2. 
     
      
       
      Order. 
       
      
    30 The order I propose therefore is that leave to appeal be granted, but the appeal dismissed.

      2007/2300 R v Ryan O’DONNELL 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: In the early hours of 26 January 2007, Mr Ryan O’Donnell stabbed Mr Allan Stephen Fuller, one of the stab wounds piercing Mr Fuller’s heart. Mr Fuller was admitted to Westmead Hospital, but died between 10.35am and 11.28am that day.  
     
      
    2 On 14 September 2007, Mr O’Donnell was indicted for the murder of Mr Fuller. When his trial commenced on 13 October 2008, Mr O’Donnell was re-arraigned and pleaded not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter. The Crown did not accept the plea in satisfaction of the charge. The trial proceeded, and, on 5 November 2008, a jury found Mr O’Donnell guilty of murder.  
     
      
    3 Traditionally the crime of murder has always been regarded as the most serious of crimes because it involves the felonious taking of human life with like intent or state of mind. The legislature has set a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for the worst category of murder and a standard non-parole period of 20 years. These are the guideposts by which the sentence that I now impose must be measured.  
     
      
    4 As is clear even from the difference between the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period, even within a crime perceived as the most serious because of our society’s view of the sanctity for human life, there is a range of culpability associated with the crime. In order to determine the objective features, which measure the culpability of Mr O’Donnell and then deal with his subjective circumstances, it is necessary to set out the circumstances of this offence. Before doing so I should briefly set out the purposes of sentencing in a case such as this.  
     
      
    Sentencing Principles 
     
      
    5 The purpose in sentencing any offender, even those charged with murder, seeks to resolve what are often, if not necessarily, conflicting goals. In serious crimes, such as murder, the importance of punishment and public deterrence loom large. These include the protection of society, personal and public deterrence, retribution and reform. Each of those factors, particularly the protective nature of sentencing, personal and public deterrence, and punishment, must have regard to the gravity of the circumstances, viewed objectively within the range of crimes that may fall within the offence charged. These point most obviously to the factors that require protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, and to retribution. Reform or rehabilitation may also be significantly affected by the objective circumstances of the offences, but is a factor affected most obviously by the subjective circumstances and the capacity for rehabilitation. That capacity for, and the likelihood, if any, of, rehabilitation, in turn, impacts upon the degree to which a sentence is fixed, which ensures the protection of society and the personal deterrence of the offender. There is no single correct sentence and the often complicated interplay of considerations point in different directions.  
     
      
    Circumstances of this Offence 
     
      
    6 The circumstances of the offence are fairly straight forward, although one eye witness, Ms April Stephenson, whose evidence I considered to be unreliable, gave a very different account from all other relevant witnesses.  
     
      
    7 On the evidence before the Court, and consistent with the jury verdict, the events of the night of 25 January 2007 can be briefly summarised and are clear. Mr O’Donnell had commenced work as a clerk in the public service, working at a call-centre. He had not worked there long, and had previously had difficulty obtaining employment.  
     
      
    8 Workplace drinks were organised for P.J. Gallagher’s Irish Pub at Parramatta and, it seems, Mr O’Donnell was keen to go and be part of the social group. While Mr O’Donnell has, and had, a continuing drug (cannabis) dependency problem, he did not consume drugs on 26 January 2007 and last smoked cannabis the night before the stabbing. I find that Mr O’Donnell was not directly affected by cannabis at the time of the stabbing.  
     
      
    9 However, Mr O’Donnell did consume alcohol. There are differences in evidence as to the amount consumed. He consumed the better part of a soft drink bottle (600ml) full of bourbon, together with a number of drinks bought for him, during the night, from the bar.  
     
      
    10 When Mr O’Donnell first went to the pub, he sat in the beer garden area, where he ate pizza and bread, drank the bourbon from the bottle (which he poured into plain coke or bourbon and coke, ordered from the bar).  
     
      
    11 After eating and drinking in the beer garden, Mr O’Donnell went downstairs. He says he remembers being downstairs but not the move from the beer garden. He also recalls being affected by alcohol, namely, not sober, but not “extremely intoxicated”. Downstairs he danced, and continued to drink.  
     
      
    12 At about 9.00pm that night, Mr O’Donnell was dancing and lifted one of his female colleagues and was told by security to put her down. The security guard spoke to Mr O’Donnell at or about that time because of his exuberant behaviour. The guard described Mr O’Donnell, when the issue was raised with him, as apologetic, as in control of himself rather than drunk, and generally as a “gentle giant”, “out for a good time”. The security guard assessed Mr O’Donnell’s sobriety and noticed that he was walking straight, speaking fluently and appeared excitable, but not intoxicated. That was also the assessment at about midnight, when the security guard spoke again to Mr O’Donnell, this time for spitting chewing gum. I find that Mr O’Donnell was affected by alcohol, but was not drunk, and was certainly not so affected as to hinder the formation of his intention, or, except in an indirect manner to which I will refer later, as to impact upon his control of his actions.  
     
      
    13 At about 2.00am in the early hours of 26 January 2007, the deceased, Mr Fuller, who was affected to some degree by alcohol, entered the area adjacent to the dance floor from the male toilet. The area was crowded, and he was a little unsteady on his feet. As he walked through the crowd to return to the area at which he had previously been standing and drinking, he stepped on Ms Stephenson’s foot. Ms Stephenson was neither a friend of, or known to, Mr O’Donnell.  
     
      
    14 Mr O’Donnell called to Mr Fuller and insisted that he apologise to Ms Stephenson. Mr Fuller’s response was brusque. There are two versions, each to the same effect. Mr Fuller said words the effect of: “Fuck you”, to which Mr O’Donnell replied in kind. Notwithstanding my general view that Ms Stephenson’s evidence was unreliable, I accept that the initial response by Mr Fuller may have sounded aggressive.  
     
      
    15 After this exchange, Mr O’Donnell approached Mr Fuller and, in a seemingly confrontational statement, asked him “to step outside”. Mr Fuller responded sceptically, or unbelievingly, and refused.  
     
      
    16 With his left hand, Mr O’Donnell grabbed Mr Fuller by the right shoulder at or about the same time as their foreheads met. There is no evidence that either head-butted the other. Rather, it seems, that they were grappling and positioned themselves “like props” in a scrum (not properly bound).  
     
      
    17 Mr O’Donnell pushed Mr Fuller down and moved his right hand in a motion that was described, by all the witnesses who noticed it, as a punching motion, or series of punches to the body of Mr Fuller.  
     
      
    18 It is a necessary inference from the evidence adduced that Mr O’Donnell was holding a knife and stabbing Mr Fuller during these “punches”.  
     
      
    19 Mr O’Donnell inflicted four stab wounds and a laceration to the left forearm. There were other injuries. One of the stab wounds was to Mr Fuller’s right shoulder, which seems to have occurred either when Mr Fuller was falling or being pushed over the arm of a bench seat or when Mr Fuller parried a blow which resulted in the knife cutting the top of Mr Fuller’s right shoulder. The laceration to the left forearm is consistent with an injury occasioned by Mr Fuller seeking to defend himself.  
     
      
    20 One of the stab wounds was a 4-5 cm stab wound to the chest, which, it was discovered after his death, had punctured the pericardial sac into the right ventricle of the heart, ultimately causing death. 
     
      
    21 After the stabbing, there was more “wrestling” and a few punches may have been thrown, albeit weakly, by Mr Fuller.  
     
      
    22 Blood spattered in a wide arc and pooled on the floor. The security guards, who had by that time arrived (the incident did not take very long), subdued Mr O’Donnell, took him to clean himself so as to check for wounds (of which there were none) and attended to Mr Fuller.  
     
      
    23 Mr O’Donnell had a conversation with a number of the security guards. The guards were concerned, amongst other things, to ensure Mr O’Donnell did not still have a weapon. Mr O’Donnell, the guards say, did not seem drunk. Mr O’Donnell was searched and, initially, denied any knowledge in words to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “Fuck off; I don’t have anything on me; I don’t have the fucking knife; I don’t know what you are talking about.” 
        
       
      
    And he also said: “There is no knife!”On being asked: “Did you do it?” Mr O’Donnell responded, initially, “No, I fucking didn’t stab him!” But later remarked: “Yeah, I fucking shanked the cunt!” 
     
      
    24 On being asked why he had stabbed Mr Fuller, Mr O’Donnell, after initially denying it, gave various reasons which included that “he swore at my friend”; “he pushed me first”; “he punched me first” and, ultimately, commented that “he deserved it anyway”. 
     
      
    25 I find proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Mr Fuller did not push or punch Mr O’Donnell before Mr O’Donnell seized Mr Fuller, and that he did not punch Mr O’Donnell before he, Mr Fuller, had been stabbed. In that regard, I accept the evidence of Mr Mansour, an independent witness, which, in most significant respects, is corroborated by all other witnesses. Mr Mansour, however, unlike a number of other witnesses, heard and saw how the “fight” commenced.  
     
      
    26 The weapon used was a black-handled fold-out knife without a spring loaded opening mechanism, i.e. it was not a “flick knife”. As such, interesting questions arise as to how and when Mr O’Donnell opened the knife. I am unable, on the evidence, to make findings in that regard. Even though the weapon was not a “flick knife”, it may be able to be opened with one hand and, therefore, may not have been opened before the fight started. However, it would take a deliberate act to open it. And Mr O’Donnell brought the knife to the pub.  
     
      
    Medical Treatment and Cause of Death 
     
      
    27 On admission to hospital, Mr Fuller was generally unresponsive and bradycardic. He was examined by the Emergency Department team in accordance with its protocol. He was subject to x-ray. An emergency laparotomy was performed and a Transoesophageal Echo was done in the operating theatre. It did not show any intrapericardial fluid. The left ventricle of the heart was under filled and contracting vigorously. No other structural abnormalities to the heart were evident. The other wounds were sutured.  
     
      
    28 Mr Fuller was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at 6.40am. At about 10.00am, Mr Fuller required washing, for which purpose he was rolled on to his left side. At that, he became hypotensive and bradycardic. CPR was commenced and another Echo (a Transthoracic Echo) was performed. A pig-tail catheter was inserted intrapericardially, which drained 80-100ml of fluid. On repeat Echo, there was no effusion around the heart, and, therefore, no surgical exploration occurred.  
     
      
    29 The wound to the right ventricle went undetected. It seems this occurred because the muscle in the heart closed the wound and no looseness in the pericardial sac occurred. Because the pressure in the right ventricle is relatively low (pumping blood only to the lungs), the wound remained closed until Mr Fuller was rolled on to his left side, opening the wound, causing blood to enter the pericardial sac (the fibrous bag surrounding the heart) and, amongst other things, causing blood loss to the left side of the chest thereby collapsing the left lung.  
     
      
    30 The stab wound to the chest, inflicted by Mr O’Donnell, caused death. This was the subject of a formal admission under s 184 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Ex PP).  
     
      
    The Trial 
     
      
    31 As earlier stated, Mr O’Donnell pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty of manslaughter. His defence to the murder charge was excessive self-defence. As a consequence some issues were formally admitted (see reference to cause of death, above) and a large number of witnesses were not called.  
     
      
    32 The attitude and conduct of Mr O’Donnell in that respect, while not being in the same category as a plea of guilty, or pre-trial assistance to law enforcement authorities (see s 22 and 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999), would, and are, considered to the credit of Mr O’Donnell as pre-trial disclosures under s 22A of the aforesaid Act.  
     
      
    33 Further, the course taken discloses some contrition and acceptance, by Mr O’Donnell, of responsibility for his actions. I take account, without identifying any specific value, of these factors.  
     
      
    Subjective Circumstances 
     
      
    34 Because of the manner in which the trial was conducted, and in particular the reliance by Mr O’Donnell on his alleged psychiatric issues, the Court has the benefit of evidence from two expert psychiatrists, a Pre-Sentence Report and a further written opinion from the psychiatrist qualified on behalf of Mr O’Donnell, relating particularly to his sentencing issues. 
     
      
    35 Mr O’Donnell was born on 30 September 1985 and was 21 at the time that this offence was committed. He had a troubled childhood. His parents separated when Mr O’Donnell was two years of age, and he has lived with his father (and stepmother) for some periods and otherwise lived with his mother.  
     
      
    36 His father was a strict disciplinarian and there is some evidence, which I accept, that, as a young child living with his father and stepmother, he was the subject of some physical abuse, which resulted in bruising, and witnessed domestic violence between his father and stepmother.  
     
      
    37 While Mr O’Donnell’s relationship with his father is (or was) poor, his relationship with his mother is a close personal relationship. His mother was institutionalised in a psychiatric facility when he was six years of age, because she was abusing cannabis and hearing voices. Notwithstanding his close relationship with his mother, in his earlier teen years, Mr O’Donnell was abusive towards his mother and took out his frustrations on her. While living with his mother she, for a seven year period, had a relationship with one of the two persons with whom she had been connected since the separation, and, according to Mr O’Donnell, that boyfriend “beat his mother and she sustained fractures to her face and ribs”. At that stage, Mr O’Donnell was aged 11 or 12 years.  
     
      
    38 He stopped living with his father from the age of 13 or 14 and had not seen his father for approximately 7 years prior to the incident at the pub.  
     
      
    39 There is evidence consistent with Mr O’Donnell having significant behavioural problems as a child, having to attend different schools and having significant psychiatric or psychological issues. Mr O’Donnell was admitted to Royal Brisbane Hospital as a 14 year old, presenting with Oppositional and Defiant Behaviour for approximately one year prior to his admission. The notes of the Hospital report that Mr O’Donnell had an abusive relationship towards his father’s new wife. His mother also had difficulty managing Mr O’Donnell’s behaviour. He was, even at that early age, using marijuana on a daily basis for at least a month prior to his admission. He was diagnosed with Oppositional and Defiant Behaviour. The attending doctor felt he may have had a drug induced psychotic disorder although, upon reflection, the doctor opined that he had a factitious disorder with the object of avoiding school. It was also reported that he had chased his mother around the house with a broomstick and lighter.  
     
      
    40 There are significant questions as to whether Mr O’Donnell was suffering (at the time of his admission to Hospital) from post traumatic stress disorder deriving from an assault and bullying by school peers. However Mr O’Donnell denied any auditory hallucinations following the suggested persecution. 
     
      
    41 As earlier mentioned, Mr O’Donnell had significant drug and alcohol problems. He began drinking alcohol at an excessive level at the age of 18 years. At that stage he would drink up to a bottle of bourbon per week and usually binge on the weekends. He admits to alcoholic blackouts, including shaking and early morning drinking. 
     
      
    42 Mr O’Donnell states that he began smoking cannabis at 13 years of age. He discontinued smoking it for a period but resumed the habit and was smoking at least from the age of 18 years to the date of the incident. At some stages he was smoking up to approximately 10-15 cones of cannabis per day. He had also used amphetamines, including crystal methamphetamines, which he usually took by snorting or swallowing but had, on two occasions, administered the drug intravenously. He also occasionally used ecstasy and experimented with cocaine and LSD.  
     
      
    43 According to both Professor Greenberg and Dr Allnutt, Mr O’Donnell was not psychotic and was rational and in control of his own conduct. Nevertheless, while differing in the degree of the condition, each of the psychiatrists agreed that he suffered mild paranoia, which, in Dr Allnutt’s opinion, caused him to perceive threat more readily than other persons would and to react as if the threat were greater.  
     
      
    44 Each of the psychiatrists (and the Pre-Sentence Report) opine that Mr O’Donnell has good chances of rehabilitation, provided he has some significant psychiatric intervention, and I accept those opinions.  
     
      
    45 Mr O’Donnell has no prior convictions and is relatively young. While Mr O’Donnell had in his possession a knife, being a dangerous weapon, and the offence was committed with a weapon, I accept that the offence was unplanned and/or unorganised. The Crown submitted that given the admitted drug use, it cannot be said that Mr O’Donnell was a person of good character. On the other hand, his drug abuse, while unfortunate, did not lead to any criminal record or matters that came to the attention of the police, and I am taking into account that, in that regard, he is a person of previously good character with a previously unblemished record with the police or courts.  
     
      
    46 As previously stated, I accept the opinions expressed by the psychiatrists that, with proper attention, Mr O’Donnell has good prospects of rehabilitation. I also accept that, with that treatment, likely to occur while in prison (and which I recommend should occur in prison), Mr O’Donnell is unlikely to re-offend. 
     
      
    47 As earlier stated, Mr O’Donnell has accepted, to some extent, responsibility for his conduct. However, his level of remorse is not at the highest level. I accept that he has acknowledged and is sorry about the injury and consequences of his action, but there is still a degree of lack of acceptance of responsibility for his conduct.  
     
      
    Conclusion 
     
      
    48 I do not consider that the offence committed is in the worst category of cases and it certainly does not require an indeterminate life sentence. 
     
      
    49 Were it not for some of the aspects of the subjective circumstances of Mr O’Donnell, the objective circumstances leading to this offence would require condign punishment and in particular punishment that reflected the general deterrence to the carrying of weapons in a public place, which weapons have been used to inflict damage. A knife is not a fashion accessory, and the courts need to make that clear to all. However, almost all murders are committed with a weapon, often a firearm, and the use of the knife, on this occasion, does not take the offence beyond the mid-range. The objective seriousness of the offence is at or about mid-range.  
     
      
    50 However, the subjective elements associated both with Mr O’Donnell’s history of psychiatric issues and his youth, render specific deterrence a less important aspect. They also render rehabilitation (on which I have already made findings) a more important aspect. Overall, and bearing in mind the subjective features relevant to Mr O’Donnell, particularly the leniency that should be afforded to a first offender who is spending his first period in prison, I consider that I am able to depart from the standard non-parole period and a sentence slightly under that is appropriate.  
     
      
    51 Because any sentence that is now imposed will involve a substantial potential parole period, I find that the need to be supervised for a significant length of time is satisfied and I do not find special circumstances. Mr O’Donnell needs supervision whilst in the community, particularly to ensure that the psychiatric issues, which I anticipate will be dealt with while in prison, can be translated into communal life and allow Mr O’Donnell, on release, to be more confident and less likely to re-offend. But that supervision is catered for, without a greater period of parole than the statutory formula provides.  
     
      
    52 Murder is the most serious of offences and causes the most serious of consequences. The deceased, Mr Fuller, is a person with a close family and, as one would expect, many people have suffered loss as a result of this crime. Nothing can replace that loss. 
     
      
    53 The maximum sentence is life imprisonment and the standard non-parole period is 20 years’ imprisonment. As one would expect with the most serious of offences, a full-time custodial sentence is warranted but, given my earlier comments, something less than the standard non-parole period is appropriate. Because of the past custody of Mr O’Donnell, the sentence will commence from 26 January 2007.  
     
      
    54 I have taken into account the Judicial Commission statistics and a number of cases that have been provided to me by the Crown and the defence. I have particular regard to the spontaneous nature of the crime. 
     
      
    Conviction and Sentence 
     
      
    55 Mr Ryan O’Donnell you are convicted of murder in that on 26 January 2007, at Parramatta, in the State of New South Wales, you did murder Allan Stephen Fuller.  
     
      
    I sentence you to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 16 ½ years commencing 26 January 2007 and concluding 25 July 2023, the balance of term being a further 5 ½ years expiring on 25 January 2029. You are first eligible for release on 25 July 2023.

     Richard Ivan Noel KITE v Regina 
     
     
     NON-PUBLICATION ORDER RE COMPLAINANT 
    1 GROVE J: I agree with Blanch J.2 BLANCH J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him at the District Court in Sydney on 1 February, 2008. He entered pleas of guilty in the Local Court to two offences of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of ten years contrary to s66A Crimes Act, 1900. The maximum penalty provided for each offence is 25 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 15 years. He was sentenced on each offence to eight years and four months with a non-parole period of five years. The first sentence consisted of a non-parole period of five years to date from 6 December, 2007 with a balance of term of three years and four months. On the second count the sentence was the same but to date from 6 June, 2008. Accordingly, the total sentence was one of eight years and ten months consisting of a non-parole period of five years and six months with a balance of term of three years and four months.3 The matter proceeded by way of an agreed statement of facts which was as follows: 
     
      
      “The complainant in this matter, NG, was born on 11 May 2000 and was 6 years old at the relevant time. 
       
       
      On 31 December 1006 the offender, Richard KITE, was at 7 Mill Hill, Port Macquarie for a family New Years Eve celebration. The house belonged to Peter Jackson who is the father of the offender’s defacto partner, Katherine Jackson. Also present at the party that evening were Pam McArdle – the complainant’s grandmother and partner of Peter Jackson; Darren McArdle – the complainant’s father; Krystel Boyd – the defacto of Darren McArdle; Suzanne McArdle – the complainant’s aunty; and Kerry Scott – Suzanne McArdle’s defacto. 
      
     
     
      
      A number of children were also present, including the complainant, Darren McArdle’s son, Suzanne’s three children and her niece and the offender’s 4 year old step-daughter and 4 month old son. 
      
     
     
      
      The offender had not met the complainant previously. She arrived at the house at about 6pm that night. 
      
     
     
      
      In the early part of the evening, the offender and the children were playing in the backyard swimming pool. The complainant was wearing only her underwear and the offender was wrestling and playing in the pool with her. 
      
     
     
      
      Throughout the course of the night, most adults were drinking and occupied the front lounge room of the house. Towards the rear of the house, a number of children, including the complainant, were sleeping and playing around at various times on lounges in the sunroom. 
      
     
     
      
      Between 10pm and midnight, all adults within the house were seated in the front lounge room, playing card games. 
      
     
     
      
      Prior to midnight the card game came to a halt and the adults commenced playing pool in the garage until well after midnight. The offender left the pool game on numerous occasions and went into the sun room where some of the children were sleeping on lounges. 
      
     
     
      
      On one occasion the offender stated that he was going to refill his drink and was gone for a period of over five minutes – despite the fact that he still had a full glass. On a number of occasions, Kerry SCOTT, who had become suspicious of the offender, followed him into the room and found him leaning over the back of a couch that the complainant and the offender’s step-daughter were lying on. 
      
     
     
      
      On one of these occasions, the offender was leaning over the couch where the girls were lying. SCOTT noticed that both children had their tops pulled up at least halfway along their stomachs, exposing their navels. The offender was touching and tickling his step daughter on the stomach, whilst they were asleep. When the offender noticed SCOTT, he stated ‘they are so cute and innocent whilst they’re lying there, so peaceful sleeping’. SCOTT asked the offender to return to their pool game. 
      
     
     
      
      Sometime after midnight, the offender went back into the sunroom where the complainant was sleeping on the couch. Other children were asleep on the other couch in the room. The offender sat on one end of the couch, moved the complainant’s legs as he sat beside her and pulled her skirt up to her waist. 
      
     
     
      
      The offender proceeded to perform cunnilingus on the complainant by pushing her legs apart with one hand, pulling her underpants to one side, placing his tongue on her vagina, licking her and then inserting his tongue inside the complainant’s vagina. The offender’s tongue went ‘right into the bottom’ (Q169, page 18 of transcript of interview with complainant) of the complainant’s vagina. This went on for what the complainant describes as a ‘long time’ (Q195, page 21 of transcript).(Sequence One) 
      
     
     
      
      The accused then inserted his finger into the complainant’s vagina and ‘pushed really hard down’ (Q203, page 21-22 of transcript). The offender inserted his finger ‘deep down…..the whole way down’ (Q212-213, page 22 of transcript) to a depth demonstrated by the complainant to be between 3-4cms. The offender pushed ‘more than once…..maybe nine times’ (Q225, page 24 of transcript). The complainant believed that the offender was trying to spread his spit further around her vagina (Sequence Two). The offender eventually ceased and left the room. 
      
     
     
      
      Upon returning home the following day, the complainant disclosed that the accused had ‘licked my fanny’ to her mother after being asked about her night. The police were subsequently contacted and shortly after the incident Detectives from Port Macquarie Child Protection Team interviewed the complainant who made full and clear disclosures regarding the assaults. 
      
     
     
      
      The complainant was taken for a Sexual Assault Investigation Kit (SAIK) at Port Macquarie Base Hospital where some abrasions to her vagina, consistent with the assaults, were noted. 
      
     
     
      
      By prior arrangement at 4pm on 20 February 2007 the offender attended Chatswood Police Station. The offender was arrested, cautioned and taken to the Custody Officer where he was informed of his rights under Part 9 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (LEPRA). 
      
     
     
      
      The offender was offered the opportunity of an interview but declined upon legal advice. He agreed to provide a voluntary DNA sample. He was then charged.” 
      
    4 The sentencing judge gave a careful and thorough consideration to all the relevant sentencing principles in what was a difficult sentencing exercise. His judgment is criticised only in respect of two matters. The first criticism made is that the judge failed to give to the applicant any benefit for his remorse and the second criticism is that his Honour wrongly concluded he had little confidence in the offender’s rehabilitation prospects. 5 As to the matter of remorse, on 6 December, 2007 when standing the matter over to consider the sentence his Honour said to the applicant’s legal representative: 
     
      
      “Assume I was to say he would get this 25 per cent discount for the early plea, good utilitarian value, it’s meant that the victim and her family haven’t had to give evidence, the standard matters, it’s the saving to the criminal justice system.” 
      
    6 Later on at page 2 of that transcript he said: 
     
      
      “To take it more than 25 per cent, given as I say, I see real benefits to the victim’s family, the criminal justice system and the court system and it’s also of itself an acknowledgement of his remorse, which I accept is genuine. All I’m saying is, any more than 25 per cent, you let me know why you say that.”  
      
    7 In the course of his remarks on sentence he said: 
     
      
      “I identify the discount applicable to the utilitarian (sic) of the plea and for the remorse expressed as being 25 per cent.” 
      
    At the conclusion of his remarks on sentence, he was asked to clarify whether the 25% discount was for both the utilitarian value and for remorse and his Honour made it clear that the 25% discount was for both the utilitarian value and remorse. 8 This was a case where the prosecution case consisted of the complaint made by the complainant the next morning to her mother. There was an abrasion which gave support to her version and there was some observation of the applicant in the room next to the child on the night. It was a case where there would be difficulties for the prosecution at trial because of the age of the complainant. The applicant entered pleas of guilty at the earliest opportunity and by doing that there was significant utilitarian value and a significant avoidance of any further problems for the complainant who was saved from the prospect of having to give evidence in circumstances where the evidence indicated the complainant was upset when asked to think about the incident. It does appear to me that it is a case where a discount of 25% for the utilitarian value of the plea was justified and that appears to have been the sentencing judge’s first assessment of the matter.9 The sentencing judge did accept in his remarks on sentence that the applicant was remorseful. He had the opportunity of hearing from the applicant in evidence and he accepted that his remorse was genuine. Similar remorse was expressed to the psychologist W. John Taylor who said: 
     
      
      “… from comments made by him it is apparent that he has an awareness of the damaging effects of his behaviour on the victim. He also expressed responsibility for his offences.” 
      
    10 He also expressed his feelings of guilt and shame about his behaviour to the Probation Officer who recorded it in the pre-sentence report. In my view it would have been appropriate to give to the applicant some benefit in the overall sentencing process for the fact that he understood how serious his conduct was and that he was remorseful for it. It is not appropriate to express that as a percentage or to engage in a mathematical exercise but it is a factor to be taken into account in arriving at an appropriate sentence, see R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 and R v Saleib [2005] NSWCCA 85.11 Remorse has always been a factor taken into account in mitigation. How that is done is now regulated by s21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999, which states that it has to be regarded as a mitigating factor: 
     
      
      “… but only if: 
      
     
     
      
      (i) the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions and 
      
     
     
      
      (ii) the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both).” 
      
    Those provisos were clearly met in this case not only from the evidence of the applicant but also from the report of Mr Taylor and the pre-sentence report.12 In R v MAK and R v MSK (2006) 167 A Crim R 159 the Court made it plain that since the introduction of s21A the preferable course is not to quantify a discount for remorse and it has been pointed that the simplest way to proceed in sentencing is to arrive at a discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty whether in specific terms or not and then proceed to review what Gleeson CJ in R v Gallagher (supra at 228) called the “complex of inter-related considerations” which could in appropriate cases include remorse. Because s21A makes specific provision for remorse to be considered as a separate mitigating factor, to include it as a factor contributing to the percentage discount for the plea of guilty can give rise to a perception of double counting.13 As to the prospects of rehabilitation, the evidence before the sentencing judge was that the applicant had a minor criminal history and had never been sentenced to imprisonment. He had two driving convictions in New Zealand in 1990 for which he was fined and drug convictions in 1992 and 1998 in New Zealand for which he was also fined. He had been in a number of de facto relationships, the last one was over a period of four years and the Probation report in November, 2007 indicated there was a son who at that time was aged 14 months. He left that relationship following his arrest. The Probation Service interviewed his last partner who said she was “’shocked’ by his involvement in the offences before Court” and she added that “there had never been any indication of inappropriate behaviour towards the children in their family life.”14 In the Taylor psychological report it was noted that he was currently in the position of being an assistant manager and had had that employment for seven years. That report went on to say: 
     
      
      “He is assessed as having a low to moderate risk of general recidivism. His risk of sexual recidivism is considered to be low- moderate. These opinions are based on actuarial analyses and clinical judgement.” 
      
    15 The report went on to note that he had sought treatment after the offences for his problem with alcohol and he had also attended five or six sessions with a psychiatrist.16 Bearing in mind all of those factors, I do not believe that a negative view of the applicant’s prospects for rehabilitation is justified, particularly when the applicant was so frank in acknowledging how serious his behaviour was. I believe he has good prospects of rehabilitation and both the common law and s21A(3)(h) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999 require that this be treated as a mitigating factor.17 In those circumstances there should be some amelioration of the penalties which have been imposed both to reflect his remorse and his prospects of rehabilitation.18 Because new sentences are to be imposed, it is necessary to consider the material which has been tendered relating to the applicant’s conduct in gaol. That material confirms that the applicant is a model prisoner and that he has sought to engage in a treatment programme. I don’t believe that places him in any better position than when he was before the sentencing judge because I would have concluded from the material produced at his sentencing that he would seek treatment and would be a model prisoner. That is why I believe he has good prospects of rehabilitation. 19 It is also somewhat unclear from the sentencing judge’s remarks as to what effect he gave to the limited nature of the applicant’s prior convictions. He said: 
     
      
      “I do not think that the charges permit these factors to warrant extending any significant degree of leniency to the offender in this regard.” 
      
    In Ryan v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 267 the High Court noted that a person being sentenced was entitled to “some leniency for his otherwise good character.” See per McHugh J at page 278. That needs to be considered in the context of re-sentencing.20 The difficulty in re-sentencing in this Court is the same difficulty as faced by the sentencing judge and that is to balance the subjective features relating to the appellant against the undoubtedly serious nature of the offences. The offences are ones which involve a standard non-parole period of 15 years which must be seen as an indicator of how serious the law regards the offences. They are clearly offences where a strong element of general deterrence should be reflected in the sentences.21 The proportion of the total sentence reflected in the parole period should also be adjusted to provide for an appropriate period of supervision of the applicant once he is released from custody.22 I would: 
     
      
      1. grant leave to appeal. 
       
      2. allow the appeal. 
       
      3. quash the sentence imposed on the first count and instead impose a sentence of a non-parole period of four years and six months from 6 December, 2007 with a balance of term of three years. On the second count I would quash the sentences imposed and instead impose a sentence of four years and six months from 6 June, 2008 and a balance of term of three years.

    3 HARRISON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentences imposed by his Honour Nield DCJ on 1 June 2007. The applicant had pleaded guilty in the Downing Centre Local Court on 21 March 2006 to five charges and was committed to the District Court for sentence. On 23 January 2007 the applicant appeared for sentence in the Sydney District Court and adhered to his plea in relation to all charges. Those charges were as follows: - 
     
      
      Charge 1 
      : That on or about 21 March 2005 at Sydney, by deception, the applicant dishonestly obtained for himself a financial advantage, namely the crediting of $26,125 to the bank account of B I Connections Pty Ltd. 
       
       
      Charge 2 
      : That on or about 7 April 2005 at Sydney, by deception, the applicant dishonestly obtained for himself a financial advantage, namely the crediting of $45,650 to the bank account of B I Connections Pty Ltd. 
       
       
      Charge 3 
      : That on or about 5 May 2005 at Sydney, by deception, the applicant dishonestly obtained for himself a financial advantage, namely the crediting of $52,250 to the bank account of B I Connections Pty Ltd. 
       
       
      Charge 4 
      : That on or about 26 May 2005 at Sydney, by deception, the applicant dishonestly obtained for himself a financial advantage, namely the crediting of $59,400 to the bank account of I Q Pty Ltd. 
       
       
      Charge 5 
      : That on or about 6 June 2005 at Sydney, by deception, the applicant dishonestly attempted to obtain for himself a financial advantage, namely the crediting of $118,800 to the bank account of I Q Pty Ltd. 
       
      
    4 The first four charges were offences contrary to s 178BA(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (""the Act"") and attracted a maximum penalty of imprisonment for a term of 5 years. The fifth charge was an offence of attempting to commit an offence contrary to s 178BA(1) of the Act and also attracted a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. 
     
      
    5 The applicant was originally sentenced as follows: - 
     
      
      On charge 1 
      : to a term of 2 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 23 days commencing on 23 January 2007 and expiring on 12 February 2009 with a balance of term of 8 months and 7 days commencing on 13 February 2009 and expiring on 20 October 2010. 
       
       
      On charge 2 
      : to a term of 2 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 24 days commencing on 23 July 2007 and expiring on 18 August 2009 with a balance of term of 8 months and 7 days commencing on 16 August 2009 and expiring on 22 April 2010. 
       
       
      On charge 3 
      : to a term of 2 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 23 days commencing on 23 January 2008 and expiring on 14 February 2010 with a balance of term of 8 months and 7 days commencing on 15 February 2010 and expiring on 22 October 2010. 
       
       
      On charge 4 
      : to a term of 2 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 24 days commencing on 23 July 2008 and expiring on 15 August 2010 with a balance of term of 8 months and 7 days commencing on 16 August 2010 and expiring on 22 April 2011. 
       
       
      On charge 5 
      : to a term of 2 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months commencing on 23 April 2009 and expiring on 22 October 2010 with a balance of term of 1 year and 3 months commencing on 23 October 2010 and expiring on 22 January 2012. 
       
      
    6 The aggregate sentence thereby imposed was 5 years commencing on 23 January 2007 and expiring on 22 January 2012 consisting of an aggregate non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months commencing on 23 January 2007 and expiring on 22 October 2010 and an aggregate balance of term of 1 year and 3 months commencing on 23 October 2010 and expiring on 23 January 2012. 
     
      
    7 On 1 June 2007 his Honour re-opened the sentence proceedings pursuant to s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. His Honour then revoked all five sentences imposed on 13 April 2007 and in lieu of those sentences he imposed the following terms of imprisonment: - 
     
      
      On charge 1 
      : to a term of 2 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months and 10 days commencing on 23 January 2007 and expiring on 2 October 2008 with a balance of term of 6 months and 21 days commencing on 3 October 2008 and expiring on 22 April 2009. 
       
       
      On charge 2 
      : to a term of 2 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months and 9 days commencing on 23 July 2007 and expiring on 31 March 2009 with a balance of term of 6 months and 21 days commencing on 1 April 2009 and expiring on 22 October 2009. 
       
       
      On charge 3 
      : to a term of 2 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months and 10 days commencing on 23 January 2008 and expiring on 2 October 2009 with a balance of term of 6 months and 21 days commencing on 3 October 2009 and expiring on 22 April 2010. 
       
       
      On charge 4 
      : to a term of 2 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months and 9 days commencing on 23 July 2008 and expiring on 31 march 2010 with a balance of term of 6 months and 21 days commencing on 1 April 2010 and expiring on 22 October 2010. 
       
       
      On charge 5 
      : to a term of 2 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 1 year commencing on 23 October 2009 and expiring on 22 October 2010 with a balance of term of 1 year and 3 months commencing on 23 October 2010 and expiring on 22 January 2012. 
       
      
    8 The aggregate sentence thereby imposed was 5 years commencing on 23 January 2007 and expiring on 22 January 2012 consisting of an aggregate non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months commencing on 23 January 2007 and expiring on 22 October 2010 and an aggregate balance of term of 1 year and 3 months commencing on 23 October 2010 and expiring on 23 January 2012. 
     
      
    The appeal 
     
      
    9 The applicant relies upon four grounds of appeal as follows: - 
     
      
      Ground 1 
      : ""His Honour erred in determining aggravating factors and setting sentence for offences."" 
       
       
      Ground 2 
      : ""His Honour erred when he failed to consider significant mitigating factors."" 
       
       
      Ground 3 
      : ""His Honour erred when he imposed a crushing and manifestly excessive sentence."" 
       
       
      Ground 4 
      : ""His Honour erred when he re-sentenced the offender."" 
       
      
    10 The Crown did not oppose the grant of any extension of time that the applicant sought in this appeal for leave to appeal against his sentence. 
     
      
    11 The applicant appeared for himself unrepresented in this Court. His written submissions in aid of his appeal would also appear to have been prepared without the assistance of legal advice. 
     
      
    Background 
     
      
    12 At the time that the offences were committed the applicant was employed by the New South Wales Department of Health. He was dismissed from that employment on 4 August 2005. The offences were serious involving a breach of trust and a combined loss to the department of $183,425, and an unsuccessful attempt to obtain a further $118,800. The applicant committed the offences by lodging documentation with his employer that purported to support payments for staff training provided by companies with which he was associated when no such training had been provided at all. The documentation was entirely false and the transactions were shams. 
     
      
    Ground 1 
     
      
    13 The applicant contended that his Honour erred by treating the breach of trust, the substantial loss that was suffered and the planning that occurred as aggravating factors. The defence had argued at the sentencing hearing that if the injury is an element of the offence it could not also be taken into account as an aggravating factor. Section 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that it is an aggravating factor that ""the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial."" In his remarks on sentence his Honour said the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""25. In determining an appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender for each of the offences I must recognise the purposes of sentencing outlined in Section 3A of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         and I must take into account such of the aggravating factors referred to in Section 21A, subs 2, of that Act as are present and such of the mitigating factors referred to in subs 3 of that section as are present and any other relevant factor. 
         
         
        26. There cannot be any argument that the offences committed by the offender are serious offences. They were planned offences. They were committed by an employee of the department in gross breach of the trust imposed [sic] in him by the department. They resulted in a substantial loss of money to the department. 
         
         
         
         ***** 
         
         
        29. As to Section 21A, subs 2, . . . I consider that the aggravating factors are those lettered (g) because the department's loss was substantial, (k) because the offender abused his position of trust as an employee of the department and (n) because the offences were planned and that, as to subs 3 of that section, the mitigating factors are those lettered (e) because the offender's criminal [sic, record] is not significant, (i), because of the offender's admissions of guilt when interviewed and his early guilty pleas to the charges show his remorse and, (k), because of his guilty pleas."" 
        
       
      
    14 I do not think that his Honour erroneously took into account as aggravating factors any matters that were otherwise elements of these offences in the way suggested by the applicant. The reference by his Honour to pars (g), (k) and (n) of s 21A(2) does not to my observation pick up any specific elements of the s 178BA charges in an impermissible way at all. The factors referred to in those paragraphs continue in my view to have work to do and no double counting took place. 
     
      
    15 The applicant also submitted that in expressing his view that there had been substantial loss to the department his Honour failed properly to discriminate between or among the various offences and in particular to take account of the fact that there had been no loss at all as a result of the attempt offence. His Honour was required to sentence in relation to each of the offences individually and to the extent that he took account of the size of the losses the applicant contended that he did not do so. The applicant agued that the correct approach would have been to determine whether the loss was substantial in relation to each separate offence and impose a sentence accordingly.  
     
      
    16 The applicant also submitted that by taking this approach his Honour imposed sentences that were potentially distorted or inflated by an inappropriate reference to the totality of the offending, in place of the individual monetary amounts involved in each offence. This may in turn have led his Honour to place far greater emphasis on things such as punishment, deterrence and retribution than would otherwise have been warranted in the circumstances. The Court was referred to a series of arguably comparable cases such as R v Tomich [2002] NSWCCA 175; (2002) 127 A Crim R 234, Scanlan v R [2006] NSWCCA 238 and R v Fisher [2001] NSWCCA 143. The applicant argued that by comparison to these cases he had received a sentence that was disproportionately high having regard to the sums involved in those cases and to the corresponding sentences that were imposed. 
     
      
    17 The Crown argued that no error had occurred in his Honour's approach. However, I consider that his Honour's comments at par [26] of his remarks on sentence, that the offences ""resulted in a substantial loss of money to the department"", fail adequately, or indeed at all, to distinguish between the amount of the loss that is individually referable to each of the offences. His Honour's approach in sentencing the applicant for charges 1 to 4 inclusive was to impose what were in effect identical sentences. The amounts involved were not the same and in the case of charge 1 it was approximately one half of the amount involved in charge 4. Moreover, a review of the cases upon which the applicant relied suggests that the sentences imposed in similar cases were for amounts that approached the total sum involved in all of the present offences but were quite different to the sums involved in the individual offences. The choice of a starting point of three years for each of the first four charges appears to have resulted from a failure separately to consider aggravating factors that may have been established in relation to each individual charge. In my opinion this is an error that this Court should correct. 
     
      
    Ground 2 
     
      
    18 The applicant submitted that his Honour overlooked a significant number of mitigating factors. These are discussed below. 
     
      
    19 Mental illness: The applicant had a long history of severe depression that was documented in reports from his treating psychologist and psychiatrist. He also made submissions about a severe gambling addiction and unresolved child sexual assault. He submitted that his Honour overlooked a material consideration being the impact of stress affecting the applicant that arose from his work and an internal inquiry there in an unrelated matter. These matters played a central role in the period immediately prior to the commission of the offences and were never fully explored. 
     
      
    20 Assistance given to authorities: The applicant submitted that his Honour failed to consider the applicant's assistance given to police throughout the police investigation. This would appear to be a submission drawing upon the fact that the applicant co-operated with the police. 
     
      
    21 Bail: His Honour failed to consider that the applicant was on bail for a period of two years without further offending which should have been treated as evidence of substantial rehabilitation warranting special circumstances and mitigation. 
     
      
    22 Delay in process: The proceedings took two years to conclude. 
     
      
    23 Offences committed over a short duration: The offences were committed as a short burst of criminal behaviour attracting a high degree of concurrence. 
     
      
    24 First custodial sentence: His Honour failed to give consideration to the fact that this was the first time that the applicant had served any term of imprisonment. 
     
      
    25 Rehabilitation: The applicant contended that during the sentencing procedure his Honour indicated that the applicant's chances of rehabilitation were difficult to determine. His Honour failed to have regard to the period on bail with no offences committed together with successful abstinence from alcohol and drugs for a period of ten years. 
     
      
    26 Culpability of the casino (at which the applicant gambled: The applicant had been diagnosed with a pathological gambling addiction and was by definition a compulsive gambler who was susceptible to the attractive and alluring marketing strategies if the Star city casino in Sydney. He argued that in motivating the applicant to gamble and by inviting him to attend the casino the casino had entered into a relationship with him involving a duty of care to him that was breached. 
     
      
    27 Contrition: The applicant presented an argument for a reduction in sentence for his demonstrated contrition. He referred to and relied upon significant steps taken to seek help for his addiction, mental health and sexual assault issues. His attendance at counselling, psychiatric appointments and Gamblers Anonymous demonstrated a willingness to address issues in his life that were relevant to his original offending. 
     
      
    28 The Crown contended in response to these matters that they had all been addressed and taken account of by his Honour. His Honour referred to evidence of depression, drug and alcohol abuse and related matters and the evidence concerning sexual abuse. He also referred to the evidence of work related pressures and the applicant's belief that those pressures had caused his relapse into gambling. His Honour accepted that the applicant was addicted to gambling and that such addiction slightly mollified his culpability but he also observed that this did not reduce the seriousness of the fact that the offences had been committed to obtain money for that purpose. His Honour referred to the internal investigation and recognised that it was against the background of events at the applicant's workplace that he relapsed into gambling. 
     
      
    29 This Court has held that the commission of offences to provide funds for an addiction (including gambling) is not a matter to be considered in mitigation of an offence: R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [203] and [252] – [255]. See also R v Todorovic [2008] NSWCCA 49 at [12] – [13], [60] – [63], R v Huang, R v Siu [2007] NSWCCA 259; (2007) 174 A Crim R 370 at [42], Le v R [2006] NSWCCA 136 at [32] and Assi v R [2006] NSWCCA 257 at [27].  
     
      
    30 The Crown submitted that his Honour in fact relied upon the principle of totality, and not deterrence simpliciter, partially to accumulate the sentences. This was an appropriate approach for his Honour to take in all of the circumstances and it was therefore open to him to accumulate the sentences in the way that he did. 
     
      
    31 The applicant's assistance was no more than the making of admissions to police in the course of an ERISP. No other assistance was in evidence. 
     
      
    32 The period of two years on bail was contended by the Crown to be not particularly significant and his Honour was in any event aware that no further offences had been committed. 
     
      
    33 The period between charge and sentence was nineteen months to the date of the imposition of the initial sentences and twenty-two months to the date of the corrected sentences. These periods were unexceptional and did not attract the principles referred to in R v Sandford (Court of Criminal Appeal, 7 March 1994, unreported). 
     
      
    34 The primary significance of the circumstance that offences have been committed over a short period is the impact that that has upon the aggregate sentence to be imposed by virtue of the operation of the principle of totality: R v Holder [1983] 3 NSWLR 245 at 260. The Crown submitted that his Honour was well aware of the time frame over which the offences were committed and the aggregate sentence did not fail appropriately to reflect the period over which they occurred. 
     
      
    35 His Honour was also well aware that the sentences he was imposing were the first custodial sentences that the applicant would be required to serve. 
     
      
    36 The Crown also contended that his Honour recognised that the applicant had not consumed alcohol or drugs since 20 August 1997 and had abstained from gambling for ten years prior to the commission of the subject offences. In the circumstances his Honour could not have failed to notice or to appreciate that there was no evidence that the applicant had committed any further offences whilst on bail. The finding made by his Honour with respect to the prospects of rehabilitation was therefore entirely open. 
     
      
    37 The Crown submitted that the submissions about the casino's culpability were simply misconceived. His Honour took the applicant's admissions in the ERISP and his subsequent early pleas of guilty into account as evidence of remorse and contrition. 
     
      
    38 However, it is instructive in this context to recall what his Honour had to say in his remarks on sentence at pars [32] to [35]: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[32] What, then, having regard to what I have said about the offences and the offender, are appropriate sentences to impose upon him for the offences? 
         
         
        [33] Balancing the purposes of sentencing, the objective seriousness of the offences, the subjective features of the offender and the other factors, to all of which I have referred, I have determined that the starting point for the sentence for the offences is imprisonment for three years. I reduce each sentence by twenty five per cent, so that the period of three years is reduced to two years three months. 
         
         
        [34] Absent a special circumstance, the period of two years nine months would be apportioned into a non-parole period of two years twenty-one days and a parole period of eight months seven days. 
         
         
        [35] As to special circumstances, I cannot see anything in what I have said about the offences and the offender that I consider to be special"". (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    39 During the course of argument in this court, the applicant's case emerged as follows. Following his quoted remarks his Honour proceeded to impose a total sentence of imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months and a parole period of 1 year 3 months. His Honour clearly declined to vary the statutory ratio. The applicant's challenge to this approach in the circumstances therefore was not that it was not open to his Honour to decline to apply a finding of special circumstances, which it clearly was, but rather that the highlighted portions of the passages just quoted demonstrate that he was not even of the view that special circumstances existed at all. The applicant contended that having regard to the evidence before him his Honour's approach cannot withstand scrutiny and is erroneous. In particular the applicant contended that this was so having regard to the evidence of what occurred at his place of employment when he was made the subject of a special inquiry, superimposed upon his labile mental state. 
     
      
    40 His Honour recorded these matters in some detail and it is instructive to record what he said as follows: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""[5] The offender joined the St John's Ambulance Brigade during 1979 as a cadet and remained a member of the Brigade until the end of 1985. During his time in the Brigade he became an instructor and then an examiner. Between 1982 and 1985 he was sexually assaulted on a number of occasions by older members of the Brigade. I cannot say what effect these sexual assaults had upon him and whether they caused or contributed to his offending. 
         
         
        [6] The offender was a member of the Australian Army Cadet Corp at his high school. He was drum major in his unit's drum corps, chief medic in his unit and reached the rank of Company Sergeant Major. He was sexually assaulted on a number of occasions by older members of his unit. Again, I cannot say what effect these sexual assaults had upon him and whether they caused or contributed to his offending. 
         
         
        [7] After commencing the nursing degree course at Sydney University, the offender left his mother's home to live with his girlfriend. After some time, and I do not know when, this relationship broke down and he and his girlfriend separated. He is single and does not have anyone dependent upon him. 
         
         
        [8] In 1990 the offender commenced employment as a registered nurse at the Prince of Wales Hospital. He worked in Oncology, Paediatric Neurosurgery and the emergency department. 
         
         
        [9] In 1995 the offender was transferred from the Prince of Wales Hospital to Sydney Hospital at where [sic] he worked in the emergency department. 
         
         
        [10] For some time before 1995, and I do not know for how long, the offender had abused both intoxicating liquor and prohibited drugs. He suffered a breakdown during 1995 and was admitted into a drug detoxification centre.  
         
         
        [11] After discharge from the detoxification centre, the offender resumed his employment as a nurse but after about eight months he resumed his use of prohibited drugs. 
         
         
        [12] On 4 April 1997 the offender was charged with one offence of stealing from a dwelling and seven offences of making a false or misleading statement, and on 6 May 1997 he was dealt with by a magistrate in the Local Court at North Sydney for these offences. I do not know the facts related to these offences. 
         
         
        [13] During July 1997 the offender suffered a second breakdown. He resigned from his employment at Sydney Hospital and he was admitted into, firstly, the McKinnon Unit at Rozelle Psychiatric Hospital and then at the Phoenix Rehabilitation Unit at Manly Hospital. He was discharged from the Phoenix Rehabilitation Unit on 20 August 1997 after successfully completing the rehabilitation course. He has not consumed intoxicating liquor or used any drug since his discharge from this unit. 
         
         
        [14] During 1998 the offender commenced employment as a care manager in a clinical trial at Manly Hospital. 
         
         
        [15] During 1999 the offender was appointed to the position of Health Information Exchange Co-ordinator for the Northern Sydney Area Health Service. 
         
         
        [16] During 2001 the offender transferred from the Northern Area Health Service to the Department of Health to manage the department's data collection and reporting service. He held this position until he was suspended from duty on 29 March 2005 for alleged misconduct, that being, order splitting. His employment was terminated on 4 August 2005. Not surprisingly or unexpectedly, his suspension from his employment with the department was both embarrassing and distressing to him. 
         
         
        [17] Between mid March 2005 and 6 June 2005 the offender prepared 11 false invoices, five in the name of B. I. Connections Pty Limited and six in the name of I.Q Pty Limited, the successor of B. I. Connections Pty Limited, totalling of $302,225 claimed for staff training and submitted them in five batches to the Department of Health by personally putting them into the accounts payable tray in the department's accounts branch. He facilitated payment of the invoices by submitting them with falsified Department of Health non-creditor invoice vouchers, which he had signed in his name and countersigned in a false name. He received payments of four amounts totalling $183,425. 
         
         
        [18] The offender's fraud was discovered on 6 June 2005…""  
        
       
      
    41 Special circumstances were argued in the applicant's case at the sentencing hearing before his Honour. A report from Dr Bruce Westmore dated 22 July 2006 was tendered and it included the following opinion: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""I note the opinions of the psychologist but I am unable to confirm that Mr Marks was psychotic at the time the offending behaviour occurred. I do not think the history supports that proposition in any consistent way. 
         
         
        There is however a clear ""non psychotic"" explanation for his behaviour. He thought he was being picked on and bullied in the workplace and his ""paranoid"" ideation regarding that may be reality based. He was suspended for certain work practices and he acknowledges that he was very upset after that occurred."" 
        
       
      
    42 There was in my opinion considerable material before his Honour that did amount to special circumstances. The applicant had a history of mental illness that was not insignificant. He remains in need of psychiatric care and supervision. His psychologist was of the opinion that when assessed by him the applicant's ""state of mental distress closely reflect[ed] an ongoing pattern of mental health instability under stress"" and that he ""require[d] psychological treatment for his underlying traumatic abuse"". Added to this is the fact that the sentences imposed by his Honour will be the applicant's first time in custody. In R v McDonald [1994] FCA 956; (1994) 71 A Crim R 370, in the context of a gaol sentence imposed in relation to fraud offences, Burchett and Higgins JJ observed at 379 ""[in] a case of this kind, a first incarceration may have a very salutary effect, and the prospect that it may do so should not be left out of account when its length is fixed"".  
     
      
    43 It was not in such circumstances in my opinion open to his Honour to make the finding that he made at par [35] of his remarks on sentence. His Honour effectively put out of his consideration the matters to which his attention was drawn. He did not permit himself the opportunity to consider of whether or not the statutory ratio could be varied. Ground 3 
     
      
    44 It is uncontroversial that each of the applicant's offences should carry a sentence that is appropriate for that offence and that the totality of the sentence should be derived by appropriate orders for accumulation and concurrence. In this respect I consider that the individual sentences that were imposed by his Honour for each separate offence were on one view not inappropriate. No one sentence was excessive standing alone. However, whereas the principle of totality can obviously operate to lead to the imposition of an aggregate sentence for multiple offences that might exceed the maximum sentence available for any one or more of the individual sentences, the degree of accumulation between or among the respective sentences here under appeal is excessive and has produced an overall non-parole period that is too long. For this reason it is my view that the applicant's aggregate sentence is manifestly excessive even if the individual sentences are unexceptionable.  
     
      
    Ground 4 
     
      
    45 The re-opening of the sentence by his Honour was not opposed. The applicant suffered no prejudice in the circumstances. He does not suggest that the sentence imposed following the re-opening was more onerous than the sentence originally imposed. His Honour uncontroversially put in place a sentence that he had foreshadowed he would impose but which he mistakenly failed to implement. He corrected that failure when he re-sentenced. This ground of appeal is without merit. 
     
      
    Orders 
     
      
    46 In my opinion, having regard to the foregoing, some other less severe sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. I would therefore propose to re-sentence the applicant in accordance with the orders that follow. The effect of that re-sentencing will produce an aggregate sentence of 3 years and 5 months commencing on 23 January 2007 and expiring on 22 June 2010 consisting of an aggregate non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months commencing on 23 January 2007 and expiring on 22 October 2009 and an aggregate balance of term of 6 months commencing on 23 October 2009 and expiring on 22 April 2010. For that purpose I would propose the following orders: - 
     
      
      1. Grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. 
       
       
      2. Quash the sentences imposed upon the applicant by Nield DCJ on 1 June 2007. 
       
       
      3. In lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced to the following terms of imprisonment: - 
       
        
         
        (a)  
        On charge 1

        (d)  
        On charge 4 
        : to a term of 2 years and 8 months with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 23 October 2007 and expiring on 22 October 2009 with a balance of term of 8 months commencing on 23 October 2009 and expiring on 22 June 2010. 
         
         
        (e)

      SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On Friday 24 October 2008 Mirsad Mulahalilovic (the offender) pleaded guilty to the single charge contained in an indictment presented against him on that day. 
     
      
    2 The charge to which the offender pleaded guilty was that he, on or about 19 August 2005 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, did possess a thing, namely a quantity of firearm ammunition, which was connected with the preparation for a terrorist act or acts, being reckless as to the existence of that connection.  
     
      
    3 The sentence hearing was ultimately stood over until Friday 9 January 2009 when written and oral submissions were received and evidence was taken. Today my task is to impose sentence and to provide reasons for, and remarks in respect of, the sentence to be imposed. 
     
      
    4 In the course of these remarks on sentence I shall describe the background to the present plea, mention the principles of law appropriate to the sentencing process and make findings of fact in relation to the commission of the offence. In addition, I shall consider the objective gravity of the offence, the subjective circumstances of the offender and any other matter relevant to the imposition of penalty. Finally, it will be necessary for me, in certain areas, to choose between the contesting submissions of the parties. This area of disputation is, however, within a relatively small compass. 
     
      
       
      Background to the plea 
       
      
    5 The offender is one of nine men who were arrested and charged in late 2005 with a serious terrorism related offence. In this Court, an original indictment had been presented against the offender and the other men in May 2007. The charge in this indictment was that the offender and the other men, had conspired together to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. All the accused, including the offender, had earlier been committed for trial. This occurred in March 2007, following a lengthy committal hearing.  
     
      
    6 The trial against the nine men was set down to commence on 27 October 2008. The commencement of the jury empanelment was to occur on that date. (I should add that the Court had earlier been involved in some eight months of intensive pre-trial decision making prior to the jury empanelment. Those pre-trial procedures had commenced in February 2008, and had continued unabated until the week of 27 October 2008). 
     
      
    7 During the pre-trial process, one of the accused, Khaled Sharrouf, had been found unfit to plead. This led to the Court making an order that he be separately tried from the others. The order was made on 15 September 2008. On 12 September 2008, another of the accused, Mazen Touma, pleaded guilty to four charges contained in a fresh indictment. Plainly, an agreement had been reached between the Crown and Touma in this regard. The Crown had indicated that, in view of Touma’s then willingness to plead guilty to the four individual charges in the new indictment, the Director of Public Prosecutions would not proceed further against him in relation to the conspiracy charge. 
     
      
    8 A third member of the alleged conspiracy also determined that he would plead guilty to certain charges in a fresh four count indictment, alleging a series of terrorist offences. In fact, this offender, O, pleaded guilty to those four charges on 3 November 2008. At this stage sentence has not been imposed on O. Once again, the Crown informed the Court, presumably in conformity with the agreement reached between the parties, that the Crown would not proceed further against O on the conspiracy charge. 
     
      
    9 The particular circumstances which led to the presentation of the fresh indictment against the present offender and his subsequent decision to plead guilty to the new charge may be briefly stated. I have been told that, not long before the anticipated date of the jury empanelment in the conspiracy matter, the offender’s legal representatives had made a “No Bill” application on their client’s behalf. This application, however, was rejected by the Director of Public Prosecutions. There then followed an urgent application by the offender for a separate trial. This contested application was actively pursued in a hearing on 14 October 2008. At the conclusion of the hearing of the application, I announced that, in the exercise of my discretion, I would not order a separate trial for the offender. I determined that his trial should proceed together with the trial of the remaining men facing the conspiracy charge. A week or so later, on 24 October 2008, I provided reasons for that decision. It appears that extensive negotiations were taking place between the legal representatives for the Director and those appearing for the offender. This occurred during the intervening days between the decision and the publication of reasons. Those negotiations, as it happened, bore fruit in the sense that a fresh indictment was presented on 24 October 2008, and the offender immediately pleaded guilty to the new charge. The Director of Public Prosecutions took the position that, in view of the offender’s willingness to plead guilty to the charge in the new indictment, he would not proceed further against him in relation to the separate conspiracy charge. 
     
      
       
      The statutory offence 
       
      
    10 The offence to which the offender has pleaded guilty is contained in Part 5.3 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. Relevantly, s 101.4 of the Act provides: - 
     
      
       
        
        “(2) A person commits an offence if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the person possess a thing; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the thing is connected with preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in a terrorist act; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the person mentioned in paragraph (a) is reckless as to the existence of the connection described in paragraph (b)”. 
          
         
        
       
      
    11 The offence carries a maximum of ten years imprisonment. 
     
      
    12 The statutory definition of “recklessness” is found in Part 5.4 of the Criminal Code Act 1995: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) A person is reckless with respect to a circumstance if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) he or she is aware of the substantial risk that the circumstances exist or will exist; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) A person is reckless with respect to a result if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the result will occur; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) The question whether taking a risk is unjustifiable is one of fact. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) If recklessness is a fault element for a physical element of an offence, proof of intention, knowledge or recklessness will satisfy that fault element”. 
        
       
       
      The facts surrounding the commission of the offence 
       
      
    13 There is a large measure of agreement between the parties as to the facts that are relevant to the commission of the present offence. Regrettably, however, the parties were not able to agree completely in relation to all the factual allegations. It will be necessary for me to resolve the difference between the parties in that regard. The matters where agreement has been reached may be briefly stated as follows: - 
     
      
       
      (a) At the time of the arrest of the offender on 8 November 2005, police found a receipt in his wallet issued by Jansa Arms Co. That receipt was dated 19 August 2005. Jansa Arms Co traded at premises at 458 Bexley Road, Bexley, New South Wales 2207. 
       
       
      (b) The receipt recorded the purchase on 19 August 2005 of a quantity of ammunition. It was described in the receipt as “7-62-39 Ammo”. 
       
       
      (c) In the same wallet was found a torn page from a notebook on which was written the notation “308 or 7.62 x 39 cleaning kit” along with the words “black powder for black powder guns”. 
       
       
      (d) The police also located a firearms licence permit in the name of Mirsad Mulahalilovic. This had an expiry date of 19 July 2006 and had been issued under the authority of the Commissioner of Police New South Wales. There was also a card showing membership by the offender of the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia. This particular membership card, on its face, appeared to have expired on 31 March 2005. It indicated, however, that the offender had been a member of the association since April 2001. 
       
       
      (e) The precise detail of the terrorist act or acts stipulated in the indictment was, and is not, known to the Crown. The quantity of ammunition, to which the receipt related, however, has never been located. 
       
       
      (f) The ammunition mentioned in the receipt is of a type which is capable of being used in a variety of rifles including AK-47 rifles, SKS rifles and Zastava rifles. It was of a type identical to that which was the subject of an earlier enquiry made by O at the Condell Park Firearms Range and Gun Shop in late July 2005. It was identical to the type of ammunition recorded on a “to do” list found in the possession of O on 8 November 2005. It also appears that the ammunition was of a type identical to that which had either been purchased by or found in the possession of two other men. These two men were said to have been engaged in the alleged conspiracy during 2005. There was no evidence to suggest that the present offender had any knowledge of the activities of those two men in that regard. 
       
       
      (g) The “to do” list found in the possession of O on 8 November 2005 also contained an entry bearing the words: - 
       
       
        
        “See Mirsad - $ Ammo”. 
        
       
       
      (h) The offender was friendly towards, and associated with, O throughout 2005. 
       
      
    14 The critical area of disputation in relation to factual matters arose principally from the Crown’s assertion during the sentencing hearing that the offender held and embraced certain beliefs of an extremist nature. The holding of these beliefs was, according to the Crown’s submission, a relevant matter to be taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, and in relation to other matters generally relevant to the issue of penalty. Mr Turnbull SC, who appeared with Mr Djemal for the offender, accepted that the holding of views of this kind would be relevant to sentence, but disputed the factual conclusions advocated by the Crown. It will be convenient to state these at this stage. The Crown had submitted that at the time of the commission of the offence, the offender was a devout Muslim. There can be no doubt about that matter. The Crown, secondly, submitted that the offender held certain beliefs in relation to his interpretation of the Muslim faith. These were said to include the following: - 
     
      
       
      (a) Islam throughout the world was under attack and there was a religious obligation to come to the defence of Islam and other Muslims. 
       
       
      (b) Jihad was the primary means by which this religious obligation should be fulfilled. 
       
       
      (c) A significant and legitimate aspect of the fulfilment of this obligation was violent Jihad, which involved the application of force and violence, including in certain circumstances the killing of persons who did not hold or have the same fundamentalist beliefs. 
       
      
    15 The Crown argued that the fact the offender held these beliefs was to be inferred from the finding of a large volume of material supporting such views (extremist material) at his premises upon the execution of a search warrant at the time of his arrest. The extremist material was extensively described in a schedule provided by the Crown. In addition, the Crown provided DVD’s showing a selection of this material. 
     
      
    16 The type of images contained in the material may be briefly described. They appear to fall into a number of categories. First, there are images extolling the September 11 2001 attacks on America. Secondly, there are images involving Osama bin Laden and/or praising his activities particularly in relation to “warfare”. Thirdly, there are extremely gruesome images showing the brutal execution of foreign prisoners held by Militarist Islamists. These include, for example, the particularly horrible beheading of a Korean prisoner by a group of masked men holding rifles. All the images in this category are ghastly, to say the least. Fourthly, there are images praising suicide bombings, documents dealing with the defence of Muslim lands and the need to employ violent jihad in the defence of Islam. The Crown also pointed to the presence at the offender’s home of non-electronic material. For example, the book by Sheik Abdullah Azzam “Defence of the Muslim Land”. 
     
      
    17 Mr Turnbull SC countered by tendering a copy of a report by Ahamad Moutasallem. This was an analysis described as “Mulahalilovic Hard Disc Report”. It forms part of Exhibit 1, a folder containing the bulk of the material relied upon by the offender during the sentence hearing. The report is essentially a brief summary of the contents of each of the major sub-folders found on the hard disc of the offender’s computer. The author noted that the hard disc was quite large. In total, 150 gigabytes had been used consisting of over 100,000 files and over 5,000 sub-folders. The three main sub-folders contained much material that could be described as “benign”. It included, for example, Islamic lectures, Quranic recitations, Arabic religious songs, Arabic language classes and American movies. The war clips and execution material were described in the report as “random”, being interspersed among computer games, accounting documents and the like. There were, for example over 1,000 files of Islamic lectures. These “lectures” covered issues such as the translation of certain verses of the Koran, the lives of the Islamic Prophets etc. Many of the lectures encouraged Muslims to be open minded, diplomatic, pleasant, peaceful, wise and patient. The Arabic Anasheed’s content varied greatly. It ranged from gentle poetry about the affection a Muslim man should have for his wife to tracts concerning the occupation of the Muslim lands and the need for resistance. 
     
      
    18 There was also significant material on the hard disc relating to Arabic language classes (the offender did not speak Arabic as he was a Bosnian by birth). 
     
      
    19 There was a smaller folder which contained a number of recent American movies. There was also a considerable volume of music. There were also movie files from “Faces of Death” which appeared to be a selection of gory movies including animal attacks, deadly accidents, executions and amputations. There was also a hidden folder containing several pornographic videos. 
     
      
    20 The folder Exhibit 1 contains a lengthy summary described as “seized media summary – Mulahalilovic”. This summary gives further detail of the contents of much of the material found on the offender’s computer. It is 57 pages in length. The point made by Mr Turnbull SC was that the material relied on by the Crown to support its assertion that the offender held extremist beliefs and enjoyed extremist material must be seen against his possession of a much broader range of documentation, both Islamic and other, which is generally of a “benign” nature. I should mention that the Crown not only relied on the fact that the offender “possessed” extremist material on his computer. It relied on the fact that a good deal of this extremist material was apparently “shared” between the offender and those persons with whom he was originally charged as co-conspirators. For example, the Crown particularly relied on the fact that some of the extremist material was held by O in particular.  
     
      
    21 Exhibit “A” (a Crown exhibit) is a schedule of extremist and instructional material seized from the offender’s premises at 34 Kent Street, Belmore. This schedule demonstrates that a good deal of the extremist material, indeed most of it, was also held by O. For example, the images entitled “The End of America”. Secondly, the video introduced by Osama bin Laden showing a number of explosions of vehicles and persons. Thirdly, Islamic teachings about paradise. Fourthly, material described as “female suicide bombers for God”. Fifthly, the work entitled “Defence of the Muslin Lands”. I shall not list them all. There are many, including images and documents regarding jihad and the need to destroy non-believers and those who would “stray” from the path of Islam. Finally, mention might be made of a video described as “American Pigs Killed” showing a video of a truck exploding. It does not, however, seem that O had any of the execution videos or images in his possession. 
     
      
    22 In further support of his argument Mr Turnbull SC placed before the Court a number of character references and called a number of witnesses. In relation to the first category, the statements of the character witnesses became Exhibit 2 in the sentencing hearing. There is no need for me to detail these. Many of them stress that the offender was not disposed to violence and that he was generally a peaceful person. Many described him as honest, reliable and family oriented. His general practitioner, Dr Jamal Rifi, described the offender as “a gentle well mannered person”. Ms Rose Matijevic said, “he is not a violent or vengeful person…and I know he would not be involved in anything that would cause anybody any harm”. There were work references as well, attesting to the fact that the offender has always been a good worker. His mother provided a note which indicated that she had been working three jobs to maintain payments on the mortgage and the bills for the jointly owned home during his time in prison. The remaining character references stress the fact that the offender has never been involved in any violent behaviour, and that he is, generally speaking, “a peaceful person”. 
     
      
    23 These aspects of the offender’s character were commented upon by witnesses who gave evidence at the hearing. One particular witness, Mr Camdzic, gave evidence about the circumstances surrounding a conversation he had with the offender on 5 November 2005. This conversation had been captured in a telephone intercept. It is necessary to make some brief comment about this because the Crown has placed reliance on the conversation to suggest that it points to the offender’s support for extremist behaviour, particularly that related to a possible terrorist response. On 5 November 2005, the offender had been having a discussion with Mr Camdzic. The topic of discussion was an item on the internet in which a person in the United States of America had taken a copy of the Koran, shot at it and set it on fire. Both men expressed their disgust at this behaviour and the offender said “Don’t worry, there will be the day for them” (or, according to another translation “never mind, they’ll get theirs too”). 
     
      
    24 Mr Camdzic suggested that during this discussion there had been no suggestion by either man of any threat of extremist behaviour, but that they were each simply expressing abhorrence towards the behaviour, which they were discussing. 
     
      
    25 Even without the evidence of Mr Camdzic, I would not be satisfied that the particular remarks made by the offender during the conversation afford any particular basis for asserting that the offender was espousing extremist beliefs or suggesting extremist behaviour on that occasion. 
     
      
    26 Another witness, Mr Adkovic stated that, for example, the offender was particularly critical of those Muslims who had been involved in the infamous Beslan massacre. The Crown argued, however, that little weight could be given to this statement, as it was not confirmed by any evidence from the offender. 
     
      
    27 It will be apparent from all of the above that there is an area of dispute between the parties in relation to the extent to which the offender did or did not hold extremist beliefs and the extent to which the holding of such beliefs, even to the extent that they were held, ought contribute to the relevant considerations underlying the imposition of penalty in the present matter. The offender, of course, is not to be punished for the holding of extremist beliefs, but those beliefs, to the extent to which they were held, do have the capacity to impact upon an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence and they have a relevance, in other respects, for the sentencing process. This is particularly so in relation to the question as to whether the plea of guilty entered on the offender’s behalf might properly be regarded as the drawing back from the holding of any such extremist beliefs. Of course, if that were not the offender’s mindset, this will become a matter of little or no significance in the sentencing process. 
     
      
    28 I will return to this disputed area of fact in dealing with other aspects of the sentencing process. Before doing so, however, I will say something about the offender’s subjective circumstances. 
     
      
       
      The offender’s subjective circumstances 
       
      
    29 Most of the factual matters I will now describe emerge from the report of a consulting clinical psychologist, Emma Collins. Ms Collins provided a report dated 5 December 2008. The information she presented was gleaned from an interview she had with the offender on 1 December 2008. Some of the material referred to in the report was confirmed by the details of the character evidence called on the offender’s behalf. The offender himself gave no evidence before me and I have to say that, in matters of importance, as I will later explain, little weight can be given to some of these matters appearing in the psychologist’s report in circumstances where the offender has not given evidence or where it is not reliably supported by other evidence. 
     
      
    30 The indisputable facts, however, are that the offender is a 32 year old Bosnian born Muslim male. He has been bail refused and in custody for a little over three years. He had been living with his wife and family, and had a painting business, at the time of his arrest. 
     
      
    31 The background history establishes that the offender was the older of two brothers who were born and raised in a small Bosnian town. He had “a good childhood”. It appears, however, that for a time his father abused alcohol, and that this adversely affected his father’s parenting and general behaviour within the home. Consequently, the offender had a poor relationship with his father in these early years, principally because of these abusive experiences. The relationship, in more recent times has improved. His father has given up alcohol and has become more religious and devout in his daily life. 
     
      
    32 The offender completed his education to the end of Primary school. He did not have any learning or behavioural problems and probably would have continued with High School education were it not for the fact that the family life was disrupted because of the need to move to Germany in about 1992. This “forced” migration occurred because of the growing tensions and problems in Serbia. The family stayed in Germany for about four years and then they relocated to Sydney in 1996. 
     
      
    33 There is no doubt that these various moves, coupled with attendant language difficulties, would have had an unsettling effect on all the family, including the offender. It appears, however, that they have settled well in Australia and, after a time, adapted fairly well to Australian conditions. The family currently reside at Belmore. The offender became involved with his present wife in 2001 and they married the following year. The offender built a granny flat on the property for his wife and his daughter. (The child was born after he was taken into custody). The marriage is a good one and the offender’s wife remains supportive of him and visits him weekly. 
     
      
    34 The offender set up his own Plastering and Painting company a little while after he had moved to Australia and he was working in that capacity right up to the time of his arrest in 2005. He had always maintained consistent work within the community. 
     
      
    35 For a time, when he was living in Germany, the offender had experimented with drugs and experienced binge drinking. This behaviour, not unusual for a young man of that age, began to moderate after he moved to Sydney. From the time he turned 21, he ceased using cannabis and, after a short time, gave up alcohol altogether. The offender told Ms Collins that he experienced an increasing interest and participation in the religion of Islam. In relation to the present offence, the offender discussed this with Ms Collins. I will quote from the report (at paras 16 and 17): - 
     
      
       
        
        “He reports that he heard many varying religious beliefs and perspectives but he said that he did not get swayed by such influences and rather made his own choice about Muslim “schools” of religion through his own research and practices. Mr Mulahalilovic denied following beliefs relating to the fundamentalist application of jihad, stating that he does not tolerate the killing of “innocence”. 
        
       
       
        
        (He reports) that he discussed religious laws with some members of the Prayer Hall, including the co-accused. He states that he took this man’s comments lightly and did not give them much merit. He did acknowledge that he did not always challenge this man’s personal beliefs preferring to “keep the peace”. Mr Mulahalilovic attempted on one occasion to go pig hunting with this man, as was traditional in Bosnia, but the place where he had previously been with his family was closed. He reports that this man later asked him to buy some bullets for him and he complied. He told me that he was aware that this man’s gun licence had expired and so accepted that he was unable to handle firearms appropriately, given his (expired) licence. He reported that he was “naïve” as to how this behaviour could be construed as a terrorist act. Mr Mulahalilovic denied any knowing involvement in terrorism”. 
        
       
      
    36 The conclusions reached by Ms Collins in relation to the offence appear at para 23 in the following terms: - 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Mulahalilovic admits that whilst he did not condone more fundamentalist practices he did not always assert his beliefs around others, stating that he tends to avoid confrontation. Therefore, with regard to the current offence, there were times when he might have been more firm about his beliefs, but seemingly was unable to. If his account of not being aware of terrorist activity is to be given credence, his lack of assertion seems to be no more than what might be expected from anyone moving in a group of people where views of varying intensity are expressed and one does not want to make waves”. 
        
       
      
    37 Ms Collins thought the offender was a person who was rather passive in his communication style with others, and perhaps naïve in his appreciation of the motives of others, particularly those outside his family. He admitted that he had been manipulated by other more sophisticated parties. Ms Collins did not make any strong recommendations for treatment for Mr Mulahalilovic. She found him to be “a healthy person and reasonably well adjusted”. He was free from any major mental illness or recent substance abuse. Ms Collins, however, thought that the offender would have available to him a number of protective factors that would make him amenable to ongoing supervision in the community. She considered that he was a person who had stable accommodation available to him, a supportive family and the benefit of a firm relationship. He had “reasonable employment prospects”. 
     
      
    38 A number of these views of the offender were, to some degree, confirmed by each of the three character witnesses who gave evidence. Each of these persons confirmed that, based on his experience, the offender was not a violent person, nor a person given to violent behaviour of any kind. Each confirmed that, in a number of ways, the offender was quite a tolerant person, that is tolerant of people of different backgrounds and beliefs. All three witnesses thought that there would be no prospects of the offender committing any further offences, especially those of the kind referable to the offence to which he has pleaded guilty. They did not, however, provide any particular insight into the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence. 
     
      
       
       
       
       
      The statutory framework for sentencing in Federal matters 
       
      
    39 The statutory guidepost for the exercise of the sentencing discretion in the present matter is provided by s 16A(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth): 
     
      
       
        
        “16A(1) In determining the sentence to be passed, or the order to be made, in respect of any person for a Federal offence, a Court must impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence.” 
        
       
      
    40 Section 16A lists a number of matters which the Court must take into account ""as are relevant and known to the Court"". These include, relevantly, for the present sentencing exercise:  
     
      
    · The nature and circumstances of the offence· The degree to which the offender has shown contrition for the offence· The fact that a person has pleaded guilty to the charge in respect of the offence· The deterrent effect that any sentence may have on the person· The character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition of the offender 
     
      
       
      
    · The prospect of rehabilitation of the offender, and· The need to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence.   
     
      
    41 Although the need for general deterrence is not specifically listed among the factors in s 16A(2), a sentencing court must have full regard to the need for denunciation and general deterrence in determining the appropriate severity of the sentence in accordance with s 16A(1) (R v Paull (1990) 20 NSWLR 47; El Karhani (1990) 21 NSWLR 370). The formulation of words in s 16A(1) indicates that the sentencing principles developed at common law, rather than the various provisions in the State legislation, should apply for sentencing of Commonwealth offences (Faheem Khalid Lodhi v Regina (2007) NSWCCA 360 at [81] per Spigelman CJ; Johnson v The Queen (2004) HCA 15; (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at [15].) 
     
      
    42 It is clear that the common law concepts that are especially important in the present sentencing exercise are punishment, deterrence, denunciation and incapacitation (the last matter is often described as protection of the community - see Faheem Lodhi v Regina at [89, 97 - 109] per Spigelman CJ). In R v Martin (1999) 1 Cr App R 477 (at 480), Lord Bingham CJ, as the Senior Law Lord then was, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In passing sentence for the most serious terrorist offences, the object of the Court will be to punish, deter and incapacitate: rehabilitation is likely to play a minor (if any) part.” 
        
       
      
    43 There is also a need to consider the nature and purpose of the anti-terrorism laws, the reasons for their enactment and, in the context of the particular offence, the maximum penalty prescribed by the legislature.  
     
      
    44 In relation to the first matter, part 5.3 of the Criminal Code Act 1995, within which the relevant offence is contained, is based not only on the general legislative powers of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, but also on legislative powers referred by each of the States under s 51(XXXV) of the Constitution. As such, it is based on a scheme determined by the Parliament of the Commonwealth and the Parliament of every State. In that sense, it reflects the common will of the people of Australia through their elected representatives.  
     
      
    45 In addition, the seriousness with which the international community views terrorism offences is reflected in the number of international instruments which address the issue. The provisions of the Code in relation to terrorism offences give effect to Australia's international obligations as a signatory to a number of these instruments. They reflect a common worldview that terrorism is a matter of international, not merely domestic, concern.  
     
      
    46 The background to the enactment of the anti-terrorism provisions contained in part 5.3 of the Code was explained by the Attorney General in the course of the Second Reading Speech on 12 March 2002. This related to the provisions, which were originally enacted. On that occasion the Attorney observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “(This bill) has been prepared in response to the changed security environment since September 11.  
        
       
      
      
       
        
        September 11 is a stark example of the horror and devastation that can be caused by acts of terrorism.  
         
         
        Terrorism has the potential to destroy lives, devastate communities and threaten the national and global economy.  
         
         
        For these reasons this government has affirmed its commitment to combating terrorism in all of its forms.  
         
         
        We join with the international community in condemning the 11 September attacks and other terrorist activities.  
         
         
        Other like-minded countries have passed, or are in the process of passing, anti-terrorism legislation designed to assist in this fight.  
         
         
        Consequently, counter-terrorism legislation and proposals throughout the world have been considered in the preparation of this Bill.” 
        
       
       
      
    47 It may safely be assumed the subsequent amendments to the terrorism legislation have been motivated by these or similar considerations, and by the impact of subsequent terrorist atrocities in various parts of the globe.  
     
      
    48 The broad purpose of the creation of an offence of the kind involved in this sentencing exercise is to deter the emergence of circumstances which may render more likely the carrying out of a terrorist act. It is to punish those who contemplate or recklessly commit action of the prohibited kind. It is to denounce the activities of terrorists and their adherents. It is to incapacitate them so that the community will be protected from the horrific consequences contemplated or made possible by their actions. The legislation is designed to bite early, long before the acts connected with terrorism mature into circumstances of a deadly or dangerous consequence. The legislation generally extends to the actions of those who act recklessly, as well as to those who act intentionally and knowingly. The maximum penalty for the present offence recognises that the present offence is not as serious as other terrorist offences, but it remains an offence of some considerable seriousness. The intentional possession of items that may be used in a terrorist attack, particularly items that may cause death, even where that possession is reckless rather than knowingly motivated, is a dangerous adjunct to terrorism and must be denounced and deterred by significant penalties, where that is appropriate. 
     
      
    49 There is an observation made by the Court of Appeal for England and Wales in R v Barot (2007) EWCA Crim 1119 at [45] which is germane to this discussion. There the Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Terrorists who set out to murder innocent citizens are motivated by perverted ideology. Many are unlikely to be deterred by the length of the sentence that they risk, however long this may be. Indeed, some are prepared to kill themselves in order to more readily kill others. It is, however, important that those who might be tempted to accept the role of camp followers of the more fanatic, are aware that, if they yield to that temptation, they place themselves at risk of very severe punishment. Punishment is the other important element of the determination of the sentence for offences such as this.” 
        
       
      
      
       
      
    50 This observation was, of course, made in the context of terrorist activity designed to kill innocent people. It has a relevance, however, for terrorism in all its aspects. Specifically, it includes in its ambit those who, intentionally or recklessly assume, in some form or other, the role of a camp-follower to those who are of a more extreme terrorist bent. Terrorists cannot adequately function without followers, acolytes or assistants. 
     
      
    51 It is especially important to note that the terrorism legislation, relevantly for the present matter, is concerned with actions even where the terrorist act contemplated or posited by an accused person has not come to fruition or fulfilment. Indeed, the legislation caters for prohibited activities connected with terrorism even where no target has been selected, or no final decision made as to who will carry out the ultimate act of terrorism. There is a need, then, to consider what would have happened had the intending terrorist act or acts actually occurred. There is a commensurate need, in the present matter, to assess the offender's state of mind, so far as it can be ascertained, by reference to his actions and his plea. 
     
      
    52 It will be necessary to ask the questions: What do the agreed facts, tell us as to those matters? What do the facts, in the areas of difference between the parties, tell us as to those matters? In the light of the answers to those questions, what then is the objective seriousness and gravity of the criminal conduct that falls to be punished by this sentencing exercise?  
     
      
       
      Objective seriousness 
       
      
    53 I turn now to assess the objective gravity of the offence. The assessment of the criminality involved, particularly in an offence where the core element is recklessness, is plainly an important aspect of the sentencing task. This is at the heart of the differences between the parties. It will require me to resolve the two areas of related primary dispute, namely the nature of the relationship between the offender and O, so far as it can be ascertained, and the state of the offender’s mind, relevant to the commission of the offence. This, in turn, will require an examination of the following two questions. To what degree was the offender aware of the substantial risk represented by obtaining possession of and handing over of the ammunition to O? Secondly, why did the offender, being so aware, go ahead with the transaction? The offender’s plea, of course, acknowledges that the offender was aware of the substantial risk that the ammunition was connected with preparation for, or the engagement by O, or some other person, in a terrorist act. It also acknowledges that, objectively viewed, it was unjustifiable for the offender to take that risk. The extent of the offender’s awareness, however, and the nature of the subjective circumstances that made it objectively unjustifiable to take the risk, are both matters highly relevant to the assessment of objective criminality. 
     
      
    54 As a preliminary, it will be convenient to note one further area of agreement arising from the contents of a series of telephone intercepts played in evidence before the Court at the hearing of the sentencing submissions. The Crown has accepted that the ammunition in question was purchased by the offender as a consequence of requests made to him by O. This appears not only from the telephone intercepts, but also from the text of one particular SMS message also in evidence before the Court. I shall briefly describe the sequence of the facts relevant to this proper concession. 
     
      
    55 On 10 August 2005, O sent an SMS to the offender with a telephone number for the offender to contact. (“Salam Bro there is the (no) u wanted 9559.2311”). This was the number of Jansa Arms Co at Bexley. It will be recalled that this was the business which eventually supplied the offender with the ammunition. Following this, in several calls, the offender was “prompted” by O to carry out the task he had been asked to undertake. These were friendly and jocular calls, but, in their own effusive way, they were persistent. After the purchase, O rang the offender to make arrangements to collect the ammunition from him. Significantly, O spoke to the offender about the ammunition using a rather clumsy code. It is true, as Mr Turnbull submitted, that the offender was slow to pick up on the fact that a code was being used by O. But, on the other hand, it is not without significance that O felt free to use code language in this regard when he spoke to the offender concerning the ammunition the offender had bought for him. Eventually, the offender understood what was being said to him and agreed to keep the ammunition safe until it was collected the next day. It is to be assumed that O collected or was given the ammunition, but as I have earlier said, it has never been accounted for or located. This sequence of events has essentially been gleaned, as I have said, from the telephone calls, since no evidence has been given by the offender himself. 
     
      
    56 The phone calls, incidentally, show quite a warm and lively relationship between the two men, although O may properly be perceived as being the more dominant personality of the two. The offender, in general terms, appears to be affable and compliant towards his friend’s suggestions. There is not the slightest tension between them. 
     
      
    57 The calls indicate that no particular pressure was put on the offender to make the purchase. Secondly, the follow-ups to the original request were made, although somewhat persistently, in a relatively leisurely manner by O. Thirdly, the entire “transaction” occurred over a period of some ten days, so it could hardly be said that it was spontaneous, or something done merely on the spur of the moment. Fourthly, the offender had ample time, had he wished to contemplate the situation more carefully, to withdraw from the transaction before the ammunition was obtained and collected by O. 
     
      
    58 It has not been argued on the offender’s behalf that he was unaware of O’s extremist sympathies. Indeed, the following concession is specifically made by the offender’s legal representatives in paragraph 52 of the written submissions: - 
     
      
       
        
        “In light of the friendship between O and the offender and their religious associations, including attendance at the same prayer hall, it is a safe inference that the offender was aware of his friend’s extremist sympathies. The offender, by his plea, now accepts that the provision of bullets to O, …carried with it a substantial risk that the ammunition was connected with the preparation for a terrorist act or acts and that it was unjustifiable to take that risk having regard to the circumstances known to him being O’s extremist views and desire to obtain the bullets, effectively illegally by use of Mirsad Mulahalilovic’s license.” 
        
       
      
    59 It is not without significance, as I have earlier noted, that O felt comfortable and easy in using a code when speaking to the offender regarding the ammunition that he wished to collect. There was a “conspiratorial” tone to the conversation. Indeed, the entire topic was generally muted throughout the various calls. Although the offender was a little slow on the uptake, the final conversation demonstrates that once he realised what O was speaking about, he was readily compliant with the suggestion that he should take care of the ammunition, keep it safe and make it available to O on the following day. 
     
      
    60 These conclusions regarding the relationship between the two men, and its role in the transaction, lead me next to consider the issue of the extremist material found in the offender’s possession. Let me say immediately that I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, as the Crown urged me to find, that the offender believed that a significant aspect of the fulfilment of the obligation to defend Islam was violent jihad involving the application of force and violence. Nor do I accept beyond reasonable doubt that the offender embraced, as part of his ideology, the killing of “infidels” or “kuffir”. That said, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender’s mindset went further than that advocated by Mr Turnbull SC on his behalf. In particular, I consider that the offender’s beliefs went beyond mere “tolerance” of the views of his friend O. I think it may be safely inferred that the offender shared, to some unknown degree, a portion of the extremist views espoused by O, and that the offender was, to some extent, in the process of dabbling in, or contemplating, the possibility of taking a more extreme position himself.  
     
      
    61 That this is so appears to me to be a readily available inference from a number of matters. First, from the nature of the relationship itself as between the two men. It was in part a relationship based on a sharing of religious views, and of views regarding the position of Islam in world politics. Secondly, the offender did have in his possession a fair swag of extremist literature and material. In that regard, I am quite unimpressed by the submission that, because the quantity of this material was dwarfed by other more benign material in the offender’s possession, it should be given little weight. Rather, I think that its possession is significant because of the very nature of the material itself. There is indeed a considerable volume of material espousing the need for good Muslims to go to the active defence of Muslims worldwide. The impact of this volume of consistently jihadist material is not to be devalued. The gruesome images, as I have described them, are particularly repellent. They do not sit at all easily with the suggestion made by the live witnesses and the character references suggesting that the offender had no interest whatsoever in violence. Nor do they sit easily with the suggestion that he was a tolerant easygoing person. No civilised person could take any pleasure in, or even tolerate, these images. But, as I have said, I am not prepared to find beyond reasonable doubt that the offender had embraced the more extremist views held by O. Rather, I consider that he was on the edge, on the brink of, being drawn into a more extremist position, and that the possession of this gruesome material is a reflection of that growing interest. It is altogether too glib to say that the offender was merely “tolerating” the views of O. The truth appears to me that, at least in some respects, he shared some of those extremist views and, by virtue of his association with O and perhaps others, he was, at the very least, contemplating the possibility of being drawn further into that extremist position. 
     
      
    62 I conclude therefore that the criminality involved in the present offence is not at the very low level advocated by Mr Turnbull on the offender’s behalf. Of course, it must be said that it is not the most serious type of offence contemplated by this part of the legislation. In my view, however, it stands, in terms of seriousness, well above the level contended for by senior counsel. The offender undertook the activities the subject of the offence for a number of complex and inter-woven reasons. First, because of his friendship with O. Secondly, because of his sympathies with O’s more extremist views, and thirdly, because he himself, to some undetermined degree, shared some of those views and was in the process of considering whether he should be drawn further into a more extremist position. I accept that the offender was, on a day-to-day basis, not a violent person nor was he a person particularly disposed to violence of any kind. He was a mild person, generally capable of toleration of other people’s points of view. But world events, his embrace of Islam and the views of those with whom he was mixing were urging him or, at least, drawing him towards the embrace of a more extremist position. It is for this reason, among others, that the offence must be classified as a serious one. 
     
      
    63 Mr Turnbull argued that since it was not possible, in connection with the extremist material, to know when the material was collected, how often it was examined by the offender, when it was first accessed etc, that no great weight should be given to the material. Alternatively, Mr Turnbull argued that greater weight should be given to the overall tone of the telephone conversations. These, counsel argued, favoured the proposition that the offender was simply doing a favour for a friend. I consider that it is clear from the conclusions I have already reached that the offender’s possession of the extremist material cannot be swept under the carpet or treated as lightly as the written submissions have attempted to do. In addition, the possession in the present circumstances of ammunition which is capable of killing or causing serious injury to people if used in a terrorist manner is another reason why this offence must be regarded as serious. I accept, of course, that no terrorist target or targets had been determined either by O or by anyone else. I accept also that the evidence falls short of demonstrating whether the ammunition was to be used directly by O or by others. These are properly matters that may be taken into account but they do not dispel or substantially dilute the seriousness of the offence. It seems to be suggested in Ms Collins’ report that, despite the events of the relevant 10 day period, it did not occur then to the offender that the situation was redolent with terrorist possibilities. She suggested he was naïve, or that he simply failed to assert himself. I do not accept this view of the matter. The offender himself gave no evidence and, in those circumstances, I consider that little weight can be given to these statements in the report. The facts I have found must mean that the offender’s failure to back away from the transaction at a time when he was fully aware of O’s proclivities renders the offence a serious one. It is not, as I have said, the most serious of offences of this kind, but it is, nevertheless, a serious offence. 
     
      
       
      The plea of guilty 
       
      
    64 Mr Turnbull SC has argued that the plea was entered at the earliest “reasonable” opportunity. The plea is an important matter to be taken into account as all the authorities accept. The position in relation to the value of plea in sentencing for a Commonwealth offence in New South Wales is quite clear. The proper approach is to recognise the value of a plea of guilty by reference to the willingness of the offender to facilitate the course of justice. It is not appropriate to simply view the utilitarian value of the plea on the basis that it has saved the community the expense of a contested hearing (Tyler v R; R v Chalmers [2007] NSWCCA 247 at (110-111); R v Cameron [2002] 209 CLR 339 at (11) and following). Although the Court is not bound to state a mathematical quantification for a discount allowed on this basis, it is desirable in the present matter to demonstrate transparency in that regard. 
     
      
    65 I cannot accept, however, that the plea in the present matter was entered at the first available opportunity, even in the sense suggested by Mr Turnbull. It is true, of course, that the plea was entered immediately upon the presentation of a fresh indictment. Mr Turnbull’s submission however, is contrary to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v PB [2008] NSWCCA 109 at (30). A realistic view of the overall situation, however, must be taken. The presentation of the fresh indictment and the entry of the plea must be seen as a “deal” struck between the prosecutor and the offender. It is, in effect, a compromise reflecting no doubt advantages to both sides. It is, as between the Commonwealth and the offender, a compromise and resolution of the issues between them. In real terms, the Court must take account of the entire history of the matter. I have set this out earlier and there is no need for me to repeat it here. It was only when the offender’s “No Bill” application had failed, and his subsequent application for a separate trial was declined, that intensive negotiations took place resulting in the compromise to which I have referred. It would be wrong to regard the plea otherwise than as a plea entered at the hearing. 
     
      
    66 The Crown has made it clear that an informal approach to resolve the position between the parties was made many months ago but that was not successful. It was not based on instructions nor was it posited upon any specific factual basis. I do note, however, that one very real consequence of the offender’s willingness to facilitate the course of justice, as evidenced by his plea, is that the nature and prospective length of the trial involving the offender has been very significantly curtailed. The Court should reflect in its allowance a recognition that the course of justice has well and truly been facilitated as a consequence of the subjective intentions of the offender as reflected in the plea. Mr Turnbull also asked me to take into account that the conduct of the offender and his legal representatives during the pre-trial procedure has been one of generally attempting to facilitate the course of justice in a practical sense. The pre-trial procedures were long and difficult, involving the Court in the delivery of nearly 60 decisions. All the accused in the conspiracy trial were entitled to test aspects of the Crown case, and no criticism is presently offered in that regard. As I said in R v Touma (24 October 2008 at para 137) a plea of guilty may facilitate not only the ultimate objects of our system of justice, for example, the imposition of sentence and the infliction of appropriate punishment. It may also carry with it the avoidance of lengthy pre-trial hearings and matters of a similar kind. Consequently, I take into account Mr Turnbull’s submissions in this regard and make allowance for the fact that, during the pre-trial procedures, the offender’s legal representatives consistently took a stance that facilitated the trial in a real and commendable manner. 
     
      
    67 The matters I have mentioned satisfy me that the appropriate discount to be allowed for the present plea is a discount of 10 per cent. That is the discount I will apply to the sentence of this offender to recognise his facilitation of the course of justice. 
     
      
       
      Remorse and contrition 
       
      
    68 Mr Turnbull has submitted that current sentencing practice has emphasised that, generally speaking, a discount should also be given to acknowledge that a plea of guilty might properly be taken as an indication of remorse, contrition and an acceptance of responsibility for an offender’s wrong doing. In cases involving a terrorist offence or offences, the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal has made it clear that, generally speaking, the more important considerations will be punishment, deterrence, denunciation and protection of the community. In that situation, the Court is entitled to ask in the present matter – to what extent has the offender stepped back from any extremist notions he may have held, or perhaps contemplated, at the time of the commission of the offence? Is the community protected from any future danger in this regard? 
     
      
    69 In the present matter, I accept that some allowance can and should be made for the fact that the plea of guilty may be taken, to some extent, to express remorse and acceptance of responsibility. More significantly, perhaps, the plea may be taken, at least to some degree, to be a drawing back by the offender from his interest in any extremist beliefs he may have contemplated embracing in 2005. It is obvious, however, that considerable caution needs to be taken about this aspect of the matter. This is because the offender has not given evidence before me, and the present state of his mind has not been expounded, explored or tested in any realistic way. The report of Ms Emma Collins indirectly touches upon this matter. There is also the evidence of the offender’s family and associates, which suggests that the Court need have no fears for the offender’s behaviour in the future. The absence of any evidence from the offender, once again, means however, that less weight can perhaps be given to this particular aspect of the assessment. 
     
      
    70 In the ultimate, however, I accept that the plea may be taken as a cautious indicator that the defendant has abandoned his interest in the possibility of embracing more extremist notions. It is always difficult to be certain about such a matter because the Court is required to make a prediction about the future behaviour of the accused in circumstances where the Court has not heard from the offender himself. In the circumstances, however, I propose to make an allowance or recognition of the fact that the plea may be taken to indicate that the offender is unlikely to be, or represent, a danger to the community on release. This allowance must, however, be a moderate allowance. 
     
      
       
      Other matters 
       
      
    71 The offender has no prior convictions in Australia or elsewhere. He has a history of hard work. He is a person who is plainly committed to making provision for his extended family. I accept that the witnesses called to testify on his behalf, and those who provided character evidence, generally regard him as a reliable, honest, hardworking and family orientated person. He is clearly sincere in his religious beliefs and those beliefs have been important during his life in rescuing him from potential problems he has had with alcohol and drugs. 
     
      
    72 I also take into account that the offender has been in prison now for a little short of three years and three months. His custodial situation as an AA classified person on remand has been a difficult one. There is no need for me to go into the detail of this. I have examined the position of an AA offender in R v Touma (24 October 2008) and R v Lodhi [2006] 199 FLR 364. The Crown has not suggested that it is otherwise than appropriate to take into account pre-conviction custody and I propose to make a modest allowance in that regard. (The sentence I propose to impose will require the offender to spend a further brief time in custody and I also take into account his custodial situation in that regard). 
     
      
    73 The final matter is the position of the offender’s family. While I have very considerable sympathy for his wife and child, and for that matter his parents, I do not think that I can make any specific allowance in the sentencing process for the burdens that have been placed on his family up to the present time, or for that matter, for the future. The circumstances revealed by the evidence are unhappy ones but they are by no means extraordinary or out of the usual. They reflect the situation, commonly experienced, where a husband and provider loses his liberty because of his criminal conduct. 
     
      
    74 I turn finally to consider the sentence to be imposed upon the offender. I leave to one side, for the moment, the discount for the plea, although I have found that this should be allowed at a percentage of 10 per cent. Taking into account the overall objective criminality involved in the offence, and making proper and adequate allowance for the subjective and other matters I have examined, it is my view that, prior to discount, the offence warrants the imposition of a sentence of five years and three months imprisonment. This means, when the discount is allowed and applied, the sentence for the offence should be (when rounded down), for a term of four years and eight months. The sentence is to commence on 8 November 2005 and is to expire on 7 July 2010.  
     
      
    75 Section 19AB of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) requires that the Court fix a non-parole period. The purpose of the non-parole period is to provide a mitigation of the punishment of the offender in favour of rehabilitation through conditional freedom. The non-parole period, however, must itself incorporate all relevant sentencing principles, including punishment denunciation and general deterrence. 
     
      
    76 Section 19 AG of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) obliges the Court, in relation to the present offence, to fix a non-parole period at a percentage of at least three-quarters of the sentence. In my opinion, it is appropriate that the non-parole period be set at 75 per cent of the sentence. The Crown has not submitted that the Court should do otherwise and it is, in all the circumstances, appropriate that I do so. 
     
      
    77 The non-parole period is to commence on 8 November 2005 and it will expire on 7 May 2009. 
     
      
    78 Mirsad Mulahalilovic in relation to the charge in the indictment, you are convicted and I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of four years and eight months commencing on 8 November 2005 and expiring on 7 July 2010. 
     
      
    79 I fix a non-parole period in respect of the sentence for three years and six months, commencing on 8 November 2005 and expiring on 7 May 2009. 
     
      
       
      Explanation 
       
      
    80 I am obliged to explain to the offender the effect of the orders I have made. 
     
      
    81 Mirsad Mulahalilovic, the sentences I have imposed mean that you will be obliged to spend a minimum period in custody of three years and six months. This means that, having regard to the time you have already spent in custody, you will be eligible for first release in a little over three months time, namely on 7 May 2009. 
     
      
    82 It will be a matter for the Attorney General as to whether you will be released on that day. It may depend upon your behaviour in prison. It will also be a matter for the Attorney General to determine whether any conditions should apply to you while you are at conditional liberty upon parole after the 7th day of May 2009. If you are released on that day, you will remain on parole for a further period of 14 months. If you were to breach your parole, you may be required to return to prison to serve the balance of the term of your sentence.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BELL JA: I agree with Rothman J. 
     
      
    2 ROTHMAN J: Mr Dror Salah seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed upon him for manslaughter by Johnson J on 4 April 2008. Justice Johnson sentenced Mr Salah to a non-parole period of 5 years and 9 months with the remainder of sentence of a further 3 years. 
     
      
    3 Mr Salah pleaded guilty to manslaughter, having been indicted for murder, on the sixth day of the trial, which plea the Crown accepted in full satisfaction of the indictment. At the time that the plea was entered, most of the witnesses to the incident had already given evidence. That evidence, together with an agreed statement of facts, was taken into account by his Honour. The basis of the plea of manslaughter was excessive self-defence. The maximum penalty that may have been imposed by the Court, for this offence, was 25 years’ imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 Save as to one aspect, the findings of fact by his Honour are not in dispute. The one aspect relates to a finding that Mr Salah heard a warning given to him by Mr Arazi prior to the incident that led to the death of the victim, Mr Guelman. The incident occurred on 5 August 2006 at Bondi Beach. 
     
      
    5 Mr Salah presses eight grounds, on which he relies for the grant of leave to appeal, and if leave be granted, for the appeal: 
     
      
    (i) His Honour erred in applying an inadequate discount of 10%;(ii) His Honour erred by finding that Mr Salah heard Mr Arazi’s warning;(iii) His Honour erred in finding that this was an objectively serious offence of manslaughter … in circumstances where Mr Salah was acting in self defence, albeit excessively;(iv) His Honour erred in finding that Mr Salah had not demonstrated contrition;(v) His Honour erred in failing to take into account the provocative conduct of Mr Guelman;(vi) His Honour erred in not allowing a sufficient and proper discount for the period of time spent by Mr Salah in protective custody;(vii) His Honour erred in failing to give reasons for finding special circumstances (and erred in not first imposing the non-parole period);(viii) The sentence was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    Facts 
     
      
    6 It is unnecessary to repeat all of the facts upon which his Honour relied and which his Honour set out from [3] of the Remarks on Sentence. His Honour was required to sentence both Mr Salah and his brother Ezra. Each of them and Mr Guelman were Israeli nationals. Mr Guelman frequented a cafe in Bondi, located near a business conducted by Mr Salah. 
     
      
    7 In the morning of 5 August 2006, Mr Salah and Mr Guelman were involved in an altercation, during which Mr Guelman offended Mr Salah by calling him “an Arab”. Mr Guelman threatened to kill Mr Salah. Mr Guelman punched Mr Salah in the side of the head, pulled his hair and tried to punch him again. At that point, Mr Salah pushed Mr Guelman’s head into the windscreen of a vehicle, cracking the windscreen. 
     
      
    8 Mr Salah returned home after the incident. That night, shortly after 9.00pm, Mr Guelman entered the cafe to which I have earlier referred. Mr Guelman was anxious and angry and told Mr Arazi of the earlier incident. Mr Guelman also told another person in the cafe, Mr Nisanov. Mr Nisanov left the cafe, walked down the street, and, on seeing Mr Salah, headed towards him. Mr Salah was driving a green four-wheel-drive vehicle, with his brother in the front passenger seat. Mr Nisanov “told [Mr Salah]” and his brother that “the deceased was looking for him and confirmed that the deceased was at [the cafe]”. The cited words are from paragraph 5 on page 2 of the Agreed Facts on Sentence (Exhibit B on Sentence) and are similar to evidence given by Mr Nisanov at Transcript page 331 (“the first warning”). 
     
      
    9 Mr Salah and his brother, Ezra, drove past the cafe and looked inside. As they did so, Mr Guelman ran into the kitchen of the cafe, grabbed a red-handled Victorinox knife and left the cafe. As he left the cafe, Mr Guelman held his hands (with the knife) under his shirt. On seeing Mr Guelman obtain the knife, Mr Arazi ran to the front passenger side of Mr Salah’s vehicle and warned (“the second warning”) both Mr Salah and his brother with the following words: 
     
      
       
        
        “He just go to the kitchen, grabbed a knife, just get out of here”. (Transcript page 255) (Remarks on Sentence at [10]). 
        
       
      
    On the same page of transcript, there is another version of the second warning, being: 
     
      
       
        
        “Just get out of here. He grabbed a knife and he is going to go crazy”. 
        
       
      
    There is no substantive difference between these two versions. Mr Arazi gave evidence that he “told them” one or other of those versions. While his Honour conceded that it was “unclear as to whether the passenger window was open at the time” his Honour was satisfied that the words were said, and was “satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Arazi … warned” Mr Salah and his brother. 10 Mr Salah drove the vehicle around the corner and pulled in towards the kerb. At that point, Mr Arazi ran to the car and gave another warning to Mr Salah and his brother saying: “Get out of here” (“the third warning”). 
     
      
    11 Soon after, Mr Guelman walked the short distance to the intersection, turned left and approached Mr Salah’s car. There was an altercation between Mr Guelman and Mr Salah’s brother, Ezra, in which Mr Guelman closed the car door on Ezra’s hand, causing a fracture. Ezra left the car and Mr Guelman cut him, on the hand, with the knife. 
     
      
    12 Mr Salah left the vehicle, carrying a length of metal vacuum cleaner pole, in an effort to go to the assistance of his brother. Mr Guelman brandished the knife at Mr Salah and tried to stab him. Mr Salah hit the deceased on the head and body with the vacuum cleaner pole, at least four times, pushing him back towards the wall of the adjacent shop. Mr Salah grabbed the knife from the deceased, and in doing so sustained a 28 mm “y-shaped” cut between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand. Having grabbed the knife, Mr Salah stabbed Mr Guelman six times in a struggle. Five of those stab wounds were to the front of Mr Guelman’s body, in the area of his left chest, upper right thigh and left leg. The sixth wound was in the back up-left abdomen. Two of those wounds were immediately life threatening. One such stab wound had punctured the aorta; the other cut the femoral artery. The latter caused immediate and massive bleeding. When the blood pooled at the feet of Mr Guelman, Mr Salah stepped back and Mr Guelman collapsed to the ground. Mr Salah picked up the knife and part of the pole (one part having separated) and he and his brother ran to the car and drove off. 
     
      
    13 Following the incident, an ambulance, which had arrived within minutes, took Mr Guelman to the hospital, arriving at 10.05pm, where surgery was performed to repair the femoral artery, but Mr Guelman died at 4.10am the next morning (6 August 2006). 
     
      
    14 While the above has largely been taken from the summary of the facts of his Honour (and parts of it are directly quoted therefrom), what I have referred to as “the second warning”, his Honour referred to as “the first warning”, his Honour ignoring, for that purpose, the conversation referred to at Paragraph [8] above. Consequently, his Honour refers only to two warnings. 
     
      
    Ground (i): Discount For Plea 
     
      
    15 I accept, as submitted on behalf of Mr Salah, that the Crown would not, at committal (or at any substantive time before the plea was entered), accept a plea for manslaughter (or any lesser charge) in full satisfaction of the indictment for murder. 
     
      
    16 Mr Salah was entitled to a discount on his sentence by reason of his plea of guilty (ss 21A(3)(k) and 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999) to reflect the utilitarian benefit to the administration of justice in the timing of the plea: R v Thompson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383; 115 A Crim R 104 at [160]. There is little doubt that the plea on day six of the trial (following discussions with the Crown on day five) saved approximately five weeks of hearing time and the consequent inconvenience to witnesses and jurors and associated costs of the trial. 
     
      
    17 The range of discount for a plea of guilty is between 10% and 25%, the lowest figures often being utilised for pleas entered after the first day of trial. However, the amount of any such discount is a matter within the discretion of the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    18 It was open to Mr Salah to have indicated, formally or informally, at or before the committal proceedings, or on indictment in this Court, that he pleaded not guilty to murder, but guilty of manslaughter. There is no evidence to suggest any substantially earlier indication, even informally, by Mr Salah that he was prepared to plead to manslaughter. 
     
      
    19 The utilitarian benefit to the administration of justice to which this Court referred in R v Thompson and Houlton, supra, includes evidence gathering, the costs of preparing for trial and the inconvenience to and costs of the jury: R v Harmouche [2005] NSWCCA 398; (2005) 158 A Crim R 357 at [39]-[40]. This plea was entered more than a week after the commencement of the trial. As earlier stated, the plea saved some significant court time. If no court time were to have been saved, there would be little or no discount. 
     
      
    20 The discount of 10% applied by his Honour was, in the circumstances, within the range available and within the discretion available to his Honour. This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
    Ground (ii): The Finding That The Warning Was Heard 
     
      
    21 As earlier stated, this ground relates to the warning, referred to in his Honour’s judgment as the second warning, being the conversation recited at paragraph [9] above. The submission asserts that the evidence did not support a finding that Mr Salah heard this warning. Essentially, the submission is based upon the finding of his Honour that it was “unclear” whether the passenger window of the car was open at the time that the words were spoken. Because the proof of facts adverse to Mr Salah must be proved beyond reasonable doubt (R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270), it is submitted that the possibility that the window of the car was closed has the result that the hearing of the warning was not proved to the requisite standard and could not be relied upon by his Honour. 
     
      
    22 The evidence, relevantly summarised above, is to the effect that Mr Arazi “told” Mr Salah that which was recited. The mere fact that the window of the car was closed, if that were the case, does not qualify that evidence to such a degree that it would disentitle his Honour from finding, to the requisite standard, that the warning was heard. 
     
      
    23 The subsequent conduct of Mr Salah and his brother is consistent with their knowledge that Mr Guelman had acted in a way of which Mr Arazi had spoken. The Crown relies on answers given by Mr Salah in a record of interview. The agreed facts refers to Mr Salah’s brother, Ezra, receiving a phone call warning him that Mr Guelman was waiting for them with two knives in his pocket [Agreed Facts on Sentence at page 4(b)]. The Agreed Facts also refer (at the same page at (e)) to the window of the car being open and to Mr Salah and his brother being “told” of the likely actions of Mr Guelman, with reference to the record of interview of Mr Salah at Q551 – Q553, and in particular at Q547. The finding of fact, as to the warning, was open to his Honour, and this ground of appeal also fails. 
     
      
    Ground (iii): Finding Of Objective Seriousness 
     
      
    24 Mr Salah submits that his Honour erred in finding that this was an objectively serious offence of manslaughter. In so doing, his Honour elevated the role of Mr Salah to a serious example of manslaughter, in circumstances where Mr Salah was acting in self-defence. Further, Mr Salah criticises his Honour’s Remarks for taking into account, in assessing objective seriousness, that Mr Salah did not drive away from the scene in circumstances where Mr Guelman may have been obstructing the vehicle. 
     
      
    25 Notwithstanding the submission that some of these matters were incapable of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, each of them reflects the evidence before his Honour, both oral evidence and the Statement of Agreed Facts. It seems that the submission on the standard of proof relates to the existence of the warning and whether it was heard and, in that regard, repeats the earlier ground of appeal. 
     
      
    26 There can be no doubt, given the existence of the conversation that I have referred to as the first warning, the telephone call to which reference has earlier made and the later warnings, that Mr Salah had ample opportunity to drive away from the scene, to avoid any confrontation, and to avoid placing himself in what he understood would be a dangerous situation. On one view of the evidence, Mr Salah welcomed and/or sought out the confrontation. It is unnecessary to develop that view. It is sufficient to remark that his Honour’s findings, in this regard, were open to his Honour, were relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence for which sentence was to be imposed, and rendered the manslaughter in question a more serious offence than would otherwise have been the case. The finding that this particular offence was an objectively serious offence of manslaughter was open to his Honour, and this ground of appeal also fails. 
     
      
    Ground (iv): Finding Of Lack Of Contrition 
     
      
    27 Mr Salah refers to the fact that he handed himself into Waverley Police Station on the evening of 7 August 2006 (this is two days after the offence and a day after the demise of Mr Guelman), that a number of phone calls to others were made by Mr Salah to enquire as to Mr Guelman’s injuries or health, and that Mr Salah requested his girlfriend to take his clothes (and those of his brother) to the police. This, Mr Salah submits, together with the fact that he was originally charged with murder, evidences some remorse, to which his Honour failed to have regard in a finding that Mr Salah had not demonstrated contrition and, consequently, failing to take contrition into account as a mitigating factor on sentence. 
     
      
    28 Mr Salah’s attendance on the Police, and the instruction to provide them with the clothing, is equally consistent with a genuine voluntary desire to cooperate and also with a realisation of the strength of the case against him, in circumstances where there were a number of witnesses to the event who knew him and could identify him. Further, Mr Salah’s telephone calls enquiring of Mr Guelman’s condition are equally consistent with remorse and with an attempt to ascertain the consequences of Mr Salah’s actions. 
     
      
    29 Mr Salah presented no other material, and gave no evidence, oral or otherwise, expressing any contrition for that which had occurred. His Honour (Remarks on Sentence at [37]) expressly determined that the telephone conversations did not demonstrate remorse and that otherwise Mr Salah did not demonstrate remorse. This finding was open to his Honour and the ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
    Ground (v): Failure To Take Into Account The Deceased’s Provocative Conduct 
     
      
    30 There are two aspects to this submission. There can be little doubt that his Honour was aware of the facts, recited them, and took them into account. The first of the two aspects is the conduct of Mr Guelman earlier in the day to which his Honour expressly refers (Remarks on Sentence at [38]). He did not consider the earlier altercation and the verbal abuse constituted provocative conduct of the kind, which would mitigate the offence. If this ground of appeal were directed at that earlier conduct, his Honour expressly referred to it, and expressly rejected it as provocation of the kind that would ameliorate the sentence. This finding was open to his Honour. 
     
      
    31 If, on the other hand, the submission were referring, as seems to be the case, to the fact that Mr Guelman was the aggressor in the incident and Mr Salah felt under threat, this is a necessary element of the manslaughter, in that, Mr Salah’s subjective belief that he was required to defend himself was the only basis upon which the offence was manslaughter, and not murder. While that subjective element may be present without the objective existence of aggression on the part of Mr Guelman, the circumstance of the aggression in the incident itself is so much a part of the feature of the offence for which sentence was imposed that it is inconceivable that his Honour failed to take into account that aspect. This ground of appeal is also rejected. 
     
      
    Ground (vi): Insufficient Discount For Protective Custody 
     
      
    32 His Honour expressly refers to, and accepts, that protective custody involves greater hardship than ordinary custody and, on the material before his Honour, this referred to Mr Salah’s custodial history. Mr Salah submits that no clear discount is expressed. It is unnecessary (and may be overly mathematical) for discounts to be expressed in relation to every factor considered by his Honour. His Honour refers to the greater hardship and the submission that his Honour did not have appropriate regard to that circumstance is not made out. As to the issue of future terms of incarceration, his Honour seems, quite properly, to have given no discount in that regard. The terms of that custody were a matter of speculation and there was no evidence before the Court, or his Honour, as to the nature and extent of protection, if any, that would be imposed on Mr Salah: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [178], [179]. 
     
      
    Ground (vii): Special Circumstances and Order of Sentencing 
     
      
    33 It is unclear how it can be said that Mr Salah is prejudiced by any error in this regard. Section 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 requires that, in imposing a sentence, the non-parole period shall be imposed first. This is a wholly procedural issue, which does not affect the sentence imposed. His Honour, an extremely experienced sentencing judge, seems to have reverted to the practice prior to the recent amendments. Nevertheless, it is a requirement of the Act and, without altering the sentence in that regard, will be implemented. 
     
      
    34 Further, within the total sentence imposed, his Honour has reduced the non-parole period from the statutory ratio of 3:1. Mr Salah has obtained a benefit from that course. 35 His Honour expressly found special circumstances, but did not give reasons. However, the absence of any substantial criminal record, the otherwise good character of Mr Salah, and the lack of a substantial likelihood of reoffending allow special circumstances to be found, and, notwithstanding the absence of reasons below, I would confirm his Honour’s approach. 
     
      
    Ground (viii): Manifest Excess 
     
      
    36 As has been stated on a number of occasions, the principles that govern interference with sentencing stress the discretionary nature of the exercise and the limited basis upon which an appeal court will interfere with the sentence imposed. A party seeking to alter a sentence imposed must convince the appeal court of some identified or manifest error by the sentencing judge. There is, as has been set out above, in my view, no identified error. Manifest error is displayed when the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive (or in the case of Crown appeals, manifestly inadequate), and the sentence must, in that regard, be outside the range appropriate for the particular offence. 
     
      
    37 Manslaughter is an offence for which there is an extremely wide range of culpability and a correspondingly extremely wide range of appropriate sentences: see R v Warren Alan Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377; (2005) 160 A Crim R 1, per Spigelman CJ at [133]-[135]; R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349; R v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397; R v Blacklidge (Court of Criminal Appeal, Gleeson CJ, 12 December 1995, unreported). A form of “comparative sentencing justice” cannot form the basis for manifest excess; there is no doctrine of parity for offenders other than co-offenders. It is necessary for an appellant to show sufficient to the Court to establish the range of sentence available and that the offence in question is outside of it, such that the Court can find that the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust. Notwithstanding the wide range of offences that are within manslaughter, there is still an appropriate range of sentence, and, even though the range may be difficult to ascertain, the Court is still required to determine whether the sentence imposed is outside it and, consequently, manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    38 There is no doubt that the offence here in question, and the circumstances of Mr Salah, render this not in the worst category. But his Honour has not imposed the maximum sentence or anything approaching it. Manslaughter involves the felonious taking of human life (R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510) and, when it arises as a result of self-defence, involves an intention to kill, an intention to cause grievous bodily harm or an indifference to human life. 
     
      
    39 The fact that it involves excessive self-defence is the reason the offence is manslaughter, and not murder, and self-defence cannot, of itself, be double-counted in the assessment of the offence. There are many cases involving no self-defence that are far less serious than this offence, e.g. the assault that, but for an accidental knocking of the head or other like accidental injury, would be, at worst, common assault. Even within the offence of manslaughter involving excessive self-defence, the circumstances of this offence render it more serious than most. Even though Mr Salah used the knife the victim brought to the crime scene, and which the victim intended to use against Mr Salah, Mr Salah went willingly to the altercation, armed with a metal pipe, despite knowledge that the victim was armed with a knife. 
     
      
    40 The Crown and Mr Salah rely on Judicial Commission statistics and summaries of other judgments. Statistics are, in this area, to be used even more carefully than usually: Blacklidge, supra. Generally, the slavish adherence to statistics would render sentencing a mechanical and self-fulfilling exercise. In this area, because of the range of circumstances necessarily encompassed by the offence of manslaughter, regard must be had to the differential aspects of each offence. 
     
      
    41 Reference to the cited cases reveals the range of circumstances and the range of sentences imposed. In R v Ahmad [2006] NSWCCA 177, the sentence to be imposed arose out of a fight between factions of a local community (a not dissimilar circumstance) for which the sentence imposed for manslaughter was a non-parole period of 6 years and a remainder of a further 3 years and 4 months. Mr Salah seeks to distinguish Ahmad on the basis that other offences were involved. But those other offences do not seem to have had the effect of lengthening the sentence for manslaughter, and were the subject of separate punishment. There are, as one would expect, other distinguishing features: the use of a firearm; a finding of intent to kill; and the weapon used was brought to the scene by the offender. But, in Ahmad, there was a more significant discount for the plea, and the sentence imposed was longer than that imposed in this case. 
     
      
    42 The sentence imposed by his Honour, for this particular offence and the subjective circumstances of this particular offender, is not beyond the range. The Court should not interfere with the sentence imposed. 
     
      
    43 There is no one correct sentence, and the test for interference by this Court, in the sentence imposed, has not been satisfied. Further, pursuant to the terms of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the Court would need to be satisfied that another, relevantly lower, sentence was warranted. I am not so satisfied. The appeal on the ground of manifest excess also fails. 
     
      
    Proposed Orders 
     
      
    44 As earlier stated, the sentence should be confirmed, but imposed in accordance with s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In that circumstance, I propose that the Court make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (i) Leave to appeal be granted; 
       
       
      (ii) The appeal against the sentence imposed by his Honour Johnson J be allowed only to the extent necessary to comply with s 44 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
      1999; 
       
       
      (iii) The sentence imposed by Johnson J on Mr Dror Salah on 4 April 2008 be quashed and in lieu thereof Mr Salah be sentenced for the manslaughter of Hernan Dario Guelman to a non-parole period of 5 years and 9 months commencing 7 August 2006 and expiring on 6 May 2012 with the balance of term of 3 years expiring on 6 May 2015. Mr Salah remains first eligible for parole on 6 May 2012; 
       
       
      (iv) Otherwise the appeal be dismissed. 
       
        
       
      
    45 PRICE J: I agree with Rothman J.

   JUDGMENT1. Anarella Faye McKellar’s life has been seriously out of control. It has been out of control it seems since she started to associate with a man named Keith Cubby. She has made a serious commitment to getting her life back into control. 2. These sentence appeals raise the issue of structuring appropriate sentences which take into account the crimes which Ms McKellar has committed, but which also take into account her efforts at getting her life back into order.3. When a person is sentenced by a Magistrate in the Local Court, they are entitled to appeal to the District Court against the severity of the sentence. When the District Court Judge hears the appeal, the District Court Judge can take fresh evidence. The District Court Judge re-sentences the offender according to what the District Court Judge thinks is the appropriate sentence.4. In this case, Anarella McKellar has appealed from sentences she received from a Magistrate sitting in the Dubbo Local Court on two occasions. On the first occasion, she received four sentences. She is appealing from all of those. On the second occasion she received one sentence and she is appealing from that as well.5. The first occasion she was sentenced in the Dubbo Local Court was 3 November 2008. On that occasion, Magistrate Hamilton had before him a number of crimes committed by Ms McKellar. In addition, he had to deal with the breach of a bond which had been imposed by another Magistrate, almost eighteen months beforehand. The result of the Magistrate’s sentences was an overall period of custody of twenty-six months with a non parole period of nineteen months. For some reason the sentences were not back-dated to when Ms McKellar went into custody and when the period of just over a month additional custody is taken into account for that back-dating, the overall sentence was about twenty-seven months with a non parole of about twenty months. That overall non parole period is about equivalent to the statutory ratio of seventy-five percent.6. I will now explain the sentences which the Magistrate imposed. The earliest crimes that his Honour was sentencing Ms McKellar for were two offences of larceny and goods in custody; the larceny was shoplifting. For those two crimes Ms McKellar had received a bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for eighteen months from 7 February 2009. When she was before Magistrate Hamilton on 3 November 2008, she had breached that bond by the other offences which she had committed and which the Magistrate was sentencing her for. Those breaches were significant, one of them being an assault and the other being a long series of offences involving a stolen credit card. The Magistrate revoked the bond and, instead, sentenced Ms McKellar to two months imprisonment, which his Honour dated from the day that he imposed it.7. The other offences which the Magistrate had before him on that day included a common assault, as I said, and the credit card offences. There were eleven credit card offences - which amounted to crimes against s 178BA(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 - of obtaining a valuable thing by deception. The Magistrate sentenced Ms McKellar to nine months imprisonment for seven of those offences and commenced that sentence on 3 January 2009, at the expiry of the two months which his Honour had imposed, and specified a non parole period of six months. For the other four credit card offences, his Honour imposed sentences of twelve months and commenced those sentences six months into the sentences he imposed for the earlier credit card offences. The commencement date was 3 July 2009 and the non parole period nine months.8. The nine months sentence for the first seven were concurrent and the four months sentence for the second four offences were also concurrent. His Honour accumulated the two groups of sentences to the extent that I have mentioned. 9. The last matter which his Honour sentenced Ms McKellar for was a common assault. For that he imposed a sentence of nine months imprisonment. That sentence commenced at the expiry of the non parole period for the credit card offences and his Honour specified a non parole period of two months.10. I have already referred to the overall result of those sentences by reference to the dates. Ms McKellar’s overall sentence commenced on 3 November 2008 and expired on 2 January 2011. Her non parole period expired on 2 June 2010.11. The second occasion that Ms McKellar was in court was on 22 January 2009, just a few weeks ago. Once again she was before Magistrate Hamilton. She was again charged with larceny. That had been committed on 29 September 2008. Larceny is an offence against s 117 of the Crimes Act. His Honour imposed a sentence of seven months imprisonment with a non parole period of three months. His Honour commenced that sentence at the same time as the sentence which he had earlier imposed on 3 November 2008 for the common assault, namely 3 April 2010. His Honour specified three months non parole period. So Ms McKellar’s overall non parole period was extended by a month from 2 June 2010 to 2 July 2010.12. I need to refer briefly to what happened when Ms McKellar committed these various crimes. The first in time was the larceny and goods in custody, committed on 18 August 2006. She was seen to steal some items from the Priceline Pharmacy in Macquarie Street, here in Dubbo. She was seen to be accompanied by a man. When police caught up with her they found her with other items which were stolen and they were stolen from shops and they were the goods in custody offences. It is for those two offences that she was given the eighteen month bond which Magistrate Hamilton revoked and substituted with two months imprisonment.13. The next crime in time was a common assault, which occurred on 20 March 2008. Ms McKellar and her partner Keith Cubby were in Centrelink. There was another woman in Centrelink at the time called Nina Elwood. Passing her in Centrelink Ms McKellar said to Ms Elwood “You’re a dog”. Ms Elwood responded in the same terms. Ms McKellar took exception to that and according to the police facts “started to pull the victim’s hair and punch her to the face and head”. At the same time Mr Cubby started to punch Nina Elwood and threw her to the ground and kicked her to the head a number of times. The staff separated them and alerted the police.14. The third set of crimes were the credit card offences. Ms McKellar and Mr Cubby, who was at that time her partner, came by two stolen credit cards, belong to somebody else. Over the afternoon of 9 June 2008 and the morning of 10 June 2008, they went around to various retail outlets here in Dubbo and used first, the MasterCard which had been stolen and second, the Visa card which had been stolen, to buy goods from those shops with the false credit cards. They were stopped on the first day when the MasterCard was rejected. They then switched to the Visa the next day and were stopped when that was rejected. It was a shopping spree using somebody else’s credit cards which lasted about twenty-four hours. The effective sentence imposed for those eleven crimes was eighteen months imprisonment with a non parole period of fifteen months.15. I should have recorded when talking about the common assault on Nina Edwards(as said) in Centrelink, that Ms McKellar was sentenced to nine months imprisonment for that crime, with a non parole period of two months.16. The last offence in time which is the subject of a sentence appeal, was committed on 29 September 2008, and was once again a shoplifting offence. She was with her partner Mr Cubby. They went to a retail outlet in Dubbo. They helped themselves to a number of items. They were caught on the CCTV. Mr Cubby was seen to take some initiative so far as the commission of these offences was concerned.17. I should note what the evidence is before me. I have as exhibit A the prosecution papers, regarding the sentences which were imposed on 3 November 2008. Exhibit D are the prosecution papers concerning the sentence which was imposed on 22 January 2009. Exhibit B is a note of the penalties imposed on Keith Cubby for his part in the credit card offences, which he committed together with Ms McKellar. Exhibit C is Mr Cubby’s criminal record. Exhibit 1, tendered on behalf of Ms McKellar, is a personal note to the Magistrate or to me at least - it is directed to ‘Your Honour’ - and Exhibit 2 is Ms McKellar’s up-dated criminal record.18. Ms Robinson, who appears for Ms McKellar, makes various submissions regarding the sentences which have been imposed. Her first submission is that the overall sentences do not reflect special circumstances, which the Magistrate found, and there should be some adjustment. Her second submission was that at least two of the sentences might have attracted other than custodial sentences, namely the assault and the first crimes of larceny and goods in custody. Her third submission concerned the overall impact of the sentence, being out of proportion with the extent of the criminality involved. Her fourth submission concerned the sentences imposed for the credit card offences, which she said could have been more concurrent than they were, because they were committed over the relatively short period of time. Her fifth submission concerned a very significant event, which occurred since the Magistrate sentenced Ms McKellar on 3 November 2008. Although she had entered pleas of not guilty for the credit card offences, Mr Cubby her co-offender and partner in life, had entered not guilty pleas. Ms McKellar decided to co-operate and she gave evidence for the prosecution against Mr Cubby. It is agreed that the evidence amounted to substantial assistance. He was convicted. She is entitled to a discount on the sentences which she received because of that assistance. Ms Robinson’s sixth submission concerned periods which should be allowed on supervision on parole, or alternatively, under bonds to be of good behaviour. Her seventh submission concerned back dating of the overall sentences to commence when Ms McKellar first went into custody.19. Ms Shields appeared briefly for the respondent Director of Public Prosecutions on this appeal. She disclosed at the earliest opportunity the fact that on a previous occasion she had acted for Ms McKellar. As soon as she could, she withdrew from acting for her client and Mr Monaro appeared for the Director. Mr Monaro’s position was that he generally did not disagree with the submissions made by Ms Robinson. He submitted regarding the credit card offences that sentences for those crimes should not be fully concurrent because of the number of separate victims of the crimes.20. For various reasons - including the need to update the evidence before me concerning the sentence which had been imposed on 22 January 2009 and to institute a formal appeal from that sentence - these proceedings have been adjourned a number of times. This has no doubt resulted in some degree of inconvenience to Ms McKellar who has been to court a number of times and her case has not been dealt with as early as it might have, although it has been important to obtain the information which we now have.21. When the matter resumed today, Ms Robinson focused her attention on sentences imposed for the credit card offences. Mr Cubby’s overall sentences for the same crimes was a period of twenty-one months with eighteen months non parole period. His criminal history was substantially longer than Ms McKellar’s. Ms McKellar’s offending behaviour in fact commenced at about the time that she started her relationship with Mr Cubby. In fact Ms McKellar, who is now thirty-two, had no criminal record at all until she was twenty-seven. In addition of course Ms Robinson argues Ms McKellar pleaded guilty not at the earliest opportunity, but on an earlier occasion, and should be entitled to a discount not only for the assistance she gave in the proceedings against Mr Cubby, but for that plea.22. The result should be a sentence which is substantially less than the sentence imposed on Mr Cubby. In fact when the overall sentences are compared, as they presently stand, Mr Cubby received a sentence of twenty-one months compared with her overall sentence of eighteen months. Mr Cubby’s non parole period was eighteen months, with her non parole period of fifteen months. Clearly that needs a significant adjustment.23. Another focus of Ms Robinson’s submissions today was her client’s rehabilitation. She acknowledged that she clearly needs to see the Probation and Parole Service. Her client, she said, is open to addressing her drug problem including undertaking a residential rehabilitation program, once she has had the opportunity to become reunited with her family. One of the clear signs of her rehabilitation, in my opinion, was referred to by Ms Robinson as the steps she made in giving evidence against Mr Cubby. Mr Cubby, I expect, has been a bad influence in Ms McKellar’s life since she has been associated with him. She has now not only broken away from that relationship, but has taken steps to see that he has been dealt with by the justice system as he should have been.24. So far as individual sentences are concerned, Mr Monaro did not take exception to the submissions made by Ms Robinson. She proposed that for the larceny and goods in custody offences committed on 18 August 2006, instead of revoking the bond and imposing a custodial sentence, an appropriate course would be to substitute a longer bond. I agree with that submission, although it was a serious breach of the bond. It was one of her earliest offences and s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires a judicial officer to sentence an offender to imprisonment only if there is no other alternative. I regard a longer bond as an appropriate alternative, although I regard revocation of the earlier bond as also appropriate.25. So far as the assault on 20 March 2008 was concerned, Ms Robinson’s submission was that this amounted to Ms McKellar’s first crime of violence. She has a limited adverse history and her submission was that this should be met by another bond. I also accept that submission because of her limited previous record and s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires me to consider alternatives.26. So far as the credit card offences were concerned, Miss Robinson realistically and appropriately acknowledged that they should be met with full-time custodial sentences. This is so because she committed eleven separate crimes either on eleven separate occasions or against eleven separate victims, or both, over a period of some twenty-four hours, using two credit cards. However, I propose to commence those sentences from when she went into custody on 29 September 2008.27. I am going to structure the sentences which Ms McKellar receives for those eleven crimes as follows. She previously had an overall sentence of eighteen months, with a fifteen month non parole period. As I said that needs significant adjustment, because of the assistance which she has given in the prosecution of Mr Cubby and because of her plea of guilty. There needs to be a marked difference between her sentence and that received by Mr Cubby.28. I propose that her overall sentence for those eleven crimes will be twelve months, with a non parole of six months. That sentence takes into account her assistance, her role in the crimes and her pleas of guilty. The sentences would have been significantly higher and closer to what they were so far as the Magistrate was concerned, but for those factors.29. Once again Ms Robinson turning finally to the shoplifting which occurred on 29 September 2008, realistically acknowledges that a custodial sentence was appropriate. Her client was bail at the time and had a record for similar offences. She suggested some partial accumulation of that sentence with the other custodial sentences. I propose to do that. 30. In a moment I will announce the particular sentences which I would impose in allowing her appeal. But I can indicate that the global result will be as follows. There will be a twelve month sentence from 29 September 2008 to 28 September 2009, the non parole period will commence on 29 September 2008 and conclude on 28 April 2009; that will be an overall non parole of eight months. The ratio between the non parole period of eight months and the overall sentence of twelve months, has been altered taking into account the special circumstances which I find of Ms McKellar’s need for assistance in her rehabilitation. Accordingly the formal orders which I make in this appeal are as follows.31. Under s 20(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, I set aside all of the sentences of the learned Magistrate. For the seven offences of obtain valuable thing by deception contrary to s 178B A(1) (described as Sequences one to seven), I impose a sentence of a fixed term of six months to commence on 29 September 2008 and to expire on 28 March 2009.32. For the four offences of obtain a valuable thing by deception, again s 178BA(1) of the Crimes Act (described as Sequences eight to eleven) I impose an overall sentence of nine months imprisonment, to commence on 29 December 2008, and to expire on 28 September 2009. I fix a non parole period of three months to commence on 29 December 2008 and to expire on 28 March 2009.33. For the offence of larceny, committed on 29 September 2008, again s 117 of the Crimes Act, I sentence Ms McKellar to seven months imprisonment to commence on 29 January 2009 and to expire on 28 August 2009. I fix a non parole period of three months to commence on 29 January 2009 and to expire on 28 April 2009.34. For the common assault, committed on 20 March 2008, again s 61 of the Crimes Act, instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment, under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I make an order directing Ms McKellar to enter into a good behaviour bond for one year from today. The only condition of that good behaviour bond is that she be of good behaviour.35. Finally for the offences of larceny against s 117 of the Crimes Act, and goods in custody again s 527C(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, committed on 18 August 2008, I revoke the good behaviour bond previously imposed. Instead of that bond and instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment, under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I make an order directing Ms McKellar to enter into a good behaviour bond for three years from today. That good behaviour bond is subject to the following conditions-1. That she be of good behaviour.2. That she report to the office of the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service at Bourke within seven days of her release on parole.3. That she advise that service and the Registrar of this court of her residential address and of any change in that address.4. That she accept supervision from the Probation and Parole Service and accept all of their reasonable recommendations and directions so far as alcohol and other drug assessment and long term residential rehabilitation programmes and counselling for domestic and family violence issues.HIS HONOUR: Now I think that is it. So a number of things, one whether I have made all the orders I need to make to dispose of the appeals. Two, whether the arithmetic is correct.MONARO: Your Honour I just--HIS HONOUR: Yes Mr Monaro.MONARO: In relation to the bond matter, the revocation of bond matters--HIS HONOUR: Yes.MONARO: --there were two bonds imposed originally, is your Honour--HIS HONOUR: Thanks.MONARO: --intending to make two concurrent bonds I assume?HIS HONOUR: What’s the custom does - I didn’t realise there were two bonds were, it’s just got here s 9 bond for two offences. But where’s the--MONARO: Well your Honour I think.HIS HONOUR: This is the original larceny isn’t it. No I think it’s one bond Mr Monaro, it’s behind - it’s tab 11--MONARO: Yes, yes I’m sorry Your Honour yes.HIS HONOUR: Tab 11 yes, I think I’m right, what do you think?MONARO: Yeah it does appear to have been--HIS HONOUR: One bond for the two offences.MONARO: Mm, thank you your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Good. Now is there any other order that I need to make Ms Robinson?ROBINSON: I don’t believe there’s any other order. However, just in relation to the maths, your Honour indicated an overall non parole of eight months, my calculation the overall non parole period is seven months, is that what your Honour intended? Effectively goes from September until April which is seven months however when your Honour was--HIS HONOUR: Okay. Yes it’s probably what I - yes I might’ve actually looked at eight months before I did my - that might be an earlier calculation just let me - no you’re right it’s seven months I’m wrong.36 I correct my remarks in the judgment. The overall non parole period is seven months, with the head sentence of twelve months, which I confirm reflects the special circumstances but the dates I specified are correct.ROBINSON: Correct.HIS HONOUR: Good thank you. Now anything else?ROBINSON: Nothing that I can see arising.MONARO: No your Honour.37. All right. Ms McKellar I am obliged to explain all this to you. You have won your appeals, all of them and I’ve adjusted your sentences. The overall reason is what I said, you look as though you’re making a serious effort of getting your life back on track. Am I right - yeah and I’ve given my reasons, you’ve heard what I said. 38. The gaol sentences I’ve kept for the credit card spree that you went on for twenty four hours and for the recent shoplifting from the flower place in September last year. That’s because of your record, but I’ve reduced the credit card fraud sentence significantly, because you helped in the case against Cubby and because you pleaded guilty I’ve reduced it from overall eighteen months, down to overall twelve months and from the minimum of fifteen months to a minimum of six months because of what I’ve said. Your recent shoplifting, you’ve still got the seven months and you’ve still got the three months which the Magistrate set you, but two of those three months you’re serving at the same as the six months, all right. 39. So your overall sentence I’ve back-dated to start on 29 September 2008, that’s when you first went into custody. You’ve got twelve months, so your overall sentence finishes a year after that 28 September this year. That’s when your overall sentence finishes. 40. Your effective non parole period is seven months, starting back then in September and your non parole period finishes on 28 April 2009 - 28 April 2009. In a moment I am going to make an order that you be released on that day on parole. I’ve given you a bond for twelve months for clocking Ms Edwards in Centrelink, all right and that’s just to be of good behaviour there’s no other conditions.41. The main sentence so far as I’m concerned - so far as your future is concerned - is the three year good behaviour bond from today. And that’s so that you can help yourself getting your act together. Probation and Parole Service are in charge of your supervision. You’ve got to report to them seven days after you’re released on parole at Bourke, keep them informed of your address and this court of your address. You’ve got to stay out of trouble for three years and they’re going to give you advice about drug and alcohol rehabilitation, family violence, domestic violence and I am directing you to follow their advice so far as it’s reasonable which I’m sure it will be and they’re going to help you. They’re trained to do that in getting your life back together. They’re good at what they do and they know how to help people in your situation, that’s what they’re trained to do. So that lasts three years to give you a good opportunity and if need be if that includes a residential rehab programme that might be the best thing for you to do. But you’ve got to stay out trouble for three years or you’ll be back before me and I will have to reconsider the sentence.42. There is one other formal order which I have to make under s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I order that Ms McKellar be released to parole on 28 April 2009. I am not fixing any conditions on parole because of the good behaviour bond of three years.HIS HONOUR: Now do you understand all of that? All right, it’s a lot to understand, Ms Robinson might help you if you need when she’s available and explain but you’re out of gaol on 28 April this year and then it’s over to you and the Parole Service to carry on sorting out your life. You’ve made a very good start. Nothing else Ms Robinson?ROBINSON: Thank you your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Mr Monaro?MONARO: Thank you your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Okay, Ms McKellar can be taken down and good luck.

     Vlajko IVANOVIC v Regina 
      
      
     Judgment 
      
    1 BLANCH J: On 14 March 2008 the applicant was sentenced in the District Court on four counts of impose upon the Commonwealth by an unfair representation contrary to s 29B of the Crimes Act 1914 and three counts of dishonestly causing a loss to the Commonwealth contrary to s 135.1(5) of the Criminal Code 1995, the maximum penalty for each of the offences under s 29B of the Crimes Act is two years imprisonment and the maximum penalty in respect of the Criminal Code offences is five years imprisonment.2 On each of the Crimes Act offences he was sentenced to nine months imprisonment to date from 14 March 2008, and on each of the Criminal Code offences he was sentenced to two years imprisonment to date from 13 December 2008, but with a recognisance release order for him to be released on 13 March 2009, on entering into a recognizance to be of good behaviour until 13 March 2010.3 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences on the basis that the sentencing judge erred in failing to discount the sentences by reason of the applicant's early plea and his willingness to facilitate the course of justice. 4 The four offences contrary to s 29B were as follows:  
     
      
      1. Between 15 August 2000 and 29 August 2000 he obtained a disability support pension in his own name but omitted to inform the Commonwealth he was employed and in receipt of an income. He was overpaid $506.96. 
      
     
     
      
      2. Between 10 October 2000 and 24 October 2000 he obtained a disability support pension, again failing to inform the Commonwealth he was employed and receiving an income. He was overpaid $476.96. 
      
     
     
      
      3. Between 10 November 2000 and about 10 May 2001 he received a Newstart allowance in a false name of Marko Marjanac at a time he was receiving a disability support pension. He was overpaid $5757.80. 
      
     
     
      
      4. Between 15 February 2001 and 22 May 2001 he received a disability support pension when failing to inform the Commonwealth he was in receipt of workers compensation payments. The overpayment was $1865.74. 
      
    5 The three offences under the Code were as follows:  
     
      
      1. Between 24 May 2001 and 22 November 2001 he received a Newstart allowance in a false name whilst he was receiving a disability support pension. The overpayment was $6348.37. 
      
     
     
      
      2. Between 5 June 2001 and 21 September 2004 he received a disability support pension and when he did so he did not disclose his correct assets or that he was in receipt of workers compensation. The overpayment was $27,649.98. 
      
     
     
      
      3. Between 10 September 2004 and 10 March 2005 he received a Newstart allowance in the false name of Marko Marjanac when he was in receipt of a disability support pension. The overpayment was $6406.84. 
      
    6 In total he was paid $57,498.59 in Newstart allowance and disability support pension and of that amount $49,012.64 represented the overpayment. The applicant has made full restitution of the amount to the Commonwealth.7 The applicant was born in March 1947 and came to Australia from the former Yugoslavia in 1966. He has convictions in 1973 for stealing and goods in custody. He received a six months suspended sentence plus fines. Later in 1973 he received fines for resisting arrest and unseemly words, and in 1990 at Liverpool District Court he was released on a bond to be of good behaviour for three years for malicious injury to property and ordered to pay compensation of $10,302.95. At the sentencing hearing reports were tendered which indicated that the applicant injured his lower back in 1985 working as a builder. He received compensation of $40,000 plus a weekly payment, and in 1994 he was awarded a disability pension. In 1997 he started working again under the false name of Marko Marjanac, and in 2000 he fell from scaffolding injuring himself. The report of Dr Sokolovic indicates that his physical condition has deteriorated and he has had regular medication for his diabetes, hypertension and heart problems.8 All of these subjective matters were taken into account by the sentencing judge, and the question agitated before this court is whether the judge has imposed too heavy a sentence, in particular because he failed to give appropriate recognition to the plea of guilty. 9 In his remarks on sentence the trial Judge said: 
     
      
      “I have also taken into consideration the plea of guilty which was entered at the Local Court. The plea was entered shortly after the service of the prosecution brief of evidence. The plea of guilty is some evidence of remorse and contrition. However, any leniency as a result of such remorse on this basis is minimal having regard to the strength of the Crown case. 
      
     
     
      
      Of more significance is the fact the offender has made reparation to the Commonwealth in the amounts he defrauded which is further evidence of his contrition. I have taken the plea of guilty together with his remorse and reparation into account in determining the appropriate sentence, such matters entitling the offender to an element of leniency. 
      
     
     
      
      The offender has co-operated with the authorities in the investigation of the offences, having made full admissions during his record of interview which was conducted on 20 June 2005. I take this matter into account in favour of the offender.” 
      
    10 In these statements it is plain the sentencing judge was bearing in mind the fact the applicant had entered a plea of guilty at an early stage and he said he was taking it into account, together with other matters such as remorse and reparation. There is no basis for doubting that the sentencing judge gave full weight to the fact of the plea of guilty. In Tyler v The Queen (2007) 173 A Crim R 458 at paragraph 114 it was said: 
     
      
       “Taylor DCJ was called upon to sentence Tyler in accordance with the principles stated by the High Court in  
      Cameron 
      . This specifically excludes reference to the utilitarian value of the plea. Since the test is a willingness of the offender to facilitate the course of justice, one relevant consideration, at least in some cases, is the strength of the Crown case: this may cast some light upon the question whether the plea of guilty was truly motivated by willingness to facilitate the course of justice, or, pragmatically, for example, the recognition of the inevitable. Nor is there any requirement, in sentencing Commonwealth offenders, for quantification of a discount for the plea of guilty.” 
      
    11 The sentencing judge referred in his remarks on sentence to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v Jennifer Rose Purdon CCA NSW unreported 27 March 1997 where Hunt CJ at CL said:  
     
      
      “…in the case of a fraud upon the social security system, a custodial sentence is to be imposed unless there exist very special circumstances justifying some lesser order. It is unnecessary to refer to the very many judgments which have re-stated and applied that proposition. It is sufficient to refer only to three: Regina v Van Tung Luu (CCA, 7 December, 1984, unreported) at 3; Regina v David Fernanda Medina (CCA, 28 May 1990, unreported) at 4; Regina v Mears (1991) 53 A Crim R 141 at 145. An attempt was made to distinguish those cases by reference to their facts, but those statements made were intended to go beyond the facts of those particular cases and to be of universal application. In my view, it is too late to challenge those statements now.” 
      
    12 He went on to say: 
     
      
      “The rationale stated for the rule that a custodial sentence is to be imposed for social security fraud except in very special circumstances is that the offence is easy to commit but difficult to detect, it is widespread, and the introduction of more checks upon applicants for social security would cause delays in the payment of benefits and therefore hardship to those whose need is urgent. It has also been said that the rule reflects a concern for the protection of the revenue, but I would prefer to express it as a concern for the additional burden upon all taxpayers who shoulder the heavy burden of providing the funds for the social security system to operate and the even heavier burden created by the widespread abuse to it by frauds such as these. The rule is  
      not 
       based upon the fact that many of the frauds are perpetrated for motives of greed rather than need. Both types of fraud are widespread. They are equally difficult to detect. If the fraud is based upon a perceived need, a custodial sentence must be expected except in very special circumstances. If the fraud is based on greed, the custodial sentence will be longer. See  
      Regina v David Fernanda Medina 
       (at 6);  
      Regina v Mears 
       (at 145).” 
      
    13 Those statements of principle are as valid today as at that time. The fraudulent activity here was planned and over a number of years. It justifies a sentence which reflects a significant element of general deterrence.14 This court will interfere with a sentence imposed if it can be shown the sentencing judge was in error, and then only if the court forms the opinion that some other less severe sentence is warranted in law and should be passed. In my view in this case the judge has made no error, and I am also of the view that in the circumstances of this case no less severe sentence should have been passed. 15 I would refuse the application for leave to appeal and dismiss the appeal.16 GROVE J: I agree.17 JOHNSON J: I also agree.18 GROVE J: The orders of the court will therefore be as proposed by Justice Blanch. oOo

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him in respect of one count of doing an act with intent to influence a witness contrary to s 323(a) Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for seven years. The applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of three years commencing on 6 January 2008 and expiring on 5 January 2011 with a balance of term of two years imprisonment commencing on 6 January 2011 and expiring on 5 January 2013. 
     
      
    2 The practical effect of his sentence was to add one year to the sentence which had already been imposed for offences of malicious wounding and aggravated car-jacking. It was the complainant, in the malicious wounding matter who the applicant attempted to influence when committing the present offence. 
     
      
    3 In this Court the Crown did not resist the applicant’s submission that the sentence imposed for the attempt to influence offence was excessive and requires the intervention of this Court. It is accordingly necessary to determine the appropriate sentence and in particular having regard to matters of totality the period of full time custody which the applicant should serve before being released to parole. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    4 After a trial in the District Court the applicant was found guilty of a charge contrary to s 154C of assaulting with intent to take a motor vehicle whilst in company (aggravated car jacking). James Koning and his partner Rebecca Noakes were Crown witnesses and gave evidence at the trial. 
     
      
    5 The applicant was in custody prior to the commencement of the trial and sent a letter via Australia Post to Mr Koning’s home. The letter was received on 18 May 2006. The back of the envelope indicated that it was sent by the applicant and gave his prisoner identification number. 
     
      
    6 The letter said: 
     
      
       
        
        “To Jimbo, what’s going on? Why are you saying it was me and Kano that done this car jacking? What cause your dirty on us? Going doubles on your missus. Come on that’s in the past. That was two years ago and don’t think you’re getting any money off us now for that ounce of ice and if I go down for something I didn’t do because of you, you better watch your back. All right so think about who you’re covering for and what you’re doing. Be careful it’s a dangerous game. Blacky.” 
        
       
      
    7 Mr Koning made copies of the letter and handed the original to police. 
     
      
    8 As I have indicated notwithstanding receipt of the letter, Mr Koning gave evidence and the applicant was convicted. He subsequently pleaded guilty to an unrelated matter of malicious wounding. 
     
      
    9 The applicant was sentenced for both the aggravated car jacking and malicious wounding in the District Court on 6 October 2006. For the aggravated car jacking he was sentenced to imprisonment for 7½ years comprising a non-parole period of 5 years and a balance of term of 2½ years. For the malicious wounding he was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years comprising a non-parole period of 2½ years and a balance of term of 18 months commencing on 8 December 2009. 
     
      
    10 The applicant appealed the sentences and on 14 August 2007 this Court allowed the appeal (MB v R [2007] NSWCCA 245) and the applicant was re-sentenced. The standard non-parole period for the offence of aggravated car jacking was varied by the Court due to his youth, his disturbed background and his prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    11 The applicant was resentenced as follows: 
     
      
    · For the offence of malicious wounding, a non-parole period of 18 months, commencing on 6 January 2006 and expiring on 5 July 2007 was imposed with a balance of term of 2½ years commencing on 6 July 2007 and expiring on 5 January 2010. 
     
      
    · For the offence of aggravated car jacking, a non-parole period of 3 years was imposed commencing on 6 January 2007 and expiring on 5 January 2010, with a balance of term of two years, commencing on 6 January 2010 and expiring on 5 January 2012. 
     
      
    12 Accordingly, the expiry date of the non-parole period prior to the imposition of the sentence for the present offence was 5 January 2010 and his full term expired on 5 January 2012. The effect of the sentence imposed for the present offence was to increase the non-parole period of the applicant’s sentence by one year and to extend the length of the overall sentence by one year. 
     
      
    13 Little was placed before the Court by way of subjective material on the applicant’s behalf. However, the sentencing judge found that applicant is the youngest of a number of children. He lived with his mother in the Berkeley area of Wollongong at times when he was not in custody. He had had a troubled childhood and spent a significant period of his life in juvenile detention centres. 
     
      
    14 He has a brother Shane who is aged in his thirties. Shane is available to be a support and role model for his younger brother and wishes to try and influence the applicant away from criminal activity. 
     
      
    15 The applicant has a long history of substance abuse. He started using cannabis at the age of eleven and alcohol as a very young teenager. He has more recently become addicted to crystal methamphetamine or ice. 
     
      
    16 The applicant is now 21 years of age. He was aged 19 years at the time of the offence. 
     
      
    17 The sentencing judge accepted that the applicant had pleaded guilty at an early opportunity and allowed a discount of 20% for his plea. The consequence is that the starting point for the maximum term of the sentence must have been six years and three months. The offence carries a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. 
     
      
    18 The offence was serious and does, as the sentencing judge confirmed, strike at the heart of the criminal justice system. It was not the most serious offence or even a most serious offence of its type. The applicant’s actions could properly be described as naïve in sending a letter which he signed making it inevitable that his offending would be detected. It bespeaks the actions of an immature person finding himself in distress following his incarceration for the primary offences. 
     
      
    19 When, as in the present case, a court is sentencing for a serious offence but where the sentence will be imposed in addition to a significant prison term for other matters, it is important to ensure that the overall sentence is not crushing. There must also be a recognition of the prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    20 This Court was provided with the statistics collected by the Judicial Commission in relation to sentencing of offenders for the present offence. The statistics reveal that 17 cases have come before the District Court in the period during which statistics have been collected. Of these approximately half have received prison sentences while the others have been dealt with by way of bond, community service, suspended sentence or periodic detention. The statistics indicate that the applicant has received the most significant sentence of any offender. 
     
      
    21 In my judgment the offence was serious. It was aggravated by the fact that it was committed when the applicant was in custody, bail having been refused in relation to the primary offences. The applicant incorporated reference in the letter to the complainant being a drug dealer, a false allegation, which was no doubt made in order to deter the applicant from reporting the matter to the authorities. The crime was not impulsive. 
     
      
    22 However, the applicant is a young person and the period in custody which he must serve in relation to the other offences is significant. His troubled history indicates that he will need a significant period of supervision within the community if he is ever to put his life in order. That opportunity should be provided through a sentencing regime proportionate to his offending but which provides an opportunity for him to rehabilitate himself within the community. 
     
      
    23 In my judgment the appropriate sentence is a period of full time custody of 18 months with an additional term of 18 months. I would provide that the sentence commence on 6 April 2009 and accordingly he will be eligible for parole on 5 October 2010 the further term of his sentence being completed on 5 April 2012. The consequence will be that he serves a period of full time custody for this offence of 9 months. 
     
      
    24 I find special circumstances both because of the applicant’s age and the need to provide a sentence which appropriately recognises the other sentences imposed upon him. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
       
      1. Leave to appeal granted and appeal upheld. 
       
      2. Sentence imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
      3. Sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of 18 months commencing on 6 April 2009 and expiring on 5 October 2010 with a further term of 18 months expiring on 5 April 2012.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant was originally charged with malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900. That offence carries a maximum penalty of a term of imprisonment for 25 years. He was also charged with an alternative count to which he pleaded guilty of malicious wounding contrary to s 35(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (Repealed) which carries a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment. He was sentenced to a total term of 5 years 2 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and 10 months.  
     
      
    2 The relevant facts can be briefly stated. At about 7 pm on 2 March 2007 Aaron Petrovic went to a seafood restaurant with a friend for dinner. Mr Petrovic ordered barramundi but believed that the fish he was served was of a different variety. He complained to the shop owner. Shortly afterwards Mr Petrovic asked the applicant, who was also present in the restaurant, why he was staring at him. The applicant asked Mr Petrovic in effect “do I know you?” Mr Petrovic then advised the applicant not to order barramundi for his dinner. 
     
      
    3 The applicant’s response was to tell Mr Petrovic to shut up otherwise he would stab him. He pulled a hunting knife with a blade approximately 12 cm long from a sheath and slammed it on the table. Mr Petrovic replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “Stab me for what? I just said that the barramundi was not barramundi. I just ordered it … If you’re going to pull a knife you may as well use it or sit down.” 
        
       
      
    4 Mr Petrovic then took his dinner over to the applicant to show him. The applicant began swinging the knife around and calling out incoherently. Mr Petrovic told him to calm down and relax and that he had merely wanted to tell him about the barramundi. 
     
      
    5 The applicant swung the knife at Mr Petrovic who grabbed him in order to restrain him. They struggled and eventually fell to the floor. Mr Petrovic tried to grab the knife and as he was doing so the applicant stabbed him in the left upper arm. He was also stabbed in the left side of his abdomen. Mr Petrovic ultimately managed to get the knife and threw it away. 
     
      
    6 Mr Petrovic was assisted by a friend to walk outside the restaurant where he collapsed. He was found by the police lying on the footpath. He had suffered grievous injuries. The stab wound to the left side of his abdomen had perforated his large bowel and there were multiple stab wounds to his left arm with a separation of the bicep muscle, the median and musculo-cutaneous nerves and the brachial artery. He required surgery to both the bowel perforation and his arm and artery. He spent a number of weeks in hospital. 
     
      
    7 The subjective circumstances of the applicant were identified by the sentencing judge. He was born on 10 May 1942 in Greece and was 64 years of age at the time of the offence and 65 when sentenced. He has no prior criminal history. 
     
      
    8 The applicant suffers from schizophrenia and has done so since he was in his mid forties. He has a history of mental health admissions at the St George Mental Health Unit. The admissions arose from non-compliance with medication regimes, breaching of community treatment orders, self-harm attempts, unprovoked aggression, paranoid ideation and command auditory hallucinations. He reported to Dr Olav Nielssen, a psychiatrist, that he had a total of 8 or 9 admissions to St George Hospital, most recently for around 2 months in July 2006. He had a period of stable health but his condition again deteriorated when his medication was changed and ultimately he ceased taking it. 
     
      
    9 Dr Nielssen expressed the following opinion: 
     
      
       
        
        “The diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia is based on the history of typical symptoms of the illness, a typical pattern of treatment and the findings during the interview, including impaired insight regarding the origins of the symptoms during the acute phase of the illness. 
        
       
       
        
        The Justice Health Medical Records show that Mr Zaharos was acutely mentally ill at the time of his reception to gaol, but his symptoms are now in remission as a result of consistent treatment with antipsychotic medication since his arrest. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Zaharos has a form of the illness that responds to treatment, but his illness has followed a relapsing course because he has previously stopped taking medication against medical advice. He attributed his poor adherence to the unpleasant side effects of medication, but limited awareness of the presence of illness and the need for indefinite treatment must be a factor in his decision to stop [taking] medication. His longest period of remission since the onset of illness in his mid forties was the five years that he received treatment in the form of long acting injections as a condition of a [community treatment order].” 
        
       
      
    10 There was evidence before the sentencing judge that the applicant although lacking in confidence and formal education, has a keen mind. He has engaged in community activities and was said by the Reverend Brian Tung, the Anglican priest at the Parish of Riverwood-Punchbowl to have a “very kind heart.” The applicant is known to have provided financial and other help to his neighbours in the housing commission block where he lived. 
     
      
    11 Four grounds of appeal were advanced in the application being: 
     
      
       
      1. The learned sentencing judge erred in his consideration of the mental illness of the applicant. 
       
       
      2. The learned sentencing judge erred in his approach to the question of whether there were special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
      1999. 
       
       
      3. The learned sentencing judge erred in allowing only a 20 percent reduction in sentence for the plea of guilty. 
       
       
      4. The sentence is manifestly excessive in all the circumstances. 
       
      
    12 The sentencing judge found that the applicant was not remorseful and was not prepared to find that the applicant was “not fully aware of the consequences of his action.” He concluded that the applicant was dangerous and rejected the suggestion that he was “unlikely to re-offend”. 
     
      
    13 The sentencing judge rejected a submission that the applicant’s mental illness was causally connected to the commission of the offence. His Honour did not accept the diagnosis of Dr Nielssen, it being apparent that the account of the events which the applicant told the psychiatrist was at odds with the agreed facts placed before his Honour. In particular his Honour rejected the suggestion by Dr Nielssen that the applicant was acting “in response to a defect of reason in the form of persecutory beliefs arising from acute symptoms of mental illness” and further rejected the suggestion that the applicant did not know that what he was doing was “morally wrong.” 
     
      
    14 To my mind the finding which his Honour made was soundly based. Where mental illness has played a part in the offending, the need for general deterrence may be diminished: R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48. However, where an offender understands what he is doing and the gravity of his actions, general deterrence may be of continuing significance: Wright at 51; R v Henry & Ors [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [252]-[254]. The issue is further discussed in R v Matthews [2004] NSWCCA 112; (2004) 145 A Crim R 445 and R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33]-[36]. 
     
      
    15 His Honour rejected the suggestion that the applicant’s mental illness was causally connected to the commission of the offence. I am not persuaded that that finding was incorrect. Accordingly, I reject the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
    16 With respect to special circumstances the applicant complained that his Honour’s finding is unclear. The sentencing judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ms McSpedden submitted that I should make a finding of special circumstances here so as to alter the ordinary [ratio] of the offender’s non-parole period to his overall sentence. I have considered that submission and although I acknowledge that this is a case in which I could find special circumstances my assessment is that there is no proper reason for me to make a finding of special circumstances here and, therefore, I do not find special circumstances.” 
        
       
      
    17 The applicant submitted that there was a compelling case for special circumstances, in particular because the applicant was aged in his sixties, suffered from a mental illness, and had never previously offended. 
     
      
    18 This Court has previously considered the question of special circumstances on many occasions. The decisions have emphasised the need for such a finding to be carefully considered and properly justified by an offender’s circumstances. In R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 this Court considered the range of factors capable of constituting special circumstances. In particular, where factors relevant to the subjective circumstances of the applicant have been considered in relation to the head sentence it is important that they are not “double counted” and utilised to alter the statutory proportion between the head sentence and the non-parole period. The Chief Justice said in R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [18]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Almost all matters capable of constituting special circumstances have usually been taken into account in determining the head sentence and sentencing judges should ensure that double counting does not occur.” 
        
       
      
    19 In Simpson at [73] the Chief Justice said when considering the appropriate relationship between the non-parole period and the total sentence: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “As a practical matter there are unlikely to be many cases in which this Court will interfere unless the non-parole period is found to be manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    20 In the present case, his Honour’s sentencing remarks suggest that he was aware that there were features of the applicant’s case which would justify a finding of special circumstances. As I make plain below I am of the view that such a finding should be made. However, the issue is one on which sentencing judges may reasonably differ and is one of the many issues to be considered. I am not persuaded that by not making a finding in this case his Honour erred.  
     
      
    21 The sentencing judge provided a 20% reduction in the sentence for the plea of guilty. The applicant complained that he should have received the maximum entitlement having regard to the fact that he pleaded to the alternative count on the indictment but was dependent on its acceptance by the Crown if a trial was to be avoided. I do not accept this submission. 
     
      
    22 The applicant was arrested and charged on the date of the offence, 2 March 2007. He pleaded guilty more than 9 months later on 7 December 2007 when the matter came before the District Court. In the meantime there had been a committal hearing. 
     
      
    23 As has been said by this Court on many occasions the discount for a plea is to recognise the utilitarian benefit which it brings to the system of justice. When that plea is entered at the time of trial, even though to a lesser offence, the utilitarian benefit may be significantly different from that resulting from a plea at an earlier time. The relevant principles were discussed in R v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117; Sullivan v R; Skillin v R [2008] NSWCCA 296; R v SY [2003] NSWCCA 291 at [85]-[88]. 
     
      
    24 The applicant submitted that this issue should be resolved by the fact that the Crown Prosecutor conceded at the sentence hearing that “it would be fair to say it was a plea at the earliest opportunity.” This submission was made in recognition that the plea was entered as a result of the bargain between the Crown and the defence on the first day of trial. The concession was not appropriate and his Honour was correct to find that the applicant did not plead guilty at the earliest opportunity. 
     
      
    25 The applicant’s ultimate submission was that the sentence was manifestly excessive. In my judgment this submission should be accepted. 
     
      
    26 The maximum penalty for the offence to which the applicant fell to be sentenced was seven years. This is of course in distinct contrast to the penalty for the more serious offence being twenty-five years. Although the wounds inflicted upon Mr Petrovic were serious they did not fall at the upper end of the range. Malicious wounding very often occasions significant and permanent injury to the victim. This was not a case in that category. Allowing a discount of 20% for the plea it is apparent that the starting point for the sentence was a total sentence of six years and six months. Having regard to the fact that this was a first offence, and could not be described as falling within the most serious case of this offence the sentence was excessive. 
     
      
    27 However, although not in the most serious category of case the offence was serious and the result of an aggressive response to Mr Petrovic’s endeavours to assist the applicant. Mindful of the sentencing judge’s findings of a lack of remorse and reservations as to his prospect of rehabilitation, a substantial prison term must be imposed. I have significant reservations as to whether in the circumstances the sentencing judge’s finding that a discount of 20% for the plea of guilty was appropriate but I accept it for the purpose of re-sentencing. To my mind there is a need for the applicant to receive a lengthy period of supervision upon release and accordingly I would find special circumstances. Although not directly relevant to the offence, it is apparent that the applicant must continue on his anti-psychotic medication if he is to lead a stable life. 
     
      
    28 In my judgment the applicant should be sentenced to a non-parole period of two years and nine months with an additional term of one year and three months. I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Grant leave to appeal and uphold the appeal. 
       
      2. The sentence imposed in the District Court is quashed. 
       
      3. The applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months commencing on 2 March 2007 and to expire on 1 December 2009 being the date upon which he is eligible to be released to parole. There is an additional term of 1 year and 3 months to commence on 2 December 2009 and concluding on 1 March 2011.

     R v RK 
      
     R v LK 
     
     
      
       
      The respondents allegedly dealt with money which was part of the proceeds of a plan to defraud the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme of some $150M. They were charged with conspiring to deal with money being reckless as to the fact that the money was proceeds of crime, pursuant to s 11.5(1) and s 400.3(2) of the  
      Commonwealth Criminal Code 
      . The Crown case was not that the respondents had knowledge that the money was the proceeds of crime, only that they were reckless as to this fact. 
       
       
      Following a trial before a jury, the respondents made a no case to answer submission. The trial judge rejected the submission that the evidence could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt the critical elements of the offence charged, but upheld the submission that the indictment, on the case the Crown presented, charged an offence bad at law or unknown to the law. The trial judge directed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty. 
       
       
      The Crown appeals to this Court, pursuant to s 107 of the  
      Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 
       2001 which provides for an appeal by the Crown against an acquittal by direction. 
       
       
       
      HELD 
       
      Per Spigelman CJ, Grove and Fullerton JJ agreeing 
       
       
      1 It is possible at common law for persons to conspire to commit an offence with respect to which recklessness is the fault element. This is also true of the  
      Commonwealth Criminal Code 
      . [32]-[34], [53], [78], [79] 
       
       
        
        R v Ansari  
        [2007] NSWCCA 204; (2007) 70 NSWLR 89 applied. 
        
       
       
      2 It is more appropriate to characterise s 5.4(4) of the  
      Commonwealth Criminal Code 
      , which provides that where recklessness is a fault element it can be established by proof of intention or knowledge, as evidentiary, rather than definitional. [41], [78], [79] 
       
       
        
        R v Ansari  
        [2007] NSWCCA 204; (2007) 70 NSWLR 89 not applied. 
        
       
       
      3 Proper approach to interpretation of a Code considered. [44]-[48], [78], [79] 
       
       
      4 The references to “conspiracy” in the Code are of a technical legal character and were intended by the drafters, subject to any express statutory modification, to implement the common law. [46]-[47], [49]-[51], [78], [79]  
       
       
        
        Stuart v The Queen  
        (1974) 134 CLR 426 applied;  
        Vallance v The Queen  
        (1961) 108 CLR 56 referred to. 
        
       
       
      5 For a person to be guilty of the offence of conspiracy to commit an offence, both at common law and under the  
      Commonwealth Criminal Code 
      , s/he must know the facts that make the act or acts unlawful. [55], [60]-[62], [78], [79]

        Giorgianni v The Queen  
        (1985) 156 CLR 473 applied. 
        
       
       
      6 The trial judge properly distinguished  
      Ansari  
      on the basis that, in that case, it was the Crown case that the accused actually did know all of facts that made the conduct criminal. Here only recklessness was alleged. [68]-[70], [78], [79] 
       
       
        
        R v Ansari  
        [2007] NSWCCA 204; (2007) 70 NSWLR 89 referred to. 
        
       
       
      7 It was open to her Honour to direct a verdict, rather than to quash the indictment. [75], [78], [79]

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: This is a Crown appeal against the decision of Sweeney DCJ to direct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty with respect to conspiracy offences allegedly committed by each respondent. Provision is made for an appeal by the Crown against a verdict by direction by s 107 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. 
     
      
    2 At the commencement of the trial Sweeney DCJ had rejected an application on the part of the respondents to quash each indictment on the basis that it did not disclose an indictable offence. At the end of the Crown case her Honour dealt with a no case to answer submission. She rejected the respondents’ submission that the evidence in the Crown case could not prove beyond reasonable doubt the critical elements of the offence charged. However, her Honour upheld the submission, modifying her earlier views, that the offence on the indictment was not an offence known to the law.  
     
      
    3 The indictment against each accused relevantly stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … between about 1 December 2003 and about 1 February 2004 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere did conspire with each other, [RM] and with divers other persons to deal with money to the value of $1,000,000 or more being the proceeds of crime where those persons who were to deal with the money pursuant to the conspiracy were reckless as to the fact that the money was the proceeds of crime.” 
        
       
       
      The Statutory Scheme 
       
      
    4 The offence of conspiracy is created by s 11.5 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code which relevantly states: 
     
      
       
        
        “11.5(1) A person who conspires with another person to commit an offence punishable by imprisonment for more than 12 months, or by a fine of 200 penalty points or more, is guilty of the offence of conspiracy to commit that offence and is punishable as if the offence to which the conspiracy relates had been committed. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) For the person to be guilty: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the person must have entered into an agreement with one or more other persons; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the person and at least one other party to the agreement must have intended that an offence would be committed pursuant to the agreement; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the person or at least one other party to the agreement must have committed an overt act pursuant to the agreement.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    5 The offence which the respondents allegedly conspired to commit was an offence under s 400.3(2) in the Commonwealth Criminal Code which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “400.3(2) A person is guilty of an offence if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the person deals with money or other property; and 
          
         
        
       
      
    (b) either: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) the money or property is proceeds of crime; or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) there is a risk that the money or property will become an instrument of crime; and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the person is reckless as to the fact that the money or property is proceeds of crime or the fact that there is a risk that it will become an instrument of crime (as the case requires); and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $1,000,000 or more.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    6 As can be seen s 400.3(2)(c) creates an offence where a person is reckless as to a relevant fact. Furthermore, it creates two distinct offences where either: 
     
      
       
      (A) the money or property is proceeds of crime and the person is reckless as to the fact that the money is proceeds of crime (s 400.3(2)(b)(i) and (c)). 
       
       
      (B) there is a risk that the money or property will become an instrument of crime and the person is reckless as to the fact that there is a risk that it will become an instrument of crime (s 400.3(2)(b)(ii) and (c)). 
       
      
    7 It is pertinent to note that s 400.3(1) creates offences in parallel terms to the above but in circumstances in which the person believes the money or property to be proceeds of crime. It, according to the higher level of moral culpability, specifies a higher maximum penalty. Section 400.3(3) provides for parallel offences where a person is negligent as to the requisite fact. It, according to the lower level of moral culpability, imposes a lower maximum penalty. 
     
      
    8 The Criminal Code establishes that each offence must contain one or more physical elements and, subject to provision to the contrary, a fault element must attach to each such physical element. Section 4.1 of the Criminal Code provides that a physical element may be conduct or a result of conduct or a circumstance in which conduct or a result of conduct occurs. The relevant physical element in this case is a “circumstance” ie “the money is proceeds of crime”. 
     
      
    9 The Code further provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “5.1(1) A fault element for a particular physical element may be intention, knowledge, recklessness or negligence. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Subsection (1) does not prevent a law that creates a particular offence from specifying other fault elements for a physical element of that offence. 
        
       
       
        
        5.2(1) A person has intention with respect to conduct if he or she means to engage in that conduct. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) A person has intention with respect to a circumstance if he or she believes that it exists or will exist. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) A person has intention with respect to a result if he or she means to bring it about or is aware that it will occur in the ordinary course of events. 
        
       
       
        
        5.3 A person has knowledge of a circumstance or a result if he or she is aware that it exists or will exist in the ordinary course of events. 
        
       
       
        
        5.4(1) A person is reckless with respect to a circumstances if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the circumstance exists or will exist; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) A person is reckless with respect to a result if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the result will occur; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) The question whether taking a risk is unjustifiable is one of fact. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) If recklessness is a fault element for a physical element of an offence, proof of intention, knowledge or recklessness will satisfy that fault element.” 
        
       
       
      The Background to the Appeal 
       
      
    10 The background facts in this case involved a plan to defraud the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme by forwarding a fax, which appeared to be genuine, to the bank for the Scheme instructing that funds of approximately $150 million be transferred to four designated bank accounts. One of the accounts, to which an amount of approximately $25 million was transferred, was in the name of one of the respondents. 
     
      
    11 The Crown case was that the accused intentionally entered into an agreement to commit an offence with respect to which the fault element attaching to a particular physical element was recklessness. 
     
      
    12 The Crown case did not allege that the respondents were parties to the fraud against the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, nor that they were specifically aware of the fraud. The Crown case was that the respondents were reckless as to the fact that the funds transferred into the account were the proceeds of crime. I emphasise this important aspect of the Crown case: it is alleged that the respondents, not a third party, were reckless about this fact. 
     
      
    13 Numerous communications between the respondents, and between each of them and their alleged co-conspirators, were tendered in evidence and which, her Honour concluded, it was open to the jury to accept. This appeal proceeded on the basis that her Honour was correct to dismiss that aspect of the no case to answer submission to the effect that elements of the offence could not be proved beyond reasonable doubt. There was no challenge to her Honour’s ultimate finding in this respect: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view the evidence the Crown relies on and to which it has referred in these submissions is overwhelmingly capable of proving that each accused entered the conspiracy alleged and was reckless as to the money in [RK]’s account being the proceeds of crime.” (AB 129) 
        
       
      
    14 Her Honour further said that there was “sufficient evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt the essential elements of conspiracy to deal with the proceeds of crime and recklessness that the money was the proceeds of crime” (AB 130). 
     
      
    15 At the heart of the submissions before Sweeney DCJ and in this Court was the judgment of this Court in R v Ansari [2007] NSWCCA 204; (2007) 70 NSWLR 89. Her Honour interpreted that judgment in a particular manner, which the respondents seek to uphold. The Crown submits that her Honour misinterpreted the judgment and that, on a true interpretation, her Honour should not have found that the indictment did not charge an offence known to the law. 
     
      
    16 The principal judgment in Ansari was given by Howie J, which whom Hislop J agreed. Simpson J expressed her agreement with the reasons of Howie J, but added certain observations which, in some respects, approached the matter in a somewhat different manner. Her Honour’s expression of agreement must be understood as subject to those observations. 
     
      
    17 In this Court both parties accepted, save in one respect on the part of the respondents, that Ansari was good law and did not ask this Court to reopen it. The issue is for what the judgment stands as authority. 
     
      
    18 The conclusions of Sweeney DCJ with respect to Ansari was: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown submitted that the  
        Ansari 
         decision is not limited to its facts, did not turn on the Crown relying on intention to prove recklessness and that both Simpson J and Howie J said the Crown can charge a conspiracy to commit an offence the mental element of which is recklessness. 
        
       
       
        
        That is not how I read the decision. In my view the Court did not hold that a person can be charged with conspiring to commit an offence the mental element of which is recklessness, simpliciter. The Court held that that may be so when the Crown relies on intention or knowledge to prove the element of recklessness or where a third party is to commit the offence the object of the conspiracy, and neither is alleged here. 
        
       
       
        
        In this case the Crown said it had to prove the accused’s recklessness as to the money being the proceeds of crime at the time they intentionally entered the agreement and when they committed acts pursuant to the agreement as it continued. That would seem to produce conceptual difficulties of the kind adverted to by Simpson J. Perhaps those conceptual difficulties could be overcome by more reflection. 
        
       
       
        
        However, it seems to offend the longstanding principle of criminal liability that an accused must know of all the facts that would make his conduct criminal, to which Howie J referred and which he held had not been displaced by the Code.  
        
       
       
        
        Whatever the reasons, I am bound to follow the decision in  
        Ansari  
        and applying it as I understand it, it follows that the offence with which [RK] is charged in this indictment, on the case the Crown has presented, is bad at law or unknown to law. 
        
       
       
      The Judgment in  
      Ansari 
       
      
    19 In order to understand the applicability of the judgment in Ansari to the present case it is necessary to note that it was concerned with a conspiracy to commit a different offence. I have set out at [6] above, the two distinct offences as created by s 400.3(2) of the Commonwealth Criminal Code.  
     
      
    20 This case involves an offence A, concerned with money as proceeds of crime. Ansari involved an offence B, concerned with a risk that money would become an instrument of crime. That difference explains some of the language of the judgments in Ansari where the word “risk” is sometimes deployed as a reference to the particular charge, not to the fault element of recklessness. 
     
      
    21 Howie J referred to Churchill v Walton [1967] 2 AC 224; Johnson v Youden [1950] 1 KB 544; Kamara v Director of Public Prosecutions (UK) [1974] AC 104; Giorgianni v The Queen (1985) 156 CLR 473; Western Australia v Marchesi [2005] WASCA 133; (2005) 30 WAR 359, and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “[76] The situation at Common Law, therefore, is that there is no impediment to a person being charged with a conspiracy to commit an offence that is one of strict or absolute liability. However, in order to be guilty of the conspiracy to commit such an offence the person must agree to commit an act that is unlawful.  
        The person 
         does not have to know that the act is unlawful but  
        needs to know all the facts that make the act unlawful 
        . If a person can conspire to commit a crime for which no mens rea is necessary, there seems to be no good reason why a person could not conspire to commit a crime of which the mental element is recklessness.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    22 Howie J had earlier identified the relevant offence: 
     
      
       
        
        “[63] In my opinion there is only one physical element in the offence as stated in s 11.5(1). The physical element is encompassed in the words ‘conspires to commit an offence’. It is impossible to comprehend two people forming an agreement unless the subject matter of the agreement is known. A composite element of an offence has been recognised in offences to which the Code applies: see  
        Lee v R 
         [2007] NSWCCA 71 at [7]. The subject matter of the prohibited agreement under s 11.5(1) is an intention to commit an offence of the kind described in the section. Therefore s 11.5(1) contains a single physical element of conduct being to enter into the proscribed agreement. There is no fault element stated in s 11.5(1), therefore, applying s 5.6(1), the default fault element for a physical element of conduct is intention. Applying the definition of “intention” in s 5.2(1) of the Code, the person must mean to enter into such an agreement.” 
        
       
      
    23 His Honour subsequently referred to: 
     
      
       
        
        “[78] … the requirement of s 11.5(2)(b) that the accused and at least one other person ‘have intended that an offence would be committed pursuant to the agreement’. The accused must intend that conduct will be carried out that amounts to a criminal offence and he cannot have that intention if he does not  
        know all the facts that would make the intended conduct an offence 
        . It is not enough that he intends that conduct will be carried out that it so happens and by reason of facts of which he is unaware is criminal.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    24 In the passage primarily relied upon in the submissions on this appeal his Honour said, (emphasis added): 
     
      
       
        
        “[85] Generally speaking the issue that is raised in respect of conspiracy to commit an offence to which recklessness applies is one of proof of the guilty knowledge of the conspirator rather than the validity of the charge. A charge is not bad at common law on its face just because it alleges a conspiracy to commit a strict or absolute liability offence or an offence that could be committed recklessly. It would be rare for the statement of the offence to show on its face that the allegation was one that relied upon the accused’s being reckless as to a fact that was an element of the offence to which the conspiracy related. It should become apparent if particulars were required to be given indicating how it was alleged by the prosecution that the accused had agreed to commit the offence that is the subject of the conspiracy. Unless the prosecution was alleging that the accused had  
        sufficient knowledge of the facts making the conduct agreed upon a criminal offence 
        , it could not succeed on the charge of conspiracy. 
        
       
       
        
        [86] If at the end of the Crown case there was evidence proving  
        the requisite knowledge 
         then the trial judge would be required to direct the jury that, before they could convict the accused of the conspiracy alleged, they must find beyond reasonable doubt that  
        he had the knowledge of facts that made the intended conduct an offence 
         and hence the conspiracy a criminal one. 
        
       
       
        
        [87] In my opinion the conspiracy alleged in each of the charges was not bad at law. There is nothing in the Code that indicates that a person cannot conspire to commit an offence of which the mental element is recklessness and there is no reason otherwise to impose such a restriction on the offence. There are two reasons for reaching that conclusion. Firstly the agreement entered into may be that another person will carry out the conduct. Provided that the conspirators  
        know of all the facts that would make the conduct of the third party criminal 
        , it would not matter that the person carrying out the conduct was committing an offence by acting recklessly. 
        
       
       
        
        [88] Secondly  
        recklessness 
         under the Code  
        can be proved by both intention and knowledge. 
         Section 5.4(4) provides: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (4) If recklessness is a fault element for a physical element of an offence, proof of intention, knowledge or recklessness will satisfy that fault element. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Therefore, if the conspirators intended that they would carry out the conduct  
        knowing all the facts that made that conduct criminal 
         it would not matter that the offence arising from that conduct was one for which the fault element was recklessness. 
        
       
       
        
        [89] It is the second reason that applies in the present case. Provided that the Crown was intending to prove as against the appellants that  
        they knew that there was a risk that the money they dealt with would become an instrument of crime 
        , that is that  
        they knew of all the facts that made their dealing with the money criminal conduct 
        , there was no impediment to the prosecution proving the offences charged.” 
        
       
      
    25 His Honour reiterated the critical aspect of the Crown case in Ansari: 
     
      
       
        
        “[93] … It is clear … that the Crown was maintaining in relation to the appellants that it would prove that they were reckless as to the risk of the money being used as an instrument of crime  
        because the appellants intended 
          
        that it would be used 
         as an instrument of crime. The Crown was alleging that  
        they had knowledge that 
         the money with which they dealt … was at risk of being used as an instrument of crime  
        because they knew 
          
        it was money that would be used  
        in the commission of crime or to facilitate crime”. (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    26 In her judgment Simpson J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[9] Thus, where a person is charged under the  
        Code  
        with conspiracy, the Crown must, by s 11.5(2)(b), prove, inter alia, that the person charged and at least one other party to the agreement alleged intended that an offence (punishable by imprisonment for more than 12 months) would be committed pursuant to the agreement. It is of some significance that s 11.5(2)(b) (in contrast to s 11.5(1)) is framed in the passive voice; it is not necessary that the physical acts that make up the offence are intended to be or will be committed by any particular person. In particular, it is not necessary that they are intended to be, or will be, committed by any of the conspirators. Two people may, for example, agree to arrange the importation of prohibited drugs by using an unwitting agent, who is wholly unaware that he is carrying the drugs …” 
        
       
      
    27 Simpson J also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[19] As set out above, by s 400.3 of the  
        Code 
        , the fault (mental) element of the offence of money laundering may be intention, recklessness, or negligence. That state of mind must be shown to exist at the time of the ‘dealing’ alleged. An allegation of conspiracy to commit that offence where the fault element alleged is recklessness raises this question: whose state of mind is relevant for the purpose of determining recklessness? I am of the view that that person is the person who performs the physical acts that constitute the crime against s 400.3(2). That is: where A and B agree that an offence will be committed (at their behest) against s 400.3(2) by C, it is C’s state of mind that must be shown to be reckless: that is, reckless as to the fact that there is a risk that the money or property will be used in or to facilitate, the commission of a crime. The state of mind of the conspirators must (because of s 11.5(2)(b)), be intention – ie intention to agree that an offence against s 400.3(2) will be committed; and that offence may be constituted by the fault (mental) element of recklessness. But, because in this case it was alleged that the physical acts of the appellants in receiving the money constituted the physical element of the offence of money laundering, it is not necessary to consider the state of mind of any other person.  
        
       
       
        
        [20] But the manner in which the offences (of conspiracy) were pleaded and particularised produces this somewhat odd result: the appellants were charged with (intentionally) agreeing to commit an offence the fault element of which was recklessness – ie they agreed to deal in money, reckless as to whether the money would be used in, or to facilitate, the commission of a crime. 
        
       
       
        
        [21] Such a proposition is conceptually difficult to grasp. Logic, or a rational use of English language, would suggest that that cannot be done. But such resistance to the proposition fades when regard is had to the definition in the  
        Code  
        of ‘recklessness’, which gives the word an extended meaning.” 
        
       
      
    28 Her Honour’s reference to “an extended meaning” was a reference to s 5.4 which I have set out at [9] above and which her Honour said ‘defined’ the word “recklessness”. 
     
      
    29 Simpson J went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “[23] Recklessness, as I have already mentioned, was the state of mind necessary for the commission of the offence the object of the conspiracy – what I might call the subsidiary offence. The recklessness to which the indictment adverted was recklessness as to a circumstance in which conduct that constituted the s 400.3(2) offence was said to have occurred – the circumstance being the existence of a risk that the money would be used in, or to facilitate, the commission of a crime … To  
        prove the conspiracy the Crown had to prove that the appellants agreed to commit an offence aware of the relevant circumstance 
        . Where (as here) the circumstance is, itself, the existence of a risk, putting the language of s 400.3(2)(c) together with that of s 5.4(2)(a) produces a result that, at first glance, might appear odd, but which is not in reality, (for reasons which will appear) untoward. The result is this: the Crown had to prove that the appellants intentionally agreed that each would deal with money in the future, and that, at that future time each appellant  
        would be aware 
         that there then would be a substantial risk that there was a risk that the money would become an instrument of crime (ie would be used in, or to facilitate, the commission of an indictable offence), and (by sub-para (b)) that, having regard to the circumstances known to him, it was unjustifiable to take that risk. That is conceptually unacceptable. But it emerges only from the unextended meaning of ‘recklessness’.  
        To prove recklessness 
        , by reason of s 5.4(4) the Crown could also prove either that the appellants intended or knew  
        that the money would become an instrument of crime 
        .  
        That is, in fact, what the Crown here set out to do 
        .” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    30 Simpson J referred to the Crown case under consideration: 
     
      
       
        
        “[28] … It is inherent in the manner in which the charges were framed, and the sub-section under which they were brought, that the Crown was alleging that the appellants were reckless as to the fact that there was a risk that the money deposited would be used in the commission of, or to facilitate, the commission of that crime or in the commission of a tax evasion offence. Bearing in mind the provisions of sub-ss 5.4(2) and (4), it was open to the Crown to prove recklessness either by proving that  
        the appellants were aware that there was a substantial risk that the money would be used  
        in that way, and that, having regard to the circumstances known to them, it was unjustifiable to take that risk  
        OR 
         that  
        they either intended or knew that the money would be used 
         in that way. Although it was not necessary that the Crown prove that the appellants (or either of them) themselves physically dealt with the money, it was admitted by them that, in receiving the money from Z, they did so. (As indicated above, the Crown case was, in fact, that the appellants  
        both knew and intended that the money would be used 
         in that way.)” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    31 Her Honour referred to the necessity to prove an intention to enter into the agreement and added: 
     
      
       
        
        “[32] … On behalf of the appellants heavy reliance was placed upon the provisions of s 11.5(2)(b), requiring, for proof of the offence of conspiracy, proof that at least two individuals intended that an offence would be committed pursuant to their agreement. That is a different intention. There is no reason why that intention does not extend to an intention that an offence against s 400.3(2) would be committed – that is, an offence constituted by dealing in money/property where there existed a risk that the money/property would become an instrument of crime, and where the person who committed that crime would be reckless as to the fact of that risk – that is, would be aware of a substantial risk that the money would be used in structured transactions, avoiding the provisions of the  
        FTR Act  
        (or tax evasion), and that, having regard to the circumstances known, it is unjustifiable to take that risk; or knew or intended that it would be so used. 
        
       
       
        
        [33] The argument advanced on behalf of the appellants wholly fails to take into account the extended definition of ‘recklessness’ contained in s 5.4(4). Where recklessness may be proved by intention or knowledge, any colour of validity that might otherwise be given to the argument disappears altogether. And  
        both knowledge and intention were what the Crown here set out to prove 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        [34] The flaw in the appellants’ argument is in failing to identify who the Crown alleged was (or would have been) ‘reckless’ and to what aspect of the facts alleged the recklessness attaches. The appellants’ argument attributes recklessness to themselves, in the formation of, or entry into, the criminal agreement. I accept that recklessness is insufficient for that. But that is not the correct analysis. It is not recklessness as to the agreement that is in question; it is agreement (intentionally entered into) that an offence will be committed that might, inter alia, be done with a reckless state of mind. The recklessness attaches, not to the formation of, or the entry into, the agreement, but to the offence that is to be committed pursuant to the agreement.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    32 The judgments in Ansari provide one example of a factual situation in which persons can conspire to commit an offence with respect to which recklessness is the fault element attached to a physical element of the offence. I refer to a situation in which the physical element is to be carried out by a person who is not party to the agreement. 
     
      
    33 As Howie J said at [87], set out at [24] being the first of two examples his Honour gave, to repeat: 
     
      
       
        
        “Provided that the conspirators know of all the facts that would make the conduct of the third party criminal, it would not matter that the person carrying out the conduct was committing an offence by acting recklessly.” 
        
       
      
    34 This reasoning is to the same effect as the observations of Simpson J at [19], set out at [27] above, that the relevant state of mind of recklessness is the state of mind of “the person who performs the physical acts that constitute the crime against s 400.3(2)”. 
     
      
    35 In Ansari this example did not apply because, as in the present case, it was the accused who, it was alleged, dealt with the money.  
     
      
    36 The judgments in Ansari focused on s 5.4(4), which I have set out at [9], to the effect that where recklessness is a fault element it can be established by proof of intention or knowledge as well as by proof of recklessness. 
     
      
    37 Section 5.4(4) is based on the reasonable proposition that a lower level of culpability can be made out by proving a higher level of culpability.  
     
      
    38 As the Final Report of the Model Criminal Code Officers’ Committee entitled Model Criminal Code Chapter 2: General Principles of Criminal Responsibility (1992) (“the MCCOC Report”) made clear at [203.3], the authors of what became s 5.4 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code relied on the US Model Penal Code. That Code relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “2.02(5) When the law provides that negligence suffices to establish an element of an offense, such element also is established if a person acts purposely, knowingly or recklessly. When acting recklessness suffices to establish an element, such element is established if a person acts purposely or knowingly. When acting knowingly suffices to establish an element, such element also is established if a person acts purposely.” 
        
       
      
    39 As the Explanatory Note to this provision states: 
     
      
       
        
        “Subsection (5) makes it unnecessary to state in the definition of an offense that the defendant can be convicted if it is proved that he was  
        more 
         culpable than the definition of the offense requires. Thus, if the crime can be committed recklessly, it is no less committed if the actor acted purposely.” (See  
        Uniform Laws Annotated - Volume 10A: Model Penal Code 
        , West Group, 2001 p96.)  
        
       
      
    40 Similarly, s 5.4 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code makes it unnecessary to state on each occasion that a person may be convicted of an offence containing a physical element for which the fault element is recklessness if s/he is more culpable than that ie, because s/he intended or knew of that element. 
     
      
    41 In Ansari, Simpson J referred to s 5.4(4) as definitional. (See eg her Honour’s reference to “definition” and “extended meaning” at [21] and [23] set out at [27] and [29] above.) In my opinion it is more appropriate to characterise the section as evidentiary, rather than definitional.  
     
      
       
      The Common Law Position 
       
      
    42 As I have indicated at [21] above, in Ansari Howie J referred to common law cases on conspiracy for guidance with respect to the offence under s 11.5 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code.  
     
      
    43 I repeat my observations on the law in Baladjam v R [2008] NSWCCA 85 in this respect, because that judgment will not be publicly available until the conclusion of that lengthy trial. 
     
      
    44 The general approach to interpretation of a Code is well established. As Windeyer J put it in Vallance v The Queen (1961) 108 CLR 56 at 75: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Code is to be read without any preconception that any particular provision has or has not altered the law.” 
        
       
      
    45 Nevertheless, there are circumstances in which the interpretation of a Code which, like any other statute, must involve reference to the full context of the specific provision that falls to be interpreted. This extends to the legal history of the particular provision and of the terminology in which it has been expressed. 
     
      
    46 In Stuart v The Queen (1974) 134 CLR 426 at 437, Gibbs J rejected the proposition that “it is never necessary to resort to the common law for the purpose of aiding in the construction of a Code” and added: 
     
      
       
        
        “it may be justifiable to turn back to the common law where the Code contains provisions of doubtful import, or uses language which had previously acquired a technical meaning, or on some such special ground.” 
        
       
       
      (See also  
      Bank of England v Vagliano Brothers  
      [1891] AC 107 at 145;  
      The Queen v Barlow  
      [1997] HCA 18; (1997) 188 CLR 1 at 19; and  
      Sungravure Pty Ltd v Middle East Airlines Airliban SAL  
      (1975) 134 CLR 1 at 22.) 
       
      
    47 In my opinion, the references to “conspiracy” in the Code are of a technical legal character for purposes of the application of these principles. The terminology which the drafters of the code used were words and phrases which had well established legal meanings. Generally, the legal meanings did not differ from dictionary meanings. As Windeyer J put it in Vallance at 75: 
     
      
       
        
        “Law may define the forbidden conduct more fully and more precisely than in common speech is ordinarily necessary; but it does not define it differently.” 
        
       
      
    48 His Honour went on to give an example: 
     
      
       
        
        “[The Code] does not define ‘maim’, but that word is used in it. In ordinary speech it means a crippling injury, such as the loss of a limb. The meaning is the same for law, but the specific test by which early law distinguished [maim] from lesser injuries was by asking whether the harm would make a man less able for fighting. The test produced some strange decisions. That is an illustration of the meaning of a word in the Code being fixed by the common law.” 
        
       
      
    49 In my opinion, the references to “conspiracy” in the Code were also intended by the drafters of the Code to be “fixed by the common law”, subject to any express statutory modification (cf R v Wyles; Ex parte Attorney-General (Qld) [1977] Qd R 169 at 177–182). The authors of the offence creating provision in s 11.5(1) adopted the terminology of the pre-existing Commonwealth offence in s 86 of the Crimes Act. That section was itself clearly derived from the common law and was not subject to the special rules for interpreting a code. 
     
      
    50 Furthermore, it is clear from the full text of s 11.5 that the authors of the conspiracy provisions of the Code paid careful attention to the pre-existing common law and to debates about the appropriateness of laying a charge of conspiracy, in lieu of substantive offences. That appears most clearly from the identification of the particular requirements of a finding of guilt of a charge of conspiracy set out in subss 11.5(2), (3), (4) and (5). Like the general discretion introduced in subs (6), these matters reflect decisions and debates that have occurred about the application of the crime of conspiracy at common law.  
     
      
    51 I am reinforced in this conclusion by the MCCOC Report, on which s 11.5 is clearly based. That Report identifies the need for such an offence and its detail by reference to the case law and debate about the crime of conspiracy at common law. (See MCCOC Report at [405] pp96ff.) It indicates that the offence of conspiracy under the Code was intended to implement the common law, save in identified respects. (See Ansari at [64]-[66].)  
     
      
    52 This conclusion is quite unsurprising. Conspiracy offences in those States with a criminal Code have frequently been interpreted by reference to common law principles. Accordingly, the texts on the Queensland and Western Australian Codes frequently invoke common law cases to explain the code provisions. (See eg LexisNexis Butterworths, Carter’s Criminal Law of Queensland, vol 1 (at Services 75 and 64) at [s 541.20]–[s 541.55]; LexisNexis Butterworths, Criminal Law Western Australia, vol 1 (at Services 102 and 96) at [s 558.5]–[s 558.35].) In this respect the texts reflect the case law in the Code States. 
     
      
    53 I agree with Howie J at [76], set out at [21] above, that it is possible at common law for persons to conspire to commit a crime of which the mental element is recklessness. I also agree that there is no reason why that cannot be true under the Commonwealth Criminal Code. Such an offence will, however, be rare. 
     
      
    54 As one author has said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is unsurprising that conspiring to commit an offence of recklessness has not been considered by the courts. For one thing, there are relatively few offences of recklessness (including offences of intention which can in the alternative be committed recklessly, such as murder and rape). Secondly, given its nature – a premeditated agreement to commit a crime – it is unlikely in practice that two persons would conspire to commit an offence of recklessness, let alone a series of them. However, the distant possibility should not be precluded, or at least the possibility of incriminating in conspiracy persons who agree to commit an act which is criminal and is of a risk-producing character should not be precluded. As a minimum these persons should not be incriminated unless they agree to commit, and thus have the intent to commit the conduct creating the risk of harm, with the same degree of knowledge of risk as would be required of the perpetrator of it by the mens rea element of the substantive crime of recklessness represented by it, as a basis for incriminating the latter in the substantive crime.” (Peter Gillies,  
        The Law of Criminal Conspiracy  
        (2nd ed) Federation Press, Sydney (1990) at 101.) 
        
       
       
      The Position under the Code 
       
      
    55 The critical aspect of the common law offence of conspiracy to commit an offence, that is picked up by the Commonwealth Criminal Code, is that an accused must know the facts that make the act or acts unlawful. This was Howie J’s conclusion at [76] and was based on the authorities to which his Honour referred. The emphasised passages in the Ansari judgments, which I have set out at [21], [23], [24], [25], [29], [30] and [31], all indicate the basic significance of this requirement in the reasoning of that case. 
     
      
    56 The reason why this must be so is that the mere intention to enter into an agreement is an intention without a moral component of any character. It is the subject matter of the agreement where the moral culpability required for a criminal offence must be identified. In the case of the crime of conspiracy to commit an offence, the requisite moral culpability cannot exist unless the accused knows the facts that make the conduct unlawful. 
     
      
    57 Amongst the authorities to which Howie J referred, it is sufficient to quote the joint judgement of Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ in Giorgianni, a case concerned with a charge of aiding and abetting. However, their Honours referred to conspiracy as being equivalent in the relevant respect. Their Honours had said with respect to aiding and abetting at 505: 
     
      
       
        
        “The necessary intent is absent if the person alleged to be a secondary participant lacks knowledge that the principal offender is doing something or is about to do something which amounts to an offence.” 
        
       
      
    58 After referring to the equivalence between conspiracy and aiding and abetting, their Honours added at 506-507: 
     
      
       
        
        “The necessary intent is absent if the person alleged to be a secondary participant does not know or believe that what he is assisting or encouraging is something which goes to make up the facts which constitute the commission of the relevant criminal offence. He need not recognise the criminal offence as such, but his participation must be intentionally aimed at the commission of the acts which constitute it … Intent is required and it is an intent which must be based upon knowledge or belief of the necessary facts.” 
        
       
      
    59 I agree with Howie J that this reasoning is applicable to s 11.5(1) of the Commonwealth Criminal Code. 
     
      
    60 The words “to commit an offence” in s 11.5(1) and the words “intended that an offence would be committed” in s 11.5(2)(b) should be interpreted in accordance with the common law position discussed above. A person cannot be found guilty of an offence under s 11.5(1) unless s/he knows the facts that make the act or acts unlawful. 
     
      
    61 The observations of Howie J at [78], set out at [23] above, apply to an offence against s 11.5(1): 
     
      
       
        
        “The accused must intend that conduct will be carried out that amounts to a criminal offence and he cannot have that intention if he does not know all the facts that would make the intended conduct an offence.” 
        
       
      
    62 His Honour’s observations at [85], set out at [24] above, also apply: 
     
      
       
        
        “Unless the prosecution was alleging that the accused had sufficient knowledge of the facts making the conduct agreed upon a criminal offence, it could not succeed on the charge of conspiracy.” 
        
       
       
      The Application of  
      Ansari 
       
      
    63 In the passages at [88], [89] and [93] in the judgment of Howie J, which I have set out at [24] and [25] above, his Honour emphasised that the Crown case in Ansari was that the accused actually did know all of the facts that made the conduct criminal.  
     
      
    64 To the same effect are the observations of Simpson J who concluded at [23], set out at [29], that: 
     
      
       
        
        “To prove recklessness, by reason of s 5.4(4) the Crown could also prove either that the appellants intended or knew that the money would become an instrument of crime. That is, in fact, what the Crown here set out to do.” 
        
       
       
      See also her Honour’s observations at [33] set out at [31] above. 
       
      
    65 It is of significance that in Ansari the Court was concerned with the second of the two kinds of money laundering offences ie whether there was “a risk that money or property will become an instrument of crime”, to which I have referred at [13] above as an offence B. The present case involves an offence A: namely that the money or property is proceeds of crime. By reason of the inclusion of the word “risk” in an offence B it is necessary to adapt the language of the judgments in Ansari for present purposes. 
     
      
    66 To adapt the language of [89] from the judgment of Howie J, set out at [24] above, to the present case, it would read: 
     
      
       
        
        “Provided the Crown was intending to prove as against the appellants that they knew that the money is proceeds of crime that is that they knew all of the facts that made their dealing with the money criminal conduct, there was no impediment to the prosecution proving the offence as charged.” 
        
       
      
    67 Similarly the reasons of Simpson J at [28], set out at [30] above, would read: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … It was open to the Crown to prove recklessness either by proving that the appellants were aware that there was a substantial risk that the money was proceeds of crime …  
        OR 
         that they either intended or knew that the money was proceeds of crime.” 
        
       
      
    68 So understood the reasoning in Ansari is not applicable to the present case for the reasons identified by Sweeney DCJ. (See [18] above.)  
     
      
    69 It is not the Crown case that either of the accused knew that the money was proceeds of crime. As the Crown emphasised in its submissions in this Court the Crown case was that the appellants were reckless as to the fact whether the money was proceeds of crime. That allegation may have supported a substantive offence under s 400.3(2). It cannot support a charge of conspiracy where, in order to satisfy the test of intention with respect to the entry into an agreement to commit an offence, the accused must know the facts that constitute the offence. 
     
      
    70 Sweeney DCJ correctly distinguished Ansari. Her Honour correctly concluded that the Crown case disclosed no offence known to the law.  
     
      
       
      The Order 
       
      
    71 The appellant Crown also submitted that her Honour erred in making an order directing a verdict of acquittal. It was submitted that the outcome of her Honour’s conclusion should have been an order to quash the indictment. The Crown submitted that it was not the evidence that was found wanting, but rather the charge itself that was deemed bad. 
     
      
    72 I have set out at [24] par [85] of the judgment of Howie J which states that the charge would not itself be bad merely because it alleges a conspiracy to commit an offence that could be committed recklessly. Indeed, in the present case there is nothing on the face of the indictment that states that it was the accused who were reckless as to the fact that the money was the proceeds of crime. However, the particulars provided, the evidence adduced and the submissions made did identify the case as being of that character. 
     
      
    73 On the above analysis it was not the indictment that was bad but the particulars provided and evidence adduced that indicated that the Crown case could not succeed. 
     
      
    74 I have set out at [18] above, Sweeney DCJ’s conclusion which, to repeat, was that “the offence … charged in this indictment, on the case the Crown has presented, is bad at law or unknown to the law”. (emphasis added) 
     
      
    75 In these circumstances it was open to her Honour to direct a verdict of acquittal rather than to quash the indictment. 
     
      
    76 It is unnecessary to deal with the respondents’ contentions which challenged the applicability and validity of s 107 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001.  
     
      
    77 The appeal should be dismissed.

      JUDGMENT: On first defendant’s notice of motion for stay of proceedings 
       
      
    1 SIMPSON J: Ninety-two separate proceedings are before the Court. Each was commenced by summons filed either in 2007 or 2008 by Ms Christine Tumney (“the Prosecutor”), an authorised officer of the NSW Food Authority. Three separate defendants are named: Nutricia Australia Pty Ltd (“Nutricia”), Michael Speare Hocken Sharpe, and Toni Lee Brendish. The two individual defendants are and were at all material times directors of Nutricia. 
     
      
    2 In each summons the Prosecutor claims an order that the named defendants appear before the Court to be dealt with in respect of an offence alleged to have been committed against the Food Act 2003. By s 118 of the Food Act such proceedings are to be before the court exercising its summary jurisdiction. Procedure is governed by Chapter 4, Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 
     
      
    3 By notice of motion filed on 3 September 2008 Nutricia seeks a permanent stay of each summons, or, alternatively, that all charges against it be quashed. Although they have not filed any similar notice of motion, the two individual defendants seek orders of a similar kind. They largely relied upon the arguments advanced on behalf of Nutricia.  
     
      
    4 The charges are brought under three different subsections of the Food Act: s 18(3), s 21(2) and s 21(3). 
     
      
    5 S 18(3) is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “18.  
        Misleading conduct relating to sale of food  
        
       
       
        
        (1) … 
        
       
       
        
        (2) … 
        
       
       
        
        (3) A person must not, in the course of carrying on a food business, sell food that is packaged or labelled in a way that falsely describes the food.” 
        
       
      
    6 A note to the subsection directs attention to s 22 which gives examples of food that is falsely described. One such example is: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) The food is represented as being of a particular nature or substance for which there is a prescribed standard under the Food Standards Code and the food does not comply with that prescribed standard 
          
        …” 
        
       
      
    7 S 21 provides, relevantly: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A person must comply with any requirement imposed on the person by a provision of the Food Standards Code in relation to the conduct of a food business or to food intended for sale or food for sale. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) A person must not sell any food that does not comply with a requirement of the Food Standards Code 
          
        that relates to the food. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) A person must not sell or advertise for sale any food that is packaged or labelled in a manner that contravenes a provision of the Food Standards Code. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) … 
        
       
       
        
        (5) …” 
        
       
      
    8 For the purpose of the present proceedings it was not in issue that Nutricia and the two individual defendants carried on a food business and sold food.  
     
      
    9 The “Food Standards Code” referred to in the legislation is the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code.  The Food Act adopts the definition given to the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code (hereinafter called “the Code”) that appears in the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act 1991 (Cth). The Code is a national Code promulgating detailed standards in respect of the production, sale and importation of food, devised under a co-operative arrangement between the governments of Australia and New Zealand and, in NSW, given the force of law by the Food Act (s 21).  
     
      
    10 The charges against Nutricia and the two individual defendants may be variously categorised into groups, to which it will be necessary to return. For now, it is convenient to outline, as briefly as possible, the background. 
     
      
       
      Background 
       
      
    11 Nutricia is an Australian company that manufactures and supplies, inter alia, infant formula products. These include a product marketed as Karicare Gold Plus. Karicare Gold Plus is manufactured in three forms, an “infant formula” (for babies up to six months), a “follow on formula” (for babies between six months and twelve months) and a “toddler supplement” (for children one to three years). The product is marketed and supplied in cans. Except where it is necessary to differentiate, I will refer to the products as “Karicare”. 
     
      
    12 Two components of Karicare are fructo-oligosaccharides and galacto-oligosaccharides. These substances are commonly referred to, respectively, as “FOS” and “GOS”. I will adopt those abbreviations. FOS is also known as inulin. It is the inclusion of FOS and GOS in all three forms of Karicare that gives rise to twenty-five charges under s 21(2). 
     
      
    13 It is the Prosecutor’s case that the products were packaged and labelled in such a way as to represent that they were of a particular nature or substance, and that this amounted to a false description of the food. This gives rise to the charges against s 18(3). 
     
      
    14 It is further the Prosecutor’s case that the products carry labels that contravene two different provisions of the Code. This gives rise to the charges under s 21(3).  
     
      
    15 Finally, the Prosecutor alleges that energy content (which is required to be stated on labels of the containers in which the product is sold) were, in contravention of a specific requirement of the Code, miscalculated. This gives rise to a further fifteen charges under s 21(2). 
     
      
    16 I will outline in more detail below the factual matters relevant to the issues for present determination. 
     
      
       
      The Food Standards Code 
       
      
    17 I begin with an overview of the Code.  
     
      
    18 The Code is divided into sections, each of which is a numbered “Standard”, and prescribes the requirements applicable to the particular subject matter with which it deals. For example, St 1.2.8 deals with Nutrition Information Requirements. St 1.3.1 deals with Food Additives. Occurring throughout the Code are “editorial notes”. By St 1.1.1, cl 5, the editorial notes are not legally binding. 
     
      
    19 The first Standard is St 1.1.1, which is headed “Preliminary Provisions – Application, Interpretation and General Prohibitions”. St 1.1.1 opens, as do all succeeding Standards, with a statement of its purpose. That statement is, as will become apparent, of some importance. The purpose of St 1.1.1 is stated as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “This Standard sets out preliminary provisions which apply generally to the  
        Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code 
        . General application and interpretation provisions are contained in this Standard. Application and interpretation provisions specific to individual food standards are to be found in those specific standards.  
        
       
       
        
        This Standard should always be consulted as a starting point in the use of the Code because it regulates the general operation of the Code in its entirety. Many definitions which have general application to the Code are contained in this Standard 
        .” (italics added) 
        
       
      
    20 In cl 2, St 1.1.1 sets out a number of definitions which are to be applied to words and phrases used throughout the Code “unless expressly defined elsewhere” in the Code. The following are relevant for present purposes: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        component 
         means any substance including a food additive used in the preparation of an ingredient and present in the final product in a primary or modified form;  
        
       
       
        
        nutritive substance  
        means a substance not normally consumed as a food in itself and not normally used as an ingredient of food, but which, after extraction and/or refinement, or synthesis, is intentionally added to a food to achieve a nutritional purpose, and includes vitamins, minerals, amino acids, electrolytes and nucleotides; 
        
       
       
        
        prescribed name 
         means a name by which a food is defined or described in a Standard, and is declared in this Code to be a prescribed name.” 
        
       
      
    21 Interestingly enough, although the entire focus of the Code is on the regulation of production, sale and supply of food and food products, there is no definition of “food”. That word is extensively defined in the Food Act, and, in very similar terms, in the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act 1991 (Cth), s 5. All parties proceeded on the basis that, to the extent that “food” requires definition, the definition contained in the Commonwealth Act ought to be applied. I disagree with this approach. There is nothing in the Code that adopts or incorporates either definition, and nothing of which I am aware in the rules of statutory construction that would allow recourse to either of those Acts to fill any gap in the Code. I will proceed on the basis that “food”, being undefined, has the meaning it has in ordinary language. 
     
      
    22 Cl 3 of St 1.1.1 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “A reference in this Code to the nature, substance, composition, strength, weight, volume, quantity, purity or quality of any food, article, ingredient or component is the prescribed standard for that food, article, ingredient or component.” 
        
       
      
    23 Cl 9 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “9.  
        Prohibition on addition of nutritive substances to food 
        
       
       
        
        Nutritive substances must not be added to food unless expressly permitted in this Code.”  
        
       
      
    24 St 1.1A.2 is headed “Transitional Standards – Health Claims”. 
     
      
       
      “Health claim” is another term not defined in the Code, although it features significantly in the present proceedings.  
       
      
    25 Sub cll (3)(a), (b), (e) and (f) are in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(3)(a) Save where otherwise expressly prescribed by this Code, any label on or attached to a package containing or any advertisement for food shall not include a claim for therapeutic or prophylactic action or a claim described by words of similar import. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Any label on or attached to a package containing or an advertisement for a food shall not include the word ‘health’ or any word or words of similar import as a part of or in conjunction with the name of the food. 
        
       
       
        
        (e) Subject to subclauses (3)(f), (g) and (h), a food listed in column 1 of the Table to this subclause may have a health claim listed in column 3 of the Table made in respect of that food, provided that the food meets the relevant eligibility criteria in column 2 of the Table. 
        
       
       
      [The Table referred to in cl (3)(e) contains a list of foods, eligibility criteria, and the health claims permitted to be made. It is of no further relevance.] 
       
       
        
        (f) A health claim must not be made in respect of the following foods -  
        
       
       
        
        (i) … 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) food standardised in Standards 2.9.1, 2.9.2 and 2.9.4 of this Code; and  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (iii) … 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) … “ 
        
       
       
      [St 2.9.1 standardises Infant Formula Products.] 
       
      
    26 St 1.3.1 is concerned with “Food Additives”. In the introductory statement of the purpose of the Standard, “food additive” is defined as: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … any substance not normally consumed as a food in itself and not normally used as an ingredient of food, but which is intentionally added to a food to achieve one or more of the technological functions specified in Schedule 5. … Food additives are distinguishable from processing aids (see Standard 1.3.3) and vitamins and minerals added to food for nutritional purposes (see Standard 1.3.2). 
        
       
       
        
        This Standard regulates the use of food additives in the production and processing of food. A food additive may only be added to food where expressly permitted in this Standard. Additives can only be added to food in order to achieve an identified technological function according to Good Manufacturing Practice.” 
        
       
      
    27 This definition of “food additive” (which is to be found, not in the interpretation clause, but in the “Purpose” statement) is, to a point, a repetition of the definition of “nutritive substance” with the exception of the recognised purpose of the addition of the substance. A “nutritive substance” is a substance (having the (negative) characteristics mentioned in the definition) which is added for a “nutritional purpose”. A “food additive” is a substance (having the same (negative) characteristics) which is added to achieve a “technological function”. Schedule 5 of St 1.3.1 identifies the technological functions that are performed by food additives. They have nothing to do with the present case. 
     
      
    28 Schedule 1 of St 1.3.1 prescribes the maximum permitted levels of food additives, set out by “food type”. Schedule 1 contains both general provisions and specific provisions relating to particular kinds of foods – for example, Dairy Products, Ice Cream and Edible Ices, and others. Relevantly for present purposes, it contains a section specifically referable to “Foods Intended for Particular Dietary Uses” (cl 13), of which one subclause is devoted to “Infant Formula Products”, another to “Food for Infants”, and a third to “Formula Meal Replacement and Formulated Supplementary Foods” which, I was told, is a reference to “toddler formula”. There is in this Standard no definition of “infant formula products”, “food for infants” or “formulated meal replacement” or “formulated supplementary foods”. 
     
      
    29 St 1.5.1 deals with “Novel Foods”. “Novel food” is defined to mean: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … a non-traditional food and the food requires an assessment of the public health and safety considerations having regard to - 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the potential for adverse effects in humans; or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the composition or structure of the food; or 
        
       
       
        
        (c) the process by which the food has been prepared; or 
        
       
       
        
        (d) the source from which it is derived; or 
        
       
       
        
        (e) patterns and levels of consumption of the food; or 
        
       
       
        
        (f) any other relevant matters.” 
        
       
       
      “Non-traditional food” is defined to mean: 
       
       
        
        (a) a food that does not have a history of human consumption in Australia or New Zealand; or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) a substance derived from a food, where that substance does not have a history of human consumption in Australia or New Zealand other than as a component of that food; or 
        
       
       
        
        (c) any other substance, where that substance, or the source from which it is derived, does not have a history of human consumption as a food in Australia or New Zealand.” 
        
       
      
    30 St 2.9 regulates “Special Purpose Foods”. St 2.9.1 regulates “Infant Formula Products”. 
     
      
    31 Under “Purpose”, “infant formula products” are identified as: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … foods intended or represented for use as a substitute for breast milk …” 
        
       
       
      The “Purpose” statement of St 2.9.1 also directs attention to St 1.1.1 and St 1.3.1 (to which I have already referred), and to other Standards of which it is not now necessary to make mention. 
       
      
    32 In Subdivision 1 of Division 1 of this Standard, “infant formula product” is further defined (for the purposes of the Code as a whole – see the introductory words of cl 1(2)) as: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … a product based on milk or other edible food constituents of animal or plant origin which is nutritionally adequate to serve as the principal liquid source of nourishment for infants.” 
        
       
       
      “Infant formula” is here defined to mean: 
       
       
        
        “ … an infant formula product represented as a breast milk substitute for infants and which satisfies the nutritional requirements of infants aged up to four to six months.” 
        
       
       
      (“Infant” is a person under the age of twelve months.) 
       
       
      “Follow on formula” is defined as: 
       
       
        
        “An infant formula product represented as either a breast milk substitute or replacement for infant formula and which constitutes the principal liquid source of nourishment in a progressively diversified diet for infants aged from six months.” 
        
       
       
      An editorial note states: 
       
       
        
        “The intent of this definition is to limit the addition of ingredients to infant formula products to ingredients that would be considered to be foods. The addition of an ingredient that is not considered to be a food is prohibited unless specifically permitted elsewhere in this Standard. 
        
       
       
        
        …” 
        
       
      
    33 Cl 3 prescribes the method of calculation of the energy content of infant formula product. It is not necessary here to set it out. It specifies what energy value contribution or factors may be taken into account in the calculation of energy in value. The calculation is important, because cl 16 requires that labels on infant formula products contain certain information, including the average energy content expressed in kilojoules per 100 millilitres. 
     
      
    34 By cl 12, “infant formula” and “follow on formula” are prescribed names. 
     
      
    35 Subdivision 3 is concerned with “General Compositional Requirements”. Cl 6(1) is of central importance to the present proceedings. Under the heading “Restrictions and Prohibitions”, it provides: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) A vitamin, mineral, food additive or  
        nutritive substance 
         must not be added to infant formula product unless - 
        
       
       
        
          
        (a) expressly permitted by this Code; or 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) it is naturally present in an ingredient of the infant formula product. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) …” (italics added) 
        
       
      
    36 Cl 7 is headed “Permitted Nutritive Substances” and contains a Table showing nutritive substances that may be added to infant formula product if prescribed conditions are met. It includes a series of substances known as “nucleotides”. It does not include FOS or GOS. 
     
      
    37 Some relevant terminology is not defined in the Code. This includes – 
     
      
       
        
         nutritive purpose 
        
       
       
        
         ingredient 
        
       
       
        
         health claim 
        
       
       
        
         food 
        
       
       
        
         normally consumed 
        
       
       
        
         therapeutic claim 
        
       
       
        
         prophylactic claim 
        
       
       
        
         therapeutic or prophylactic claim. 
        
       
       
      The charges 
       
      
    38 The charges are as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (i) forty charges under s 21(2) (selling food that does not comply with a requirement of the Code), in two categories:- 
       
       
        
        (a) twenty-five charges alleging that, contrary to St 2.9.1 cl 6(1), FOS or GOS was added to infant formula and toddler formula (“ 
        the composition charges 
        ”); 
        
       
       
        
        (b) fifteen charges alleging that, contrary to St 2.9.1 cl 3, the energy value contributions were miscalculated (“ 
        the energy content charges 
        ”); 
        
       
       
      (ii) fifteen charges under s 18(3) (selling food that is falsely labelled), alleging that the defendants sold food with labelling that falsely described the food. The description alleged to be false was that the content of the cans was “infant formula”, a prescribed name under the Code (St 2.9.1 cl 12), when, in fact, by reason of the addition of FOS and GOS, the content was not of that description (“ 
      the false description charges 
      ”); 
       
       
      (iii) thirty-seven charges under s 21(3) (selling food labelled in a way that contravenes a provision of the Code), in two categories:- 
       
       
        
        (a) twenty-two charges alleging that, contrary to St 1.1A.2 cl 3(a), the defendants sold food with labelling that claimed therapeutic or prophylactic action (“ 
        the labelling charges – therapeutic or prophylactic action 
        ”); 
        
       
       
        
        (b) fifteen charges alleging that, contrary to St 1.1A.2(3)(f)(ii), the defendants sold food with labelling that made health claims (“ 
        the labelling charges – health claims 
        ”). 
        
       
      
    39 The composition charges were separately broken up into those concerning infant formula, follow on formula and toddler nutritional supplement. The distinction is of no present significance. The labelling charges were similarly sub-divided. There was a further differentiation in that some charges (the 2007 charges) related to sales to Woolworths, and the remainder (the 2008 charges) concerned sales to Coles. These also have no present relevance.  
     
      
    40 The two individual defendants were charged only in relation to the 2008, Coles, charges, and this also has no significance. By reason of s 122 of the Food Act, they were charged as directors. It seems that earlier legal advisors of the Prosecutor took a different view as to their liability, or the propriety of charging them, and they were not charged in relation to the Woolworths sales in 2007. 
     
      
       
      The notice of motion 
       
      
    41 As filed, Nutricia’s notice of motion merely claims orders, in the alternative, that the proceedings be permanently stayed, or that the charges the subject of the proceedings be quashed. Annexed to the notice of motion is a statement of the grounds on which it is based. Neither the written nor the oral argument entirely reflect what is there contended.  
     
      
    42 The statement of grounds is to the following effect: 
     
      
       
      (i)  
      the composition charges 
      :  
       
       
      The Prosecutor is unable to prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt because she cannot prove: 
       
       
       (a) that FOS [GOS] is a nutritive substance; 
       
       
        
        (b) (GOS charges only) that GOS is not naturally present in an ingredient of Karicare; 
        
       
       
      (ii)  
      the labelling charges 
      : 
       
       
      (a) the therapeutic or prophylactic action charges: 
       
       
        the Prosecutor cannot prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt because the words alleged to have been used do not and could not constitute a claim of therapeutic or prophylactic action; 
       
       
      (b) the health claim charges: 
       
       
        the Prosecutor cannot prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt because the words alleged do not and could not constitute a health claim; 
       
       
      (iii)  
      the false description charges: 
       
       
        the particulars do not disclose any words that falsely describe the food; 
       
       
        the Prosecutor cannot prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt because she cannot prove: 
       
       
        
        (a) that the defendant represented the food as being of a particular nature or substance for which there is a prescribed Standard under the Code; 
        
       
       
       (b) that FOS [GOS] is a nutritive substance; 
       
       
       (c) that GOS is not naturally present in an ingredient of Karicare; 
       
       
        
        (d) (in respect to certain of the charges) the particulars do not allege any representation at all; 
        
       
       
      (iv)  
      the energy content charges: 
       
       
        the charges as particularised do not allege a contravention of a requirement of the Code that relates to food; 
       
       
        the Prosecutor cannot prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt because she cannot prove that the defendants sold food that did not comply with the requirement of the Code that relates to the food. 
       
      
    43 Common to all charges is the further ground expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The charges are vexatious, oppressive and embarrassing because of their multiplicity and because other charges are brought in respect of the sale of the same item of food alleging a failure to comply with a requirement of the [Code].” 
        
       
       
      The Evidence 
       
      
    44 Just what evidentiary material was intended to be put before me on the stay application was never defined. I was provided with voluminous documentation – eleven lever arch folders – which, I was told, contained the prosecution brief (for the substantive proceedings). Much of the material was, so far as I could tell, scientific, medical or otherwise specialised material. But this material was never formally tendered on the stay application, and I am unable to regard it as evidentiary material to which I ought to have regard. Notwithstanding that, reference was at times made to parts of the contents of the folders. For the purpose of this application, another quantity of documentation was tendered on behalf of Nutricia, and became Exhibit A. This consisted of what was perceived (by Nutricia’s legal representative) to be such material, extracted from the prosecution brief, as was relevant to the stay application. There remained a considerable quantity of material to which no express reference was made by any party in the course of argument. I made it plain that I would not refer to any material to which I had not been specifically directed. This is for two reasons. Firstly, for a judge to base a decision on material to which no reference, and therefore no submissions, have been made, risks creating a denial of procedural fairness to one side or the other: the judge does not know what different complexion might have been placed upon that material if the parties had made submissions. Secondly, and this is of particular significance in the present case, to rely on some parts only of such a vast array of material is to risk error by selectiveness. I left it to the parties to draw my attention to what they contended to be the relevant material. 
     
      
    45 In order to facilitate an understanding of the way in which the Prosecutor puts her case, I was given a draft of the proposed prosecution opening, prepared for the substantive hearing. I was also provided with comprehensive written submissions on both sides. 
     
      
    46 Given the large number of charges, a selection was made of “lead” or sample charges, apparently representing the various categories of charges I have outlined above. I have not gone beyond these charges. 
     
      
    47 I turn now to deal with the issues named in relation to the four categories of charges. 
     
      
    48 There is nothing controversial or complex about the basis upon which the court will intervene to stay a criminal prosecution. It may properly do so where it would be an abuse of process for the prosecution to proceed. It is an abuse of process to proceed, inter alia, where there is no prospect that the prosecution will result in a conviction. See generally Jago v District Court of NSW [1989] HCA 46; 168 CLR 23; Walton v Gardiner [1993] HCA 77; 177 CLR 378; Rogers v R [1994] HCA 42; 181 CLR 251; Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34; 174 CLR 509. 
     
      
    49 As mentioned above, the case put in written and oral submissions was not coextensive with the grounds appended to the notice of motion. I will deal with the arguments as they were put, with particular emphasis on the written submissions. 
     
      
    50 In short, Nutricia’s position, as put in its written submissions, was: 
     
      
       
      The composition charges (s 21(2)); St 2.9.1 cl 6(1): 
       
      
    51 (i) the Prosecutor is unable to prove essential elements of the s 21(2) charges; there is therefore no prospect of a conviction and these charges are doomed to fail; 
     
      
       
      (ii) the 2007 charges are duplicitous; 
       
       
      (iii) the Prosecutor has failed to disclose relevant material. 
       
      
    52 As set out above, s 21(2) provides:  
     
      
       
        
        “A person must not sell any food that does not comply with a requirement of the  
        Food Standards Code  
        that relates to the food.” 
        
       
      
    53 The food was Karicare in its various forms. The requirement of the Code with which the Prosecutor alleges Karicare did not comply was that imposed by St 2.9.1, cl 6(1) – which prohibits the addition of a “nutritive substance” to infant formula product. The prohibition is subject to two exceptions; it is permissible to add a nutritive substance to infant formula where, either, it is expressly permitted by the Code, or it is naturally present in any ingredient of Karicare. The “nutritive substances” which the Prosecutor alleges were added are FOS and GOS. The defendants do not deny that both FOS and GOS were added to Karicare. For the prosecution to result in conviction on these charges, it is essential that the Prosecutor prove (in the FOS charges) that FOS is a nutritive substance, and (in the GOS charges) that GOS is a nutritive substance. If either is proved to be a nutritive substance, then it is also essential that the Prosecutor prove that neither of the exceptions for which cl 6(1) provides applies – that is, that the addition of FOS [GOS] to infant formula product is not expressly permitted by the Code and that FOS [GOS] is not naturally present in any ingredient of Karicare. It was common ground that the addition of neither FOS nor GOS to infant formula product is expressly permitted by the Code. It was not suggested by Nutricia that FOS is naturally present in any ingredient of Karicare. An issue arose whether GOS is naturally present in an ingredient of Karicare. 
     
      
    54 As framed and particularised, the composition charges involving the addition of FOS allege: 
     
      
       
      (i) that each defendant sold food (Karicare); 
       
       
      (ii) that Karicare is, within the meaning of the Code, an “infant formula product”; 
       
       
      (iii) that St 2.9.1 (including cl 6(1)) applies to regulate the sale of Karicare; 
       
       
      (iv) that, therefore, St 2.9.1 cl 6 prohibits the addition of FOS to Karicare unless its addition is expressly permitted by the Code or it is naturally present in an ingredient of Karicare; 
       
       
      (v) that FOS had been added to Karicare; 
       
       
      (vi) that FOS is,  
      within the meaning of St 2.9.1 cl 6(1) 
      , a nutritive substance; 
       
       
      (vii) that the Code does not expressly permit the addition of FOS to infant formula; 
       
       
      (viii) that FOS is not naturally present in an ingredient of Karicare. 
       
       
      Only (vi) is presently in issue. It is the key to the first ground taken by the defendants in support of this application for stay of these charges. 
       
      
    55 The composition charges involving the addition of GOS allege a parallel set of facts. In issue in those charges are (vi) that GOS is, within the meaning of St 2.9.1 cl 6(1), a nutritive substance and (viii) that GOS is not naturally present in an ingredient of Karicare. 
     
      
    56 Proof that FOS [GOS] is a nutritive substance entails proof of three facts, of which two are negative propositions, that: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) FOS [GOS] is a substance not normally consumed as a food in itself;  
        
       
       
      and 
       
       
        
        (b) FOS [GOS] is a substance not normally used as an ingredient of food; 
        
       
       
      and of the positive proposition that: 
       
       
        
        (c) FOS [GOS] is a substance which, after extraction, refinement or synthesis, is intentionally added to a food to achieve a nutritional purpose. 
        
       
      
    57 Nutricia denies that either FOS or GOS is a “nutritive substance”; at least, it argues, there is no evidence (and, indeed, such evidence as there is is to the contrary) either that FOS [GOS] is not normally consumed as a food in itself or that it is not normally used as an ingredient of food, and that therefore, the Prosecutor must fail in these charges. 
     
      
    58 In their written submissions, counsel for the Prosecutor concede: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … that inulin [FOS] is a permitted food ingredient in relation to the general food supply.” 
        
       
       
      This appears to be, if not a concession, then a recognition, that FOS is a substance normally used as an ingredient in food. If that is correct, FOS cannot be,  
      within the definition in St 1.1.1 
      , a nutritive substance. That would mean that the exceptions to cl 6(1) are irrelevant. (This is not the end of the argument. The words I have italicised in this paragraph and in item (vi) of para [53] are no mere verbiage. The question is not whether FOS [GOS] is a nutritive substance within the meaning of the definition in St 1.1.1, but whether it is a nutritive substance in the sense that that term is used in St 2.9.1 cl 6(1)). 
       
      
    59 The charges concerning the addition of GOS are framed and particularised similarly to the FOS charges, with one divergence. Where, in relation to the FOS charges, the Prosecutor merely asserts that FOS is not naturally present as an ingredient of Karicare, in relation to GOS, she alleges that it: 
     
      
       
        
        “… was not naturally present as an ingredient of the infant formula product but was a product made by enzymatic transformation of lactose to synthesise GOS, and as added, the synthesised GOS was present at a final concentration beyond that which occurs naturally.” 
        
       
       
      No concession or recognition that GOS is an ingredient in food was made. A different concession was made: 
       
       
        
        “ … that GOS may be present in trace quantities in the whey ingredient of infant formula products.” 
        
       
       
      This appears to be, if not a concession, then a recognition, that GOS is naturally present in an ingredient of Karicare. If that is correct, GOS cannot be,  
      within the definition in St 1.1.1 
      , a nutritive substance. That would mean that the exceptions to cl 6(1) are irrelevant. As with FOS, however, the Prosecutor advanced the same argument to avoid this result. 
       
        
       
      
    60 What the Prosecutor argued (in relation both to the FOS and the GOS charges) is that the words “nutritive substance” as used in St 2.9.1 cl 6(1) have a more specific meaning than the same words have as used in St 1.1.1. 
     
      
    61 Nutricia’s essential argument, in the case of the FOS charges, was that there was no evidence, and the Prosecutor is not able to produce or point to evidence, that FOS is a substance not normally consumed as a food in itself and is a substance not normally used as an ingredient of food. In the light of the concession, or recognition, noted above, the latter, at least, appears to be a powerful argument. If that is correct, the FOS charges must fail and it is an abuse of process for the prosecution to proceed. An additional argument, in relation to the GOS charges, was that the Prosecutor is not able to produce or point to evidence that GOS is not naturally present in an ingredient of Karicare and therefore cannot prove that the addition of GOS to Karicare is not within the second exception in cl 6(1). Nutricia relied upon the particularisation of the GOS charges, extracted above, that GOS is present in Karicare in a final concentration beyond that which occurs naturally, as an acceptance that it does indeed occur naturally in an ingredient of Karicare. That also appears to be a powerful argument, and, if it is correct, the GOS charges must fail and it is an abuse of process for the prosecution to proceed. 
     
      
    62 Nutricia’s argument is therefore, simply, that FOS and GOS cannot be proven to be nutritive substances; if they are not proven to be nutritive substances, their addition to Karicare is not prohibited by St 2.9.1 cl 6(1), and the exceptions there provided to the prohibition are immaterial. This is the principal area of dispute. 
     
      
    63 Should that argument fail, Nutricia would argue that the Prosecutor cannot produce or point to evidence that either is a substance that is: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … intentionally added to [Karicare] to achieve a nutritional purpose.” 
        
       
      
    64 If that is correct, neither can be shown to be a nutritive substance. Nutricia also argues, in the case of GOS, that the Prosecutor is unable to produce or point to evidence that GOS is not naturally present in an ingredient of Karicare in that it does not come within the second exception to cl 6(1). In the light of the concession extracted above, that proposition appears unanswerable. But the Prosecutor also seeks to avoid that result. I will return to that. 
     
      
    65 The disputed issues on a final hearing of the composition charges would be: 
     
      
       
      The FOS charges: 
       
       
        whether FOS is proved to be a substance not normally consumed as a food in itself; 
       
       
        whether FOS is proved to be a substance not normally used as an ingredient of food; 
       
       
        if both negatives are proved: whether FOS is proved to be a substance which, after extraction, refinement or synthesis, is intentionally added to food for a nutritional purpose;  
       
       
      The GOS charges: 
       
       
        whether GOS is proved to be a substance not normally consumed as a food in itself; 
       
       
        whether GOS is proved to be a substance not normally used as an ingredient of food; 
       
       
        if both negatives are proved: whether GOS is proved to be a substance which, after extraction, refinement or synthesis, is intentionally added to food for a nutritional purpose; 
       
       
        if all of the above are proved, whether GOS is proved to be a substance not naturally present in a (any) ingredient of Karicare. 
       
      
    66 The stay application (as will, if there is to be one, a substantive hearing) depends very largely upon the construction of various terms used in the Code. The Code is significantly lacking in definitions. I have already mentioned a number of relevant terms that are undefined. 
     
      
    67 For the purpose of the stay application, it is sufficient if the Prosecutor can point to any evidence, however slight, that tends to establish the relevant facts. It is not appropriate, on a stay application, to assess the weight of any individual item of evidence. 
     
      
       
      Interpretation 
       
      
    68 I digress to make some observations about the approach to the construction of the Code. It is not easy. The Code is, in my experience, an unusual breed of instrument, something of a hybrid. 
     
      
    69 Its aetiology is spelt out in a “Commentary” at its commencement. It was developed and maintained by “Food Standards Australia New Zealand”, which, as its name proclaims, is a joint instrumentality of Australia and New Zealand. So far as the Australian contribution is concerned, it is authorised by the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act 1991 (Cth). But enforcement and policing of food standards are within the constitutional realm of the states. For that reason, the Code is given the force of law by the Food Act of NSW.  
     
      
    70 Accordingly, in my view, (and contrary to the approach taken by all parties, who referred me to the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth)), construction of the Code falls to be determined by reference to NSW interpretation law. That is because it is given the force of law by a state Act, and this is a prosecution brought under state law, governed by rules of evidence and interpretation of NSW law.  
     
      
    71 In construing the Code, it seems to me to be appropriate to bear in mind that, while it has legal force, it is a document drafted, apparently, by non-lawyers. That being so, it may be appropriate to take a more liberal, or more purposive, approach to its construction. 
     
      
    72 I was told, however, that it is a “legislative instrument” within the meaning of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 (Cth). The Legislative Instruments Act has this relevance – and, it seems to me, this relevance only. It shows the extent, if any, to which, as a draft, the Code came under the scrutiny and supervision of those skilled in parliamentary drafting techniques. That is relevant to the degree of liberality that might be brought to bear on the construction questions. 
     
      
    73 In response to my questions about these circumstances, I was referred to Pt 5 of the Legislative Instruments Act. The purpose of Pt 5 is expressed to be to facilitate the scrutiny by Parliament of legislative instruments, and to provide for disallowance when considered appropriate. S 38 requires tabling, for a specified period, of legislative instruments, obviously for the purpose of permitting scrutiny. What is not clear is the extent to which parliamentary drafting staff are called upon to assist in ensuring the clarity of the instrument, or that it achieves its purpose or reflects the intentions of the drafters. 
     
      
    74 I have come to the view that the more liberal approach to construction which I have mentioned above ought to be adopted. In particular, considerable weight ought to be given to what can be discerned to be the intention of those who compiled the Code, and the purpose for which it, and its individual provisions, were formulated. 
     
      
    75 At the same time, I bear in mind that the Code must be taken to mean what it says, and that, even if it appears not to have achieved its purpose, it is not to be rewritten in order to achieve that purpose. I also bear in mind that, in this instance, it is to be construed in the context of criminal prosecution. Any ambiguity must be resolved in favour of the defendants and against the Prosecutor. I shall endeavour to balance these considerations. 
     
     * * * 
    76 In respect of St 2.9.1 cl 6, the competing positions were these. 
     
      
    77 On behalf of Nutricia it was argued that the definition of “nutritive substance” in St 1.1.1 is clear in its terms, and applies throughout the Code, including in cl 2.9.1. The expression of the “purpose” of St 1.1.1 in which the definition of “nutritive substance” – for the Code in general – appears, is clear and unequivocal.  
     
      
    78 Essential to Nutricia’s argument was the assertion that the Prosecutor has presented no evidence that could amount to proof that FOS is not normally consumed as a food in itself, and no evidence that FOS is not normally used as an ingredient of food. The same applies in relation to GOS. Indeed, Nutricia identified evidence on the stay application that pointed in the opposite direction – that inulin (FOS) is marketed as “Metamucil Fibresure”, a substance that is intended to be mixed with water and consumed as a food in itself. This is consistent with the Prosecutor’s concession. Nutricia identified other evidence that FOS is used as an ingredient in various food products sold in NSW and New Zealand (and globally). I infer from the volume of material to which I have referred above that the whole of the Prosecutor’s brief has been served. If there were any evidence of the kind which, as is asserted on behalf of Nutricia is lacking, then it would have been a simple matter for counsel for the Prosecutor to direct me to it. They did not. Initially, they made no attempt to identify any evidence of any of these facts. They concentrated their attention on the construction argument to which I will shortly turn. 
     
      
    79 Nutricia identified what it perceived as the high point of the prosecution case in proving the two negative propositions. In each case, it was said, the high point in the prosecution brief was:  
     
      
       
        
        “… irrelevant and otherwise inadmissible evidence of Dr McVeagh that ‘ 
        infants and toddlers 
         do not consume FOS [or GOS] in itself’”;  
        
       
       
      and  
       
       
        
        “The irrelevant and otherwise inadmissible evidence of Dr McVeagh that ‘in Australia  
        infants and toddlers  
        do not normally consume foods containing added FOS [and GOS] as an ingredient.” (italics in original of written submissions)  
        
       
      
    80 At no time during the hearing did counsel for the Prosecutor take issue with these assertions as to the state of the evidence, including to the challenge to the admissibility of the statement extracted from a report provided by Dr McVeagh. 
     
      
    81 Indeed, in their written submissions, as extracted above, they expressly conceded (para 30) that FOS is a normally used food ingredient, and (para 43) that GOS may be present “in trace quantities” in the whey ingredient of infant formula products. This approach, it appears to me, was at least an acknowledgment that the evidence is lacking as the defendants contended. 
     
      
    82 Counsel for the Prosecutor therefore focused their attention on the construction of “nutritive substance”, as it appears in cl 6(1), and channelled their energies into an argument that cl 6(1) means more than it says. They presented an elaborate argument to the effect that “nutritive substance” as it there appears represents a narrower concept than the same combination of words as it appears in St 1.1.1. The essential submission appears in para 18 and is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “When the definition of ‘nutritive substance’ [sic – is] construed in the context of Standard 2.9.1, the question whether a substance is ‘normally consumed as a food in itself’ or ‘normally used as an ingredient of food’ must have regard to the relevant population, that is, infants. …” 
        
       
      
    83 In other words, and as the argument developed, counsel for the Prosecutor suggest that “nutritive substance” in cl 6(1) ought to be read as meaning, not the bare: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … a substance not normally consumed as food in itself and not normally used as an ingredient in food …” 
        
       
       
      but as: 
       
       
        
        “ … a substance not normally consumed  
        by infants 
         as a food in itself, and not normally used as an ingredient of food  
        for infants 
         …” 
        
       
      
    84 Even taking the liberal approach to construction that I have foreshadowed, I am unable to accept the Prosecutor’s contention.  
     
      
    85 The “Purpose” stated in the introduction to St 1.1.1 is explicit. It is that St 1.1.1 should always be consulted as a starting point in the use of the Code because it regulates the general operation of the Code in its entirety. It asserts that many definitions which have general application to the Code are therein contained. 
     
      
    86 In the first paragraph it is noted that, while St 1.1.1 contains general application and interpretation provisions, in other cases application and interpretation provisions specific to individual food Standards are to be found in those specific Standards. It is also of interest that cl 2, the interpretation clause, begins with the words “Unless expressly defined elsewhere in this Code …” (and then provides that the expressions and words have the meanings there assigned to them.) 
     
      
    87 Recourse to St 2.9.1 fails to disclose any specific interpretation provisions relevant to what is meant by “nutritive substance” as there used (other than as defined in St 1.1.1), that would override the application of the St 1.1.1 definition. On the contrary, in the “Purpose” introductory statement, the following, unequivocal, statement appears: 
     
      
       
        
        “Standard 1.1.1 defines nutritive substances for the purposes of this Code.” 
        
       
       
      This is a quite explicit adoption of the definition of “nutritive substance” in St 1.1.1, for the purposes of St 2.9.1. 
       
      
    88 It would be quite wrong, and I decline, to interpolate into cl 6(1) the additional words proposed. 
     
      
    89 It is true that, as it stands, and so far as it deals with nutritive substances, cl 6(1) is substantially a duplication of St 1.1.1 cl 9, although it does contain reference to other substances, and provides for two exceptions to the general prohibition. The duplication is, in my opinion, merely reflective of the manner in which the Code came into existence, and its somewhat piecemeal nature. It is not an indicator that the words as they appear in one should be treated as meaning something different from the same words as they appear in the other. 
     
      
    90 During the course of argument, counsel for the Prosecutor tendered a number of documents as “extrinsic materials” as a proposed aid to the construction of the Code, particularly the use of the phrase “nutritive substance” as it appears in St 2.9.1 cl 6(1). This material was largely historical and included the original Standard prescribed with respect to infant formula, reviews and reports thereafter (commencing February 1993), and the final report on Special Foods Standard. 
     
      
    91 It was put that this material tended to support the construction the Prosecutor seeks to place upon the words “nutritive substance” as they appear in St 2.9.1 cl 6(1), including the additional words proposed to be inserted. 
     
      
    92 I rejected the material, saying that I would give reasons in due course. 
     
      
    93 After judgment was reserved I received from counsel for the Prosecutor further written submissions, urging, inter alia, that reliance on the extrinsic material was permissible to aid in the construction of the phrase. 
     
      
    94 Again, reliance was placed upon Commonwealth legislative provisions with regard to interpretation. Particular reliance was placed upon the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) s 15AB. 
     
      
    95 In this prosecution I am exercising state, not federal, jurisdiction. I adhere to the view I have already expressed that the appropriate guide to construction is to be found in NSW legislation: the Interpretation Act 1987. S 34 of the Interpretation Act is in virtually identical terms to s 15AB of the Acts Interpretation Act.  
     
      
    96 S 34 provides that extrinsic material may be used in the interpretation of “an Act or statutory rule” (and, although it is not entirely clear that the Code is a statutory rule, I am prepared to take a broad view of the phrase and apply s 34 to the interpretation of the Code) in certain defined circumstances. Extrinsic materials may be used in the following circumstances: 
     
      
       
      (i) to confirm that the meaning of the provision is the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text. (The extrinsic material was not tendered for this purpose: indeed, it was tendered for the opposite purpose, to show that the ordinary meaning conveyed by the provision is not its (intended) meaning); 
       
       
      (ii) to determine the meaning of the provision where it is ambiguous or obscure. (Counsel for the Prosecutor rely upon this, asserting that the definition of “nutritive substance” is ambiguous or obscure. I do not accept that. For reasons I have already given, I do not find the meaning of cl 6(1) in any way ambiguous or obscure. S 34 does not permit reliance on the material for this purpose); 
       
       
      (iii) to determine that a meaning other than the ordinary meaning ought to be given to the provision because the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or unreasonable. (Counsel for the Prosecutor also rely upon this aspect of s 34. I do not find that the ordinary interpretation of cl 6(1) leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or unreasonable). 
       
      
    97 Accordingly, it remains my view that the extrinsic material is not available to be used as an aid to construction.  
     
      
    98 Further, although no mention was made of it, sub para (3)(a) of s 34 requires, in determining whether to take into account any such proposed material, the desirability of parties being able to rely on the ordinary meaning of the text of the provision (taking into account its context in the statute, and the purpose or object underlying the provision). 
     
      
    99 In this case that is, in my opinion, of some significance. As I have already held, a fair reading of the Code dictates that “nutritive substance” has, in cl 6(1), the same meaning as is given to it by St 1.1.1. This is a provision with which manufacturers of food, including of infant formula, must comply – at the risk, in case of failure to do so, of criminal prosecution, as well as significant - or worse - commercial repercussions. I do not think justice is served by turning to a volume of extrinsic material in order to arrive at a construction that is, or appears to be, significantly at odds with the words as they appear in the clause.  
     
      
    100 I declined at the time to receive the extrinsic material. I see no reason to change the view I then formed or the ruling that I made. It is not clear to me that the present argument goes so far as to seek a review of the ruling I made, but if it does, I decline to do so.  
     
      
    101 A significant consideration, in this instance, is that this is a criminal prosecution. It would be quite wrong to strain the language of the Code to incorporate what the drafters have failed themselves to incorporate. 
     
      
       
      Prosecutor’s further written submissions 
       
      
    102 After the conclusion of argument, and after judgment was reserved, I received a further twenty pages of written submissions from counsel for the Prosecutor, and, subsequently, a response from counsel for Nutricia. 
     
      
    103 The submissions on behalf of the Prosecutor were, to say the least, obscure and difficult to follow. They appear to be intended to achieve two things: - 
     
      
       
      (i) to reinforce and repeat the argument concerning the construction of “nutritive substance” in cl 6(1), specifically by urging the receipt and reliance on extrinsic material; I have stated my views on this and I do not intend to repeat them. The additional submissions do nothing to persuade me that I ought to change or even reconsider those views; 
       
       
      (ii) to put certain additional propositions. These, so far as I am able to understand them, are: 
       
       
      Proposition 1:  
       
      
    104 So as not to do injustice to the submission, I will extract the proposition in full: 
     
      
       
        
        “11. It is irrelevant as to who consumes the substances. The only relevant consideration in the first part of the definition is to identify the  
        normal 
         (and thus not normal)  
        ‘uses’ of the substances being added 
        . (Here, manufactured GOS and FOS are not such substances which may be naturally present  
        in  
        the food.) If they are  
        normally  
        used (either as consumed foods or as ingredients) not as foods in themselves, and are not  
        normally  
        used as ingredients in food then they can be ‘nutritive substances’ subject to them being the manufactured substance, and is (sic) being added for a nutritional purpose.” (bold in original) 
        
       
      
    105 So far as I can ascertain from the written argument that follows, the intention was to examine the meaning of “normally” as it is used in the definition of “nutritive substance”. It was put that: 
     
      
       
        
        “16. … the fact that there is evidence that these substances are sometimes used as ingredients does not mean that the substances are normally used as ingredients of food. What is in issue is normal use, not sale of products containing these substances.” 
        
       
      
    106 If I understand this argument correctly (and I am not at all sure that I do) it is that “normal” has some statistical base. “Normal” use of a food depends upon the extent to which it is used as a food. Rare and unusual consumption would not establish “normal” use. Perhaps so. But, in my view, “normally” in the definition is equivalent to “ordinary” or “not artificial”. There follows an argument that FOS and GOS are nutritive substances because they are additives “used to serve the purpose of dietary fibre”, which, the submission goes on to assert, is not normally used as an ingredient of food. I find this proposition surprising. My understanding is that dietary fibre is integral to many foods, and is added as an ingredient to many foods. I was referred to no evidence to suggest that “dietary fibre” is other than a food or a food ingredient. 
     
      
       
      Proposition 2: 
       
      
    107 This was a repeat of the proposition that the inquiry as to normal consumption of a substance of food or its normal use as an ingredient, incorporates an inquiry as to “the targets or population to whom the regulated food relates”; it goes on to introduce a distinction between manufactured GOS and naturally occurring GOS. 
     
      
    108 For reasons I have already given, I reject the first argument. There is no warrant for interpolating words into cl 6(1) that do not there appear. 
     
      
    109 For reasons that follow (see Proposition 3), I also reject the second proposition.  
     
      
       
      Proposition 3: 
       
      
    110 This is a proposition that there is evidence capable of establishing that both FOS and GOS: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … are normally added for and thus  
        used as 
          
        dietary fibre 
         and thus are not normally consumed as food in itself, and not normally used as ingredients of food …” (italics and bold in original) 
        
       
      
    111 I have already expressed my understanding concerning dietary fibre. There is nothing in this further argument that persuades me that I am wrong. In particular, there is no reference to any evidence to contrary effect. 
     
      
    112 I conclude that there is no evidence that FOS is not normally consumed as a food in itself. There is no evidence that GOS is not normally used as an ingredient of food. Such evidence as there is is to the opposite effect. The Prosecutor therefore cannot prove that either is, within the meaning of St 2.9.1 cl 6(1), a nutritive substance. It is unnecessary therefore, to determine whether the Prosecutor is able to prove that the addition of either FOS or GOS does not come within exception to (b) cl 6(1). 
     
      
    113 Two further prosecution arguments ought to be noted. Firstly, in para 31 and repeatedly thereafter submissions were made differentiating between synthetic (or “manufactured”) GOS and naturally occurring GOS. I was referred to no such distinction or differentiation in the Code. So far as I can see, the Code treats GOS as a generic, and does not distinguish between its different forms. 
     
      
    114 Secondly, in paras 37 and 38 the following submissions were made: 
     
      
       
        
        “37. The exception in paragraph (b) [of cl 6(1)] does not have the effect that merely because a vitamin, mineral, food additive or nutritive substance is present in an ingredient, it is permissible to separately add any amount of that substance to an infant formula product. What paragraph (b) means is simply that it is permissible to add the ingredient that contains the vitamin, mineral, food additive or nutritive substance where it is naturally occurring in the food ingredient. 
        
       
       
        
        38. If the construction contended for by the defendant is correct, it would mean that it would be permissible to add any amount of a vitamin, mineral, food additive or nutritive substance that is naturally contained within an ingredient. Such a construction is inconsistent with other provisions of the Code.” 
        
       
      
    115 The “other provisions of the Code” with which the disputed construction is said to be inconsistent were not identified. It may well be that what the Prosecutor contends for is what the regulators had in mind in formulating cl 6(1). Indeed, that would be a logical approach on the part of the regulators. But it is not so clear that that was the intention as to allow the proposed formulation to usurp the role of the words of the Code. What is now proposed is not what was incorporated into the Code. 
     
      
    116 It would have been very simple, if that were what the drafters intended, to provide that a vitamin, mineral, food additive or nutritive substance must not be added in quantities additional to those that occur naturally in any (permitted) infant formula product ingredient. That they did not clearly do. 
     
      
    117 Having regard to the view I have reached concerning whether FOS and GOS are nutritive substances, it is not, strictly, necessary to come to a conclusion on this argument. It concerns only the exception in cl 6(1), (b) which is material only if the Prosecutor is able to succeed in proving that GOS is a nutritive substance. 
     
      
    118 Counsel for the Prosecutor further argued that the construction contended for by the defendants:  
     
      
       
        
        “ … invites the Court to disregard cl 24 of Standard 2.9.1.” 
        
       
      
    119 Cl 24 requires that infant formula and follow on formula must contain certain vitamins, minerals and electrolytes in specified quantities. The submission made on behalf of the Prosecutor is, in effect, that cl 24 is inconsistent with cl 6(1). That submission overlooks cl 6(1)(a) which provides an exception to the prohibition where the addition is expressly permitted by the Code. Cl 24 is express permission for the addition of these substances. 
     
      
    120 My conclusion in relation to the first two elements has the inevitable consequence that the prosecution case must fail because the Prosecutor is incapable of proving essential elements of the charges. It is therefore unnecessary to deal with whether there is evidence that GOS is naturally present in an ingredient of Karicare. These charges will be stayed. 
     
      
       
      The labelling charges (s 21(3)); St 1.1A.2 cl (3)(a), (3)(f)(ii): 
       
      
    121 These are divided into two categories. They are: 
     
      
       
      (a) twenty-two charges alleging that, contrary to St 1.1A.2 cl 3(a), the defendants sold food with labelling that made therapeutic or prophylactic claims; 
       
       
      (b) fifteen charges alleging that, contrary to St 1.1A.2(3)(f)(ii), the defendants sold food with labelling that made health claims. 
       
       
      (a) therapeutic or prophylactic claims 
       
      
    122 St 1.1A.2(3)(a) prohibits the sale of food with labels that: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … include a claim for therapeutic or prophylactic action or a claim described by words of similar import.” 
        
       
      
    123 It seems that, at different times, or in different circumstances, Karicare, whether infant formula or follow on formula, was sold in cans bearing labels with slight variations. I set out below what is particularised, in various of the summonses, as the relevant, objectionable, content of different labels. They are: 
     
      
       
      1. Summons 13672/07: 
       
       
        
        “GOLD PLUS FOLLOW ON FORMULA 
        
       
       
        
        From six months, Karicare Gold Plus is a premium formula designed to meet the increasing nutritional requirements of growing infants. Its unique formulation of special ingredients, include Nutricia prebiotics. These nutritionally support your baby’s digestive and natural immune systems.” 
        
       
       
      2. Summons 13678/07: 
       
       
        
        “GOLD PLUS INFANT FORMULA

It has a unique formulation of special ingredients, including Nutricia prebiotics. These nutritionally support your baby’s digestive and natural immune systems.” 
        
       
       
      3. Summons 12728/08: 
       
       
        
        “ 
        GOLD PLUS INFANT FORMULA 
        
       
       
        
        From birth, Karicare Gold Plus is nutritionally complete and is designed to meet the needs of bottle fed infants. It has a unique formulation of special ingredients, including Nutricia prebiotics 
        .  
        These nutritionally support your baby’s digestive and natural immune systems. A well supported immune system helps babies thrive 
        .” 
        
       
       
        
        “  
        GOLD PLUS FOLLOW ON FORMULA 
        
       
       
        
        From six months, Karicare Gold Plus is a premium formula designed to meet the increasing nutritional requirements of growing infants. Its unique formulation of special ingredients, include Nutricia Prebiotics. (sic)  
        These nutritionally support your baby’s digestive and natural immune systems. A well supported immune system helps babies thrive 
        .” (emphasis added in summons; (apparently) absent from labelling) 
        
       
      
    124 On behalf of the Prosecutor it is alleged that each of these contains a “therapeutic or prophylactic claim”. 
     
      
    125 Neither “therapeutic” nor “prophylactic” is defined in the Code, and nor is the composite phrase. The Macquarie Dictionary gives the following meaning for “therapeutic”: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        therapeutic 
        ,  
        adj 
        . Pertaining to the treating or curing of disease; curative.” 
        
       
       
      and of “prophylactic”: 
       
       
        
        “ 
        prophylactic 
        ,  
        adj 
        . 1. Defending or protecting from disease, as a drug. 2. Preventive; preservative; protective. –  
        n 
        . 3. A prophylactic medicine or measure.” 
        
       
       
      It defines “immune” as: 
       
       
        
        “ 
        immune 
        ,  
        adj  
        1. Protected from a disease or the like, as by inoculation …” 
        
       
      
    126 On behalf of the defendants it was submitted that it is “critical” that the words “form part of a phrase”: that is, (as I understand the argument) that they denote a composite concept. I see no reason so to limit the words as they appear in the clause. The two words have distinct meanings, and represent distinct concepts. In my view, the clause ought to be read as containing references to both therapeutic action and prophylactic action. True, that result would be clearer if the clause prohibited claims for “therapeutic action” or “prophylactic action”, and such a formulation would be more in accord with conventional drafting standards. But this is one of those areas where the apparent absence of supervision or contribution by parliamentary drafting staff may be taken into account in order to allow a purposive approach to be taken to the construction. In any event, it makes little difference to the outcome. Even if it is a composite phrase, it is one that is disjunctive. 
     
      
    127 For the purposes of the application for a stay, the test to be applied is whether the words are capable of being read as making a claim for therapeutic action or prophylactic action. That is, the test is whether a notional jury, properly instructed, could find that they made such a claim. At this stage of the proceedings, it is not appropriate to determine whether (in my view) they do or do not amount to such a claim: that is for the ultimate tribunal of fact. Although there is to be no jury, it may well be that (no matter what view I would reach) the judge who ultimately deals with the prosecution would reasonably come to a different view. 
     
      
    128 I have come to these conclusions: the words on the labels are not capable of being read as making a “therapeutic” claim. There is no suggestion of treatment or cure of disease. But, by the reference to immune systems, they are capable of being read as making a claim for prophylactic action, in defending or protecting from disease. For that reason, the charges relating to labels so framed should proceed to a hearing.  
     
      
       
      (b) Health claims 
       
      
    129 St 1.1A.2 prohibits making of “a health claim” in respect (inter alia) of infant formula products. It is the Prosecutor’s case that the claims on the labels set out above also amount to “health claims” and are prohibited by St 1.1A.2(3)(f)(ii). 
     
      
    130 Sub para 3(f) is relevantly in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “3(f) A health claim must not be made in respect of the following foods - 
        
       
       
        
        (i) … 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) food standardised in Standard 2.9.1 … 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) … 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) …” 
        
       
      
    131 “Health claim” is undefined in the Code. 
     
      
       
      “Claim” is defined in St 1.1.1(2) as: 
       
       
        
        “ … any statement, representation, information, design, words or reference in relation to a food which is not mandatory in this Code.” 
        
       
       
      In an editorial note it is observed that a claim may be made, for example, on the label of a package of food or in an advertisement. It was not argued on behalf of Nutricia that the labelling was incapable of amounting to a “health claim”. What was argued was that sub para (3)(f)(ii) does not stand alone to prohibit the making of a “health claim”. In order to convey the argument it is necessary to set out in more detail the structure and provisions of the clause.  
       
      
    132 Sub para (3)(a) is expressed as set out above, and applies: 
     
      
       
        
        “Save where otherwise expressly prescribed by this Code …” 
        
       
      
    133 Sub para (3)(b) prohibits the inclusion of the word “health” or any word or words of similar import as part of or in conjunction with the name of the food; sub para (3)(c), again save where otherwise expressly prescribed by the Code, prohibits any claim that may be interpreted as medical advice; sub para (3)(d), also save where otherwise expressly prescribed by the Code, prohibits the inclusion on a label or package of the name of or any reference to any disease or physiological condition. Sub para (3)(e) permits, in circumstances there defined, certain health claims to be made. (It is set out in [*] above.) 
     
      
    134 Sub para (3)(e) is expressly made subject to sub paras (3)(f), (g) and (h). 
     
      
    135 Nutricia’s argument, in writing, was this: 
     
      
       
        
        “55. The effect of [cl 3(f)] is to create an exception to the permission granted by sub cl (3)(e), such that none of the permitted claims [permitted by sub cl (3)] can be made in respect of the foods specified in (f). Manifestly, the intention is that no health claim of the kind set out in [sub cl (3)] can be made in respect of the foods that are the subject of the exception in (f).” 
        
       
      
    136 I reject this contention. It is plain to me that sub para (3)(e) is subject to, inter alia, sub para (f) – that is, even claims that would otherwise be permitted by sub para 3(b), where they relate to foods mentioned in sub para 3(f), may not be made; sub para 3(f) is clear in its intent and in its expression. 
     
      
    137 Since no argument was put that the claims made cannot otherwise amount to a health claim, I decline to stay prosecution on these charges.  
     
      
       
      The energy content charges (s 21(2)); St 2.9.1 cl 3: 
       
      
    138 S 21(2) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “A person must not sell any food that does not comply with a requirement of the  
        Food Standards Code  
        that relates to the food.” 
        
       
       
      The “requirement” of the Code with which the defendants are said to have failed to comply is St 2.9.1 cl 3. That clause, as I have mentioned above, prescribes the manner of calculation of the energy content of infant formula product, expressed in kilojoules. It provides that the energy content of infant formula product must be calculated using only certain specified factors. 
       
      
    139 Cl 3 does not impose any obligation on any person to do or not do anything. That role, referable to energy content calculation, is to be found in cl 16, which requires labels on infant formula products to state the average energy content expressed in kilojoules per 100 millilitres. 
     
      
    140 The summons is poorly phrased. It particularises the offence as: 
     
      
       
        
        “(c) At all material times,  
        calculation of 
         the energy content of the food being [Karicare] included the energy value contributions of ingredients other than those specified in cl 3 …” 
        
       
      
    141 The energy charges are misconceived. The only submission put in writing on behalf of Nutricia in respect of these charges was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “73. These charges … allege a breach of Standard 2.9.1 cl 3. The form of charge is deficient. That clause does not create a prohibition. It merely provides a mechanism for calculating energy content. There is no offence alleged. There is no allegation that the food does not comply with a requirement of the Code as required by s 21(2).” 
        
       
      
    142 In oral argument counsel for Nutricia pointed out that cl 3 expressly permits the inclusion of energy value contributions of any carbohydrate component of the infant formula product, and that “carbohydrate” is defined in St 1.2.8, in such a way as to include FOS. (He made no mention, in this context, of GOS.) 
     
      
    143 It is of some interest that, while cl 3 directs attention to the “energy factors” set out in St 1.2.8, it does not adopt the definition of “carbohydrate” there set out. The definition clause of St 1.2.8 is expressed to apply only to “this Standard”. This is another of those examples of loose drafting that ought to be overlooked or excused, or accommodated by a flexible approach. 
     
      
    144 It is unnecessary to deal with that argument. There is, it seems to me, a simpler, more fundamental, reason why the charges so framed cannot succeed and therefore ought to be stayed. That is this. 
     
      
    145 S 21(2) under which the charges are brought, makes an offence of selling food that does not comply with a relevant requirement of the Code. 
     
      
    146 Cl 3, as was pointed out, does no more than prescribe a method of calculation of energy content. It is, in effect, preliminary to the requirements of cl 16. 
     
      
    147 Miscalculation of energy content is capable of, and probably likely to, produce a false or misleading declaration of the average energy content of the product. But to sell a food with a false or misleading declaration, or label, is not an offence against s 21(2). This statement of energy content does not have the consequence that the food sold does not comply with a relevant requirement of the Code – the food may be perfectly compliant. It is the label that is non compliant.  
     
      
    148 Simply proving, if the Prosecutor is able to do so, that impermissible factors were taken into account in the calculation of energy content does not and cannot give rise to an offence against s 21(2). These charges must be stayed. 
     
      
       
      The false description charges: (s 18(3)), St 2.9.1 cl 6(1) 
       
      
    149 S 18(3) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “A person must not, in the course of carrying on a food business, sell food that is packaged or labelled in a way that falsely describes the food.” 
        
       
      
    150 The nature of these charges may be stated succinctly. It is that in its packaging or labelling, Karicare was represented as being “infant formula”. “Infant formula” is a prescribed name under St 2.9.1 cl 12. 
     
      
    151 The Prosecutor’s case is that it was false to describe Karicare as “infant formula”. This was because, in breach of St 2.9.1 cl 6(1) of the Code, it contains the prohibited substances FOS and GOS.  
     
      
    152 Proof of these charges depends, like the composition charges, on proof that FOS and GOS were nutritive substances and their addition to Karicare was prohibited by cl 6(1). Plainly, these charges stand or fall with the composition charges. 
     
      
    153 Having regard to the conclusions I have reached in relation to the composition charges, these charges must also be stayed. 
     
      
    154 The remaining grounds may be disposed of quickly. One is that the charges involving allegations of sale of food (s 21(2)) are duplicitous because they relate to multiple sales, and not to a single, identifiable, sale. The simple rebuttal to this proposition can be found in R v Hamzy (1994) 74 A Crim R 341; and in R v Hanza [2008] NSWCCA 288. 
     
      
    155 Complaint was also made about an asserted failure on the part of the Prosecutor to disclose relevant material. Some assertions along these lines were made in Nutricia’s written submissions, but no oral submissions were directed to the issue. Given that many of the charges will be stayed, it is inappropriate to deal with this complaint at this stage. 
     
      
    156 No separate argument was directed to what was said to be the oppressive nature of the multiplicity of charges. Having regard to my findings, it is unnecessary to take time on that issue. 
     
      
    157 It will be necessary for the parties to formulate the orders that must be made consequential upon these reasons.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: 
     
      
      (1) Introduction 
       
      The incidents which became the subject of four of five charges in the District Court concerned events on the night of 9-10 July 2004, in the appellant’s premises at Warners Bay near Newcastle. There were three charges of having sexual intercourse without consent, one charge of attempted sexual intercourse and a further charge of assault with an act of indecency. The charges, and the conduct to which they related, will be identified more fully below. At his trial, the appellant pleaded not guilty to each count and was convicted on one count only (number 5) of sexual intercourse without consent, contrary to s 61I of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 (NSW). The offence carried a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of seven years. The appellant was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of five years, commencing on 17 July 2006 and expiring on 16 July 2011, with a further term of one year, eight months. 
       
      
    2 The appellant sought to appeal against his conviction and sought leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    3 As will appear shortly, most if not all of the grounds of appeal against conviction involved issues of fact: leave was required to appeal on any ground which did not involve a question of law alone: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5(1); Carlton v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 244 at [10]. Given the seriousness of the offence for which he was convicted and the nature of the issues raised, it is appropriate that he have such leave in respect of all aspects of the appeal for which leave is required. 
     
      
    4 The bulk of the grounds of appeal related in one way or another to the conduct of the appellant’s solicitor and counsel during the trial. These grounds will be addressed together. 
     
      
    5 The second major group of grounds related to the authenticity of the videotapes of the sexual activity, as presented by the prosecution in the course of the trial. (There was some overlap between the appellant’s complaints in this regard and his complaints with respect to the conduct of counsel.) 
     
      
    6 The third group of complaints concerned admission of a number of items of evidence, together with a failure to give proper instruction to the jury in respect of such evidence. There was a further complaint in relation to the inadequacy of the summing up, which will also be addressed in this context. 
     
      
    7 The fourth group of complaints included grounds asserting that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory, in part because of the accumulation of complaints noted above, but also because of alleged inconsistency between certain of the verdicts. 
     
      
    8 Something further should be said about the conduct of the appeal. First, the appellant lodged with his written submissions a number of statements from witnesses, each of which was said to be supportive of his innocence. This material will be dealt with in the context in which it arises below. More importantly, the appellant, who appeared in person, gave evidence and called his partner (Ms Bentley) to give evidence as to various events which occurred during the course of the trial, in part involving conversations with his lawyers, both in Court and outside the courtroom. It will be necessary in due course to say something about the relevance of this evidence, which was adduced without objection from the Director. Before doing so, it is convenient to set out the charges and the circumstances giving rise to each charge. 
     
      
    (2) The facts9 The appellant was born in 1965. The complainant was 30 years old at the relevant time. They were in a relationship which had begun shortly after they met in March 2004. It was a sexual relationship and they frequently slept at each other’s residences. 
     
      
    10 The appellant had arranged to go on an overseas trip with a male friend. The trip was to commence on 10 July 2004. The trip had been the source of considerable tension between the appellant and the complainant. 
     
      
    11 On the night of 9 July 2004 the appellant and the complainant had consumed alcohol and argued. The complainant said that her recollections of the latter part of the night and the early morning were blurry and confused. She remembered getting out of a taxi at the appellant’s house, but nothing of what happened thereafter until she woke up feeling not right and a bit nauseous. At that stage words were exchanged between her and the appellant. The appellant left to go on his trip. The complainant went back to sleep. When she subsequently awoke she saw a wine bottle next to the bed and a jar of Vaseline on the bedside table. In another bedroom she saw a carrot on a bed. She noticed what looked like Vaseline on the top of the bottle. She pressed buttons on a VCR recorder and saw images of herself and the appellant involved in sexual activity on the screen. She took the video (Exhibit A) and another video that had cartoons or something similar written on it. On 11 July 2004 she contacted police. 
     
      
    12 On 13 July 2004 police executed a search warrant at the appellant’s premises. They located and took possession of, inter alia, the wine bottle and six videotapes. One of these (Exhibit B) also depicted sexual activity involving the appellant and the complainant.  
     
      
    13 On 31 July 2006 the appellant was charged on indictment on the following counts: 
     
      
       
      (1) Between 17 March and 11 July 2004 at Warners Bay the appellant did have sexual intercourse with the complainant without the consent of the complainant, knowing that she was not consenting. 
       
       
      (2) On 10 July 2004 at Warners Bay the appellant did assault the complainant and at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency on the complainant. 
       
       
      (3) On 10 July 2004 at Warners Bay the appellant did have sexual intercourse with the complainant without the consent of the complainant, knowing that she was not consenting. 
       
       
      (4) On 10 July 2004 at Warners Bay the appellant did attempt to have sexual intercourse with the complainant without the consent of the complainant, knowing that she was not consenting. 
       
       
      (5) On 10 July 2004 at Warners Bay the appellant did have sexual intercourse with the complainant without the consent of the complainant, knowing that she was not consenting. 
       
      
    14 The activities to which the charges related were: count (1) - digital penetration of the complainant’s vagina; count (2) - rubbing a hand on the anal and genital region of the complainant whilst a vibrator was in the vicinity of her genitalia; count (3) - the insertion and movement of a dildo in the complainant’s genital area; count (4) - the placing of a bottle in the exposed anal area of the complainant; count (5) - the insertion of a bottle into the complainant’s vagina. The prosecution contended that the complainant had consented to none of these activities. 
     
      
    15 In respect of each of those counts the sexual activity was recorded on video, count (1) activities on Exhibit B, the remaining activities on the video Exhibit A, which was enhanced in Exhibits E and M. Exhibit B was taken on Easter Tuesday, 13 April 2004 after boating at Port Macquarie. 
     
      
    (3) The trial16 The appellant was represented by counsel at the trial. The prosecution case was dependent upon the video evidence as the complainant had no recollection of the events the subject of the charges. Prior to the empanelment of the jury a voir dire was conducted on 31 July 2006 to determine whether, by reason of certain aspects of the videotapes, a permanent stay of the proceedings should be granted or the videotapes should be excluded pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The challenge was unsuccessful. 
     
      
    17 The jurors were empanelled and the trial proceeded. During the course of the trial, a question arose as to whether the appellant accepted the authenticity of the videotapes and that they had not been tampered with. Counsel for the appellant gave that concession. Subsequently a document confirming this concession was tendered pursuant to s 191 of the Evidence Act. The only issues then remaining were whether the complainant consented to the conduct of the appellant which was complained of or the appellant may have believed that she did consent. 
     
      
    18 There were a number of exchanges between appellant’s counsel and the presiding judge during the course of the trial. On 16 August 2006, shortly after the appellant’s counsel had stated that the appellant’s case was complete, his instructions were withdrawn. The appellant’s solicitor applied for a discharge of the jury at that stage but this was refused. The trial was thereafter conducted by the appellant’s solicitor to its conclusion. 
     
      
    19 On 24 August 2006 the jury found the appellant guilty on count (5). He was convicted and, on 1 December 2006, was sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of five years commencing on 17 July 2006 and expiring on 16 July 2011 with a further term of one year eight months to commence at the expiration of the non-parole period and expire on 16 March 2013. 
     
      
    20 The jury found the appellant not guilty on counts (2) and (3) and were unable to agree upon a verdict in respect of counts (1) and (4). 
     
      
    21 The prosecution had a certificate under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) with two charges of filming for indecent purposes, relating to counts (1) and (5). The appellant was convicted of the charge relating to count (5), for which he was sentenced to six months imprisonment to date from 17 July 2006 and to expire on 16 January 2007. 
     
      
    22 In relation to count (5), Exhibit M was played in court. In evidence at trial the appellant agreed with the following description of what was depicted: just before he inserted the wine bottle he was touching the genitals of the complainant, she moved away from him, he picked up a dildo or vibrator and touched her genitals, she moved away from him, she uttered the word “don’t” a number of times. He was masturbating, was looking at the television screen, he lifted the doona to expose her lower body and he looked at the camera when he did that. He accepted at that point of time the doona was over the complainant’s head. At one time he was sucking on the carrot. He agreed the complainant then said “don’t” quite forcefully. The appellant agreed it could be suggested the complainant tried to kick out with her foot when he tried to put the bottle near her. He agreed she said “don’t” again. He inserted the bottle and she cried out very loudly “ouch”. He agreed he pushed the bottle in hard. He said that in his mind he was giving the complainant pleasure.  
     
      
    23 The prosecution case was that the appellant videotaped sexual acts between himself and the complainant when the complainant was either heavily intoxicated or asleep or both and did not consent to those acts. The complainant had no memory of the events in question. The complainant gave evidence that at no time did she agree to use implements in the sexual relationship. It was her evidence that when it was discussed she actively declined to use the vibrator or be filmed. 
     
      
    24 It was the appellant’s case that the sexual relationship between himself and the complainant involved the complainant engaging in behaviour that encouraged his advances and then rejected them in what he described as a yes-no, yes-no pattern. That pattern constituted the dynamics of their relationship and was why he made the suggestion of filming their sexual activity. It was the appellant’s case that the complainant willingly participated in being filmed during sexual activity and she had watched some of the video footage and had taken two of the recordings home with her. It was the appellant’s case that the sexual relationship involved consensual use of vibrators, dildos, carrots and bottles, and that the complainant enjoyed and actively encouraged the use of such implements. It was the appellant’s case that the complainant was angry the appellant was going on an overseas holiday for two weeks without her and had fabricated the complaint against him in retaliation for him leaving her.  
     
      
    (4) Evidence on the appeal25 The appellant sought to call evidence (from himself and his partner) as to the steps taken by him and his lawyers, including instructions given by him and advice received, both in preparation for the trial and during the course of the trial. That course was not opposed by counsel for the Director; rather he called evidence from the appellant’s trial solicitor and trial counsel. The purpose, on the appellant’s part, was to demonstrate a miscarriage of justice through: 
     
      
       
      (a) the failure of his lawyers to follow instructions with respect to trial strategy; and 
       
       
      (b) inappropriate pressure placed on him by his lawyers to take a course contrary to his instructions. 
       
      
    26 This course would in most circumstances be misconceived. A miscarriage of justice will generally be capable of demonstration only by reference to the objectively verifiable circumstances of the trial. What takes place between an accused person and his or her lawyer will usually be irrelevant to that assessment: Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; 80 ALJR 614 at [8] (Gleeson CJ). Where counsel has been briefed, the general rule is that the accused will be bound by counsel’s conduct of the trial. If counsel fails to follow instructions, the final resort of the disaffected client is to withdraw instructions. Why that is done is usually no concern of the prosecution or the Court. However, in Nudd at [19] Gleeson CJ continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “The description of conduct as an ‘error’, and the characterisation of something that happened as ‘unfair’, could in some circumstances turn upon knowledge of why something was done or omitted, and this, in turn, might reveal a departure from standards of professional duty. As Lord Carswell said in  
        Teeluck v Trinidad and Tobago  
        [2005] 1 WLR 2421 at 2433, there may be rare cases in which counsel's misbehaviour or ineptitude is so extreme as to constitute a denial of due process to the client. McHugh J gave two examples in  
        TKWJ v The Queen  
        [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124 at [76]: cases where, for no valid reason, counsel fails to cross-examine material witnesses, or does not address the jury. (I take his Honour to have been referring to cases where there is no rational explanation of counsel's decision; not to cases where an appellate court simply thinks it was unwise to fail to cross-examine. That is indicated by his Honour's treatment of failure to cross-examine and failure to address as like cases). In  
        Teeluck v Trinidad 
        , Lord Carswell went on to say that, normally, ‘the focus of the appellate court ought to be on the impact which the errors of counsel have had on the trial and the verdict’: at 2433.” 
        
       
      
    27 An exception may arise in a case where withdrawal of instructions in the course of a trial is followed, as in this case, by an application for an adjournment. In the case of a jury trial, granting such an application is likely to lead to the trial being aborted unless fresh counsel can reasonably be expected to take over at short notice. Because the Court will often not be in a position to evaluate whether the withdrawal of instructions is reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances, an application, made well into the course of the trial, which will lead to the discharge of the jury, will usually be refused. A refusal to adjourn will not readily be reviewable. Not only is it a discretionary decision, but it is one likely to turn on matters of impression. An attempt to adduce evidence on appeal as to the accused’s impressions of events occurring during the trial should, in most circumstances, be rejected: cf Cesan v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2007] NSWCCA 273; 174 A Crim R 385 – reversed, Cesan v The Queen [2008] HCA 52; 250 ALR 192, but not on this issue. It is not necessary for the trial judge to form a view that the application is a device to avoid an adverse verdict in order to refuse the application. 
     
      
    28 Where the accused, following conviction, seeks to demonstrate that the withdrawal of instructions and the consequential adjournment application were justified, the exercise on which the appeal court is invited to embark involves the assessment of the reasonableness of the accused’s conduct. But that is not the relevant test: the test is the fairness of the trial, objectively assessed. The relevant principles were identified by Gleeson CJ in this Court in R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 in the following terms at 685D-F: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. A Court of Criminal Appeal has a power and duty to intervene in the case of a miscarriage of justice, but what amounts to a miscarriage of justice is something that has to be considered in the light of the way in which the system of criminal justice operates. 
        
       
       
        
        2. As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence. 
        
       
       
        
        3. However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of ‘flagrant incompetence’ of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellant intervention.” 
        
       
      
    29 The concept of “flagrantly incompetent advocacy” is drawn from the judgment of Lord Lane CJ in R v Ensor [1989] 1 WLR 497. As explained by McHugh J in TKWJ at [97], such a description of counsel’s conduct “may show that a miscarriage of justice has occurred in a particular case” but is “unhelpful generally in determining whether there has been a miscarriage of justice within the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act”, that being the question for determination by the Court. One might add that such a description is designed to distinguish a high level of incompetence from misjudgement or even negligence. It carries no necessary implication as to how the characterisation is to be reached. Of course, it is a characterisation of the circumstances of a particular case, but a critical question is whether those circumstances may be ascertained by evidence presented either at trial, or to the court of appeal. 
     
      
    30 In Birks, counsel for the accused failed to put to the complainant in a rape case circumstances consistent with the accused’s story as later recounted by him in the witness box. Unsurprisingly, the accused was cross-examined by the prosecutor to suggest that the story was a recent invention. After the jury retired, counsel explained to the trial judge that the accused had in fact given instructions in terms consistent with his evidence. The failure to put that case to the complainant was “his own oversight”: at 682G. Evidence to similar effect was adduced in the Court of Criminal Appeal: 683B. If an accused is able to produce evidence, which is admissible, material, credible and conducive to an acquittal, which was available at the time of trial, he or she may also say that instructions were given to obtain the evidence, which instructions were not followed: see Regina v Connolly (unrep, NSWCCA, 15 March 1979). This would be evidence of a kind which, if first discovered after a conviction, might warrant an inquiry into the conviction: Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), Pt 7. This is not evidence of disagreement as to strategic decisions made in the course of a trial, which would usually be inadmissible, because irrelevant: see TKWJ at [107]-[110] (Hayne J). A distinction should thus be drawn between facts relevant in the criminal trial on the one hand, and the basis of strategic decisions, or subjective intentions, of the accused and counsel, on the other hand. 
     
      
    31 Evidence falling within the latter category would generally be inadmissible: much of the appellant’s evidence in the present case fell into the latter category. For example, although he complained that inquires with respect to the authenticity of the copies of the videotapes were not pursued and that an expert obtained by him at his own expense was not utilized, it was material which competent counsel, acting in his client’s interests, could properly decline to pursue as a distraction from the issues likely to be persuasive with a jury. 
     
      
    (5) Conduct of appellant’s lawyers32 Nine separate grounds (grounds 1, 12-17, 20 and 21) related to various aspects of the manner in which the appellant’s solicitor (Ms Randle) and his counsel (Mr Brewer) conducted his defence. It is convenient to deal with these grounds together. 
     
      
    (a) Atmosphere of hostility33 The transcript revealed that the appellant’s counsel clashed with the trial judge on a number of occasions. The primary examples of these clashes were as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) On 3 August 2006 a question about engaging in oral sex put to the complainant by appellant’s counsel was objected to pursuant to s 293 of the  
      Criminal Procedure Act 
      . The question was rejected, his Honour relying upon s 41 of the  
      Evidence Act 
      . On the following day another s 293 objection was taken and his Honour criticised appellant’s counsel, in the absence of the jury, for not giving him advance notice of the matter: Tcpt, 03/08/06, pp 154-156; Tcpt, 04/08/06, pp 187-188. 
       
       
      (b) On 4 August 2006 his Honour rejected a question by appellant’s counsel which assumed that a previous question had been answered in the affirmative when it had not: Tcpt, p 182-183. A short time later appellant’s counsel again transgressed in this way. His Honour sent the jury out before criticising counsel (Tcpt, p 185), his Honour concluded (Tcpt, p 186): 
       
       
        
         
          
          “… you are not doing your client any benefit at all by continuing this course of cross-examination and if it continues in the future unfortunately your client will suffer the consequences, which is unfair to your client.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (c) Later that day his Honour criticised appellant’s counsel, in the absence of the jury, as to the detail of the cross-examination of the complainant which his Honour considered was becoming oppressive and irrelevant: Tcpt, p 204. 
       
       
      (d) On 9 August 2006 his Honour interrupted the cross-examination of a police witness, in the presence of the jury, to say he did not understand the relevance of the cross-examination: Tcpt, p 351. Counsel explained the relevance to his Honour who then permitted counsel to continue asking questions on that issue, although not the particular question which had caused his Honour to raise the issue. 
       
       
      (e) Later in the cross-examination of the police officer, the following exchange occurred (Tcpt, p 360): 
       
       
        
         
          
          “HIS HONOUR: Please let this witness, in his own way, answer the question. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          [COUNSEL]: Well, your Honour, I am not going to let that happen. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          HIS HONOUR: Well, I’m going to let that happen. I’m going to let that happen.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (f) On 10 August 2006 counsel was making a submission, in the absence of the jury, when his Honour cut him off. The following exchange was recorded (Tcpt, p 396): 
       
       
        
         
          
          “HIS HONOUR: I have difficulty talking to you, [counsel], and I don't know whether this confrontation attitude refers to me or otherwise, but please let's keep the tension out of your discussion and my discussion. I am not here to deal with confrontation, I don't welcome it, I really don't welcome it. It is very unfortunate to have a confrontation attitude all the time. I really don't welcome it. It is foreign to me, really is foreign. I will just go off the bench.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (g) On 14 August 2006 the following exchange, which took place in the absence of the jury, was recorded (Tcpt, p 506): 
       
       
        
         
          
          “HIS HONOUR: You weren't aware of the authority? 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: I was aware, your Honour - I wasn't aware--  
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: You were aware of it. If you were aware of it why didn't you refer me to it? 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: I wasn't aware of this authority so much as the recognition evidence notion that began with Mundarra Smith and the cases involving police officers-- 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: If you are protecting your client's interests, if the judge makes a mistake and you know and you know that there is authority it is incumbent upon you to tell me. 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: Well, I haven't said your Honour has made a mistake. What I have-- 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: If you believe that what has been directed by me may be an error, it may not be in your client's interests, then it is your obligation to your client and to the court to tell me which. Show me the authority please. 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: Just so it is clear, that is why I asked to be heard in the absence of the jury now so there is no-- 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: You knew this was going to happen again and you put the question to the witness, ‘What can you tell me about that.’ Why didn't you, before the jury came in, so we wouldn't have this problem, say to me, ‘Look, you made a ruling earlier in the piece’, and brought to my attention that, ‘There are some authorities and before we play any more of this tape I would like to deal with the matter with you.’""  
          
         
        
       
       
      (h) On 15 August 2006 the following exchange occurred in the absence of the jury (Tcpt, pp 629-630): 
       
       
        
         
          
          “[COUNSEL]: The other matter is that on a number of occasions, I haven't counted them all up yet, but when I raised matters your Honour looked at me several times, there was a section 293 question and I desisted from raising matters that I thought would incur a reprimand from your Honour, based on the fact that I hadn't alerted your Honour. 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: You must alert me in relation to section 293. 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: Your Honour would have observed-- 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: Partially-- 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: Partially-- 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: Firstly, let me say I don't like being verballed in my court. I looked at you, did I? I really would like to know, I looked at you and that caused you to be too frightened to say-- 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: No, your Honour, I'm never too frightened. Your Honour has already described me as being confrontational. 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: I'm just wondering-- 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: Never too frightened, your Honour. 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: Firstly, I don't like being verballed-- 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: I wasn't attempting to verbal your Honour at all. 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: You have, very successfully. I looked at 
           
          you? 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: I simply reject that. 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: That's what you said I did. 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: Your Honour said on a number of occasions-- 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: You are going to tell me about the section 
           
          293 matters. 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: --holding your finger up at me. 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: Holding my finger up? 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: Your Honour is now laughing at me. 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: I am. 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: Your Honour held your Honour's finger up and said ‘Excuse me’ and looked at me in front of the jury. 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: Oh. Well, I have been on this bench a long time, [counsel] -- 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: I understand that, your Honour. 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: Will you just listen? I have never, never had allegations of this nature raised against me and I find them very, very offensive. But if you are too frightened, as a counsel, to look after your client's interests, well so be it. But in relation to section 293, if you want to raise matters, I told you raise them with me beforehand. 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: That's what I have been doing.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (i) On 16 August 2006 the following exchange occurred in the absence of the jury (Tcpt, pp 697-698): 
       
       
        
         
          
          “HIS HONOUR: It really is very unfair. I mean, I gave a ruling. I indicated what was relevant. You read the statement of what you were going to say to me. I said what is relevant in that statement is the description. I asked is there any clear identification of the vibrator on the video. Now you've introduced a whole new area. 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: No. Nothing has been introduced. She hasn't given any evidence about it. 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: What is the jury going to do? The Crown has objected. This woman is going to say, yes, she used it in her sex life with men, in her sex with the accused, but it is patently clear-- 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: It is not-- 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: Excuse me. 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: It's not-- 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: Excuse me. I don't know. The question has been asked. The question has been objected to. The objection is a proper objection. The question shouldn't have been put. It goes outside my ruling. It is unfair to the Crown. It is unfair to the complainant. It is just another act of your incompetence or it is an act of your defiance, but it is not an act of what I regard as the proper act of a properly prepared and ethical barrister. Take the jury back to the jury room. 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: Let me just place on the record-- 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: Everything is on the record, sir, so say what 
           
          you want. There are no secrets here sir. 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: Why is it that every-- 
           
           
          (Jury commenced to enter courtroom) 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: Excuse me. Take the jury back to the jury room please. 
           
           
          (Jury withdrawn) 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: So how do we handle this situation? 
           
           
          CROWN PROSECUTOR: Did your Honour say take the jury back to the jury room? 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: Back to the jury room please. So how do we handle the situation? 
           
           
          CROWN PROSECUTOR: I am happy if [counsel] simply withdraws the question and I proceed to cross-examination, your Honour. 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: I am going to say something to the jury. I am going to say to the jury that there was legal argument in relation to the evidence. I have permitted the evidence in relation to the vibrator. It was limited to that effect, but [counsel] went beyond my direction and I will say it is unfair and they should disregard the question. Yes, bring the jury back please. 
           
           
          During the course of legal argument you did not object to the evidence, did you? 
           
           
          CROWN PROSECUTOR: Of the description of the vibrator? 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: Yes. 
           
           
          CROWN PROSECUTOR: No your Honour. 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: I am going to tell the jury. 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: While the jury are returning I will just place on the record-- 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: Everything is on the record here sir. 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: You've said that before. I am just letting-- 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: Well, I am going to say it again. Everything is on the record. 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: Thank you, and I was just going to indicate that what I anticipated the witness would give-- 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: I know what the witness is going to say, I heard you summarise it earlier, but the question should not have been put. 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: It was consistent with evidence the complainant had given. 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: It does not matter. The question should not have been put-- 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: Well, it doesn't-- 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: --because it breaches section 293. I am not going to go through this again. I don't know how to get through your head what the law is. I don't know how to do it. I can't be any clearer. 
           
           
          IN THE PRESENCE OF THE JURY 
           
          HIS HONOUR: I sent you out, members of the jury, because a very serious matter had arisen. Prior to this evidence being given during the course of legal argument and interruptions I permitted the evidence to be given. The Crown did not object to the evidence being given about this vibrator, about that purchase of a vibrator and the size of the vibrator and that was the extent of the evidence which was to be given. 
           
           
          As to the next question asked of the witness by [counsel], there was no permission given by me for the question to be asked. The question has to be struck out and you must not under any circumstances speculate what the answer to the question would have been. [Counsel] went against my directions and instructions, because the only relevant section of her evidence pertained to the purchase of that vibrator. Do you understand that? 
           
           
          (Jury indicated in the affirmative) 
           
           
          You must not in any way speculate, in any way speculate what the answer to that question which I have directed to be struck out would be. It would act unfairly to the parties in this case. Now, do you understand that? 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (Jury indicated in the affirmative) 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: I can't tell you in any stronger terms.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        In respect of these events the prosecutor placed on record some additional comments in relation to the location of the jury during the above exchange. In essence, the additional comments were to the effect that the jury was not physically in the courtroom during those exchanges and the courtroom door was closed at all times except when the court officer opened the door at the time counsel was saying “why is it that every”: Tcpt, 17/08/06, pp 718-719. 
        
       
       
      (j) Later that day, in the absence of the jury, the following exchange occurred (Tcpt, pp 704-705): 
       
       
        
         
          
          “CROWN PROSECUTOR: I will, your Honour. Could I raise one matter. Apparently whilst the concession was being read the accused shook his head in the negative … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          HIS HONOUR: I too shake my head. This was why I believed, having regard to the behaviour of the accused and his counsel during the course of this trial, that something in writing would be-- 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: I ask you to withdraw that. 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: I don't withdraw that. 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: I ask you to withdraw it-- 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: I don't withdraw it, sir. I really don't 
           
          withdraw it. I don't withdraw it. I don't withdraw it. 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: What are you suggesting, that I conspired with the accused-- 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: No, I am not. 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: --in acting a certain way-- 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: You haven't let me finish what I was going to say. 
           
           
          [COUNSEL]: No. That is because you talk over the top of me all the time. 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: Well, I am not going to deign to answer that comment, but I will just come back and say what I was trying to say before. Perhaps I will repeat what I said. Having regard to the conduct of the accused and his counsel during the course of the proceedings, I felt that a document in writing would have overcome any problems. It is clear that the accused - I was told the accused had refused to sign any documents, so it is clear that either his counsel has acted without instructions from his client or the accused doesn't agree with the concession made by his counsel or that he has changed his mind. So I would like you to put the concession again. Ask for the concession again and let me see what the response is and that concession again should be sought in the presence of the jury. Failing that, a document-- 
           
           
          RANDLE: Your Honour, may I speak? 
           
           
          HIS HONOUR: Yes. 
           
           
          RANDLE: Mr Gillies has just withdrawn instructions from [counsel]. Secondly, I do have instructions that, with respect to the videotapes that the Crown are relying on, there is no argument with respect to the authenticity or the tampering, or should I say, non-tampering with them.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    34 In essence, the appellant submitted on appeal that his Honour, by his conduct, cut off some lines of examination, was vigilant against questions put by appellant’s counsel and any line of examination he considered irrelevant, oppressive for the complainant (or both), was antagonistic to appellant’s counsel and by his conduct generally tended to undermine the defence case. A fair-minded observer would have concluded that the trial judge had predetermined some issues. The net effect of the interaction between his Honour and appellant’s counsel was to cause a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    35 The task of this Court is to study the transcript of the trial in order to determine the validity or otherwise of the appellant’s complaint that the judge and counsel conducted themselves in a fashion meriting criticism, and if so, whether what occurred between them so affected the fairness of the trial as to have produced a miscarriage of justice: R v Lars (1994) 73 A Crim R 91. 
     
      
    36 The exchanges complained of were concerned with legitimate issues arising in the course of the trial but, unfortunately, the exchanges were not always accompanied by an appropriate degree of restraint. Nevertheless, the exchanges complained of occurred, almost entirely, in the absence of the jury. As such they cannot be regarded as having contributed directly to any unfairness of the trial, in the sense that they directly raised the risk that the jury would be distracted from its task or caused to perceive a conflict between the judge and counsel such as could generate a belief on their part that the judge was not impartial. In that sense the conduct of counsel and exchanges between counsel and the judge in the absence of the jury may be regarded as of little direct relevance. Exchanges in the presence of the jury are more important. The real vice of those is “the risk that the jury were diverted from their proper function, and gained an impression that the judge had formed an adverse view of the defence sought to be raised by each of the accused”: Lars at 142. 
     
      
    37 It was not inappropriate for his Honour to raise the evidentiary issues which he did and it does not appear that his handling of these issues evidenced any undue bias in favour of the complainant or any prejudging of issues. Having regard to all the circumstances revealed by the transcript, it is not possible to conclude that any miscarriage of justice was produced by the exchanges between appellant’s counsel and his Honour. No miscarriage of justice has been demonstrated. 
     
      
    (b) Incompetence of counsel38 The appellant submitted his counsel was flagrantly incompetent in a number of respects, resulting in a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    39 As noted above it was held in Birks, at 685, that “flagrant incompetence” of trial counsel may be recognised as causing a miscarriage of justice. It is also accepted that a trial may have been unfair, leading to a miscarriage of justice, by reason of the manner in which counsel appearing for the accused conducted his defence: Seymour v R [2006] NSWCCA 206; 162 A Crim R 576. However, an appellant carries a heavy burden in attempting to establish this ground of appeal: R v Miletic [1997] 1 VR 593 at 597.  
     
      
    40 In Birks it was stated (at 683-4): 
     
      
       
        
        “In our system of criminal justice a trial of an accused person is conducted in the manner of a contest between the Crown and the accused, and that trial has many (although not all) of the features which attend civil litigation conducted in accordance with what is sometimes described as the adversary system of justice. To a large extent the parties to such proceedings are bound by the manner in which they conduct them. It is the parties who decide, for example, what information will be put before a tribunal of fact, and the tribunal bases its decision on that information. 
         
         
        As a general rule, a party is bound by the conduct of his or her counsel, and counsel have a wide discretion as to the manner in which proceedings are conducted. Decisions as to what witnesses to call, what questions to ask or not to ask, what lines of argument to pursue and what points to abandon, are all matters within the discretion of counsel and frequently involve difficult problems of judgment, including judgment as to tactics.” 
        
       
      
    41 The appellant must show that the failing or error of counsel was a material irregularity and that there was a significant possibility that it affected the outcome of the trial: TKWJ at [79] (McHugh J). 
     
      
    42 In Ali v The Queen [2005] HCA 8; 79 ALJR 662 Hayne J (with whom McHugh J agreed) said at [25]: 
     
      
       
        
        “the question of miscarriage does not turn on a factual inquiry into why trial counsel acted or did not act in a particular way. That kind of inquiry cannot be made. Rather, the question is whether there  
        could 
         be a reasonable explanation for the course that was adopted at trial. If there could be such an explanation, it follows from the fundamental nature of a criminal trial as an adversarial and accusatorial process that no miscarriage of justice is shown to have occurred.” 
        
       
      
    43 Thus, in general, an appellate court does not make a factual inquiry into trial counsel’s instructions or why trial counsel did or did not act in a particular way. However, it has been acknowledged that there may be circumstances where such an inquiry may be appropriate: Nudd at [9]. 
     
      
    44 The primary matter raised by the appellant was an alleged failure by his counsel to dispute the authenticity of the videotape evidence and to call expert evidence from Dr Tibbitts, an electrical engineer, and Ms Storey-Whyte, an independent consultant specialising in analysis of recordings, speech and language samples, in support of the contention that the tapes had been doctored or tampered with. However, the appellant in his evidence accepted that Section B of Exhibit A depicted what occurred between him and the complainant on 10 July 2004 and that he could make out words on the recording which indicated the complainant was rejecting his advances. The prosecution’s expert, Mr Ringrose, in a report which was before the court on the voir dire, accepted the authenticity of the videotape and that part of Section B of Exhibit A was recorded over part of Section A. 
     
      
    45 Evidence was adduced on the appeal as to the instructions given to the appellant’s trial counsel and solicitor. The appellant gave evidence that at all times he had instructed his counsel and solicitor that he wished the experts to be called and the issue of the authenticity of the tapes to be contested. The appellant said that he was not told that Dr Tibbitts would not give evidence and he considered she would do so if she were paid. However, there was a difficulty as he was lacking in funds. He said that he was not told that Ms Storey-Whyte was not able to assist. His present partner, Ms Bentley, also asserted that the appellant’s legal representatives were instructed at all times that the experts were to be used. 
     
      
    46 Counsel for the appellant gave evidence on appeal that the appellant had initially wished to contest the authenticity of the tapes on the basis that there had been a conspiracy involving numerous people against him and this was part of the conspiracy. Counsel, after considering the matter and the expert reports of Dr Tibbitts and Mr Ringrose, strongly advised the appellant that he was wasting his time pursuing that issue and should deal with the real issue in the case, namely consent. The appellant was initially reluctant to accept that advice but eventually agreed and instructed counsel accordingly. 
     
      
    47 The appellant’s solicitor confirmed that she had the appellant’s instructions when she so stated in court. She said that the appellant’s expert, Dr Tibbitts, under no circumstances was prepared to come to court to give evidence on behalf of the appellant and that Ms Storey-Whyte, the other expert qualified by the appellant, informed the appellant’s solicitor she could not give evidence which would assist the appellant. The appellant’s solicitor said the appellant was aware of these matters. Even if those facts were not established, the appellant did not show that his lawyers did not hold reasonable and bona fide beliefs in those facts, then providing a basis capable of supporting the decisions taken in relation to the conduct of the trial. Whether erroneous or not, it was open for counsel in these circumstances not to challenge the authenticity of the videotape and to concentrate on the critical issue of consent and the appellant’s belief that his actions were within the consent of the complainant. It follows that no miscarriage of justice is shown to have occurred. 
     
      
    48 Once the appellant accepted that Section B of the videotape correctly recorded the relevant activities, it was strategically appropriate to abandon that issue and to concentrate on the issue of consent. This was the advice which the appellant received: the Court finds that he accepted that advice at the time, although he had doubts on occasions thereafter as to whether this was the appropriate course. (The finding is, on the Court’s view as to the correct test, unnecessary.) 
     
      
    49 The appellant also said he had given instructions to his counsel to tender a toxic forensic report at the trial. The document reported there were no illegal substances in the complainant’s system. However, as it was not until the following Sunday that the complainant went to hospital and no evidence that she was drugged had been adduced, it was reasonable and rational for counsel not to tender the report. No miscarriage of justice is demonstrated in his failure to follow such instructions, if given. 
     
      
    50 It was further submitted that counsel had failed, through incompetence, to anticipate issues which would arise under s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act and to give advance notice of such issues to his Honour and to the prosecutor. This failure gave rise to friction between counsel and his Honour. As it has already been concluded that the hostility between counsel and his Honour did not give rise to a miscarriage of justice, the cause of the hostility is irrelevant. 
     
      
    51 Finally, it was asserted that the appellant’s solicitor acted contrary to instructions in causing the complainant to be recalled and further cross-examined. The decision of the appellant’s solicitor to further cross-examine was capable of constituting a reasonable exercise of the advocate’s discretion. No miscarriage of justice resulted from the recall and further cross-examination of the complainant. 
     
      
    (c) Withdrawal of instructions52 The withdrawal of instructions to appellant’s counsel occurred after the evidence in the appellant’s case had closed. The appellant’s solicitor informed the Court that she had not previously addressed a jury and had been unable to instruct replacement counsel to conduct the proceedings. She sought a discharge of the jury on the grounds of the conduct of counsel in the course of the trial, the fact that counsel had to a degree acted outside his instructions, that he failed to deal with a number of matters giving rise to Browne v Dunn issues, that the appellant was impecunious and legal aid was not available to him, that his Honour had had to speak to appellant’s counsel about a number of matters (which it was acknowledged all occurred in the absence of the jury).  
     
      
    53 His Honour rejected the application for discharge of the jury. He concluded that he was not satisfied the appellant had suffered the prejudice referred to in Morgan v John Fairfax & Sons (1988) 13 NSWLR 208. 
     
      
    54 His Honour’s conclusion was open to him. The appellant’s solicitor was given an adjournment to prepare her address to the jury. There is no ground of appeal which asserts incompetence in that address. 
     
      
    (d) Undue pressure from lawyers55 On 15 August 2006, shortly after 12.00 noon, the appellant became frustrated when giving evidence because, he said in this Court, he knew the DVDs being played were not an original recording and that his instructions had not been followed by his counsel. This eventually caused him to have a “meltdown” resulting in his Honour ordering two “security guards” to sit either side of him for the rest of his cross-examination: Tcpt, p 607. In the course of the “meltdown” the appellant said: “Let’s get the bloody experts in here and prove the authenticity of the tapes. Which tape are you playing now? The one I went and got tested or the one you did?”: Tcpt, p 591. 
     
      
    56 This caused the prosecutor to respond (Tcpt, pp 594-595):  
     
      
       
        
        “Your Honour, two things. Mr Gillies’ evidence about the authenticity of the videotape, unless there is a concession that the tape has not been tampered with and is authentic, as I indicated the Crown will call the expert in reply … 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You have heard what the Crown says. The Crown indicates that it is her intention to - of course there will be some arrangement made between yourself and the Crown - to call the expert in relation to the authenticity of the tape, unless there is a concession made that there is no challenge to the authenticity. Do you want to take instructions from your client in relation to that? 
        
       
       
        
        [COUNSEL]: Not at the moment because he’s in cross-examination. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I’m inviting you to obtain instructions from your client in relation to that. 
        
       
       
        
        [COUNSEL]: I think what I will do is wait until - I think my client quite frankly has become a little worked up. I quite frankly haven’t seen him like this before. I am concerned about it. He is obviously very agitated and very worked up. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I have seen him appearing to be very aggressive, but if you wish to speak to him later. Yes, would you come back? Bring the jury back please.” 
        
       
      
    57 The cross-examination of the appellant then continued and was completed on the following day. Other witnesses in the appellant’s case were called and the appellant’s case was closed. 
     
      
    58 At the close of the appellant’s case, the following occurred (Tcpt, 16/08/06, p 702): 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, the Crown at this time seeks a concession from the accused that the videotapes in evidence have not been tampered with or altered in any way and that the videotapes are original and authentic recordings. 
        
       
       
        
        [COUNSEL]: That concession is given, your Honour.” 
        
       
      
    59 There was then the discussion between his Honour and counsel which has been earlier recorded at para [33](j) which continued (Tcpt, pp 705-706): 
     
      
       
        
        “RANDLE: Mr Gillies has just withdrawn instructions from [counsel]. Secondly, I do have instructions, with respect to the videotape that the Crown are relying on, there is no argument with respect to the authenticity or the tampering, or should I say, non-tampering with them. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Has the accused then agreed to sign the prepared facts? 
        
       
       
        
        RANDLE: Yes, he has, your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Very good. Keep the jury here. The prepared facts have been prepared? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Read those onto the record. Is the jury still here? 
        
       
       
        
        COURT OFFICER: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: I am just having trouble locating the documents your Honour. Ms Randle had all the copies of them. … 
        
       
       
        
        RANDLE: Your Honour, I do have a document that is signed. It is not the original document that Madam Crown handed me. I will read it. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The Crown seeks a concession that the tapes in evidence have not been doctored or tampered with in any way, are authentic recordings.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        That was signed by Mr Gillies. Mr Gillies signed that today. That has got his signature on that document. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: I’d prefer to have the proper form.” 
        
       
      
    60 The document prepared for the purposes of s 191 of the Evidence Act was subsequently tendered. The document was signed by the appellant, witnessed by the prosecutor and the appellant’s solicitor, and dated 16 August 2006. It was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Pursuant to section 191 of the  
        Evidence Act 
          
        1995 
         the accused admits the following matter of fact which is not in dispute: 
        
       
       
        
        1. The video tapes in evidence have not been doctored or tampered with in any way. They are authentic and original recordings.” 
        
       
      
    61 The appellant gave evidence about this document on the appeal. He said he signed the document after he had been calmed down by his solicitor. He said that he signed it in the belief that it would get the judge on side and that the discharge of the jury would come and the trial would be re-run: Tcpt, CCA, 27/08/08, pp 25(35)-26(5). He said he signed it without reading it, without understanding what it was about and it wasn’t explained to him: Tcpt, pp 26(35)-27(1). Such evidence is of doubtful probity. Even if accepted, it cannot be asserted that the trial miscarried because the appellant was forced to sign the document. He signed it voluntarily, although his purpose was thwarted. The advice to agree on the authenticity of the tapes was made for strategic reasons discussed above. His agreement was given for a (different) strategic reason. 
     
      
    (e) Limiting cross-examination of complainant62 It was suggested in cross-examination of the complainant that on 3 April 2004 she commenced to have sexual intercourse, including oral intercourse (cunnilingus), with the appellant. The question was objected to on the basis that it contravened s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act: Tcpt, 03/08/06, p 154).  
     
      
    63 His Honour held (Tcpt, p 156): 
     
      
       
        
        “Insofar as the oral sex is concerned, I am not going to consider section 293 in the first instance, I am going to consider section 41 [of the  
        Evidence Act 
        ] and I find that it is not relevant and the question in relation to the oral sex is offensive and, that being the case, I disallow the question.”  
        
       
      
    64 The appellant submitted that the question relating to cunnilingus was relevant. The question was incapable of being construed as unduly offensive having regard to the manner in which it was asked and the nature of the subject matter and other permissible questions. It was relevant to establish the details of the kind of sexual activities engaged in between the appellant and complainant. 
     
      
    65 His Honour was mistaken in considering s 41 of the Evidence Act, its operation in criminal proceedings being excluded by s 275A(7) of the Criminal Procedure Act. However, s 275A itself applied and made it mandatory for the court to disallow a question put in cross-examination or direct a witness that it need not be answered if of the opinion that the question is, inter alia, unduly annoying, harassing, intimidating, offensive, humiliating or repetitive: s 275A(1)(b). The basis for disallowance relied upon is found in both provisions. His Honour was of the opinion that the question was “offensive” and for that reason disallowed it. He did not use the word “unduly” but his use of the word “offensive”, which occurs in s 41, suggests he was relying upon the power given by that section to disallow the question. If so, it can be inferred that he found the question offensive to the degree required by that section, namely “unduly offensive”. 
     
      
    66 However, the appellant’s case relied on alleged prior sexual intercourse involving a bottle and other implements. Even if oral intercourse may have been relevant to some other count, there was no miscarriage of justice vis a vis the conviction under appeal. The jury could not have reasoned that because on an earlier occasion the complainant may have consented to oral sexual intercourse, she now consented to the appellant using a bottle or that he may have thought she was consenting to such activity. The difference between the two acts was just too great to allow for such reasoning. 
     
      
    (f) Recalling complainant67 There were a number of matters which were not put to the complainant by counsel for the appellant. The prosecutor formulated a list of propositions which had not been put to her. The evidence given on the appeal, if relevant, was that counsel for the appellant considered the complainant should not be recalled for the purpose of putting those matters to her. The appellant agreed with that view. The appellant’s solicitor was aware of those opinions but was of the opposite view. When she took over the full conduct of the defence she caused the complainant to be recalled and further cross-examined. 
     
      
    68 The decision by the appellant’s solicitor is submitted to have caused the trial to miscarry. However, the decision by the solicitor lay well within the advocate’s discretion as to the manner in which proceedings are to be conducted: Birks at 683-4. Furthermore, it has not been shown why it was disadvantageous to the appellant to have the complainant recalled for further cross-examination. No miscarriage is demonstrated. 
     
      
    (g) Failure to take objection; collusion69 An additional complaint was made with respect to the expert evidence concerning the authenticity of the tapes. The appellant submitted that, having regard to the considerable force of the expert evidence and the instructions to trial counsel and solicitor, the failure to lead that evidence before the jury led to an inference that trial counsel and the solicitor had taken instructions from the prosecution. 
     
      
    70 Furthermore, the prosecutor implied at the trial that the appellant may have been drugging the complainant. This was dealt with when the prosecutor served upon the defence a forensic report relating to the complainant which did not support the suggestion that the appellant may have drugged her. Appellant’s counsel did not tender the report at the trial. 
     
      
    71 The tactical considerations relevant to the tender of this material have been referred to above: it is discussed further below. No basis has been laid for the inference that there was collusion between the prosecution and the appellant’s legal representatives to conduct the case to his disadvantage. Such a serious allegation would require very clear evidence. No such evidence is present here. 
     
      
    (6) Authenticity of tapes(a) Failure to grant permanent stay72 The appellant made an application to stay the proceedings on counts (2)-(5) permanently on the basis that part of the videotape had been obliterated such as to prejudice the appellant by removing a possible defence. Alternatively, he submitted that pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act the videotape should not be admitted into evidence.  
     
      
    73 For the purposes of the application Exhibit A was notionally divided into three parts. Section A consisted of the first 10.51 minutes. It showed consensual activity between the appellant and the complainant on 5 July 2004. Section B consisted of the next 1 hour 21 minutes. It showed the impugned behaviour between the appellant and the complainant on 10 July 2006. Section C was blank. 
     
      
    74 The appellant accepted that Section B depicted what occurred between him and the complainant on 10 July 2004. He asserted that part of Section B was recorded over part of Section A and that the audio was not synchronised with the video. 
     
      
    75 Counsel for the appellant submitted on the voir dire (Tcpt, 31/07/06, p 7): 
     
      
       
        
        “The real thrust of the accused’s application is that the over-recording of B over episode A, has removed material or obliterated material or obscured material that is favourable to his defence. In that he says, his instructions are that it would show clearly the same activity that is displayed in episode B, following on from the clearly consensual material in episode A.” 
        
       
       
      Appellant’s counsel also said that for the purposes of the application the question of any tampering with the videotape should be left “completely out”. 
       
      
    76 The power to grant a permanent stay of proceedings to prevent an unfair trial is a power to be used only in most exceptional circumstances: Jago v District Court of New South Wales [1989] HCA 46; 168 CLR 23 at 31 per Mason CJ. His Honour said at 33-34: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the safeguarding of the interests of the accused in the manner I have described the touchstone in every case is fairness… 
        
       
       
        
        The test of fairness which must be applied involves a balancing process, for the interests of the accused cannot be considered in isolation without regard to the community’s right to expect that persons charged with criminal offences be brought to trial. … 
        
       
       
        
        To justify a permanent stay of criminal proceedings there must be a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial ‘of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences’.” 
        
       
      
    77 The trial judge held: 
     
      
       
        
        “I believe I can properly draw the inference that it was the accused himself who over recorded the activities contained in activity A. However, even if I could not come to that conclusion I am satisfied that the absence of the evidence does not prevent the accused having a fair trial. That being the case I will not stay the proceedings. I go one step further and say that even if I had found that the accused’s opportunity to have a fair trial had been significantly reduced by the absence of the evidence I still would have had to consider the public interest in relation to the matter.” 
        
       
      
    78 His Honour’s conclusion was well open to him. As he observed, the complainant was available to give evidence and could be cross-examined as to the type of sexual behaviour she engaged in with the accused and the manner in which she gave her consent to sexual activity. Furthermore, the appellant was available to, and did in fact, give evidence on the issue of consent. Whilst the appellant’s case would have been stronger if the obliterated material did exist and was as represented by him, this did not prevent a fair hearing being accorded to him and the situation did not constitute such exceptional circumstances as to justify the use of the power to grant a permanent stay of proceedings. His Honour ruled that the videotape should not be excluded pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    79 Insofar as this ground raises issues as to counsel’s competence and adherence to the appellant’s instructions, those aspects have been dealt with above. 
     
      
    (b) Destruction of evidence80 The complainant had taken two videos from the appellant’s home, Exhibit B and a video marked “cartoon”. Detective Snr Const Cook gave evidence that he had viewed the second videotape. It contained only cartoons. As it contained nothing of relevance he had destroyed it (Tcpt, 09/08/06, p 349).  
     
      
    81 The appellant submitted: 
     
      
       
        
        “the non-presentation of evidence which has significant forensic value is sufficient to justify a stay of proceedings and exclude the application of the proviso. … [T]he non-disclosure of exculpatory evidence by prosecution denied appellant a fair trial and/or fair chance of acquittal.” 
        
       
      
    82 There was no evidence that the material on the videotape was exculpatory or relevant in any sense. It was not put to the witness that the videotape had contained relevant material nor was any evidence led that it had contained relevant material. Counsel for the appellant was not stopped from pursuing that line of cross-examination. No miscarriage of justice has been demonstrated. 
     
      
    (c) Alleged inconsistency in prosecution case83 Detective Abbott, when giving evidence, was asked if he had taken Exhibit A to David McGenniskin. He replied:  
     
      
       
        
        “No, I didn’t. I provided that video to the court under subpoena on 22 September and it has been in the court’s care and custody since.” 
        
       
      
    84 The date on which the video was said to have been provided to the court was 22 September 2004. The appellant submitted that that claim was incorrect and Detective Abbott had in fact committed perjury as he had delivered the videotape, the subject of the dispute, to the Australian Federal Police on 11 January 2006. Mr Ringrose, in his report of 31 March 2006, stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “On 11 January 2006 I received the following items from Senior Constable Michael ABBOTT, NSW Police: 
        
       
       
        
        ·  
        Item 1: One(1) VHS tape … described as ‘evidence video’ ….” 
        
       
      
    85 The Court was thus invited to draw the inference that the evidence was not always in the care of the court. 
     
      
    86 The report of Mr Ringrose was not in evidence at the trial. Even if the challenged evidence was not literally correct, it may be that the witness was mistaken or had forgotten some events. The matter was not raised either in his evidence-in-chief or in cross-examination so that there was no opportunity to clarify or explain what was meant or to correct the statement if it was wrong. The matter was not relevant to any ultimate issue in the trial. No miscarriage is apparent. 
     
      
    (d) Evidence of continuous custody omitted87 At trial the prosecutor opposed the production of material demonstrating the continuity of custody of the exhibits on the basis that the continuity was a question of fact for the jury. It was implicit in that position, the appellant submitted, that evidence of the continuity would be led before the jury during the trial. 
     
      
    88 However, ultimately there was no issue about the videotape and it was tendered and went into evidence without objection. Continuity of custody had ceased to be an issue. Furthermore, during the stay application the prosecution had tendered a document setting out the chain of custody of the video. It has not been demonstrated that a copy of that document was not given to those representing the appellant. No miscarriage is apparent having regard to the manner in which the case was run. 
     
      
    (7) Other evidence(a) Reference to other videotapes89 The officer in charge of the police investigation, Detective Abbott, gave evidence that six videotapes (including Exhibit B) had been found by police in the appellant’s wardrobe during the execution of the search warrant. The videotapes were taken to Charlestown Police Station where Detective Abbott viewed them. Detective Abbott was asked what was shown on the other five videotapes. He said one was the “set up video”: Tcpt, 09/08/06, p 384. He was then asked by the prosecutor: 
     
      
       
        
        “[CROWN PROSECUTOR]: I am going to stop you, I am going to show the members that video. What about the four remaining videos?”  
        
       
       
        
        [ABBOTT]: One video contained - I believe the answer to my question may prejudice the accused.” 
        
       
      
    90 Counsel for the appellant made an application that the jury be discharged. He observed (Tcpt, p 394): 
     
      
       
        
        “It is in my submission incurable by direction, because nothing that your Honour could say would ever relieve from the jury’s mind some consideration that something was being kept from them. But more particularly, a tape which the formal officer in the case had an opinion about, which was that it was prejudicial to the accused. That invites speculation by the jury that goes absolutely to the heart of this matter, there being, as I have already said, two video tapes in evidence.” 
        
       
      
    91 His Honour determined not to discharge the jury. He indicated that some further matters should be put to the jury and that he would give a strong direction to the jury that there was evidence the material did not involve the complainant in any way. Nor did the video contain relevant material which could give rise to a criminal offence and that the jury should not speculate what was in the video (Tcpt, p 397). His Honour foreshadowed that he would give directions at the end of the trial. 
     
      
    92 Detective Abbott was re-examined as follows (Tcpt, p 399): 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Detective Abbott, you gave some evidence yesterday about videos found during the search warrant? 
         
        A. Yes, I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You reviewed that material? 
         
        A. Yes, I have. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And the video that you referred to did not involve the complainant in this trial in any way? 
         
        A. That is correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And it did not show any non-consensual sexual intercourse? 
         
        A. That is correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And it did not show any material that would give rise in any way to a criminal offence? 
         
        A. That is correct.” 
        
       
      
    93 His Honour in summing up did not give the direction which he had foreshadowed. Whether this was deliberate or an oversight cannot be ascertained from the transcript. There had been a significant time between when the evidence was given and the summing up. Neither of the parties’ legal representatives reminded his Honour of the foreshadowed direction and, accepting that by this stage the appellant’s counsel’s instructions had been withdrawn and he was represented by his solicitor, the inference to be drawn is that in the atmosphere of the trial at that stage it was not seen by those involved in the trial to be a matter of significance. It may be that a reminder of the evidence in directions may not have assisted the appellant. 
     
      
    94 When the application for a discharge of the jury was made, the trial had been proceeding for some seven days before the jury and Detective Abbott was to be the last witness in the prosecution case. To discharge the jury at that stage would have been a significant step and one to be avoided if that could be done without injustice to the appellant. His Honour clearly thought that it could be avoided. 
     
      
    95 The fact that the jury returned two “not guilty” verdicts and were unable to agree on two others suggests that this evidence was not something that influenced the jury. No miscarriage of justice has been demonstrated. 
     
      
    (b) Statements of defence witnesses96 In this Court the appellant lodged a number of statements obtained from people who knew him. There was no evidence these witnesses were not available to give evidence at the trial or that statements were not, or could not have been, obtained from them prior to the trial. One of those who provided a statement, Ms Leayr, in fact gave evidence at the trial. It was not established that the evidence of any of the persons named would constitute fresh evidence and be admissible on appeal. 
     
      
    (c) Tapes held by Court97 The appellant sought to rely on correspondence from the Registrar of the Newcastle Local Court dated 18 September 2007 in which the Registrar confirmed that videotapes produced under subpoena on 22 September 2004 at the Newcastle Local Court were still held at the Court. It was submitted this raised a question as to what tape was played in the appellant’s trial and used to convict the appellant. 
     
      
    98 However, having regard to the way the trial was conducted, including the appellant’s own evidence and the address to the jury, there was no issue as to what was depicted on the videotape, which was the only issue to which this material could relate. Accordingly, no miscarriage of justice is demonstrated in this regard. 
     
      
    (8) Error in summing up99 In the course of summing up to the jury, his Honour described the presumption of innocence, that the prosecution bears the onus of proof, that the appellant did not have to prove anything. He referred to the onus and the standard of proof on a number of other occasions and reinforced those directions when discussing the question of consent and knowledge of lack of consent. He told the jury that the appellant’s evidence was the same as that of any other witness, that the onus of proof did not shift to the appellant and that the prosecution must at all times prove his guilt. He directed the jury on the question of consent. Toward the end of his summing up, he again referred to consent and reminded the jury that the appellant did not have to prove consent and that absence of consent was a matter for the prosecution to prove. The jury could have been left in no doubt where the onus of proof lay and what the standard of proof was. 
     
      
    100 Some time after the jury had retired to consider its, the jury asked questions in the following terms (Tcpt, summing up, 23/08/06, p 102: 
     
      
       
        
        “Is there a right to attempt a sexual arousal of a partner? Do we take into account the context of their sexual relationship presented by the accused? Is there any consent implied by previous sexual activities. Referring to count one and two would you also please reference the condition of knowing there was not consent?” 
        
       
       
      The appellant’s solicitor suggested in her address that in the case of existing sexual partners consent was implied and unquestionably arises purely from the fact of the relationship (Tcpt, 22/08/06, pp 7(45)-(57)) and that in the context of the existing relationship the fact that the complainant said that the appellant could not have sex or she did not feel like it at the moment was not “real non-consent”: Tcpt, p 8(1)-(20).  
       
      
    101 His Honour answered the questions as follows (Tcpt, summing up, 23/08/06, p 111-112): 
     
      
       
        
        “In regard to Ms Randle’s address is there a right to attempt sexual arousal of a partner?’ The answer is yes. Two ‘Do we take into account the context of their sexual relationship presented by the accused?’ Now I’ll deal with that part of the question next. The answer is yes, yes but only if you accept the evidence of the accused as to their previous sexual relationship, that is, including the use of a bottle, a vibrator and a dildo. So the answer is yes, but only if you accept the evidence of the accused as to the prior sexual relationship, that is in the use of a bottle, a vibrator and a dildo. I remind you that the complainant denied that those items were ever used in their prior sexual relationship. I keep going. ‘Is there consent implied by previous sexual activities?’ And the answer is no. Consent must be considered in each allegation separately. However, if you accept the accused’s evidence as to previous sexual activities despite the denial of those matters by the complainant then sexual previous activity can be considered by you when you decide whether the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew the complainant was not consenting. Alright, so an answer to that question is - do you have copies of the questions you put to me? I’ll have them photocopied but in relation to that question I repeat the question. ‘Is there any consent implied by previous sexual activities?’ The answer is no, but it may be considered, if you accept his evidence despite her denial of same when you consider his state of mind. Do you understand? ‘Could you please reference the condition of knowing there was not consent?’ This is where we go to the accused’s state of mind and I’m going to read to you my direction about knowledge and about recklessness. In addition to proving that the sexual intercourse took place and without the consent of the complainant the Crown must also prove that the accused knew that the complainant was not consenting.” 
        
       
      
    102 It was submitted these directions were erroneous in that they reversed the onus and standard of proof in directing the jury that they could only act on the possibility that the offence was proved if they accepted the appellant’s evidence on a particular point. The fact that the complainant had consented to similar activity in the past impacted on the likelihood of whether she was indeed consenting on the instant occasion. It was open to the jury to use that fact to reason it was possible that on this occasion she also consented to sexual acts involving those objects. The error complained of lay in his Honour’s indication to consider it only insofar as the third element was concerned, namely his knowledge or belief that she was not consenting. It is submitted that the evidence of the prior sexual relationship was relevant to both an assessment of actual consent and the appellant’s perception of consent. It was submitted that his Honour’s direction was erroneous. 
     
      
    103 The possibility of the jury misunderstanding a specific direction must be assessed in the context of the conduct of the trial and the summing up as a whole. The questions in issue implied an assumption or finding that there was no express consent given by the complainant. The answers given by his Honour were not pellucid, but their intention was to emphasise that consent to the conduct complained of would not properly be inferred from the existence of a sexual relationship which had not in the past embraced such conduct. That was an element of the prosecution case and depended on acceptance of the complainant’s evidence in that respect, which the appellant sought to contradict. 
     
      
    104 Although the general direction as to burden of proof was repeated, the specific direction should have referred to an acceptance of the appellant’s evidence as casting doubt on that of the complainant. On one reading it might be thought that his Honour placed on the appellant the burden of proving the nature of the earlier relationship. There was also an elision between proof of lack of consent and proof of the appellant’s belief in that regard. It is possible, but unlikely, that the jury might have been misled or confused. The answers given by his Honour to the second and third questions followed a lengthy discussion with counsel as to what underlay the questions. In the course of that discussion the appellant’s solicitor sought a reference to the fact that the appellant had contradicted the complainant’s denial of certain items being used previously in the course of sexual activities: Tcpt, 23/08/06, pp 106-107. After the directions were agreed and given the trial judge expressly asked each lawyer if she were content with the directions. The prosecutor said, “Yes I am”; the appellant’s solicitor said, “In your Honour’s hands”: Tcpt, p 115. 
     
      
    105 After a short adjournment Ms Randle raised an issue that “consent can arise from the previous relationship if the accused has a[n] honest and reasonable belief as to consent and that belief can arise from the fact of the previous relationship”: Tcpt, p 117. Reference was made to Banditt v The Queen [2005] HCA 80; 224 CLR 262 and other authorities. His Honour declined to give any further direction, primarily because, so far as relevant, the issue had been addressed: Tcpt, p 120. No complaint was raised in relation to the present ground of appeal; nor does the appellant complain that the further direction sought by Ms Randle was not given. 
     
      
    106 In circumstances where the issues were thoroughly canvassed in the course of the summing up, no miscarriage is established by reference to the answer to the jury question in a respect which was not the subject of complaint at the trial. 
     
      
    (9) Inconsistent verdicts107 Count (2) asserted that the appellant had assaulted the complainant and at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency on the complainant. The factual basis for the charge was that the videotape showed the appellant rubbing a hand on her anal and genital regions whilst a vibrator was in the vicinity of her genitalia. 
     
      
    108 Count (3) alleged the appellant had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting. The factual basis for the charge as shown in the videotape was the insertion and movement of the dildo in the complainant’s genital area. 
     
      
    109 The appellant submitted that the acquittals on counts (2) and (3) show an inconsistency of verdicts as the acquittals meant a finding of reasonable doubt in at least one of the elements of the offence. The events occurred in reasonably close proximity in time to the use of the bottle. The irresistible inference was said to be that the jury had a reasonable doubt as to the complainant’s assertion that no dildo or vibrator was used in the past. If that was so, the jury had a reasonable doubt as to her credibility. Accordingly, in the absence of any specific evidence which bolstered count (5) in particular, it would be illogical, unreasonable and rationally inconsistent for the jury to not then have a reasonable doubt that she might have previously consented to use of a similar implement, albeit a bottle, and thus may have implicitly consented, or at least that the appellant did not hold such a belief. It was submitted that the videotape evidence pertaining to count (5) was incapable of bearing upon the existing sexual relationship of the complainant and the appellant and left open a real possibility that there was implied consent or that there was a belief in implied consent to attempt to stimulate or arouse each other whilst asleep or intoxicated, with or without implements. 
     
      
    110 In MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606, Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ said at [34]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Since the ultimate question concerns the reasonableness of the jury's decision, the significance of verdicts of not guilty on some counts in an indictment must necessarily be considered in the light of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Furthermore, it must be considered in the context of the system within which juries function, and of their role in that system. A number of features of that context were emphasised in  
        MacKenzie 
        . They include the following. First, as in the present case, where an indictment contains multiple counts, the jury will ordinarily be directed to give separate consideration to each count. This will often be accompanied by a specific instruction that the evidence of a witness may be accepted in whole or in part. Secondly, emphasis will invariably be placed upon the onus of proof borne by the prosecution. In jurisdictions where unanimity is required, such as New South Wales, every juror must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of every element in the offence. In the case of sexual offences, of which there may be no objective evidence, some, or all, of the members of a jury may require some supporting evidence before they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the word of a complainant. This may not be unreasonable. It does not necessarily involve a rejection of the complainant's evidence. A juror might consider it more probable than not that a complainant is telling the truth but require something additional before reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. The criminal trial procedure is designed to reinforce, in jurors, a sense of the seriousness of their task, and of the heavy burden of proof undertaken by the prosecution. A verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that a complainant has been disbelieved, or a want of confidence in the complainant. It may simply reflect a cautious approach to the discharge of a heavy responsibility. In addition to want of supporting evidence, other factors that might cause a jury to draw back from reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt in relation to some aspects of a complainant's evidence might be that the complainant has shown some uncertainty as to matters of detail, or has been shown to have a faulty recollection of some matters, or has been shown otherwise to be more reliable about some parts of his or her evidence than about others. Thirdly, there is the consideration stated by King CJ in R v Kirkman, and referred to in later cases: it may appear to a jury, that, although a number of offences have been alleged, justice is met by convicting an accused of some only. And there may be an interaction between this consideration and the two matters earlier discussed.” 
        
       
      
    111 In the present case such directions were given. The jury was also directed that each count had to be considered separately: Tcpt, summing up, 22/08/06, p 12. This was repeated towards the end of the summing up (Tcpt, p 98). 
     
      
    112 In MacKenzie v The Queen [1996] HCA 35; 190 CLR 348 at 367 it was stated:  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “… if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    113 The activity the subject of count (2) lasted approximately nine seconds. There was no movement of the complainant and no overt act of objection. In the context of a continuing sexual relationship between consenting adults, the jury may well have had a doubt as to whether the appellant believed that the complainant was consenting to this activity. 
     
      
    114 As to count (3), the complainant already had the vibrator in her vagina. The appellant moved it out slightly and then re-inserted it. The prosecution did not rely upon the placement of the vibrator as part of the charge. Without rejecting the complainant’s evidence about the previous use of implements, the jury may have been prepared to give the appellant the benefit of the doubt on the question of whether he believed he was entitled to attempt to sexually arouse her but having regard to her words and actions, the jury may well have taken a different view when it came to the insertion of the wine bottle. He agreed that she had said “don’t” twice before he inserted the neck of the bottle, that she had said “ouch” when he did so and that he had pushed the bottle in hard; Tcpt, 15/08/06, 610(34) and 611(19). The jury might have rejected this as an act of attempted sexual arousal or that there was a possibility that he believed she was consenting to this act in the circumstances depicted. 
     
      
    115 The jury may well have entertained no doubt on the question of consent in relation to count 5 because of what they saw and heard on the videotape. The jury may well have concluded that it was clear that the complainant was not consenting and that the appellant knew it. The complainant’s actions and noises indicated clearly that there was no consent.(10) Unsafe verdict; miscarriage of justice116 These global grounds related back to the earlier substantive grounds of appeal discussed herein. Additional substantive matters were not raised, nor was there any additional force to be obtained from viewing the specific complaints cumulatively. 
     
      
    (11) Conclusion117 For the above reasons, the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
    (12) The sentence appeal118 As previously stated, the appellant was found guilty of having sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent, knowing she was not consenting contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 14 years. A standard non-parole period of seven years is applicable. The appellant was sentenced for that offence to imprisonment for a non-parole period of five years commencing on 17 July 2006 and expiring on 16 July 2011 with a further term of one year eight months to commence at the expiration of the non-parole period and expire on 16 March 2013. 
     
      
    119 His Honour recorded the facts in his remarks on sentence, including that on the videotape (Tcpt, sentence, 01/12/06, p 5):  
     
      
       
        
        “[T]he offender is seen to pick up the wine bottle and push into the genital area of the complainant. Thereafter the offender is seen to manipulate the bottle in the complainant’s genital area, despite the complainant by words and actions, indicating to him that she did not wish him to undertake the activity. These acts constitute count 5 of the indictment in respect of which the offender was convicted.” 
        
       
      
    120 His Honour concluded that the offence was within the mid range of the scale of objective seriousness. He said (at p 6): 
     
      
       
        
        “Insofar as the offence is concerned, the offender in a cruel and callous way took advantage of the complainant, when she was either asleep, drunk or unconscious, by inserting a wine bottle into her vagina. The complainant, when roused from her sleep, made it abundantly clear by her words and actions that she did not consent to the offender inserting the bottle into her vagina. The videotape reveals that after the offender first placed the bottle into the complainant’s vagina she in a loud voice said ‘Ouch’ and the offender appears to push the bottle even harder into her vagina. The offender selfishly dealt with the complainant in order to gratify his own sexual desires. This community will not tolerate persons who deal with their sexual partners in the manner in which the offender dealt with his partner whilst she was either asleep, drunk or in an unconscious state. The sentence that I impose today must contain strong elements of individual and general deterrence.” 
        
       
      
    121 His Honour found that the appellant did not indicate any contrition whatsoever and the impact on the victim was considerable. 
     
      
    122 His Honour had regard to the appellant’s record which went back to 1988. In particular his Honour referred to the fact that in 1989 he was dealt with for offensive behaviour (street fighting), that in March 1990 he was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum term of two years six months, with an additional term of 10 months, for the offence of sexual intercourse without consent; in 2000 he was dealt with for common assault, in 2003 he was dealt with again for assault, in October 2003 he was dealt with for the offence of resist or hinder police officer in the execution of his duty and assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty and, in 2004, he was dealt with for the offence of maliciously damaging property: Tcpt, pp 7-8. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “When I consider the rehabilitation of the offender I must have regard to the offender’s previous offences. In that regard the offender has in the past demonstrated that he was capable of committing acts of violence on citizens and on police and further that he was capable of sexually assaulting an acquaintance. Sharon Bentley has been in a relationship since early 2005. Ms Bentley gave evidence that the offender has reduced his drinking, is not taking drugs and has acted in an exemplary manner with her and her children.” 
        
       
      
    123 His Honour considered the appellant’s partner’s evidence pleasing but said he had to consider the criminal record of the offender and his capacity to drink large quantities of alcohol in the absence of any guarantee that he will continue the good work on his release from prison. His Honour noted the report of a consulting psychologist: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is apparent that Mr Gillies has suffered long standing psychological problems which are in urgent need of assistance.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour noted it was clear that the appellant suffers from depression and that was a matter to be considered by him. His Honour was not asked to and did not find special circumstances. 
       
      
    124 The appellant had been granted bail subject to a number of conditions including a condition that when he was at large he was to be in the company of a security guard whose fees were to be paid for by the appellant. His Honour considered this amounted to an extra curial punishment by virtue of the substantial payments made by the appellant to the security guard. The appellant was declared bankrupt following his arrest. 
     
      
    125 His Honour rejected a submission from the prosecutor that there was an aggravating feature in that he had abused a position of trust.  
     
      
    (a) Fact finding on sentence126 The appellant submitted that his Honour erred in his assessment “and is unclear in the way of his Honour expressing his opinion as to the mid range to what scale of sentence be imposed on the appellant.” It was further submitted that this Court should intervene in this quite obviously very punitive sentence. 
     
      
    127 However, the facts found by his Honour were open to him as was the conclusion that those facts brought the matter within the mid range for offences of that kind. The standard non-parole period was seven years. His Honour imposed a non-parole period of two years less than the standard period. This ground fails. 
     
      
    (b) Special circumstances128 The appellant submits that the failure by his counsel to submit that there were special circumstances demonstrates flagrant incompetence and that he should have submitted that he be given credit for the cooperative manner in which the trial was conducted by the defence. He may also have submitted that a special circumstance was that the complainant and he were in an existing sexual relationship. 
     
      
    129 The fact that the complainant and the appellant were in an existing sexual relationship cannot mitigate the offence in this case. 
     
      
    130 The manner in which the trial was conducted was no different to the way many trials are conducted. A measure of cooperation usually helps matters to go more smoothly for all concerned. There is nothing unusual in this case. None of these matters constituted special circumstances. There was no error on the part of his Honour. 
     
      
    (c) Utilitarian benefit of conduct of defence131 The appellant submitted that he had made significant admissions, consented to the tender of a large number of statements in evidence, did not cross-examine the preponderance of the prosecution witnesses and in effect only litigated the issue of substantial impairment. These matters provide the basis for a finding that the appellant’s conduct of the trial facilitated the course of justice.  
     
      
    132 In R v Doff [2005] NSWCCA 119; 54 ASCR 200, the Court said at [58(c)]: 
     
      
       
        
        “the efficient way in which the appellant’s trial was conducted, including the making of extensive admissions, which while not demonstrating contrition or remorse, did show a willingness to facilitate the course of justice by refraining from resort to dilatory and technical objections of no merit. We do not see why this should not be taken into account for the purposes of sentencing, particularly in a case where there was a single issue of substance which it was appropriate for decision by a jury.” 
        
       
       
      It was submitted that the sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account the utilitarian benefit of the manner in which the appellant conducted his trial. 
       
      
    133 No submission to this effect was made to the sentencing judge. A perusal of the record shows only one statement was tendered by consent, that of Dr Clarke. Dr Edwards was the only witness not cross-examined. The only admission was that made in Exhibit 15 regarding the authenticity of the videotape. It is not understood what is meant by the statement “in effect only litigated the issue of substantial impairment”. There was no such issue in the trial. 
     
      
    134 The admission made (which is now challenged) saved some time. It recognised the reality that however the videotape came to be produced it accurately depicted what had occurred. However, the reduction of the non-parole period from the standard seven years to five years, having regard to his Honour’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence, provides adequately for any discount for some time-saving that may have occurred by reason of the making of the admission regarding the videotape. 
     
      
    135 This is a court of error. Its powers in respect of an appeal on sentence are prescribed by s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. The court will interfere with the sentence imposed in the court below only if it be shown that the sentencing judge was in error and then only if it forms the positive opinion that some other, less severe, sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at [79]; House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499. 
     
      
    136 Error has not been established, nor has it been established that some other sentence, less severe, is warranted in law and should have been passed. There should be a grant of leave to appeal against sentence, but the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    Orders137 The following orders should be made: 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave granted to appeal against conviction (to the extent necessary) and sentence. 
       
       
      (2) Dismiss the appeal in respect of the conviction and sentence.

   JUDGMENT1. Glenn Andrew Luscombe has been described as an immature man who has a sexual preoccupation with underage girls. He has confessed to two offences of possessing child pornography. It is my job now to sentence him for those two offences.2. Today he pleaded guilty to the two charges. The first is that between 1 January 2006 and 18 August 2006 he had child pornography in his possession. He had 4,800 images and six video clips. The second charge is that between 1 July 2006 and 5 December 2006 he had child pornography in his possession, namely, eight images and five video clips. They are both offences against s 91H(3) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty is five years imprisonment. 3. Mr Luscombe pleaded guilty at what Mr Jilek, who appears for the prosecution, agrees was the earliest available opportunity. 4. I need to make some assessment of just how serious this offence was compared to other offences of the same type. 5. Somebody who knew Mr Luscombe came into possession - legally - of Mr Luscombe’s computer. That person discovered child pornography on the computer and handed it over to the police. This was at the end of 2006. Police examined the computer and found further images of child pornography. He was arrested on 10 October 2007 and denied any knowledge. However, a fortnight later he confessed that he had the images on his computer. He was interviewed and made full admissions. He admitted to being sexually attracted to young girls and became addicted to using the internet to download images.6. The facts of the case which are part of exhibit A record that there were no fewer than 4,800 images and thirteen videos of child pornography. On the COPINE scale the majority of the material was between level 3 and level 7. Level 3 is erotica and level 7 explicit sexual activity. The scale goes to 10. Hence there was no material in the worst category. The material which is the subject of the second charge is more serious than the material in the first charge. 7. The material in the first charge involved items such as young girls between three years and fourteen years in various states of exposure, young teenage girls self masturbating and exposing their genitalia in erotically suggestive poses. The material included young girls in the range of ages between three or four and about fourteen. 8. The material which is the subject of the second charge included an item involving cunnilingus of a baby or very young child’s vagina by a male and images of two girls aged twelve or thirteen engaged in self masturbation - masturbation of each other - and being touched by an adult male. It also included two teenage girls engaging in sexual activity including digital penetration and cunnilingus. One image depicted a female child holding onto an erect penis and another showing a young naked female sitting on the stomach of an adult male looking at his erect penis. 9. This short description provides some idea of the disgusting material which Mr Luscombe chose to download in one way or another and to keep or possess in one way or another. 10. In assessing how serious these offences are compared to other offences Mr Leary, who appears for Mr Luscombe, draws my attention to the criteria listed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in its judgment in R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370. By reference to those criteria which appear at [99] Mr Leary points out first that the COPINE range is between 3 and 7 and so does not include sexual assaults or grossly offensive material. He acknowledges that some images on the subject of the second count do appear to include what would be regarded as sexual assault. The material on the subject of count 1, though, all falls within the level 3 to 7 range. He argues that neither count contains any items which fall into the worst category.11. I note from a very helpful schedule of cases involving similar offences which Mr Leary has provided that other offences of this kind include features such as: nearly 42,000 files; material being at the upper end of seriousness; a victim being gagged and tortured; images of naked male children performing anal sex on other children; 100,000 deleted images; material included in the worst class; 35,000 images.12. Those figures are also relevant to the second criterion referred to in Gent which is the number of images or items of material possessed. Clearly the material in this case - although ranging up to item 7 so far as count 1 is concerned and perhaps a little further so far as count 2 is concerned - is not present in the significant numbers, or in the depravity, of the images which accompany some of the other cases. 13. There is no evidence of any attempted sale or further distribution. It was clearly for personal use. There was no attempt to delete any of the material nor was there any evidence of any network that Mr Luscombe was a member of. There is no evidence of any profit. To my mind these features indicate that the offences lie at the lower end of the range of objective seriousness for crimes such as these.14. Mr Luscombe has a criminal record. It is not directly relevant to these offences. It involves stealing and having goods in custody. He was first convicted when he was nineteen and then attracted two further convictions aged twenty-eight and thirty-one. He is now aged forty-five. 15. I have had the benefit of a detailed pre-sentence report including a psychological pre-sentence report. He is ineligible for a periodic detention order and suitable for a community service order, but there is no work placement available. The psychologists who assessed him within the Probation and Parole Service expressed the view that he appeared to fall in the moderate to low range for sexual re-offending. It thought that Mr Luscombe’s “limited insight, relationship deficits, sexual preoccupation and social isolation all appear to have impacted on his offending behaviour.” It thought that he would benefit from further therapeutic intervention and made some recommendations for meeting the needs which are represented in his criminal behaviour. 16. There is also a report from Dr Stephen Allnutt, a psychiatrist. Dr Allnutt concluded that Mr Luscombe was not manifesting any significant symptoms of any major mental disorder. He thought that he has at least an underlying paedophilic interest. Dr Allnutt thought that Mr Luscombe was in the process of developing insight and understanding and would benefit from pursuing formal psychological treatment. Dr Allnutt thought that he would be able to pursue and meaningfully engage in a sex offender rehabilitation program perhaps accompanied by a sex drive suppressant medication. Dr Allnutt made some recommendations as well. 17. As I said, Mr Luscombe has pleaded guilty and will receive the benefit in due course of that plea. There is no indication - so far as remorse is currently defined - of any remorse which I can find in his favour. He has had some difficulties to confront in his past. A particular factor which impacted upon him was the death of his mother and having to move out of home. 18. It has been drawn to my attention, perhaps because it is relevant to his rehabilitation, that later this week he will face charges in the Local Court involving child sexual assault. Mr Leary argued that bearing in mind the need for general and specific deterrence a suspended sentence might be the appropriate sentence in a case such as this; if not a suspended sentence then the custodial sentence should be structured so that the period on parole is longer than it would normally be because of special circumstances which I could find. They would be the fact that his client is spending his first time in custody and that his rehabilitation would be enhanced by supervision on release. It is also likely that he would serve any time in custody on protection.19. Mr Jilek who appears for the prosecution points out the importance of general deterrence in cases such as this. He refers to the passage quoted by Judge Berman SC in R v Saddler [2008] NSWDC 48 at [49] where his Honour quotes a passage from a Canadian court in R v Stroempl (1995) 105 CCC (3rd ed.) 187 at 191. I propose to quote the same passage - 
     
      
      “ 
      The possession of child pornography is a very important contributing element in the general problem of child pornography. In a very real sense, possessors such as the appellant instigate the production and distribution of child pornography - and the production of child pornography, in turn, frequently involves direct child abuse in one form or another. The trial judge was right in his observation that if the courts, through the imposition of appropriate sanctions, stifled the activities of the prospective purchasers and collectors of child pornography, this may go some distance to smother the market for child pornography altogether. In turn, this would substantially reduce the motivation to produce child pornography in the first place 
      .” 
       
       
      
    20. I also adopt in this case observations made by Judge Berman in Saddler in [73] and [74] which I quote - 
     
      
      “ 
      It almost goes without saying that many of the victims were vulnerable because of their age, and that because of the number of separate items covered by each offence, each offence involved multiple victims and a series of criminal acts.  
       
       
      I am also satisfied that the offence was planned in the sense that the offender set about to obtain the child pornography over the internet and did so.” 
       
       
      
    21. I place significant weight in this case on the need for general deterrence which is emphasised in so many of the authorities in this area. Mr Jilek agreed that there was no suggestion that the material would be distributed and he accepted that there were special circumstances warranting a departure from the usual ratio between a non-parole period and the parole period. He suggested that the prospects of rehabilitation were qualified in this case. He submitted specifically that a suspended sentence would not be adequate because of the number of images and videos and material.22. It is important to observe, as Mr Leary pointed out in reply, that the children depicted in the material were not physically abused as victims by Mr Luscombe. However, by purchasing or downloading or possessing the material the children depicted were victimised yet again by their images being exposed to another human being. 23. I have formed the opinion that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate in this case. I have considered all possible alternatives under s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The reason that no other penalty is appropriate is the importance of general deterrence in cases such as this which is emphasised by the authorities. 24. For the first offence which is the less serious offence I would regard an appropriate penalty to be in the region of a fixed term of six months imprisonment. However, because Mr Luscombe has pleaded guilty I propose to set a fixed term of four months imprisonment. 25. For the second and more serious charge I would regard an appropriate penalty as being sixteen months imprisonment. However, because he has pleaded guilty I propose to allow a full discount of twenty-five per cent and reduce that penalty to twelve months imprisonment.26. The non-parole period which would normally accompany a twelve month sentence of imprisonment would be nine months. I propose to reduce that nine month period to six months because of the special circumstances which were urged upon me by Mr Leary and which I accept. HIS HONOUR: In a moment I am going to sentence you, Mr Luscombe, and just before I do I will ask Mr Leary and Mr Jilek: I am sentencing him obviously to effectively twelve months with a non-parole period of six months. That means that I make the parole order so I will be asking for your assistance for appropriate conditions of parole. Mr Luscombe, if you would stand up.JILEK: Before your Honour does, if I might just, there was one issue that I neglected to draw to your attention and my friend mentioned it to me this afternoon. He has already served twenty-seven days in custody.HIS HONOUR: You’re quite right and I thank you, I saw that on the papers.JILEK: So there should be a further adjustment.HIS HONOUR: Yes, there should. That’s about a month so I’m going to fix a term of five months and the--JILEK: Maybe in respect of count 1 if your Honour wishes to do it on a global basis say instead of the four months that would make it three months.HIS HONOUR: Just say that again?JILEK: In the four months term for count 1 giving him an allowance so it would be three months.HIS HONOUR: Yes, sorry, you’re quite right.LEARY: Would it be easier for your Honour to do what your Honour was intending to do and then commence the sentence from twenty-seven days ago?HIS HONOUR: No, I don’t want to do that, I want to commence it today but I’m just trying to work out what impact it has on the head sentence of twelve months, probably none, I’ll just fix a non-parole period of five months. Does that sound right?LEARY: Yes.JILEK: Yes.HIS HONOUR: Okay. 27. Mr Luscombe, for the first offence of possessing child pornography between 1 January 2006 and 18 August 2006 I sentence you to three months imprisonment to commence today which is 15 December 2008 and to conclude on 14 March 2009. For the second offence of possessing child pornography between 1 July 2006 and 5 December 2006 I set a non-parole period of five months to commence today 15 December 2008 and to conclude on 14 May 2009. The balance of the term will be seven months to commence on 15 May 2009 and to conclude on 14 December 2009.28. Under s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I make an order directing your release on parole on 15 May 2009. The conditions of your parole will be as follows: one, that you are to be of good behaviour, two, that you are to notify the Parole Authority of any change in your residential address, three, that you appear in court if called upon to do so, and four, that you accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and accept all their reasonable recommendations and directions.Gentlemen?LEARY: Yes, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Who supervises him, the Probation and Parole Service or the Parole Authority?LEARY: Well, your Honour, he would be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service but if he breaches parole he would be called up before the Parole Authority.HIS HONOUR: Yes. What should be the conditions?JILEK: Your Honour, if I could suggest that he obey all reasonable directions of the Probation and Parole Service concerning attendance and participation in programs and counselling.HIS HONOUR: Related to sex offending.JILEK: Thank you.HIS HONOUR: With particular reference to any programs and counselling related to sex offending, Mr Leary, do you have any suggestions?LEARY: No, your Honour, I think that’s a fairly global condition that will lead the Service to what your Honour is expecting and also Mr Luscombe to what his obligations might be.HIS HONOUR: Yes. Now, gentlemen, are the figures right? That’s the first thing and the second thing is whether I need to make any additional orders before I explain the sentences to Mr Luscombe.JILEK: The figures appear to be correct to me.LEARY: I believe so, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: You both agree, all right. Are there any other orders I need to make?JILEK: Your Honour, there is one further order and that is that the material being the images, the video clips, et cetera be destroyed but I am asking that your Honour make the order on the basis that it not be destroyed before 30 June 2009 should there be any appeal or anything like that and the material will be held by the police until that date.29. I order that the material, the child pornography which is the subject of both charges be destroyed but not before 30 June 2009.No other orders?JILEK: No, your Honour.30. Mr Luscombe, I have given you a gaol sentence. The law is very strong on child pornography for the reasons which I have just explained. It is very important that people don’t do this because it just promotes the trade in child pornography, anyone who engages in it. I have given you two sentences. The first sentence is a three month sentence from today until 14 March. The second sentence is a twelve month sentence but with a non-parole period that you’ve got to stay in gaol from today until 14 May. Your first date that you should be released by my order is 14 May 2009. Then you’re on parole for seven months. Whilst you’re on parole there are conditions. You’ve got to be of good behaviour, you’ve got to stay out of trouble, any sort of trouble, but particularly this sort of trouble. If you’re called to come to court you’ve got to come to court. You’ve got to notify the Parole Authority if you change your address, and the final one most importantly, which is to help you, is that you accept supervision from the Probation and Parole Service and if they make any reasonable recommendations or directions to assist you, particularly with counselling, then you are to accept their recommendations. Do you understand all of that?OFFENDER: Yes, I do.HIS HONOUR: Okay, is there anything else Mr Leary or Mr Jilek?JILEK: No thank you, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: All right. Thank you both for your assistance. I notice it’s 25 to 5 and the monitor and the Corrective Services officers and the court officer and my associate have all been here without complaints. They had little choice but they facilitated justice being able to be administered. I will now adjourn.

      Crimes Act 
       1900. 
       
      
    2 He was arrested on 24 February 2007 and has been in custody since that date. 
     
      
    3 On 4 September 2007, he was committed for trial on the charge of murder. 
     
      
    4 On 2 November 2007, the Director of Public Prosecutions presented an indictment charging the offender with the murder of Katrina Ann McMahon. 
     
      
    5 On 7 October 2008 at Lismore, on the first day proceedings were listed for hearing, the offender entered a plea of not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter by way of provocation. The Crown accepted the plea in full satisfaction of the indictment. The proceedings on that occasion were adjourned to Sydney for the purposes of a sentence hearing. 
     
      
    6 By his plea, the offender accepts that he acted in a violent fashion towards the deceased with intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    7 On 7 October 2008, the Crown tendered a number of documents all constituting Exhibit A, they being:- 
     
      
       
      (1) Agreed statement of facts. 
       
       
      (2) 000 call (recorded) and transcript. 
       
       
      (3) Audio tape of recorded interview between Sergeant Campbell and the offender. 
       
       
      (4) Closed circuit television recording from the Australian Hotel, Ballina. 
       
       
      (5) Criminal history. 
       
       
      Facts 
       
      
    8 The offender was born on 7 December 1966. He was, accordingly, approximately 40 years of age at the date of the offence committed by him.  
     
      
    9 According to the statement of agreed facts, the offender and the deceased had been in a de facto relationship since 2000. They had two children, one aged four and the other two months respectively, as at 24 February 2007. 
     
      
    10 The offender and the deceased had a long history of drug addiction. The deceased was on a registered methadone programme. 
     
      
    11 The relationship is described as dysfunctional, predominantly because of the constant and excessive drug use by the offender and the deceased. Whilst loving at times, their relationship was marred by periods of violence towards each other. 
     
      
    12 Since 2003, on several occasions, the deceased had been observed by witnesses to have facial and other injuries. The deceased gave conflicting versions as to how these injuries were caused. 
     
      
    13 Following the birth of their youngest child on 21 December 2006, the relationship between the offender and the deceased deteriorated. The offender complained that the deceased was not at home enough and was using drugs instead of caring for the children. The offender also suspected that the deceased was being unfaithful. 
     
      
    14 The deceased complained to some people about the offender’s violence and drug use and stated that she felt unsafe at home and that she was afraid that the offender would obtain custody of their children. The deceased told other people that everything was alright between them. 
     
      
    15 On 20 February 2007, that is, about three days before her death, the deceased met one Trevor May at the Australian Hotel in Ballina. At that time she was distressed, having lost money on the poker machines and said that she was afraid to go home. Mr May bought the deceased a drink, they returned to his home where she stayed overnight. They had sexual intercourse and she left in the morning, stating that she was going to stay with her sister-in-law. 
     
      
    16 On 21 February 2007, the offender and the deceased visited his sister, Kerry O’Connor. When it was time to leave, the deceased started to cry and said “I’m scared Kez, I don’t want to go home”. Ms O’Connor said that she could stay and the deceased replied “No, I’ll be okay”. 
     
      
    17 Later that day, the deceased was at the Australian Hotel and was seen with a cracked lip. She told an associate that the offender had hit her. 
     
      
    18 On 22 February 2007, the deceased was at the Australian Hotel. She was seen to have what appeared to be dry blood in both ears. At about 11.00 pm on that day, 22 February 2007, a neighbour heard an angry male voice yelling from the direction of the home of the offender and the deceased. Another voice yelled back but the neighbour was unable to tell if the voice was male or female. The shouting lasted for about 20 minutes. 
     
      
    19 In the morning of 23 February 2007, the deceased went to a pharmacy to obtain her daily dose of methadone. She was observed by some staff at the pharmacy to have dried blood from one ear and to be “out of it” or “not with it”. The pharmacist observed a faint bruise on the bridge of the deceased’s nose. 
     
      
    20 Ms McMahon left the pharmacy and went to the Australian Hotel. She did not drink any alcohol but was observed to be distressed and later to be tired and “out of it” as if she was affected by drugs. A number of witnesses saw dried blood in the deceased’s left ear and at least one of them tried to persuade her to go to hospital. A witness who offered to take her to hospital said she was crippled over and holding her left side. When asked what happened, she replied “Brad beat me up again and I don’t want to go back to him again. I don’t want to go back this time”. She declined to go to the hospital. 
     
      
    21 At midday on 23 February 2007, the offender arrived at the Australian Hotel carrying their baby under his arm and assaulted the deceased by striking her on the face in front of witnesses. That assault was recorded on CCTV at the hotel. The CCTV footage was played on the Court television screen during the sentence hearing. Witnesses state that the offender was very angry and said to the deceased before hitting her that she had taken his tablets or “zanies”. The deceased denied stealing them. The offender was also heard to complain that the deceased should be at home looking after their children. 
     
      
    22 Several people tried to intervene as the offender grabbed the deceased. One witnesses heard the deceased say “Don’t hit me, I have a baby”. A friend of the offender stepped in and took the baby out to the car. 
     
      
    23 The offender dragged the deceased out of the hotel. A bar employee called the police and ambulance. The employee went to the car and told the offender’s father to wait for the police and ambulance but he drove away once the deceased and the offender were in the car. 
     
      
    24 The offender and the deceased went to the house of the offender’s parents. She was slurring her speech and not giving responsive answers. Her sister, Deborah Bell, arrived home and agreed to take care of the two children that day. She saw that the deceased had dried blood in one ear. Ms Bell stated the offender was pleading and yelling at the deceased to wake up. Ms Bell said that the deceased could not hear him. 
     
      
    25 At 1.20 pm, the offender rang the Riverlands Alcohol and Drug Service and said that the deceased had double-dosed on methadone. He went on to say that he was unwilling to leave the deceased alone with the baby. The offender was advised to contact the Department of Community Services. The Riverlands worker spoke to the deceased. Her speech was slurred and she was unable to hold a conversation. The worker made an urgent referral to the Department of Community Services. 
     
      
    26 The offender and the deceased stayed at the home of the offender’s parents until approximately 2.30 pm when they returned to their own home. At that time, the deceased required the offender’s assistance to walk the short distance to their home. 
     
      
    27 At about 3.00 pm, Ms Bell went to the home to obtain items for the children. The deceased was seen slumped on the lounge, sweating and the offender was rambling. 
     
      
    28 During the course of the afternoon and evening, neighbours heard a male voice yelling at different times from the home. Occasionally, some witnesses heard a female voice. 
     
      
    29 About 3.00 pm, a witness outside the home heard a male voice yelling angrily and a soft female voice coming from the house. In response to something said by the female speaker, the male screamed “we can’t ‘cause we got no fucking money”. At around 3.30 pm, a witness heard a male voice yelling for about 20 minutes. Occasionally a female voice responded. 
     
      
    30 At 3.15 pm, an officer from the Department of Community Services called on the offender. He told her he did not want the Department involved and the baby was safe. The offender’s speech was slurred and the officer believed he was under the influence of something. The officer ended the call when she was unable to get responsive answers from him. The officer called police and asked them to check on the children. The officer contacted a number of family members and after confirming the children were safe, she rang the police and told them they were no longer needed to visit the premises. 
     
      
    31 At 7.12 pm, Ms Bell called the offender and asked if the deceased was okay. He replied that she had been getting “smashed and sleeping around”. The offender talked about the baby and his daughter from another relationship. He was not making any sense and when Ms Bell asked to speak to the deceased, he continued to babble. Ms Bell heard moaning in the background which was similar to noises she had heard the deceased make earlier in the day. The phone went dead. Ms Bell tried to call back but could not get through. 
     
      
    32 At about 10.20 pm on 23 February 2007, a 000 call was received from the offender advising that his partner was dead and that she had been hyperventilating. 
     
      
    33 On the attendance of police and ambulance officers, the deceased was found lying naked on the lounge room floor with the offender attempting cardio pulmonary resuscitation. The ambulance officers confirmed that the deceased was dead and the offender was removed from the house and a crime scene established. 
     
      
    34 The offender told a police officer that the deceased had taken 60 mls of methadone and 9.00 am and then 60 mls of methadone by needle at 9.30. Police observed a number of injuries on the deceased and blood and faeces on the deceased and in various places in the house. They observed that the offender appeared affected by some substance but did not smell alcohol on him. 
     
      
    35 Police and other witnesses observed the offender’s speech sounded affected, even when sober. Accordingly, it was difficult to gauge the degree of his intoxication when he was drug affected. However, the custody manager at the police station observed that the offender was well intoxicated. 
     
      
    36 When the ERISP was played in Court at the sentencing hearing, the offender’s voice sounded somewhat drug-affected. 
     
      
    37 When interviewed, the offender told police that the deceased had left the house that morning to see a mutual acquaintance over a $10 loan. He received an SMS message advising that the deceased was at the Australian Hotel “off her face” and he went to collect her. He told police that they argued, she came home with him to his parents’ home. 
     
      
    38 He told police that he assisted her to walk home and they continued to argue when they got home. He admitted slapping her at least twice to the face and that he slapped her right thigh. He said he was upset because of the deceased’s sexual behaviour. 
     
      
    39 Around dark, the offender said that the deceased hyperventilated and defecated as he tried to assist her. He then took her to the bathroom where she undressed and he assisted her to bathe. 
     
      
    40 The offender told police that the deceased put on fresh clothes and they started arguing again. He went to make a cup of coffee. When he turned to look back, she had “gone white”. He attempted cardio pulmonary resuscitation and then called 000. 
     
      
    41 The offender denied any intention to cause the deceased harm. He said the only injury he caused was a minor laceration to her right ear. He alleged that any other injuries on the deceased were the result of her falling off her bicycle. 
     
      
    42 The offender told police that the deceased had consumed at least 125 mls of methadone and 25 Zanax tablets and that the drugs contributed to her death. 
     
      
    43 He was arrested at 1.30 am on 24 February 2007 and taken to Ballina Police Station where he was charged with maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm upon the deceased and assaulting her occasioning bodily harm. 
     
      
    44 He underwent forensic procedures at the police station. After receiving legal advice, he declined to participate in a further formal interview. 
     
      
    45 On 1 March 2007, he was charged with murder after police received advice from the pathologist, Dr Nadesan, who performed the autopsy. 
     
      
    46 The agreed statement of facts sets out the details concerning the crime scene, in particular, the lounge, main bedroom, hallway and bathroom. The lounge and main bedroom were said to be very untidy and items strewn about the floor and furniture. The children’s bedroom, in contrast, was neat and tidy. 
     
      
    47 Blood stains were found in the lounge room, the main bedroom, hallway and bathroom. Faecal stains were observed in the lounge room and main bedroom. The blood and faecal stains were on the floors, furniture and other items in the room. 
     
      
    48 A drawer knob on a set of drawers in the main bedroom had a clump of long dark hair caught on it. 
     
      
    49 Burnt paper was found in the kitchen sink. Prescription drugs and needles were found in the house. 
     
      
    50 Next to the deceased, was a metal bar, approximately 50 centimetres in length and two to three centimetres in diameter. 
     
      
    51 The autopsy revealed the death was due to intra-abdominal bleeding. The Crown pathologist expressed the opinion that the acute subdural bleeding would have been fatal if the deceased had not died from the abdominal bleeding. 
     
      
    52 The pathologist retained for the offender agreed that the cause of death was intra-abdominal bleeding but disputed that death could have been caused by the subdural bleeding. 
     
      
    53 According to the agreed facts, the intra-abdominal bleeding and the acute subdural bleeding was due to “blunt trauma”. 
     
      
    54 There were 76 separate injuries observed and the more severe contusions were located on the head and on the face. The age of some injuries varied in some in particular, the parchment injuries, were occasioned post-mortem. It was not possible to isolate the cause of all of the injuries. However, it was accepted that some of the injuries were caused by the offender. 
     
      
    55 The intra-abdominal bleeding was from a spleen injury. In the opinion of the pathologist, the bleeding would have caused drowsiness and then a loss of consciousness and then cardiac arrest. The deceased would have been bleeding from the abdomen for some hours and the spleen injury was fresh and recent. 
     
      
    56 The head showed multiple contusions scattered on the face and scalp with bleeding on both sides. 
     
      
    57 In the opinion of the pathologist, this was consistent with heavy blunt force such as punching or kicking. These injuries occurred at the same time as injury to the spleen. 
     
      
    58 The subdural haemorrhage was due to sheering forces due to multiple blunt trauma to the head. 
     
      
    59 The injuries, in the pathologist’s opinion, were consistent with the deceased having been grabbed by the hair and her head being repeatedly banged into the floor, wall or such other hard surface. 
     
      
    60 Dr Judith Perl, pharmacologist, stated that the blood concentration of the deceased for the benzodiazepine, alprazolam (trade names for Zanax) was just above the upper end of the therapeutic range. 
     
      
    61 Dr Perl would have expected a high concentration if the deceased had consumed 25 tablets of Zanax (the offender having claimed that the deceased stole 25 of his Zanax tablets). 
     
      
    62 Dr Perl was of the opinion that none of the drug concentrations found in the deceased would have contributed to her death, although alprazolam and methadone would have produced some impairment. 
     
      
    63 Given the deceased’s chronic use of methadone and benzodiazepines, Dr Perl would not have expected any significant impairment. 
     
      
       
      Psychiatric evidence 
       
      
    64 Mr R Jankowski of counsel, who appeared on behalf of the offender, tendered a medical report of Dr Olav Nielssen, psychiatrist dated 2 December 2008. Dr Nielssen interviewed the offender at Parklea Correctional Centre on 28 August 2008 and again by audio visual link on the date of his report, 2 December 2008.  
     
      
    65 The offender did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. Accordingly, the source of the detail of the history of his background and earlier history is that to be found in Dr Nielssen’s report at pp.5 to 6.  
     
      
    66 He provided a history of substance abuse and the development of an addiction including, in particular, the use of benzodiazepine medication. He claimed that addiction developed after he had met the deceased. 
     
      
    67 Dr Nielssen made a diagnosis of substance dependence and abuse disorder on the basis of the history provided to him. 
     
      
    68 The details of the history of drug taking is set out in his report (pp. 5, 7). 
     
      
    69 Dr Nielssen said there was no evidence from the history or the findings on examination of significant brain damage or of any underlying psychotic illness. He noted the offender’s report of having experienced periods of depression. He made a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depressed mood, or a clinically significant level of depression arising from a life event based on the offender’s account of being depressed and his presentation at the time of the initial interview. The life event appeared to be the loss of the deceased and his subsequent imprisonment and separation from his children. 
     
      
    70 The offender reported to him that he had had a total of 10 mg of alprazolam on the day of the offence, which he claimed was 4 mg more than his usual dose. Dr Nielssen noted that the offender was able to give a fairly lucid account of the events to the police during an interview conducted the following day, although he reported to having no memory of having done so. 
     
      
    71 He expressed to Dr Nielssen the hope that he would do a violence prevention course and anger management as well as undertake further drug counselling before his release. 
     
      
       
      Offender’s criminal history 
       
      
    72 His criminal history in New South Wales recorded offences commencing in the Children’s Court on 12 December 1983 and thereafter a stealing offence in relation to which he was originally charged on 14 May 1990 and in 1993/1994 of offences of high prescribed concentration of alcohol, assault occasioning bodily harm and in 1995 an offence of malicious damage and later that year, a stealing offence, malicious damage and in 1998, an offence of common assault and two offences of malicious wounding and in the same year contravening an apprehended domestic violence order, further dishonesty offence, a stalking offence, contravention of an apprehended domestic violence order and common assault (two offences) and further contraventions of apprehended domestic violence orders. 
     
      
    73 In 1999, there were further offences relating to contravention of apprehended domestic violence orders (two in number) and in 2003, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and an offence of common assault. 
     
      
    74 The criminal history obtained from the Western Australian Criminal Records Department indicates that he was sentenced on one count of possessing a quantity of cannabis on 28 September 1989 for which he was subjected to a fine of $200. 
     
      
       
      Evidence from the offender’s mother 
       
      
    75 At the sentencing hearing, the offender’s mother, Rita Merle Stevens, gave evidence. She lived near the deceased and her son at the time of the offence. 
     
      
    76 Mrs Stevens said that she had seen her son in Grafton Gaol in recent times. She said, when asked as to how he felt in respect of the loss of the deceased that he “was shattered”. In relation to his drug problem, he said to her that he wished to get away from drugs. She understood that he had been on methadone treatment before and whilst in custody. He expressed to her his wish to get off methadone and to get his life back on track. 
     
      
    77 Mrs Stevens said that she noted differences in him from what he appeared in February 2007. She said he was easier to talk to and referred to wanting to get on with his life, wanting to get off drugs, to do the right thing and to change his life. 
     
      
    78 Mrs Stevens said that she would always support the offender. She said her son had the support of her husband, who has visited him and that he was present in Court at the sentencing hearing. Mrs Stevens also said that the offender’s brothers and sister had been supportive. His brother attended the sentencing hearing. She said that his siblings were supportive of the offender. She said that, after his release, she would accept him into her home providing he left drugs alone. 
     
      
       
      Victim Impact Statements  
       
      
    79 The following Victim Impact Statements were produced at the sentencing hearing:- 
     
      
       
      (1) Statement of William (Bill) McMahon dated 19 October 2008 (Exhibit B). 
       
       
      (2) Statement of Jacky Titmus dated 26 November 2008 (Exhibit C). 
       
       
      (3) Statement of Renee Edwards dated 1 December 2008 (Exhibit D). 
       
      
    80 Each of these statements reveals the personal impact that has resulted from the death of Ms McMahon. The statement of Renee Edwards and the statement of William McMahon, expressed in restrained terms, provide an insight into the emotional and psychological pain and suffering that they have experienced and will continue to experience as parents. 
     
      
    81 Similarly, the statement of Ms Titmus, Ms McMahon’s sister, who, with her partner, are the primary carers of Ms McMahon’s two young children expresses her feeling of being very fortunate to watch the children develop and enjoy life but expresses her sadness that the deceased should have been the one experiencing this for herself. Ms Titmus, additionally, conveyed the emotional impact upon the deceased’s son, who is now aged six years. 
     
      
    82 In having regard to the Victim Impact Statements to which I have referred, I am bound to consider them in accordance, and I do, with those principles that have been enunciated by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 86. See also Regina v Fernando (1997) 95 A Crim R 533 and other cases. 
     
      
       
      Submissions on behalf of the offender 
       
       
      (a) Matters directed to provocation 
       
      
    83 Mr Jankowski provided detailed written submissions on sentence and extensive oral submissions on behalf of the offender. 
     
      
    84 He contended that the evidence established provocation at “not an insignificant level”. In that respect, he relied upon particular answers given during the course of the record of interview of the offender and specific matters contained in the statement of facts:- 
     
      
       
      • The particular answer given in the interview includes reference to the offender’s account of having received an SMS message that the deceased was in the hotel  
      “off her face” 
       and his reference to having been left with the baby. 
       
       
      • That the deceased had told him that she had stayed shortly before at a caravan park with a male person causing him to hold suspicions of infidelity. 
       
       
      • An account he claimed the deceased gave him in relation to what he termed  
      “orgies” 
       and an ensuing argument. 
       
       
      • The anger he said he had experienced at the deceased’s alleged disclosures to him on the evening of her death. 
       
       
      • A statement attributed to the deceased to the effect that she would turn to prostitution. 
       
       
      • Complaints that the deceased was not home enough and was using drugs instead of caring for the children. 
       
       
      • The fact recorded in the statement that the deceased had recently stayed with a male after leaving the hotel and having sexual intercourse with him. 
       
      
    85 Mr Jankowski submitted that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… The violent conduct of the offender towards the victim was a result of:- 
        
       
       
        
        (a) The offender losing self-control by virtue of the deceased admitting to having been unfaithful and her persistent failure to look after the children of the relationship, in particular, the youngest child. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) In considering the offender’s loss of self-control, the Court may take into account the offender’s own level of drug affectation.” 
        
       
      
    86 Mr Jankowski identified the evidence which he contended supported the offender’s drug affectation. These included his statements to police that he had consumed Zanax, the fact that his speech was slurred and that the officer believed he was under the influence of something, and the evidence from Ms Bell that he was not making any sense when she spoke to him. 
     
      
    87 In his submissions, Mr Jankowski referred to the principle that facts to be taken into account on sentence in a way that are adverse to the interests of the offender must be established beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    88 Reference was made to the fact that the crime of manslaughter comprehends a range of circumstances and the range of culpability is wide. Accordingly, it is not possible, he submitted, to establish any “sentencing tariff” which can be applied to other cases. 
     
      
    89 Mr Jankowski submitted that the findings that would be made as to the following:- 
     
      
       
      • That the cause of death was the intra-abdominal bleeding arising from an injury to the spleen. The bleeding was occasioned by blunt trauma such as punching or kicking. This could not be equated to the same category of conduct where a weapon was used and which would leave little doubt that death was not only foreseeable, but likely. 
       
       
      • That the head injuries were sustained in accordance with the explanation given by the deceased. This included injuries to the head whilst he was dragging the deceased to the bathroom. 
       
       
      • That the numerous injuries identified at autopsy could not be isolated as to cause and some were post-mortem. Only some of the injuries were occasioned by the offender. 
       
       
      • That the offender was affected by a self-induced overdose of prescribed medication. This, it was contended, exacerbated his loss of control when provoked by the deceased. 
       
       
      • That the offender was very remorseful about the loss of the deceased’s life and the loss to the deceased’s family. 
       
       
      • That the offender suffers from a clinically significant level of depression, in part, from the loss of the deceased. 
       
       
      • That he has good prospects of rehabilitation and a supportive family. 
       
       
      • That Dr Nielssen did not consider that the offender would again abuse benzodiazepine medication. 
       
       
      • That the offender has been constructive whilst in custody and he wished to undertake violence prevention courses and anger management courses as well as drug counselling. 
       
       
      (b) The plea of guilty 
       
      
    90 The plea of guilty was entered on 7 October 2008. However, it is said that negotiations in respect of the plea to manslaughter had been ongoing for some weeks before the trial date. The offer of a plea to manslaughter in full satisfaction of the indictment was said not to have been forwarded by the Crown until the last working days before the trial. 
     
      
    91 Mr Jankowski submitted that, whilst the offender is not entitled to a 25% discount in accordance with the principles for his plea in Regina v Thomson & Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309, he would be entitled to a discount of 20%, given the circumstances of when the plea could be and was entered and the significant utilitarian value of the plea. 
     
      
       
      (c) Remorse 
       
      
    92 The submission was that the offender expressed remorse to Dr Nielssen and that his attempts at reviving the deceased as recorded in the record of interview also demonstrates remorse. 
     
      
    93 A number of specific answers in the record of interview are set out in the written submissions.  
     
      
    94 I will return to that aspect shortly and I note the specific answers in the record of interview which are set out in the submissions. 
     
      
       
      (d) Aggravating and mitigating factors: s.21A, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
       
      
    95 The submissions advanced on behalf of the offender include:- 
     
      
       
      (1) That not all of the injuries can be said to have arisen from the offender’s actions and are not established as having been causally related to the deceased’s death. In particular, he denies the head injuries were occasioned by him. It is acknowledged that the injuries caused by the offender are relevant to objective seriousness rather than constituting a matter of specific aggravation. 
       
       
      (2) I note that the actual violence of the offence referred to in s.21A(2)(b) is an element of the offence and, in this case accordingly, it cannot be taken into account as an aggravating factor. I have, in the course of these remarks, referred to the evidence of violence, but that is only as a matter relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence. The factor of violence cannot be taken into account in any additional way in imposing sentence by reason of the fact that it is already taken into account in the assessment: s.21A(2). 
       
       
      (3) Similarly, the injury (in this case the death of the deceased) referred to in s.21A(2)(g) of the Act cannot be the subject of additional regard as an aggravating factor by reason of the fact that death is obviously an element of the offence:  
      Williams  
      (supra) at 39. 
       
       
      (4) There was no evidence to suggest that the offence was the result of a planned or organised activity. It was put that the violence inflicted upon the deceased by the offender occurred in the context of an escalation of emotion caused by the elements of provocation referred to in the submissions. In addition, the loss of self-control was exacerbated by the excessive use of prescribed medication. 
       
       
      (5) It was submitted that the offender had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to re-offend. Reliance was placed in that respect upon Dr Nielssen’s report in that respect. 
       
      
    96 Reference was made to the offender’s long history of drug use and his consumption of an excessive amount of Zanax on the day of the offence. 
     
      
    97 In relation to subjective matters, reliance was placed upon the history contained in Dr Nielssen’s report to which I have earlier referred. 
     
      
    98 It was submitted that the separation of the offender from his children, as well as impacting on other members of the family, must also have produced suffering of a significant loss to the offender. 
     
      
    99 Reliance was also placed upon Dr Nielssen’s diagnosis of disorders in the offender. 
     
      
    100 In relation to the term of the non-parole period to be determined in sentencing the offender, it was submitted that there ought to be a departure from the statutory ratio based on a finding of special circumstances which, it was contended, was justified upon the basis:- 
     
      
       
      • Reasonable prospects of rehabilitation as evidenced by the offender’s efforts to rehabilitate himself in custody. 
       
       
      • The need for the offender to receive assistance in overcoming his substance abuse and addressing relapse issues such that a longer period on parole with supervision is warranted. 
       
      
    101 He tendered Exhibits 2 and 3 which are relevant to the first of those two issues. 
     
      
    102 In relation to the offender’s criminal history, it was submitted that the nature of the offences are significantly less serious than the present offence. The last offence involving any violence, it was noted, occurred in August 2003, some three and a half years before the subject offence. Offences of dishonesty, it was said, are consistent with the offender having a significant drug problem. The antecedents of the offender, it was contended, would not constitute matters of aggravation or mitigation within the meaning of s.21A(2), (3) or (5) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    103 Mr Jankowski provided a copy of the Public Defenders’ summary of cases in respect of offenders who entered pleas of guilty or after trial in cases involving manslaughter on the basis of provocation. 
     
      
       
      Submissions by the Crown 
       
      
    104 The Crown submitted that:- 
     
      
       
      • It is clear that there was an ongoing and lengthy period of sustained violence on the deceased. 
       
       
      • That that would be taken into account in ultimately assessing the role provocation should play in the sentence to be imposed when examining the degree of violence or aggression displayed and leading to the deceased death in evaluating the objective gravity of the offence. 
       
      
    105 In relation to the general approach to be taken on the issue of provocation, the Crown submitted that where provocation was at a high level, then the gravity of the offence was lower. The time between provocation and the loss of self-control may have the tendency of reducing the objective gravity. Where the time interval is shorter, then the gravity of the offence may be reduced. 
     
      
    106 The Crown observed that in relation to the incident on 20 February 2007, the gap in time was such that, to some extent, it would make provocation less effective. 
     
      
    107 The Crown further observed that, as to the degree of violence and aggression displayed at the time of the offence, the more excessive the violence, the greater the objective gravity of the offence. 
     
      
    108 The Crown Prosecutor, in oral submissions, submitted that “the degree of violence in this case was extreme and the gravity of the offence was extreme and the provocation was low”. 
     
      
    109 For reasons stated in these remarks, I agree with that submission. 
     
      
    110 The discrete factual matters arising in respect of provocation include the following:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The evidence that establishes that the deceased, over a lengthy period, including the period between 20 February 2007 and the time of her death, was affected and impaired by excessive drug use. 
       
       
      (2) That the offender was, to a degree, impaired by the consumption of drugs, having taken an amount somewhat in excess of his prescribed three tablets a day. He claimed to police that he had consumed five tablets that day. 
       
       
      (3) The long and substantial history of marital discord. 
       
       
      (4) The evidence that establishes that the offender had acted violently towards the deceased giving rise to some visible signs of injury. 
       
       
      (5) The behaviour of the deceased which includes a failure or inability to attend to the welfare of her baby, the impact that had upon the deceased, her drug affected stated and her leaving the home and attending at the local hotel. 
       
       
      (6) The incident of infidelity earlier referred to of the deceased and the extent to which that affected the offender. 
       
      
    111 The agreed statement of facts does establish that each of the matters I referred to in the preceding paragraph as operative factors in the days leading to and including the date of the deceased’s death. 
     
      
    112 In determining the nature and the extent of the provocation, it is clear that the deceased’s drug use had rendered her incapable of discharging her role as a mother and it impaired her ability to lead a normal and rational domestic existence. It is clear on the evidence that her disabled and dysfunctional condition did contribute to the dynamics and tension within the household and that it did have an impact upon the offender. 
     
      
    113 Although the provocation arises in relation to two factors, namely, the issue of unfaithfulness and the offender’s perception of the deceased’s dereliction of duties as a mother, I am not satisfied that the first was as significant a factor as the second. 
     
      
    114 A reading of the detailed history obtained by Dr Nielssen in his report records that the offender “understood” that the provocation was based upon the deceased’s continued drug abuse and the effect that had on her ability to care for the two infant children and to “his suspicion that she had returned to prostitution”. There is no reference, otherwise, in the report to any particular circumstances said to have been associated with the deceased’s infidelity that operated upon the offender in his account to Dr Niellsen. It is clear that Dr Nielssen spent some considerable time obtaining the relevant history from the offender when he interviewed him. There is a detailed account of the drug history of the deceased and of the offender and other matters, but there is no detail as to any facts said to have been discovered by the offender or the impact that it is said to have had upon him on 20, 21 or 23 February 2007 arising out of that matter, that is, the claimed infidelity. On the occasion on which Dr Nielssen interviewed the offender, one would have expected would have elicited any material factors that operated in any significant way upon him. The only reference in this regard is an expression of his “concern” that, by reason of her drug affected stated, she may have been taken advantage of sexually. 
     
      
    115 The record of interview, however, does include some account given by the offender in relation to, what is said to be, the deceased’s infidelity. I refer, in that respect, to the lengthy answer to question 8 and the answers to questions 52, 68 and 77 to 82 in the ERISP. 
     
      
    116 The record of interview in those answers does provide some support for the fact that in the victim’s alleged disclosures to the offender related to a matter of infidelity, however, according to his answer to questions 77 and 82, he had “busted her”, told her to pack her bags and that he packed her bags “three days ago” following which he said she unpacked them. Accordingly, the provocation, on his account, initially arose on or about 20 February 2007. 
     
      
    117 The answers provided in the interview refer to the fact that, on his account, there had been further discussion about the matter of infidelity on the evening of the deceased’s death. On that basis, there is some evidence that the matter was revived and was capable of reigniting the offender’s anger. 
     
      
    118 The history given to Dr Nielssen and certain answers in the record of interview go to support the proposition that the offender was driven to anger by the combination of the deceased’s drug abuse, her perceived failure to undertake her duties as a mother, in particular, to the new baby, her leaving the home and attending at the local hotel and that he was left with the responsibility to look after the baby. 
     
      
    119 My reference to the perceived inability of the mother is a reference to his perception of her behaviour, which is clear resulted from her impairment. 
     
      
    120 In evaluating these matters, however, it is clear that the deceased’s condition was such and it would have been apparent to the offender, even with his drug issues, that the deceased’s impairment was such that she was a very ill woman. It would have been apparent that, rather than being wilful in her neglect of her motherly duties, she was simply incapable of functioning at anything like a normal level. 
     
      
    121 In accepting the facts as revealed by the offender in his answers during the record of interview, those answers are to be assessed with some degree of caution. It is apparent throughout the interview that the offender was intent on playing down his culpability and, in endeavouring to account for the nature and extent of the injuries, his account is simply not believable. He would only admit to having slapped her twice with an open hand on the face and once on the thigh. Neither basis – the supposed slaps or supposed bicycle accidents – can account for the nature and extent of the deceased’s injuries. 
     
      
    122 The offender’s criminal history does make reference to matters of violence in the offender’s history although, as Mr Jankowski has observed, he has not in recent years been convicted of any offence of violence. The reference in the evidence to his desire to undertake an anger management course is commendable and does indicate that he too perceives that his aggression or anger is a problem and it needs controlling. 
     
      
    123 As I have earlier said, the question of violence is relevant to the objective nature of the offence. The agreed statement of facts refer, in particular, to blood stains not confined to one room or part of a room, but that they were found in four particular areas of the house, being the lounge room, the main bedroom, the hallway and the bathroom. Blood and faecal stains were found on the floors, the furniture and other items in the rooms and the finding of a clump of long dark hair caught on the drawer knob is consistent with an extremely violent attack by the offender upon the deceased. 
     
      
    124 Given the conflict in the medical evidence that death could be found to have been due to the intra-abdominal bleeding arising from an injury to the spleen. It was submitted that the bleeding was occasioned by blunt trauma such as punching or kicking. I have earlier referred to the evidence that indicates that the deceased was subject to significant injuries and trauma indicating multiple assaults upon her. I do not accept the submission that the immediate cause of injury, namely, injury to the spleen, is a factor that indicates the seriousness of the offence is towards the lower rather than the higher end of the spectrum. The multiple injuries sustained by the deceased is evidence of a high level of aggression and violence by the offender towards the victim in the moments before the fatal injury that led to her death was sustained. 
     
      
    125 These observations are reinforced by the nature and extent of the multiple injuries found at autopsy. I accept that not all of the injuries can be established to have been occasioned during the attack upon the deceased that led to her death on the day of her death, but there is no evidence from persons who observed the deceased earlier in the day that she had the multiple contusions on the face and scalp. The fact that the subdural haemorrhage was due to a sheering force due to multiple blunt trauma is consistent with the offender repeatedly banging the victim’s head into the floor, wall or other similar hard surface. Whilst the plea evidences that provocation played a role, the level of extreme violence was wholly disproportionate to the ongoing circumstances that had been in operation for some considerable time prior to the death of the Ms McMahon. 
     
      
       
      Principles 
       
      
    126 It is necessary, in the light of the evidence adduced and the submissions made, to determine the sentence that is appropriate to the particular crime, having regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively, as without such an assessment, the other factors requiring consideration before arriving at the proper sentence to be imposed cannot properly be given their place: Regina v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354. 
     
      
    127 Apart from limited circumstances such as the youth or mental incapacity of an offender, public deterrence is a matter of importance in punishment for criminal offences and the subjective considerations relating to the particular offender, no matter how persuasive they be, are necessarily subsidiary to the duty of the courts to see that the sentence imposed will operate as a powerful factor in preventing the commission of similar crimes and in particular, the domestic situation by those who may otherwise be tempted by the prospect that only light punishment will be imposed: Regina v Alexander (1994) 78 A Crim R 141 at 142. 
     
      
    128 The factors to be considered in determining an appropriate sentence in a provocation case were referred to by the Chief Justice, Sir Laurence Street, in Regina v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397. There, the Chief Justice made a number of observations, including the following:- 
     
      
       
      • The circumstances leading to the felonious taking of human life being regarded as manslaughter vary infinitely. 
       
       
      • At the start, it should be recognised, the Chief Justice stated, that the felonious taking of a human life is recognised both in the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 and in the community at large as one of the most dreadful crimes in the criminal calendar. 
       
       
      • Courts recognise factual contexts which provide some basis for understanding the human tragedies that can lead to the taking of a life. 
       
       
      • The manifestation of this human tendency is necessarily attended by the utmost caution as the taking of a human life is a grave action calling for a correspondingly grave measure of criminal justice being meted out to the guilty party. 
       
      
    129 In Alexander (supra), Hunt CJ at CL (at 144) identified three particular matters to be taken into account in provocation manslaughter cases. They are:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The degree of provocation offered (or, alternatively, the extent of the loss of self-control suffered), which, when great, has the tendency of reducing the objective gravity of the offence. 
       
       
      (2) The time between the provocation (whether isolated or cumulative in its effect) and the loss of self-control, which, when short, also has the tendency of reducing the objective gravity of the offence. 
       
       
      (3) The degree of violence or aggression displayed by the offender, which, when excessive, has the tendency of increasing the objective gravity of the offence. See also  
      Regina v KMB 
       [2005] NSWCCA 185 at [11]. 
       
       
      Offender’s drug addiction 
       
      
    130 Generally, drug addiction does not mitigate an appropriate sentence being imposed on an offender. There are many decision that support that proposition: see Regina v Spiero (1979) 22 SASR 543 at 548 to 549 and, as to the role of drug addiction in sentence, see Regina v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at 381 to 387 per Spigelman CJ.  
     
      
    131 In the present case, in counsel’s written submissions on behalf of the offender (p.5), it was contended that one factor in the offender’s loss of self-control was the effect of prescribed and not illicit drugs. In that respect Mr Jankowski submitted:- 
     
      
       
        
        “2. In considering the offender’s loss of control, the Court may take into account the offender’s own level of drug affectation.” 
        
       
      
    132 Later in the written submissions (p.10), it was stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “• The offender was affected by a self induced overdose of prescribed medication which exacerbated the offender’s loss of control when provoked by the deceased.” 
        
       
      
    133 The offender’s history of drug use is referred to in the written submissions (p.16). This refers to the offender’s use of cannabis at the age of 12 and during his adult life, the use of hallucinogenic drugs in his teenage years and that he first tried heroin in his early teenage years and is said to have become dependent on that drug at the age of 17 or 18. It is noted that heroin usage ceased after enrolling in a methadone programme in 1998. In 2000 he commenced to use amphetamines he claimed and he regularly used them until his arrest for the present offence. Reference was made to two incidents referred to by the offender what were claimed to be deliberate drug overdoses in suicide attempts between 1998 at 2000. 
     
      
    134 The submissions refer to the offender’s admission that on the day of the offence he had taken an excessive amount of Zanax. 
     
      
    135 The offender told Dr Nielssen that on the day he took five, two mg tablets of alprazolam (Zanax). I note that this is consistent with information provided by the offender to police (ERISP, Q15). In the interview, he told police that his normal dose was three a day (Q17). When asked at that point by police how he felt, whether he was okay and whether he could understand the conversation, he replied “Yeah. Oh. It doesn’t dope me out, you know” (Q19). 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    136 In determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed in this case, it is necessary to apply the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Act”). 
     
      
    137 Section 3A provides that the purposes for which a Court may impose a sentence on an offender are as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (1) To ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence. 
       
       
      (2) To prevent crime by deterring the offender and others from committing similar offences. 
       
       
      (3) To protect the community from the offender. 
       
       
      (4) To promote the rehabilitation of the offender. 
       
       
      (5) To make the offender accountable for his or her actions. 
       
       
      (6) To denounce the conduct of the offender. 
       
       
      (7) To recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community. 
       
      
    138 Accordingly, it is accepted that the purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform: Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465. The High Court in that case stated that purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation from the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence in a particular case. They are guideposts to the appropriate sentence but sometimes they point in different directions. 
     
      
    139 The provisions of s.21A of the Sentencing Act provide that in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, the Court is to take into account the aggravating and mitigating factors referred to in the section that are relevant and known to the Court and any other objective or subjective factor that affects the relative seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    140 I will return to the relevant factors in the present case. I note at this point, in accordance with s.21A(2), “the Court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence”. 
     
      
    141 The effect and policy behind such a limitation is self-evident: there should be no double counting of aggravating features of an offence: Regina v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193. 
     
      
    142 Dr Nielssen, in his report, referred to treatment which the offender had for depression and that, in this respect, he had been prescribed a relatively low dose of an anti-depressant medication (a benzodiazepine – Zanax) and that he was taking that medication around the time of his arrest. 
     
      
    143 Dr Nielssen explained that the reported 10 mg of alprazolam (Zanax) was four mg more than his usual dose. Dr Nielssen noted that he was able to give a lucid account of events to police during an interview conducted the following day, although he did not have any memory of doing so. Dr Nielssen explained that this was by reason of the fact that intoxication with benzodiazepines is similar to intoxication with alcohol. 
     
      
    144 On the evidence, it is clear and I find accordingly, that the offender, on the day of the offence, had consumed more than the prescribed dose of Zanax and that his apparent condition during the course of the interview would be explained by him having done so. 
     
      
    145 Accordingly, this is a case in which the offender had, to a point, been affected by prescribed medication rather than by an illicit drug, the evidence indicating that he had not, in fact, consumed prohibited drugs in the period immediately prior to the offence. 
     
      
    146 The extent to which the Zanax affected the offender is not on the evidence something that is capable of any precise or effective determination for the medical evidence was not directed to that aspect. The offender has the onus of establishing, on the probabilities, that the effect of the Zanax did affect or impact on the applicant’s loss of self-control. The evidence does not enable a determination favourable to him in that respect, although I do take into account the fact that the Zanax did have some impact or effect upon him as at the time of the commission of the offence. To what extent, as I have said, is not clear on the evidence. I note that the evidence indicates that the offender has acted in the past aggressively and violently suggesting that he has had a problem with self-control. 
     
      
    147 A comparison of sentences in other cases is, of course, not determinative for each case depends very much upon its own facts. With that important reservation, references to sentences in similar cases may, however, be instructive at least as a general guide to some degree. 
     
      
    148 In Regina v Williams [2005] NSWCCA 99, the Court of Criminal Appeal (Tobias JA, Buddin and Hall JJ) considered the severity of sentence imposed in a domestic manslaughter in which the sentence imposed of 14 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10½ years was said to have been excessive. In that case, the appellant was found guilty by a jury of manslaughter (having been charged with murder) in respect of the death of his de facto wife. They had had a relationship for some six months and the evidence revealed that the relationship had, on a number of occasions, involved a degree of violence. The appellant, in that case, had a history of being short tempered even when unaffected by drugs. He had a history of illicit drug taking which included amphetamines, the effects of which included hostility and aggression leading to violence. 
     
      
    149 On the date of the offence in that case, there was evidence of physical aggression by the deceased towards the appellant and he was sentenced upon the basis that the jury verdict was founded upon manslaughter by reason of her provocation. The relevant material revealed provocative conduct on the part of the deceased towards the appellant prior to the day on which the fatal incident occurred. There was evidence that the deceased had injured him in the course of the altercation . 
     
      
    150 The Court of Criminal Appeal in that case found that the case was one of considerable objective gravity and that nothing less than a sentence of appropriate severity could be countenanced. However, having regard to findings made in that case, the sentence was reduced to a term of imprisonment of 12 years with a non-parole period of nine years. 
     
      
    151 The level of violence by the appellant in Williams (supra) was at a very high level and no allowance was or could have been made in that case for any effect that the illicit drug taking, in particular, had upon him. A matter, however, that was favourable to him was the fact that the provocation was significant involving, as it was found, violence by the deceased which was an aspect of the provocation on the facts of that case. 
     
      
    152 Whilst the present case has similarities to that in Williams (supra), there are two matters upon which it may be differentiated. The first is that the offender here was not affected by taking prohibited drugs but was, at the relevant time, taking a prescribed medication. Whilst that medication, as I have earlier stated, can be taken as having affected the offender in som way, it is not possible to arrive at any conclusion as to the extent or degree to which it impaired his capacity for self-control and contributed to it. However, as I have earlier stated, I have proceeded in this matter upon the basis that it did have some effect in that respect. 
     
      
    153 The counterbalancing factor is, however, the provocation. In Williams (supra), the evidence established the provocation was, at least, at a moderate level and possibly somewhat higher than that. In the present case, as I have stated, the level of provocation was at a relatively low level, a factor to be taken into account in evaluating the objective seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    154 In determining the appropriate sentence in the present case it is necessary to have firmly in mind that the maximum penalty prescribed by the legislature for the offence of manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    155 It is necessary to have regard to the gravity of the offence. As the Court of Criminal Appeal said in Regina v Blacklidge (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported 12 December 1995):- 
     
      
       
        
        “The Courts have repeatedly stressed that what is involved in every case of manslaughter is the felonious taking of human life. That is a starting point for consideration of the appropriate penalty and a key element in the assessment of the gravity of the objective circumstances of the case.” 
        
       
      
    156 At the forefront of an assessment of the objective gravity of the offence is the fact that there has been a taking of human life with intent to kill or an intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. The gravity of the offence is moderated by the fact, as I have found it in the present case, that the death was not planned and that there was a measure of provocation offered by the deceased in the period prior to and including the day on which the fatal incident occurred. 
     
      
    157 These considerations must, however, take their place, amongst other factors in the sentencing process. There was little in the present case, however, that the offender could advance of a subjective nature that would ameliorate the otherwise appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    158 In relation to the matter of contrition, there is no direct evidence in the present proceedings from the offender himself in relation to any remorse of contrition that he holds. I have not, in that respect, overlooked the references to the record of interview referred to in the written submissions of counsel for the offender (paragraph 5). I do take into account that his mother’s evidence does indicate that the death of the deceased has had a significant impact upon him and I can infer, at least to some extent, that that includes an element of remorse as well as the realisation by him of the significance of the deceased’s death.  
     
      
    159 The assessment of the nature, extent and time period over which provocation is said to have existed cannot be determined by any direct account given by the offender, for he did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. 
     
      
       
      Special circumstances 
       
      
    160 I do not consider that this is a case in which a finding of special circumstances should be made. There is little evidence on the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation. I do not overlook the evidence given at the sentencing hearing nor Exhibits 2 and 3. I have had regard to the evidence given by his mother and the report of Dr Nielssen, although Dr Nielssen does not directly assist on this issue so far as the offender’s future rehabilitation prospects are concerned. The evidence of remorse primarily comes from Dr Nielssen’s report and some references in the record of interview. Whilst it was submitted that a longer period of parole would be required in order to supervise and support the offender on his release, I do not consider that the evidence would justify a finding of special circumstances and, accordingly, I decline to do so. 
     
      
    161 In respect of the plea entered by the offender, I consider that the offender is entitled to a 20% discount for his plea of guilty. 
     
      
    162 I decline to make a finding of special circumstances. 
     
      
    163 The offender was arrested at 1.30 am on 24 February 2007. I propose to backdate the sentence to commence on 24 February 2007. 
     
      
    164 I sentence the offender to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of six years and seven months to commence on 24 February 2007 and to expire on 23 September 2013 and to a balance of term of two year and two months to commence on 24 September 2013 and to expire on 23 November 2015. The earliest date upon which the offender will become eligible for release on parole will be 23 September 2013.

      2008/5908 R v WILLIAM NICHOLAS CHARLES POCOCK 
       
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR : The offender pleaded guilty on 6 November 2008 to the murder of Darren John Peachman. The trial was listed to commence on 10 November 2008 but was later re-listed for 24 November 2008.  
     
      
    2 The offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and attracts a standard non parole period of 20 years. The Crown submissions contend that this offence falls below the mid range of objective gravity. For the reasons that follow, I agree with this submission. Hence, it is appropriate to bear the standard non parole period in mind as a reference point or benchmark. 
     
      
    3 The offence was committed on 10 March 2007 in a suburb of Newcastle. The offender was at that time just short of 21 years of age. During the late afternoon of that day, the offender attended a 21st birthday party at Mayfield. Mr Jordan Wilson, an acquaintance of the offender, also attended the party. The offender consumed a quantity of alcohol and, according to his evidence on sentence, took four ecstasy tablets in the course of the evening. Nonetheless, he was able to hold a conversation and walk without difficulty. 
     
      
    4 Some time after 10:30 p.m., the offender received a phone call from a close friend, Elley Walmsley, and was informed that her handbag had been stolen from her residential unit at 4 Harvard Close, Jesmond. Ms Walmsley’s flatmate had seen a male hand, wearing a sports watch, reach into the lounge room and take the handbag, although this was not communicated to the offender. The offender asked a number of people for a lift to Harvard Close. Ms Ryan, Mr Wilson's ex-de facto partner and Mr Wilson agreed to drive the offender to that address. During the journey the offender asked Mr Wilson if he could borrow Mr Wilson's blue and white running shoes, in place of the leather shoes that the offender was then wearing. Mr Wilson agreed and the offender changed shoes in the car. 
     
      
    5 By the time the offender reached Harvard Close, Ms Walmsley was speaking to a police officer about the theft of her handbag. A short time later the police officer left. Ms Walmsley then informed the offender that she had earlier spoken to a man (the victim) in Harvard Close who was acting suspiciously. As it happens, the victim lived at unit 10, 14 Harvard Close and had left his unit at around 10:30 p.m. to undertake a search of the bins in the local shopping centre for items of interest. Ms Walmsley’s flatmate noted that the victim was not wearing a sports watch. 
     
      
    6 Mr Wilson and the offender walked down Harvard Close together. They went to unit 4 of number 14 Harvard Close where the offender thought he overheard the occupants of the unit talking about stolen goods. The offender knocked on the door of the unit, which opened but then closed in the offender's face. Mr Wilson and the offender returned to no. 4 Harvard Close. 
     
      
    7 Shortly thereafter, Ms Walmsley and her flatmate saw the victim walking in Harvard Close and pointed him out to the offender. The victim was identified as the person who had previously been seen acting suspiciously. The offender then walked in the direction of the victim. At this point in time, Mr Wilson was in the car. Mr Wilson, wearing nothing but socks on his feet, got out and followed the offender. 
     
      
    8 The offender confronted the victim and asked him about his movements that night and whether he had stolen handbags. The victim started to open his bags to show the offender the contents. The offender then punched the victim to the head, causing the victim to fall to his knees. The offender then pushed the victim to the ground and commenced to kick the victim to the head a number of times. The offender then stomped on the victim's head at least once. 
     
      
    9 Mr Wilson attempted to restrain the offender, but was pushed aside. The offender continued to kick the victim to the head. Ultimately, Mr Wilson came between the victim and the offender and push the offender way. Mr Wilson and the offender then walked back up Harvard Close towards number 4, during which time Mr Wilson was trying to calm the offender down. The assault and the conversation between the offender and Mr Wilson were overheard by local residents. Mr Wilson was heard to say ""don't worry mate it will be all right"". The offender was heard to say ""shit"" or ""fuck"". 
     
      
    10 The offender got into a car driven by Ms Walmsley's flatmate. They left Harvard Close by driving close to the victim, who was then lying on the roadway, and doing a U-turn. As they were driving past the victim, the offender asked ""do you want to check the bag?"" The offender, Ms Walmsley and her flatmate drove to the home of another acquaintance, who noticed blood on the shoes then worn by the offender. The offender gave an account of having struck the victim, only after the victim had swung a punch at the offender. The offender made no mention of having kicked or stomped on the victim’s head. In the days following the assault on the victim, the offender spoke to various people, giving similar accounts, consistent with the offender reacting to a perceived physical threat from the victim. 
     
      
    11 At about 2 a.m. the following morning, the offender and others left that home and travelled into Newcastle. The offender was dropped at the CBD hotel in Newcastle where he was depicted on CCTV footage wearing the white running shoes. 
     
      
    12 The victim was discovered unconscious in the roadway at around 1 a.m. by a taxi driver who had dropped a passenger in Harvard Close. The victim never recovered consciousness and was pronounced dead later that day. The post-mortem established a pattern of contusions on the left side of the face, extensive contusions of the scalp on both the right and left sides, an acute subdural haemorrhage on the right side, patches of subarachnoid haemorrhage over the surface of the cerebral hemispheres and extensive contusion of the brain stem, extensive contusion on the left side of the neck, a fractured thyroid and hyoid cartilage on the right side and large amounts of aspirated blood and mucus in the air passages and lungs. These injuries were said to be consistent with a violent kicking of the victim's head in a number of directions while the victim was on the ground. 
     
      
    13 On the afternoon of 14 March 2007, the offender volunteered himself to police at Waratah. He declined to be interviewed and was charged. He has remained in custody since that date. On 16 March, Mr Wilson was interviewed by police. His account of the assault refuted any offer of violence on the part of the victim and described the offender during the assault as ""just going mental"". I accept unreservedly that the victim offered no threat to the offender whatsoever.  
     
      
    14 The victim was aged 36, 165 cm in height, weighed 54 kg and was of a thin build. By way of contrast, the offender was approximately the same height but 75 kg in weight and was reasonably fit. He had commenced training for the football season and was aware of the potential damage occasioned by blows, let alone kicks, to the head. I have determined to approach sentence on the basis that the offender intended to cause grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    15 Notwithstanding that finding, the brutal, callous and cowardly attack upon Mr Peachman, the failure to render him any assistance and the offender's attempts to somehow excuse the assault to his friends and associates discloses criminality of a significant order. The offender's conduct is all the more reprehensible when account is taken of the fact that the offender was subject to a bond imposed for precisely the same kind of offence, committed upon a hapless stranger while the offender was moderately under the influence of alcohol. 
     
      
    16 On 11 May 2004, the offender committed an assault upon a young male at a bus stop in Hunter Street, Newcastle West when the offender was moderately affected by alcohol. A sentence of two months imprisonment was appealed and replaced by a two year bond, expiring 6 December 2006. 
     
      
    17 On 11 September 2005, the offender assaulted and occasioned actual bodily harm to a young male in the toilets of a Newcastle nightclub. A patron of the nightclub entered the toilets and saw the offender kicking the victim in the head about four or five times as the victim lay on the floor. The offender was dragged away from the victim. The victim was rendered unconscious but recovered later in hospital. The offender pleaded guilty to that offence on 20 February 2006 and was sentenced to four months imprisonment, expiring on 19 June 2006. 
     
      
    18 On 10 August 2006 the offender was called up for breaching the bond imposed at Newcastle District Court as a result of the successful severity appeal. Miraculously, the offender was placed on yet another bond for a period of 18 months, to date from 10 August 2006, expiring 9 February 2008. The offender was therefore subject to this bond at the time of the assault upon Mr Peachman. 
     
      
    19 In terms of the objective gravity of the offence, it is not so far below the mid range that the standard non-parole period ceases to have a significant influence on the sentencing discretion.  
     
      
    20 General deterrence is a particularly important factor in the imposition of the sentence for this offence. The community of Newcastle has recently taken steps to address the excessive consumption of alcohol by young males in particular, in the light of numerous reports of violence committed by the intoxicated patrons of a number of local hotels and nightclubs. This offence serves to highlight the truly tragic consequences of the combination of alcohol and latent male aggression. Specific deterrence is also a relevant factor. 
     
      
    21 Whilst some explanation was sought to be advanced on the offender's behalf for his behaviour, the offender’s subjective circumstances are not so remarkable. The offender was born in New Zealand and spent his early years in a suburb close to Auckland airport. His father was a carpenter of Fijian and European extraction and his mother was from Tonga. The offender is the eldest of four boys, one of whom was the product of his mother's second relationship. His parents separated when he was seven or eight years of age and his mother's second relationship exposed the offender to a violent and alcoholic stepfather. 
     
      
    22 The family moved to Sydney, settling in the western suburbs and then moving to the Central Coast. The offender's mother ended her second relationship when the offender was 13 years of age. Thus, the offender's exposure to domestic violence and the abuse of alcohol occurred over a period of approximately 5 years. There is nothing else to indicate that the offender's family background contributed to his excessive resort to violence on random occasions when he is angered or frustrated. 
     
      
    23 The offender attended a number of secondary schools before completing year 10 at TAFE. He described learning difficulties which were said to be due to the events at home and disruption to his education because of frequent moves. However in recent times his literacy has improved. He was reputedly a talented footballer. The offender has been continuously employed since leaving school, initially as a scaffolder and steel fixer, then in rubbish collection and at the time of his arrest as a labourer for an air-conditioning company. To his credit, the offender has undertaken a major role in the support of his family, who continue to support him. 
     
      
    24 Clearly, there is an association between the offender's consumption of alcohol and the commission of offences of violence. However, the presentence reports prepared on 15 November 2004 and 20 February 2006 in relation to the offender's early court appearances place more emphasis upon the lack of impulse control and the need for the offender to undergo anger management programs. The offender completed such a program but failed to maintain contact with his supervising officer. It seems that the offender did not at that time appreciate the true nature of his shortcomings, despite acknowledging that he was aware of the connection between his consumption of alcohol and his offending. 25 I accept that he has now developed some insight into his behaviour and that his prospects of rehabilitation are more promising. I also accept that he is genuinely remorseful for the death of Mr Peachman. His evidence before the court, both written and oral, attest to his grief and his resolve to change his life. 
     
      
    26 Whilst the plea of guilty came relatively late, the Crown acknowledges that it has significant utilitarian value, in that there was no need to marshal witnesses and the cost and inconvenience of a trial in the order of four weeks was averted. In my view, a discount of 15% is appropriate to these circumstances. 
     
      
    27 The offender's youth and the fact that this is his first lengthy custodial sentence would justify a finding of special circumstances. However, the length of the sentence necessarily to be imposed and the statutory proportion between the non-parole period and the balance of term allows sufficient time for the offender to receive appropriate supervision in the community. In addition, nothing less than the non-parole period I am about to impose is capable of reflecting the objective gravity of the offence. Accordingly, I decline to find special circumstances. 
     
      
    28 The court acknowledges the impact of the offence upon Mr Peachman's family and partner. The grief and pain experienced by these secondary victims of the offence cannot be assuaged by the sentence of imprisonment to be imposed upon the offender. Mr Peachman's death was entirely senseless. The sentence must reflect the fact that the unlawful taking of a human life represents the most serious offence in the criminal calendar. 
     
      
    29 William Pocock, you are sentenced to a non parole period of 14 years and 9 months, to date from 14 March 2007, expiring 13 December 2021, with a balance of term of 4 years and 9 months, to date from 14 December 2021, expiring 13 September 2026.

    JUDGMENT1. PN is not a career criminal. He has a couple of minor offences on his record which he committed in his early twenties and a more recent low range prescribed concentration of alcohol. He has had a relatively normal childhood with no major traumatic incidents. However, commencing about six years ago, he allowed his life to spiral down into a period of sustained and depraved criminal behaviour. The criminality involved in the multiple crimes which he committed is almost overwhelming. There will be a need to impose harsh sentences because of the extent of the criminal behaviour which he has engaged in.2. Some cases involve an offender possessing child pornography. They are very serious offences and Parliament has fixed a maximum of five years imprisonment. Other cases involve disseminating child pornography. Understandably those offences are regarded as more serious and Parliament has fixed a maximum of ten years imprisonment. PN engaged in both. Some offenders use the Internet to procure or groom children, to engage them in personal contact. The children are obviously vulnerable victims and at risk. PN engaged in this conduct. More seriously, other offenders, having procured their victims over the Internet, actually engage them in sexual activity involving physical violence and personal sexual abuse of children. PN engaged in this activity. Parliament regards it as a serious offence to sexually assault a child in special care. It has fixed a maximum of eight years imprisonment to such a crime. PN did this. Parliament has fixed a ten year term of imprisonment to offenders who sexually interfere with children aged between fourteen and sixteen years. PN has done this. Parliament has fixed a maximum of sixteen years imprisonment for offenders who have sexual intercourse with a child who is under fourteen years of age. PN has done this. Each of the kinds of offences which I have referred to is serious. Almost all of them, if not all, would attract a custodial sentence. PN has committed all of these offences and, in most cases, not just once but on multiple occasions. He has committed multiple serious crimes and these crimes have produced multiple victims.3. First I should formally list the crimes which he has been charged with. I add, before listing those crimes, that PN was arrested for them on 18 May 2007 and has been in custody since then on these matters alone. I also indicate that he has pleaded guilty to all the crimes that I am sentencing him for and in due course I will refer to that and make allowance for that plea of guilty. 4. Returning to the list, these are the crimes that he has been charged with, that he has pleaded guilty to and of which I now formally convict him. He has committed four counts of sexual intercourse with a person above the age of ten years and under the age of fourteen years. The victim in each case was AW. They are offences against s 66C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. Each of them carries a maximum penalty of sixteen years imprisonment. In respect of one of those offences against AW, I will take into account under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 two additional charges to which PN has pleaded guilty and which he has asked me to take into account in sentencing him on one of those four offences. The two additional charges are sexual intercourse with a person under fourteen years of age and over ten, once again AW, contrary to s 66C(1) of the Crimes Act and aggravated indecent assault on AW contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act. I will take those matters into account when I am sentencing PN for one of those offences and I have signed the form under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act accordingly.5. Next he is charged with one count of using a carriage service to procure a person under sixteen for sexual activity. Once again the victim of that offence was AW. She was then aged thirteen years. That is an offence against s 474.26(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 of the Commonwealth and carries a maximum of fifteen years imprisonment. 6. Next PN is charged with three counts of possessing child pornography. That is an offence against s 91H(3) of the New South Wales Crimes Act. It carries a maximum of five years imprisonment. In respect of one of those offences, PN has asked me to take into account under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, no fewer than thirty-eight additional matters, all of which are the same offence of possessing child pornography. In due course I will take those matters into account when I sentence him in respect of that one matter and I sign the form accordingly.7. Next PN is charged with sexual intercourse with a child under special care, who is over sixteen and under seventeen. The victim in that case is BB, his own stepdaughter. That is an offence under s 73(1) of the New South Wales Crimes Act and carries a maximum of eight years imprisonment. 8. Next he is charged with two offences against s 66C(3) of the New South Wales Crimes Act. They are offences of having sexual intercourse with a person who is fourteen but under sixteen years of age. The two victims in that case were TZ, who was fifteen years of age, and again BB, who was then fourteen years of age. Those offences each carry a maximum of ten years imprisonment.9. I here add to remind all those present in the court that any reference to the name of a victim of any of the offences and any reference to PN’s surname outside this court - any publication of that detail or any information which may be able to identify a victim - will be an offence under law.10. Next PN has been charged with a further offence against s 474.26(1) of the Criminal Code Act of the Commonwealth of using a carriage service to procure a person under sixteen years for sexual activity. The victim in that case was a girl named BC who was fifteen. As I said that carries a maximum of fifteen years imprisonment. 11. Next PN was charged with another offence under the Criminal Code Act of the Commonwealth, namely using a carriage service to make it easier to procure for sexual activity, an offence known as grooming. The victim in that case was MD, aged fifteen and it carries a maximum penalty of twelve years imprisonment. In respect of that offence, I take into account five further offences against the same law, involving five additional victims, namely SN, LF, RM, CG and JW. Each of those offences is listed on a form under s16B(a) of the Crimes Act 1914 of the Commonwealth and in due course I will take those additional matters into account when I have signed that form.12. Finally PN has been charged with the offence of disseminating child pornography. That is an offence against s 91A(2) of the New South Wales Crimes Act and carries a maximum of ten years imprisonment. Once again, he has asked me to take into account, additional offences against the same law. On the form under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, there are no fewer than thirteen additional offences which I am asked to take into account and which I will take into account when sentencing him for that matter and I sign the form at this stage.13. It is now necessary to fill in some detail regarding these crimes. The details of the crimes are agreed by the parties and are part of exhibit A in the proceedings. I do not propose to summarise in great detail because the detail is contained in the exhibit but it is necessary for the public record to note some of the important features of these crimes. 14. The description starts with the first crimes which I referred to which are the offences involving the victim AW, which are counts 1 to 4 of sexual intercourse with a person between ten and fourteen and using a carriage service to procure sexual activity. AW lived at relevant time on the Central Coast. PN at the relevant time lived on the South Coast. Police received information regarding a possible offence on 11 May 2007. Their investigation produced the following facts about the offences concerning this victim which I now find occurred.15. The victim established a personal profile on an internet chat site. PN made contact with her through that site. He called himself “Sweet Cash Man”. In communicating with her via the internet, he attempted to convince her to leave home with him and to live in Sydney. PN was fully aware of the fact that the person he was dealing with was a thirteen-year-old girl. There were exchanges such as the following. The victim disclosed that she was thirteen and asked whether it bothered PN. He replied to the effect that he was happy with her age and willing to help with finances if she left. He said “Would you be able to spend the night in a motel with me?” PN suggested the prospect of him and another man both having sex with this thirteen year old girl at the one time. He suggested that he may fall in love with her and might even marry her some day. He suggested, asked her whether she was willing to do both men at once and asked her whether she had tried anal intercourse. He said “Thanks Angel, it’s called double penetration. One of us will be in your pussy while the other one will be in your arse”. When confirming her age, he said “That’s so cool” and then indicated that she would be “the youngest girl I’ve ever fucked”. They exchanged mobile phone numbers and the victim agreed to be picked up near her school on 8 May 2007. 16. PN picked her up and took her from the Central Coast to Sydney. He had disguised his registration plates. They went to a motel at Westmead. They went up by the back entrance in order to avoid being identified on CCTV footage. They purchased food and cigarettes and returned to the motel room. PN began rubbing her vagina. He had penile vaginal intercourse with her and ejaculated inside her. He told her to have a shower. She did this. In the shower he rubbed her breasts with the palms of his hands. After the shower, he digitally penetrated her vagina. He then put his erect penis into her mouth. They then had penile vaginal intercourse once again whilst he ejaculated inside her. The next morning they woke early and once again he had penile vaginal intercourse with her. He dropped her off at Mt Druitt at a shopping centre, saying that he would be in contact with her in a week. The victim spent the night in a nearby park.17. The following day, 10 May 2007, she spoke with police. The police attended PN’s home on 18 May 2007 with a search warrant and arrested him on that day. They then found a number of compact floppy discs, a computer hard drive and other items. He was interviewed and confirmed the activity which had occurred between him and AW to some extent, although he denied any physical contact with her. When told that he would be charged, he admitted to consensual sexual intercourse with her in the morning only. He then made full admissions confirming that he knew that she was aged thirteen.18. When police examined some of the items they seized from PN’s house, they found that thirty-eight of the compact discs contained files, both video and still images, of child pornography, depicting nudity and erotic posing of children, sexual activity between adults and children, penetrative sexual activity including vaginal, anal and oral between adults and children aged from approximately two years, including images of bondage and bestiality. Police estimated there were in excess of 10,000 images and video files of child pornography located on the discs.19. The computer, when it was forensically examined, was found to contain just over 1300 images. Some included females and males as young as two or three years old and up to about fourteen or fifteen, depicted in sexual positions with adults and children of the same and opposite sex. There were images of penetrative sexual acts between adults and young children. There were also a hundred movie files depicting child pornography, including children of varied ages, including some penetrative sexual acts performed on and by children. In another computer seized, they found a hundred images relating to child pornography. Further investigations indicated that PN had been identified as using names such as “Sweet Cash Man” and “Aussie Sugar Daddy” and email addresses including the name “Dangerous Liaisons 69”.20. The facts which I have found so far relate to the offences involving AW and some of the offences involving possession of child pornography. I now go on to detail the facts and make the findings regarding some of the other offences. PN met KB his now wife in late 1991 or early 1992. They married in 1995. KB had two children to a previous relationship. PN and his wife KB had four additional children together. They were born between 1993 and 1998. The eldest child - who was KB’s daughter from a previous relationship -was BB. She was born in 1989.21. In around 2002, PN commenced a sexual relationship with BB. In fact the relationship commenced on 29 December 2001 and concluded on 31 January 2007. She was aged between twelve and seventeen. The sexual relationship involved BB regularly performing fellatio on PN. There were references on his computer to him referring to BB as his daughter. He communicates with somebody else about her. That person asked whether PN any photographs. He replied, “Not many. One giving me head and another naked holding a sign saying “My daddy is Billy Bob 69”. In another communication, PN said that his step-daughter gave him head from when she was aged twelve. There did in fact exist a photograph which was taken of the victim BB holding a sign while she was partially naked saying something to the effect of “My daddy is Billy Bob 69.” PN sent that photograph by the Internet to somebody else. To another person he sent twelve images of a person he described as his daughter. In fact as part of the search, police found an image depicting BB performing fellatio on PN and another one which I described previously where she was lying on her back naked from the waist down, holding up a sign that read “Hi friends of Bill Bob 69 (my daddy).”22. Briefly, regarding the additional charges on the Commonwealth form concerning using carriage service for the purpose of grooming, SN was aged fourteen at the time of the offence and PN commenced discussing topics of a sexual nature after making contact with her. He suggested they meet in person. He talked about a competition to see who could be the first of the two of them to make a girl come to orgasm. 23. Regarding the victim LF, he again made contact with her through an Internet chat site. After suggesting that they meet in person, LF told PN that she was busy with school and church. He followed that by sending her more than fifty messages containing material of a sexual nature.24. Concerning RM, once again he made contact with her through an Internet chat site. They exchanged over 300 messages and voice calls after exchanging phone numbers and talks about material of a sexual nature.25. Regarding CG, he also made contact with her over an Internet chat site, asking her questions of a sexual nature. He asked her whether she was prepared to meet him after school.26. Regarding JW, he also made contact with her through an Internet chat site and suggested meeting her after asking questions of a sexual nature.27. I now turn to the offence of having sexual intercourse with a person under sixteen, namely TZ. This involved also contact with a victim named BC. PN and BC began communicating over the Internet. He asked her if she would have sex with him. She said she didn’t know. He suggested a threesome. He persisted with his questions about whether she wanted to have sex with him. They exchanged nearly 300 text messages and forty voice calls over their mobile phones. PN met BC on three occasions towards the end of 2006. On these occasions she was accompanied by her friend TZ. Both girls were fifteen. PN knew that they were missing school when they met. At one stage PN was asked by the girls if he would help them get alcohol after school.28. PN also exchanged messages with BC’s friend TZ. Once again, over 400 text messages and about twenty voice messages were exchanged. He picked her up from her high school. In September 2006 they went to a car park. They got into the back. He had penile vaginal intercourse with the fifteen-year-old TZ in the back of the car.29. Regarding BC, PN was charged with the offence which I have referred to, of using a carriage service to procure her. 30. Turning to the use of the carriage service to groom a victim namely, MD, she was fifteen at the time. They made contact via the Internet. PN has identified himself with an email address “Dangerous Liaisons 69.” They exchanged mobile phone numbers. Over August and September 2006 they exchanged over 300 text messages and seven voice calls. He sent text messages of a sexual nature. She reminded him of her age. He replied, “Yeah I know, give it time whenever you are ready.”31. Turning finally to the offences of disseminating child pornography, the charge which he is being sentenced for involved him disseminating 157 images depicting child sexual exploitation by sending them over the Internet. They range from photographs of children posing in a semi-naked state to photographs of adults having sexual intercourse with children.32. As I have said, there are thirteen additional offences which involved PN distributing or disseminating respectively on each occasion the following number of images: thirty-seven images, thirty-four images, eight images, twelve images, three images, fifty-three images, forty-eight images, thirty-two images, eight images, forty-two images, 120 images and thirty-eight images. Most of them involved images of children ranging from a state of provocative undress through to having sexual intercourse with adults.33. That completes the brief description of the facts which I find amounted to the crimes committed by PN. 34. Mr Crawford-Fish who appeared for PN called PN’s wife, KB as a witness. She gave evidence about the difficult circumstances in their relationship around the time that PN commenced his relationship with her daughter BB. She said that there was a very difficult time in their marriage when she had ceased working and was at home looking after the six children. She had two breakdowns and there was a lot of pressure on PN financially to support the whole family. Their relationship was very strained and she did not realise what he was doing when he was spending so much time on the computer.35. BB complained to her in January 2007 regarding what PN had been doing with BB. BB indicated that she had forgiven PN. At that stage PN and KB had been separated for some time and she confronted him with the allegations which he denied. Neither BB nor KB took the matter to the police at that stage and it was not until, as I said, 18 May 2007 that PN was arrested after he had sexual intercourse on the number of times I have mentioned with AW. He also continued his possession of child pornography and some of the dissemination of the child pornography in that period.36. KB indicated that her husband has been on protection in custody which is not at all surprising of course given the nature of the crimes that he has pleaded guilty to. She has been in regular contact since he has been in custody and speaks to him every day by phone and visits him weekly.37. BB too visits him regularly. She is now over eighteen. The other children are not permitted to visit by the prison authorities.38. It is clear that PN has the ongoing support of his wife. She indicates that their children also continue to support their father and step-father despite having obvious difficulties in this process. There is also support from PN’s own parents as well as his grandparents and his sister. He also has support from their local church. As she said, she stands by him and forgives him for all he has done.39. KB acknowledged under cross-examination by Mr Brown, who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions, that when she read the facts of the offences she was shocked, sickened, numbed and distressed; she could not believe that her husband had done all these things and BB, KB said, did not want the family ripped apart by these offences, or at least the offences involving her.40. There was also tendered in evidence by Mr Crawford-Fish a report from a consultant forensic psychiatrist, a Dr Jonathan Carne, dated 9 December 2008. Dr Carne confirms PN’s personal history. He is now forty-one years of age and had, as I said, a relatively normal personal upbringing. His parents separated when he was young and his mother remarried and his relationship with his stepfather was poor, but there was no violence or neglect or abuse. He is close to his mother. He finished the HSC and spent two and a half years in the Australian Federal Police before securing other employment regularly in sales and, for the previous five years before his arrest, work in a bar.41. PN detailed to Dr Carne that there was a significant degree of conflict in his relationship with his wife when he commenced his offending with his stepdaughter and that there were many arguments over money. He has no history of drug or alcohol or gambling abuse. He told Dr Carne that he had no interest in child pornography or any sexual contact with children until his stepdaughter BB reached the age of thirteen or so in about 2002 when they commenced the sexual relationship which I have referred to.42. He confirmed to Dr Carne that the sexual relationship with BB continued for five years. Over that period he developed his interest in the Internet and child pornography, visiting chat rooms. I observe at this stage that his offences regarding the use of the Internet range over periods from 1 December 2005 to 8 May 2007. The first actual contact personally with somebody he was communicating with was in late 2006. 43. Dr Carne observed that PN appeared ashamed, remorseful and depressed. In discussing rehabilitation prospects Dr Carne highlighted two features: one is that PN appeared to accept full responsibility for the offending behaviour and to express remorse and regret. That, says Dr Carne, is generally accepted as the first stage in a positive sign of rehabilitation in a sexual offender. He has not blamed any of the victims. The second is that there is no history of any lifelong interest in paedophilia. As the doctor observed, his interest appeared to be awakened when he commenced his sexual relationship with his adolescent stepdaughter. 44. Dr Carne expressed the opinion that these factors pointed to “a greater prospect for rehabilitation than an adult male who has been sexually aroused and interested in adolescents all their adult life.” But, as he adds, the prospects for rehabilitation “can only be judged on [PN’s] response to a treatment program”. He suggests a treatment program including attending the CUBITT Program whilst in custody and seeing a psychiatrist experienced in the treatment of adult sexual offenders. He also considers medication to control his sexual urges and follow-up after release. In due course I will direct that Dr Carne’s report accompany PN into custody. 45. I turn now to submissions made by the parties and my findings in respect of those submissions. I accept Mr Crawford-Fish’s submission that PN’s prospects of rehabilitation are more favourable than for some other offenders. I accept Dr Carne’s observations in this regard. I also accept that he has the full support of his family and church community.46. Mr Crawford-Fish invited me to take into account the remorse shown by PN. There are a number of references to remorse in the evidence, but s 21A(3) has recently been amended to provide that remorse can be taken into account only if the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for their actions and has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by their actions or made reparation. There is evidence that PN has accepted responsibility - that is clear from Dr Carne’s report - but I cannot find in the evidence anywhere any acknowledgment by PN of the injury, loss or damage brought about by these offences.47. I am reminded by that reference to injury, loss or damage of the fact that one of the victims, namely AW, has provided a victim impact statement. It is part of exhibit A and I propose to read it in full. It reads as follows: 
     
      
      “You have ruined everything. You have taken my childhood away from me. I have been losing everything because of what happened to me. I have lost friends and my best friends. I have lost my happiness and my childhood. I have no words that can explain the pain and hurt that has been dwelling inside of me. I may not have scars on the outside, but I do on the inside. The pain and suffering emotionally is so bad. I always feel that I am breaking down inside. Before his happened I was happy. I was also on my way to becoming a straight-A student, but since this happened my grades have dropped.  
       
       
      I have been bullied and changed schools twice since this happened. I find it hard to focus and fit in anywhere now. It is so hard to feel motivated. I cannot hold on to a steady friendship with anyone because I cannot trust people. I cannot be happy any more. You have ruined everything and things will never be how they should be now and for the rest of my life. Even after months of counselling things are not even near how I used to be. [AW].  
       
      7 December 2008.” 
       
      
    That is an articulate and graphic illustration of the tragedy which these kinds of crimes committed against children can have in their lives. I will be taking that into account in sentencing PN, and indeed I find that the emotional harm brought about to AW was substantial in accordance with s 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 48. Returning to the submissions, Mr Crawford-Fish realistically acknowledges that in respect of the offences involving sexual intercourse, they were clearly planned and involved deception. I had not included amongst the facts that often PN lied about his real age. Mr Crawford-Fish acknowledged, which is part of the offending behaviour, rather than an aggravating feature separately to be taken into account, that his client had targeted young girls and that the number of victims was significant. He pointed out correctly that none of the relationships involved any violence of threats. This means that there is absent what might have been an even greater aggravation to his criminal behaviour.49. The dissemination of the pornographic material was over a relatively short period of time and I take that into account. I also take into account that there was no profit involved in the dissemination of the material. The possession of the pornography appeared to extend over some period of years, Mr Crawford-Fish correctly acknowledged. He also acknowledged that, correctly in my opinion, the seriousness of the child pornography involved in the offences on the scale known as COPINE ranged from level 1 through to level 8 or level 9. Level 1 is the least serious; level 8 involves pictures of children being the subject to a sexual assault involving digital touching and involving an adult; level 9 involves grossly obscene pictures of sexual assault involving penetrative sex, masturbation or oral sex involving an adult. From the description that I have given, those concessions are appropriate and indeed it does extend to level 9 I find. 50. Mr Crawford-Fish submitted that there needs to be some partial concurrency, so far as the sentencing of his client for the crimes committed against AW were concerned, and some concurrency in respect of some of the other offences and I have taken into account those submissions.51. He urged me to take into account the following matters under s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. First was that his client does not have any significant record of previous convictions. I do take that into account. As I said at the commencement of these remarks, PN’s record is relatively minor. He has convictions in his early twenties for malicious damage, assault and malicious injury, and about three or fours years ago he was convicted of driving with a low range of prescribed concentration of alcohol. I will take that into account in his favour.52. Next, Mr Crawford-Fish asked me to take into account that he is a person of good character. I give limited weight to that factor for reasons which I will refer to in due course. 53. He has asked me to take into account that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. I do take those into account. On balance I do regard his prospects of rehabilitation as good.54. Finally, he has asked me to take into account that his client has pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity. I do take that into account and will in due course specify how I take that into account. So far as the Commonwealth offences are concerned, he referred to the corresponding provision under s 16A(2) and asked me to take into account his client’s contrition which I do because the provision is not so restricted as the State provision. I also take into account his client’s plea of guilty, his character to limited extent and his prospects of rehabilitation. 55. Mr Brown, for the Director of Public Prosecutions, correctly characterised the offending on the Internet as involving a parent’s worst nightmare. This must be particularly so in respect of the offences committed against AW, a school girl who was contacted by PN on the Internet, picked up from her school and taken away to a motel room in a capital city for the purposes of sexual intercourse which they engage in before he drops her off at a shopping centre after which she spends the night in a park.56. In characterising the offences, Mr Brown in respect of the AW sexual intercourse offences, invites me to find that they are in the high range because she was thirteen years of age, was picked up from school and taken away from her local area to the city. I am inclined to agree with his submission and I think those offences must be in the middle to high range of seriousness for offences of that kind. 57 As for the procuring of AW, he submits that it is quite serious and towards the high range because of her age. She was sixteen and the provision regards anyone being procured under sixteen as an offence, so I do regard that as in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. As for the possession of the child pornography, he submits that it is at least in the middle of the range and in light of Mr Crawford-Fish’s appropriate and correct concession regarding the nature of the material, I regard the possession as towards the top of the middle of the range. I do not regard it as in the top of the range because the number of images compared to some other cases is not as great.58. As far as the sexual intercourse with his stepdaughter BB is concerned, Mr Brown submits that it is at least mid range but not high range because it did not involve penile intercourse. I accept that submission and find that the offence is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness.59. As for the sexual intercourse with TZ and BB as a fourteen-year-old are concerned, I find them both in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. The offence against TZ is towards the top of that range because it involved penile intercourse, and the offence against BB is towards the bottom of the middle of the range.60. So far as procuring BC is concerned, she was fifteen at the time and I regard that offence as in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. So far as the grooming of MD is concerned, I regard that as in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Finally, the dissemination of the child pornography, I regard as being in the high range of objective seriousness particularly since some of the images - at least one disseminated - was of his own stepdaughter.61. In contrast to Mr Crawford-Fish, Mr Brown selected the seven or eight month period of some of these offences submitting that it is not a long period. I find obviously that these offences were not committed in isolation representing a few days or a week’s separation, but on the other hand they did not extend - so far as some of the procuring offences - over an extended period of time such as years.62. Mr Brown submits that there is a question mark over his rehabilitation. I think that is a sound submission but, as I say, on balance I accept the evidence of Dr Carne, backed up as it is by the support of the family. 63. I have been referred to some authorities and I make brief reference to the principles which are engaged by those authorities. Clearly, so far as the possession and dissemination of child pornography is concerned, these are crimes where the factor of general deterrence is paramount. This is made clear in a number of the authorities. Although the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision in R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370 concerns the importation of child pornography, the observations in that judgment about the importance of general deterrence related to the use of these images promoting the victimisation of the children who are the subject of the images, are relevant to a case such as this. In Gent, the Court of Criminal Appeal referred to a judgment of the Queensland Court of Appeal in R v Cook; ex parte Attorney-General (Qld) [2004] QCA 469. I refer to a passage from the judgment of Williams J at [26] of that judgment where the Judge refers to Kennedy J in R v Jones (1999) 108 A Crim R 50: 
     
      
      “The production of child pornography for dissemination involves the exploitation and corruption of children who are incapable of protecting themselves. The collection of such material is likely to encourage those who are actively involved in corrupting the children involved in the sexual activities depicted in who recruit and use those children for the purpose of recording and distributing the results. The offence of possessing child pornography cannot be characterised as a victimless crime. The children, in the end, are the victims.” 
       
      
    64. I have taken into account in sentencing for the Commonwealth offences of procuring the factors referred to in Tector v R [2008] NSWCCA 151.65. The good character up till now of PN, the offender in this case, must be given limited weight because he had since 2002 been committing serious sexual offences against his own stepdaughter. I am sentencing him only in respect of two of those crimes but there is evidence that he had been engaged in sexual activity since she was the age of twelve, and that reduces significantly the weight I put on his good character.66. I turn now to the sentences which I must impose for these crimes. I propose to approach the sentencing in this way. Because there are so many different crimes, or different types of crime in respect of some of which I need to take into account additional charges, I need to bear in mind eventually the principles of totality and proportionality. This will need to be reflected in the sentences being in many respects concurrent with each other. But the initial approach I propose to take is to indicate what I regard as appropriate sentences for each of these crimes and then I will indicate what the total of that sentence is. I will then apply certain discounts to reach a final sentence in respect of each of the crimes. In listing first the appropriate sentence before discount, I do not propose to refer to any non-parole periods. 67. In respect of the sexual intercourse assault against AW, in respect of which I take into account the Form 1 matters, I would regard a sentence of ten years imprisonment as appropriate from 18 May 2007 to 17 May 2017.68 In respect of each of the other three sexual intercourse offences against AW, I would regard a penalty of eight years as appropriate. One of them should commence on 18 May 2008 and finish on 17 May 2016. The second should commence on 18 May 2009 and conclude on 17 May 2017. The third should commence on 18 May 2010 and conclude on 17 May 2018. I emphasise that these are not the penalties which I will ultimately impose but they indicate the seriousness of the matters in respect of which I am sentencing PN.69. For the offence of using a carriage service to procure AW, I regard a penalty of seven years as appropriate to commence on 18 May 2012 and to conclude on 17 May 2019.70. In respect of the offence of using a carriage service to procure BC, once again a seven-year penalty is appropriate from 18 May 2013 to 17 May 2020. 71 For the offence of using a carriage service to groom MD, an eight-year penalty is appropriate because there is a Form 1 which I take into account regarding that matter, and that would be eight years from 18 May 2014 to 17 May 2022.72 In respect of the two offences of sexual intercourse with TZ and BB, in respect of TZ, I regard a six-year penalty as appropriate from 18 May 2017 to 17 May 2023. In respect of the offence against BC, a five-year penalty is appropriate from 18 May 2019 to 17 May 2024.73. In respect of the sexual intercourse with his stepdaughter BB, I regard a five-year penalty as appropriate from 18 May 2020 to 17 May 2025.74. For the possession of child pornography, for the offence to which are attached the additional offences, I regard a four-year penalty as appropriate from 18 May 2022 to 17 May 2026.75. For the other two offences, I would impose concurrent sentences of three years from 18 May 2024 to 17 May 2027.76. Finally, for the dissemination of child pornography, taking into account the additional matters, I regard an eight-year penalty as appropriate from 18 May 2021 to 17 May 2029. 77. The total of those sentences by my calculations is from 18 May 2007 to 17 May 2029, that is some twenty-two years. Taking into account the fact that PN had no prior convictions, his limited good character and his prospects of rehabilitation, I would reduce that overall sentence to twenty years imprisonment. 78. It is here that I take into account the fact that PN has pleaded guilty to all these offences, as Mr Crawford-Fish points out, alleviating the need for many victims of his crimes to be required to come forward and give evidence. I propose to give him the maximum discount of twenty-five per cent. Accordingly I would regard an overall head sentence for all of these offences as fifteen years imprisonment. 79. The normal statutory non-parole period representing such a penalty would be something over eleven years. I accept the submissions made by Mr Crawford-Fish that there are special circumstances in this case which justify me adjusting that ratio, namely, his client’s need for treatment, the fact that he will be on protection, the fact that he will be unable to see his children and the fact that this is his first time in custody. I therefore propose to fix an overall non-parole period of ten years to conclude on 18 May 2017. 80. In some respects, compared to the figures which I initially outlined, a minimum term in gaol of ten years might be regarded as relatively lenient for the extent of the depravity involved in the crimes and the number of victims involved in these crimes committed by PN. But I need to take into account that I should impose a sentence which is not crushing so far as PN is concerned. I calculate that when he will be released he will be aged fifty years.81. I turn now to the individual sentences which I will impose in respect of these crimes. These I will need you Mr Crawford-Fish and Mr Brown to make a careful note of because I will hear you after lunch about these. I will sentence in a different order from what I previously indicated.82. In respect of the dissemination of child pornography, taking into account the matters on Form 1, I fix a non-parole period of six years from 18 May 2007 to expire on 17 May 2013. The balance of the term will be two years from 18 May 2013 to 17 May 2015.83. In respect of the possession of child pornography, taking into account the Form 1 matters, I sentence PN to a fixed term of imprisonment of four years from 18 May 2007 to 17 May 2011.84. In respect of each of the other two possession of child pornography offences, I sentence him to a fixed term of three years to commence 18 May 2007 and to conclude on 17 May 2010.85. In respect of the sexual intercourse with BB under special care against s 73(1) of the Crimes Act, I sentence PN to a fixed term of five years to commence on 18 May 2007 and to conclude on 17 May 2012.86. In respect of the two offences of sexual intercourse with TZ and BB: in respect of TZ, I sentence PN to six years imprisonment to commence on 18 May 2008 and to expire on 17 May 2014, that is a fixed term; in respect of the offence against BB I sentence him to five years from 18 May 2007 to expire on 17 May 2012.87. In respect of the use of the carriage service to groom MD, I fix a non-parole period of six years and six months to commence on 18 May 2007 and to expire on 17 May 2013. The balance of the term will be one year and six months to commence on 18 November 2013 and to conclude on 17 May 2015.88. In respect of the use of the carriage service to procure BC, I set a fixed term of seven years from 18 November 2007 to 17 November 2014.89. In respect of the use of the carriage service to procure AW, I set a fixed term of seven years to commence on 18 May 2008 and to conclude on 17 May 2015.90. In respect of one of the counts of sexual intercourse with AW, I fix a non-parole period of six years to commence on 18 November 2009 and to expire on 17 November 2015. The balance of the term will be two years from 18 November 2015 expiring on 17 November 2017.91. In respect of the second sexual intercourse offence against AW, I fix a non-parole period of six years from 18 February 2010 to expire on 17 February 16. The balance of the term will be two years from 18 February 2016 to 17 February 2018.92. In respect of the third offence of sexual intercourse with AW, I fix a non-parole period of six years to commence 18 May 2010 and to expire on 17 May 2016. A balance of the term will be two years from 18 May 2016 to 17 May 2018.93. In respect of the sexual intercourse against AW to which are attached the additional offences on Form 1, I fix a non-parole period of five years to commence on 18 May 2012 and to expire on 17 May 2015. The balance of the term will be five years to commence on 18 May 2017 and to conclude on 17 May 2022. 94. The overall sentence is fifteen years to commence on 18 May 2007 and to conclude on 17 May 2022. The non-parole period is ten years to commence on 18 May 2007 and to conclude on 17 May 2017. 95. That does not conclude the sentence but that is as far as I propose to take it from now. I will hear from Mr Brown and Mr Crawford-Fish, you both, at 5 past 3.MATTER STOOD IN LISTLUNCHEON ADJOURNMENTHIS HONOUR: Mr Brown and Mr Crawford-Fish, the matter of PN. BROWN: Just as far as the actual sentences that your Honour has imposed, there’s just one matter. That was in respect of, if I can call it - or matter number 4, the sexual intercourse with a person between ten and fourteen where your Honour took into account the Form 1 offences.HIS HONOUR: Yes.BROWN: That your Honour specified a non-parole period of five years commencing 18 May 2012--HIS HONOUR: Correct.BROWN: --and I heard your Honour say 17 May 2015.HIS HONOUR: It should have been 2017.BROWN: Yes your Honour.96. I’ve got 2017 here in front of me so for clarity in respect of the offence just identified by Mr Brown, the non-parole period is five years from 18 May 2012 to 17 May 2017. The balance of the term is five years from 18 May 2017 to 17 May 2022.BROWN: Thank you your Honour. I know your Honour’s not quite finished but if I could just go to one matter in your Honour’s remarks. When your Honour was categorising the criminality of matter number 5 which is also sequence 10, that is use carriage service to procure AW, when your Honour categorised that as towards the higher range, you said one of the reasons - and I think you meant that AW was thirteen but you actually said that she was sixteen years. That was what I heard your Honour. I know your Honour meant to say thirteen years. I just bring that to your Honour’s attention.97. Yes what I meant to say is that the parameter for the offence is under sixteen and she’s thirteen so that she is at least two years under that limit, yes.BROWN: Thank you your Honour we’ve just clarified that. Then one other minor matter and that’s just in respect to the Crown sentence summary that was handed up to your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Yes.BROWN: I think your Honour in fact corrected it as you went through your remarks, about point 3 on page 2 of that summary sheet, as far as the charge that was to be - that the matters of use carriage service to procure were to be taken into account on or in respect of, your Honour certainly referred to the victim MD and I don’t know if your Honour’s sheet had, but mine did. My friend’s, he’d had BC there, whether or not that had been changed at some point at sequence 13--HIS HONOUR: It does have BC.BROWN: It has BC. When your Honour did make your remarks, you did refer to MD.HIS HONOUR: Yes.BROWN: Whenever you did refer to that matter. I wonder if that change could be made so that the record could be complete.98. All right. You’ve indicated that exhibit A needs to be amended on page 2 about a third of the way down where it says to place on form - principal offence - use carriage service to make it easy to procure for sexual activity (grooming) sequence 13 (BC) should read (MD) and I will make that change. Yes.BROWN: Thank you your Honour. The only other thing that just might assist your Honour and I think your Honour was going to go this anyway, in sentencing for the Commonwealth offences has, I read, 19AB that because your Honour has not specified a non-parole period for the Commonwealth offences, that your Honour would state your reasons. I know it’s obvious and my friend would realise it’s obvious from the way you’re structuring your sentence, but I just thought I’d refer you to that if that does assist, 19A, AB subsection--HIS HONOUR: I’d be grateful, just let me find because I was given the legislation.BROWN: If you don’t have it I’ve got it and I could hand mine up your Honour.HIS HONOUR: I’ve got the criminal--BROWN: I think you’re given the Criminal Code but you weren’t given the extracts from the Crimes Act.HIS HONOUR: No I need the Crimes Act.BROWN: It might be easier if I hand this up your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Thank you. Number 13 I gave a non-parole period. Number 12, I didn’t, so it’s 12 and 5 I didn’t. I think it’s 5 and 12 is that right?BROWN: Twelve, you didn’t give a non-parole period.HIS HONOUR: That’s correct I gave just a fixed term of seven years.BROWN: Fixed term yes, and the same with 5.HIS HONOUR: Five I gave a fixed term of seven years as well but the other Commonwealth, the third Commonwealth offence number 13--BROWN: You did.HIS HONOUR: I did?BROWN: Yes.HIS HONOUR: Okay. So what’s the section?BROWN: Subsection (4) of--HIS HONOUR: Of 18?BROWN: I’ve got 19AB.HIS HONOUR: Just let me read it. Thank you. 99. In accordance with section 19AB(4) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Commonwealth), my reasons for not setting a non-parole period in respect of the offence of using the carriage service to procure AW, and using the carriage service to procure BC - both offences against s 474.261 of the Criminal Code Act - are that the non-parole periods for other offences are greater than fixed terms that I set for those two offences and therefore there would be no utility in fixing non-parole periods for those two offences. Yes.BROWN: Thank you your Honour, yes. HIS HONOUR: Anything else Mr Brown?BROWN: No I can’t think of anything else your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Okay thank you. Mr Crawford-Fish?CRAWFORD-FISH: Would your Honour mind repeating a remark that your Honour made earlier and that is that it would be an offence to mention the names of any of the victims or that of the offender.HIS HONOUR: Yes. That is the case. 100. In giving my remarks on sentence, I had to refer to the names of victims and the name of the offender. It is an offence to repeat outside this court, to publish outside this court, any information which would identify any of the victims of any of the offences. One such piece of information is the name of the offender PN because one of the victims, BB is also known as BN. So I repeat it is an offence to publish out side this courtroom any information by which any of the victims could be identified. Okay.BROWN: Just one further matter I remembered your Honour in as far as the exhibits were concerned the images--HIS HONOUR: Yes.BROWN: --if I could ask for an destruction order in respect of those?HIS HONOUR: Yes. Now yesterday I was asked for one of those and it was to be post-dated.BROWN: Yes well it shouldn’t happen straightaway but perhaps if--HIS HONOUR: Somebody suggested yesterday, somebody in the opposition [?] suggested 30 June 2009.BROWN: That would be fine too by then, yes.HIS HONOUR: All right.BROWN: And if the police could come as soon as - with the registry to sign for those exhibits.HIS HONOUR: I’m just wondering where those exhibits are. I’ll just get them.BROWN: Unfortunately the police haven’t come back after lunch. They would need to remain with the registry and I’ll ask the police to come as soon as possible to sign for them.HIS HONOUR: All right. So it’s exhibit B and exhibit C I think, is that right?BROWN: That’s correct your Honour.HIS HONOUR: All right. 101. First I direct that exhibits B and C ought to be collected by the police involved in this matter this afternoon from the registry. Secondly, that those exhibits are to be destroyed but not before 30 June 2009.BROWN: Thank you your Honour.HIS HONOUR: I’ll return those two exhibits to my Associate. Now so far as the figures are concerned, any corrections needed?BROWN: No your Honour.CRAWFORD-FISH: No your Honour.HIS HONOUR: All right. 102. To confirm, I direct that a copy of the report of Dr Jonathan Carne accompany PN into custody, that is exhibit 1, and be made available to those persons in the Department of Correctional Services who may be responsible for any treatment of him or any rehabilitation. There is one other thing I have to do, explain the sentences to PN.103. PN I’m obliged to explain to you that the overall sentence commences on 18 May 2007 which is when you first went into custody. You've heard how the sentences are divided up into the various sentences which I read out. The overall sentence is one of 15 years commencing on 18 May 2007 and concluding on 17 May 2022. Your sentence will be finished on 17 May 2022. There is a non-parole period of ten years and the earliest day on which it appears on the basis of information available to the court that you will become eligible to be released on parole is 17 May 2017, that’s exactly ten years from when you went into custody. Whether or not you are released on parole is not a matter for me but for the Parole Authority, but that is the date on which it appears to me you will be eligible to be released on parole. All right you may sit down.Is there anything else I need to do in the matter of PN?BROWN: I don’t think so your Honour.CRAWFORD-FISH: No your Honour.HIS HONOUR: All right. PN can be taken down.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: On 7 November 2007, the applicant, Mr Dennis John Stanton, was convicted of one count of supply prohibited drug, being methylamphetamine, contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 and three counts of knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug (two counts involving the drug methylamphetamine and one count involving the drug MDMA, or Ecstasy), contrary to the same provision. Three further offences of knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug were included on a Form 1, in accordance with s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The conviction followed upon a plea of guilty entered by the applicant in the Local Court approximately six weeks prior to his conviction.  
     
      
    2 The maximum penalty for an offence under s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act is 15 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $220,000: see ss 32(1)(c) and 32(1)(e) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and s 17 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The sentencing judge, her Honour Payne DCJ, imposed on the applicant the following sentences: on each of counts 2 and 3 in respect of the offences of knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug, a term of imprisonment of 18 months commencing on 14 June 2007 and expiring on 13 December 2008; in respect of count 4, also being an offence of knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug, a non-parole period of 15 months, commencing on 14 December 2007 and expiring on 13 March 2009, with a balance of term of 9 months, expiring on 13 December 2009; in respect of count 1, also being the offence of supply prohibited drug (the supply offence), a non-parole period of 18 months imprisonment, commencing on 14 March 2008 and expiring on 13 September 2009, with a balance of term of 18 months, expiring on 13 March 2011. The three matters on the Form 1 were taken into account in the sentencing in respect of the supply offence.  
     
      
    3 The total effective sentence to which the applicant was sentenced was 3 years 9 months, with a total non-parole period of 2 years 3 months. 
     
      
    4 The offences of which the applicant was convicted arose out of a controlled operation conducted by police into the activities of the Rebels Outlaw Motorcycle Gang, Mid North West Chapter (the Motorcycle Gang). The offences occurred over a one month period, in circumstances where there were drug sales to police undercover operatives. Other persons, including David Keen (the co-offender), involved in the drug supplies were also charged and convicted. On 14 June 2007, police executed a search warrant on the applicant’s residence, in which he revealed to police a large number of small used resealable bags and a number of used syringes.  
     
      
    5 In her Remarks on Sentence, her Honour stated that in “a summary way”, the court was concerned with the applicant’s offending over a period between 14 March 2007 and 24 April 2007, when he supplied, or was involved in the supply, of 38.58 g of methylamphetamine and 2.27 g of MDMA, being 11 tablets, the purity of which was 42 per cent. Her Honour noted that although the quantity of MDMA might seem small, it was nearly twice the indictable quantity of 1.25 g. In respect of the methylamphetamine, the amount involved was in excess of seven times the indictable quantity, which is 5 g. The total amount of money which changed hands was $6,100 for the methylamphetamine and $340 for the MDMA. Her Honour noted the amounts involved in each of the transactions, other than for the first supply, were “well above street-level dealing”. Her Honour commented that even 1 g of methylamphetamine was not a small amount, as there are frequently street sales for 0.1 g. In his evidence before her Honour, the applicant stated that 0.1 g of methylamphetamine is sold for about $50.  
     
      
    6 Her Honour stated that general deterrence must be a feature of the sentencing exercise she was undertaking. She referred to the frequent statements made by this Court that the dissemination of illegal drugs into the community is a serious matter and that those who participate in that supply commit serious offences. Her Honour accepted, however, that the applicant’s role was not the most serious of those involved in the particular supply and that he was a facilitator. Her Honour also accepted that the applicant was somewhat vulnerable, as he had been recruited, or at least made himself available, because he was a drug addict. Her Honour accepted that the applicant’s financial gain from the operation was no more than venture money, as well as some cigarettes and methylamphetamine from the dealer.  
     
      
    7 The applicant’s personal circumstances revealed a significant degree of sadness and some disadvantage. He is of Aboriginal descent and although his childhood and developmental years were stable and relatively socially advantageous, he began binge drinking from around 13 years on weekends and developed a drug dependency from about the age of 17, when he commenced using cannabis. The applicant commenced using amphetamines in 2001 and this also developed into a dependence, involving intravenous injections several times a day. This dependency arose following his resignation from his employment after being charged with assault. Up until that time, he had consistently engaged in fulltime employment.  
     
      
    8 In a psychological report prepared for the applicant for the purposes of the sentence hearing, Ms Katie Seidler, psychologist, stated that the time following his resignation in 2001, “represent[ed] a period of substantial decompensation for [the applicant] in a range of areas”. He has not worked since then.  
     
      
    9 The applicant was aged 42 at the time of sentence and at the time he was taken into custody, he had the care of three of his 10 children. He has maintained a close relationship with his mother, who has continued to provide him with strong support over the years. His mother is presently very ill, having suffered with cancer for about five years. The trial judge accepted that the applicant’s mother’s illness will make his conditions of custody more onerous for him, because of his concern for her health.  
     
      
    10 Initially, when the applicant was taken into custody for these offences, he was on “limited association” and was in fear there may be some retaliation from the Motorcycle Gang. At the time of sentence, he was under a lower level of protection and her Honour noted that it was always difficult to know what protection status a prisoner would have during any term of imprisonment. Nonetheless, her Honour gave weight to the applicant’s custodial conditions thus far. 
     
      
       
      The issue on the sentence appeal 
       
      
    11 The applicant seeks leave to appeal pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. If leave is granted, he raises a single ground of appeal, namely, the disparity between his sentence and that of the co-offender is such that he had a justifiable sense of grievance which should be redressed by a lesser sentence being imposed on him than was imposed by Payne DCJ.  
     
      
    12 The co-offender pleaded guilty to two counts of ongoing supply of MDMA contrary to s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act; two counts of supply methylamphetamine contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and one count of supply MDMA contrary to that section. The offence contrary to s 25A attracts a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. There were taken into account on a Form 1 in relation to the s 25(1) offence, five matters of supply prohibited drug, being variously cannabis, cocaine and methylamphetamine.  
     
      
    13 The offences for which the co-offender was convicted occurred over a period of three months, from 15 March 2007 to 14 June 2007. The total amount of prohibited drugs supplied by him was 157.9 g of methylamphetamine and 85.58 g of MDMA. These amounts did not include the quantity of drugs involved on the Form 1 counts.  
     
      
    14 The co-offender, who also pleaded guilty, was sentenced by his Honour Toner DCJ on 17 April 2008. After allowing a 25 per cent discount for the plea, his Honour sentenced the co-offender to a total sentence of 4 years 4 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years 4 months. He is due for release on 13 October 2009. The effect of the sentence imposed on the co-offender, therefore, was that he was sentenced to an overall sentence 7 months longer than that imposed on the applicant and a non-parole period of 1 month longer than that imposed on the applicant.  
     
      
    15 The applicant complains that he has a justifiable sense of grievance, having regard to the sentence imposed on him compared to that of his co-offender. It was submitted that this was so, given both the relative subjective and objective features of their respective offending.  
     
      
    16 So far as their subjective features were concerned, both men were of Aboriginal descent. The applicant was older, being 42 years of age, whereas the co-offender was 27 at the time of sentence. The applicant’s circumstances are such that, notwithstanding a relatively stable family upbringing, he has a number of significant personal problems due to his drug dependency, particularly following his decompensation when he resigned from his job after being charged with assault. The co-offender was the product of an exceptionally dysfunctional family and had been introduced to and encouraged to use various illicit drugs and alcohol from the age of 12. 
     
      
    17 Both offenders had demonstrated remorse and both were considered to have good prospects of rehabilitation. Special circumstances were found in each case.  
     
      
    18 The applicant has a long criminal history, which does not do him much credit. His record commences with a small stealing offence in 1985 and has subsequently involved more serious offences, including assault, malicious damage, goods in custody and two offences for contravening an apprehended violence order. Nonetheless, Payne DJC did not consider that history disentitled him to some leniency. There were no previous drug offences. He has already served one term of imprisonment, in 2002, for offences including the possession of firearms. By contrast, the co-offender had a minor criminal history involving a mid-range PCA, assault and damage to property. Each of those offences was dealt with by way of a fine.  
     
      
    19 The co-offender’s role in the particular drug operation out of which these offences arose was more serious than that of the applicant. First, he was involved in a greater number of offences: 10 offences, including those on the Form 1, as compared to the applicant’s 7 offences, including those on the Form 1. The co-offender also played a much greater role in the offences than did the applicant. He was the person who supplied the drugs to the applicant in respect of the 3 offences of knowingly take part in supply prohibited drug. He was involved in the supply of approximately four times the amount of methylamphetamine compared to the supply in which the applicant was involved: 157.9 g, compared with 38.58 g; and approximately 37 times the amount of MDMA compared with those in which the applicant was involved: 85.58 g, compared to 2.27 g. The total amounts of money involved in the supply was also substantially greater in the co-offender’s case. Further, when a search warrant was executed on the co-offender’s residence, an amount of $4,000 was found in his bedroom. A further amount of $13,500 was found in the bedroom belonging to another co-accused. The applicant received $50 for the individual sales, some cigarettes and a small quantity of drugs for his personal use. 
     
      
    20 The following table, helpfully prepared by Ms Loukas, counsel for the applicant, demonstrates the differences in the quantities of drugs and the amounts paid for those drugs by the undercover operatives.

    21 As I have mentioned, both the applicant and the co-offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and full effect was given to the utilitarian value of this plea by each of their Honours Payne DCJ and Toner DCJ, by allowing a 25 per cent reduction in the sentence which otherwise would have been imposed.  
     
      
    22 There is no dispute as to the appropriate principles to be applied when the ground of appeal is that a co-offender has a justifiable sense of grievance, having regard to the sentence imposed upon the co-offender. In Lowe v R [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606 Mason J stated, at 613, that appellate intervention is called for, not because of error on the part of the sentencing judge, but because: 
     
      
       
        
        “… disparity engenders a justifiable sense of grievance in the applicant and an appearance of injustice to that impassive representative of the community, the objective bystander.” 
        
       
      
    23 Mason J had earlier in his judgment commented, at 611, that unequal treatment under the law would lead to “an erosion of public confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice”. Dawson J, at 623, observed to similar effect, that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… justice should be even-handed and … any difference between the sentences imposed upon co-offenders for the same offence ought not be such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the offender with the heavier sentence or to give the appearance that justice has not been done.” 
        
       
      
    24 These principles were reiterated in Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295. In that case, Dawson and Gaudron JJ stated, at 301: 
     
      
       
        
        “Equal justice requires that like should be treated alike but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them.” 
        
       
      
    25 In R v Doggett (NSWCCA, 24 March 1997, unreported) Sully J, with whom Newman J agreed, stated that to succeed on an appeal under this ground: 
     
      
       
        
        “What has to be demonstrated by the person complaining … is not that he feels aggrieved, but that a reasonable mind looking overall at what has happened, would see that the offender’s grievance is justified.” 
        
       
      
    26 Nevertheless, there are limits concerning the circumstances in which a court will intervene, as explained by Hunt J in R v Diamond (NSWCCA, 18 February 1993, unreported). His Honour, at 6, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The issue is whether the particular sense of grievance (or of injustice) is a legitimate one. There is, in my view, a stage at which the inadequacy of the sentence imposed upon the co-offender is so grave that the sense of grievance engendered can no longer be regarded as a legitimate one.” 
        
       
      
    27 I have given consideration to the application of that principle in this case. However, although the sentence imposed on the co-offender, particularly the non-parole period, is somewhat lenient, it could not be said that it was inadequate. Accordingly, the principle in Diamond is not engaged.  
     
      
    28 At the time that the co-offender was sentenced by Toner DCJ, the applicant had already been sentenced and Toner DCJ had available not only the sentence imposed upon him, but also Payne DJC’s remarks on sentence. It is apparent from his Honour’s remarks that he was conscious of the need to have regard to the principles relating to parity. He was also conscious that there were differences in the circumstances of each offender. His Honour approached the sentencing of the co-offender on the basis that each offence was objectively serious and each involved a degree of planning, although he considered there was some material to suggest the offender’s motivation was to finance his drug addiction. However, his Honour correctly observed that this was not an answer to the charge nor did it mitigate the penalty to be imposed: see R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; 106 A Crim R 149.  
     
      
    29 Toner DCJ then made two comments which are relevant to the question whether of the applicant now has a justifiable sense of grievance, in addition to the matters to which reference has already been made. The first comment related to the number of offences to which each offender had pleaded guilty. His Honour noted that the applicant was charged with 7 counts of supply pursuant to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, whereas the co-offender had been charged with 2 counts of ongoing supply under s 25A of that Act, and 3 counts of supply contrary to s 25(1). His Honour’s comparison of the number of offences was erroneous. In specifying the number of offences committed by the applicant, his Honour included the matters on the Form 1. However, when considering the number of offences committed by the co-offender, his Honour did not include the matters on Form 1. As I have already stated above, the co-offender was in fact charged with 10 offences, not 5. The correct numerical comparison, therefore, was that the applicant was convicted of 4 offences, and charged but not convicted of, an additional 3 offences listed on the Form 1 (a total of 7 offences). The co-offender was convicted of 5 offences, and charged but not convicted of a further 5 offences listed on the Form 1 (a total of 10 offences). 
     
      
    30 It is apparent from Toner DCJ’s remarks on sentence that the erroneous comparison of the number of offences was relevant to his Honour’s approach in sentencing the co-offender, when comparing the sentences imposed on the applicant. 
     
      
    31 His Honour also noted that sentences under s 25A should be more severe than those imposed for offences against s 25(1): Mirza v R [2007] NSWCCA 248 per Howie J at [14]. His Honour then made the following comment in respect of the applicant: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the context of [the applicant’s] case, however, it is difficult to see why [the applicant] was not charged pursuant to s 25A of the  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
         because, on the face of it at least, the facts as revealed in the reasons of her Honour, would have justified such a charge. It would appear that it was only a matter of forensic selection by the Director which resulted in him being charged as he was.”  
        
       
      
    32 This comment gives the appearance that the applicant was fortunate in being charged with the less serious offences under s 25(1) and that it might be thought, therefore, that the sentences imposed on him did not fully reflect his criminality. If that is a correct understanding of his Honour’s remarks, then, with respect, they were out of place. If it is not a correct understanding, the comment is irrelevant and should not have been made. Mr Rowling, counsel for the Crown on the appeal, appropriately recognised that having regard to the applicant’s lesser role in the offences, it was fairer to charge him with offences under s 25(1), rather than under s 25A. I am of the opinion that this consideration by Toner DCJ was also a factor in his sentencing approach. 
     
      
    33 Ms Loukas, counsel for the applicant, submitted that when regard was had to the greater degree of offending and the more serious role that the co-offender played, the applicant had a justifiable sense of grievance that required redress. She submitted that the more extensive prior criminal record of the applicant and his age did not explain the disparity in his sentence as compared to that of the co-offender. The Crown submitted, however, that Toner DCJ had treated the applicant’s criminal record as being a significant factor which differentiated his position from that of the co-offender in accordance with the principles in Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465.  
     
      
    34 In Veen (No 2) Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ commented, at 477, that an offender’s prior criminal history was a relevant consideration in determining the sentence to be imposed. In particular, a prior criminal history was relevant to show whether the particular offending with which the court is concerned indicates that such behaviour was aberrant, or whether it demonstrates a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law.  
     
      
    35 In my opinion, notwithstanding Toner DCJ’s comparison of the criminal history of each of the applicant and the co-offender his Honour did not treat this case as governed by the principles in Veen (No 2). Nor, in my opinion, does the difference in the offenders’ criminal records explain the disparity in the sentences imposed on each of them. I consider that his Honour failed to have proper regard to the co-offender’s far more serious offending. With respect to Toner DCJ, I am also of the opinion that his erroneous comparison of the number of offences with which each of the offenders were charged and his comments as to the manner in which the applicant had been charged, that is, with less serious offences, led his Honour to misunderstand the appropriate difference that he, as a matter of law, was required to have regard in order to ensure the principles in Lowe and Postiglione were applied in the sentence he imposed, notwithstanding the differences in the circumstances of each offender. 
     
      
    36 In those circumstances, notwithstanding the fact that the original sentence imposed upon Mr Stanton would not have called for appellate intervention, I am of the opinion that as a result of the sentence imposed by Toner DCJ on the co-offender, the applicant would have a justifiable sense of grievance such as to require this Court to intervene. 
     
      
    37 As I propose to impose different sentences on the appellant, I will take a slightly different approach from Payne DCJ and impose different sentences in respect of counts 2 and 3, so as to reflect the different amounts involved in the transaction. In the case of the transaction in count 2 , an amount of $2,000 was involved, whereas in count 3, an of $340 was involved. Although the drug in each case was different, and notwithstanding that the quantity of drug is not necessarily a determining factor in the objective gravity of the offence: see Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584, I consider that the difference in the monetary value of the transaction was substantial and ought to be reflected in the sentences imposed. 
     
      
    38 So far as count 4 is concerned, the drug and the monetary value of the transaction was the same as in count 2. I propose, however, that a slightly heavier sentence be imposed to take account of Mr Stanton’s increased offending: see R v Bavadra (2000) 115 A Crim R 152; [2000] NSWCCA 292 at [37]; Qing An v R [2007] NSWCCA 53. 
     
      
    39 Payne DCJ allowed 25 per cent to take account of the utilitarian value of the plea and that is replicated in the sentences I propose. Her Honour also found special circumstances. That should also be replicated in the sentence imposed in respect of count 1 and I have maintained, so far as practical, the ratio between the non-parole period and the additional term as her Honour applied. I have also taken the offences on the Form 1 into account when sentencing in respect of count 1.  
     
      
    40 Accordingly, I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal be granted; 
       
       
      2. Appeal allowed; 
       
       
      3. The sentences imposed by Payne DCJ be quashed and new sentences imposed as follows:

     BROWN, David Charles v R 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant was tried together with Spyro Sophiadakis on an indictment which pleaded that on 26 May 2004 at South Grafton the applicant and the co-accused shot at Jonathan Koen with intent to murder him. The count alleged a contravention of s 29 of the Crimes Act 1900 and attracted a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. Both the applicant and Sophiadakis were convicted. 
     
      
    2 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against his conviction on three grounds. None of the issues now raised were raised at the trial. The first two grounds relate to the lack of a warning by the trial judge in relation to identification evidence. The third ground alleges a miscarriage of justice on account of the Crown Prosecutor inviting the jury to consider the submission “why would the victim lie?” 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    3 Mr Koen, the applicant and Sophiadakis (also known as “Spyro” or “Spud”) had known each other for a number of years. They were members of the Outcast Motorcycle Club. At the time of the offence Mr Koen lived near Yamba. The applicant lived at Ulmarra between Yamba and Grafton. Sophiadakis was living at Mermaid Beach on the Gold Coast. 
     
      
    4 Each of the three men had held office in the Outcast Club at various times over the preceding decade. At the time of the shooting Sophiadakis was in the process of forming the Queensland Chapter of the Club. 
     
      
    5 About a month before the offence Mr Koen had confronted Sophiadakis in the Club’s premises at Sydney. The issue between them was a visit by Sophiadakis to Mr Koen’s home when his wife was there alone. The evidence indicated that they had “hard words” and Sophiadakis was asked to leave. The Crown suggested that this dispute was the source of Sophiadakis’ motive to commit the crime. No separate motive was alleged in relation to the applicant, it being submitted that he was a participant in the common purpose. 
     
      
    6 Mr Koen owned a prime mover and in the days prior to the shooting had been seeking work for it. To this end he had been contacting Sophiadakis who represented that he had work connections for Mr Koen which would require his truck to drive to Perth via Sydney. It was the Crown case that Sophiadakis had rung Mr Koen on the day of the shooting and told him that he had work for him which required the prime mover to drive to Sydney that day. An arrangement was made for Mr Koen to collect Sophiadakis from the applicant’s house later that day. There was evidence of a number of phone calls on the day of the incident between the three men. However, Mr Koen conceded that he may have spoken to the applicant but said that if he had done so their conversation was brief. 
     
      
    7 The time of the meeting became delayed and Mr Koen started drinking. By the time Sophiadakis ultimately contacted him he would not drive his truck on account of his intoxication. It was then arranged that Sophiadakis would meet Mr Koen at his house and Sophiadakis would drive at least some of the way. 
     
      
    8 Mr Koen did not recall the time at which Sophiadakis arrived at his house but it was at least half an hour after Mr Koen placed a call to the applicant, which was answered by the applicant’s de facto wife. He was looking for Sophiadakis. The telephone records establish that this call was made at about 7.50 pm that night. 
     
      
    9 The reason Mr Koen rang the applicant’s de facto looking for Sophiadakis was twofold. Mr Koen had been told by a friend, Russell Grogan, that Sophiadakis’ car had been parked outside the applicant’s house. They had earlier made an arrangement that Mr Koen was to collect Sophiadakis from the applicant’s premises. It was the defence case that Sophiadakis’ white panel van was outside the applicant’s house but this was said to be because the applicant had borrowed the car from Sophiadakis after the applicant had visited him in Queensland the day before the offence. 
     
      
    10 When Mr Koen rang the applicant’s de facto, Erica McPherson, she allegedly said they were not due at her place for another 40 minutes. 
     
      
    11 Sonia Koen, the victim’s wife, gave evidence that she overheard a telephone call between her husband and the applicant’s wife in which she heard Mr Koen say “Erica where’s Dave, have they left yet?” After concluding the telephone call she said that her husband said to her “Erica said they left over 40 minutes ago, I wonder what’s going on?” 
     
      
    12 The Crown case was that Sophiadakis arrived at the house at about 8.30 pm in a green Ford motor vehicle. The applicant was driving. However, the applicant denied that this occurred and said that he was at home at the time with his de facto wife. Mrs Koen gave evidence that she saw the applicant in the vehicle which was on her driveway when she opened the door at her house for Sophiadakis. She was the only witness who observed the applicant. Mr Koen did not see him at this time. 
     
      
    13 Mrs Koen had earlier given an account of the events to police. In that account she said that she saw the applicant in a Commodore motor vehicle. Mr Koen denied seeing any vehicle. His wife ultimately resiled from her original account although she maintained that she saw the applicant drop off Sophiadakis in a green Ford motor vehicle. 
     
      
    14 Mrs Koen was familiar with the applicant.  
     
      
    15 Mr Koen and Sophiadakis left and drove to a location on the Pacific Highway about 10 kilometres south of Grafton where it formed the intersection with the road to Woolli, otherwise known as the Woolli turnoff. The truck was stopped on the left hand side of the highway as it travelled south. Sophiadakis allegedly got out of the truck and said “I’m just going to see Davey for a minute.” 
     
      
    16 Sophiadakis had previously, but not until the journey began, told Mr Koen that the applicant was also travelling to Sydney in a separate vehicle. Mr Koen said that at least at one point during the journey he called the applicant’s number on a telephone which he handed to Sophiadakis. There was no independent evidence of any contact between Sophiadakis and the applicant during the journey. 
     
      
    17 Immediately after Sophiadakis left the truck Mr Koen moved to the driver’s seat and was filling in his logbook. He then heard a loud bang and felt a blow to his body. He said that he looked up and saw the applicant at the driver’s window with a gun in his hand. He said that the applicant was trying to do something to the gun at the time. Mr Koen then realised that he had been shot and set the truck in motion. Sophiadakis jumped onto the side of the truck. He was also armed with a pistol but as the truck moved off he disappeared. 
     
      
    18 Mr Koen managed to travel approximately 800 metres up the road before he lost consciousness and the vehicle ran off the road into the bush. Mr Koen was found some distance from the truck and was ultimately treated at the scene by ambulance officers. 
     
      
    19 The applicant was first discovered by Mr Weeks who asked him “who shot you?” Mr Koen replied “I can’t tell you.” Mr Weeks repeated his question but Mr Koen did not respond. Mr Weeks asked Mr Koen his name to which he replied “Jon”. Shortly afterwards the police and ambulance officers arrived. 
     
      
    20 Ambulance Officer Rogers gave evidence that she also asked Mr Koen who shot him and he said “Spyro”. After leaving the scene and on the way to the hospital Mr Koen nominated “David Brown” as the person who had shot him. 
     
      
       
      The defence case 
       
      
    21 The defence case was that the applicant was not at the scene of the incident and did not drop Sophiadakis at Mr Koen’s house. The primary defence case was that both Mr Koen and his wife were lying when they said that the applicant was involved. If not lying, it was said that they were mistaken. 
     
      
    22 Erica McPherson was called in the defence case. She gave evidence that the applicant was at home on the evening of the offence. She recalled speaking with Mr Koen that evening but denied saying that “they were on their way” or words to that effect. Her evidence was that the applicant was at home at this time and did not want to talk to Mr Koen so she told him that the applicant was attending to firewood at his parents’ place. She said that Mr Koen abused her so she handed the phone to the applicant.  
     
      
    23 Evidence was also called from Miss Karen Pardoe (who was declared unfavourable to the Crown) who said that she observed the applicant at his house in the bedroom when she dropped off Erica’s two children at about 9 pm on 26 May 2004. Ms McPherson confirmed this account. 
     
      
       
      The evidence of identification 
       
      
    24 Mr Koen said that the applicant had presented at the driver’s window of his truck after it had stopped. He said that he did not see the applicant until after he had been shot. It was submitted by the applicant that there were significant factors which suggested that this evidence may be unreliable. Mr Koen did not immediately nominate the applicant as the shooter. He was severely injured and likely to have been in shock. Furthermore, it was evening and the vehicle had stopped in darkness, albeit that Mr Koen said the light was on inside the vehicle. 
     
      
    25 Mrs Koen gave evidence that she had known the applicant for years. She said that when the applicant arrived at her house his car stopped no more than 30 feet away from her and it was facing the house. Although it was dark the vehicle was illuminated by a spotlight and a street light. She said that she saw the applicant in the driver’s seat. 
     
      
    26 Mrs Koen also gave evidence that she recognised the applicant’s voice when she answered Mr Koen’s mobile phone on the day of the shooting. However, she could not recall the time when the call took place and could not remember the contents of the conversation. As I have earlier recorded Mrs Koen had previously said that she had observed the applicant to arrive in a Holden Commodore. She said this was a mistake. She was challenged by defence counsel because in her witness statement she had asserted that Mr Koen would also have been in a position to have seen the applicant when he left the house with Sophiadakis.  
     
      
       
      Grounds 1 and 2 
       
       
      Ground 1 – the trial miscarried by reason of the trial judge failing to adequately direct the jury in relation to the dangers of the identification evidence of Sonia Koen as required by s 116 of the Evidence Act 1995. 
       
       
      Ground 2 – the trial miscarried by reason of the trial judge failing to adequately direct the jury in relation to the dangers of the identification evidence of Jonathan Koen as required by s 116 of the Evidence Act 1995. 
       
      
    27 The applicant submitted there were significant reasons why the identification evidence of Mr Koen and his wife was unreliable. I have already related the matters raised with respect to Mr Koen’s evidence. In respect of Mrs Koen’s evidence the applicant emphasised that she allegedly saw the applicant at night, at a distance, and whilst obscured by the car in circumstances where she could not recall other aspects of him. It was submitted that she said that she had recognised the applicant only after she had been made aware that he was a suspect. 
     
      
    28 No warning was given to the jury by the trial judge concerning the evidence of either Mr Koen or his wife. It was submitted on the appeal that this was an error and that s 116 of the Evidence Act 1995 required that a warning be given. 
     
      
    29 Section 116 of the Act is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “116 Directions to jury 
         
        (1) If identification evidence has been admitted, the judge is to inform the jury:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that there is a special need for caution before accepting identification evidence, and 
           
          (b) of the reasons for that need for caution, both generally and in the circumstances of the case. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in so informing the jury.” 
        
       
      
    30 It was accepted by the applicant that although both witnesses were familiar with the applicant, their evidence was not evidence of identification in the common law sense. It was nevertheless submitted that it was recognition evidence which required a warning: see Trudgett v R [2008] NSWCCA 62 at [28]; Gardiner v R [2006] NSWCCA 190; (2006) 162 A Crim R 233 at [68]-[69]. Counsel for the applicant submitted that in these circumstances a warning pursuant to s 116 of the Act was mandatory. It was submitted that the directions failed to comply with s 116 and failed to adequately identify for the jury the problems with this evidence: see Domican v The Queen [1992] HCA 13; (1992) 173 CLR 555; Dhanhoa v The Queen [2003] HCA 40; (2003) 217 CLR 1; R v Clarke (1997) 97 A Crim R 414; Zammit v R [1999] NSWCCA 65; (1999) 107 A Crim R 489 at [117]; R v Coe [2002] NSWCCA 385 at [67]. 
     
      
    31 In the written submissions, counsel for the applicant emphasised that in R v Demiroz [2003] NSWCCA 146 this Court stated that the caution required by s 116 is mandatory. It was accepted that the applicant made no request for a redirection at the trial but it was submitted that in any event leave to raise the issue on appeal should be granted. Again reliance was placed on the decision in Demiroz where trial counsel had not sought a redirection.  
     
      
    32 There is a significant difference between the present case and Demiroz which was not acknowledged in counsel’s submissions. In Demiroz Carruthers AJ was satisfied that in the absence of assistance from counsel the trial judge overlooked the requirements of s 116 (at [63]). This cannot be said in the present case.  
     
      
    33 The defence case at trial was conducted without any dispute that Mr Koen could have readily recognised the applicant. The defence was that Mr Koen had either deliberately implicated the applicant in revenge for the applicant failing to lend assistance to Mr Koen in relation to some illicit adventure, or “back him up.” The alternative submission to which little emphasis was given was that Mr Koen mistakenly recognised him. By implication the same position was adopted in relation to Mrs Koen’s evidence.  
     
      
    34 Because the primary basis of the defence was a deliberate false identification, significant tactical issues arose for counsel. A case of deliberate false identification did not require identification directions, although a defence of mistaken recognition would do. However, any warnings with respect to the unreliability of the recognition evidence may have significantly diminished the impact of the discrepancies which counsel said existed in the evidence of Mr and Mrs Koen and which were relied on as an indication that their evidence was fabricated. Identification directions directed to mistaken recognition would have inevitably brought to the attention of the jury alternative explanations, apart from deliberate lies, for Mr Koen falsely recognising of the applicant. 
     
      
    35 This was not a case where the requirement for directions was overlooked. After the evidence of Mr Koen was concluded the trial judge raised the question of identification directions. His Honour said that he would not give them unless they were sought and enquired of both defence counsel whether directions were requested. Counsel for the applicant indicated that he wished to wait until the close of the Crown address before providing a considered response to his Honour’s enquiry. However, at this stage of the trial he agreed with the trial judge that the defence did not appear to involve an identification case. Counsel for Sophiadakis adopted the same position. 
     
      
    36 At the conclusion of the Crown case in reply the trial judge asked counsel what directions they sought. No identification direction was requested. Furthermore, no identification directions were sought after the conclusion of the Crown address or at any later stage of the trial. It is against this background that the applicant makes his request for leave to rely on the present grounds of appeal.  
     
      
    37 In these circumstances I am satisfied that defence counsel and the trial judge gave deliberate consideration to the issue of identification directions and trial counsel for forensic purposes did not ask for an identification direction. This was a deliberate choice and a course open to counsel. It was against a background where the evidence made plain that both Mr and Mrs Koen knew the applicant well and were able to recognise him. 
     
      
    38 As I have related, Mrs Koen’s evidence was that she opened the front door of her residence and saw a green car in her driveway facing towards her. The car was no more than 30 feet away with the applicant in the driver’s seat. Both the car and the applicant were illuminated by the street light and a spotlight on the residence which illuminated the driveway. With respect to the evidence of Mr Koen, his assailant was in extremely close proximity to him when he was shot. The assailant was standing on a step on the truck immediately outside the driver’s door and clearly visible through the space where the driver’s window would have been. The driver’s window was down and did not obscure the line of sight. The light inside the cabin was on and was illuminating the assailant’s face. When he was shot Mr Koen looked up and later said that he saw the face of the applicant smiling back at him. He said that he watched the applicant who continued to point the gun at him. With Mr Koen pleading that he not shoot again, he said that the applicant attempted to fire a second shot. The gun jammed and Mr Koen continued to watch as his assailant attempted to clear the weapon. 
     
      
    39 In these circumstances I am satisfied that the failure to seek a direction or warning was a considered decision made for tactical reasons. The principles by which a grant of leave under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 have been discussed on many occasions. In Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; (1999) 196 CLR 297 McHugh J said at [72]: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no case for the grant of leave under r 4 unless the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the appellant has an arguable case that the trial judge has made an error of law or is satisfied that the appellant's conviction is otherwise a miscarriage of justice. Satisfying the Court that there is an arguable case is extremely difficult where the appellant has failed to object to evidence or failed to ask for a direction concerning evidence. In such cases, the trial judge has made no error of law because he or she has not been asked for a ruling. Consequently, an appeal can only succeed if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the admission of the evidence or the failure to give the direction has caused a miscarriage of justice, proof of which lies on the appellant. Where the evidence was admissible, but the trial judge had a discretion to limit its use, the burden on the appellant is greater: the appeal can succeed only if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the discretion would have been exercised in favour of the appellant and that, if it had, it is more likely than not that the appellant would have been acquitted. Any other view would mean that there was always a miscarriage of justice when the trial judge might have exercised a discretion in favour of the appellant.”

    41 In the present case not only was a direction not sought, his Honour’s decision that it was not required was not challenged. This position was likely to have been adopted for rational tactical reasons. In those circumstances, leave pursuant to Rule 4 should be refused. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 
       
      
    42 The applicant submitted that the trial miscarried because the prosecutor invited the jury to consider the submission “why would the victim lie?” 
     
      
    43 In his closing address to the jury the Crown said: 
     
      
       
        
        “But ask yourself this, there are two important questions, why in a situation when somebody is in peril of dying and really thinking at that point that they’re not going to survive, would you nominate the names of some person who was a friend of yours. Why would you nominate two people who are close friends of yours, knowing full well that if you did survive, the people that actually shot you would still be out on the loose in the community and may well come back and finish the job. Why would that person do that?” 
        
       
      
    44 It was submitted that this aspect of the address invited the jury to reason “… why would the victim lie?” and “why would the victim lie on his deathbed?” It was submitted that this invitation falls foul of the mischief identified in the High Court decisions of Palmer v The Queen [1998] HCA 2; (1998) 193 CLR 1 at [8]. In that case the majority joint judgment said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… to ask an accused the question: ‘Why would the complainant lie?’ is to invite the jury to accept the complainant’s evidence unless some positive answer to that question is given by the accused.” 
        
       
      
    45 In South v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 117 Hunt AJA (with whom Simpson and Whealy JJ agreed) said, in upholding a similar complaint at [42]-[44]: 
     
      
       
        
        “42 Where there is evidence that the complainant had a motive to lie, the jury's task is to consider that evidence and to determine whether, in the light of such of that evidence as they accept, they are nevertheless satisfied that the evidence given by the complainant of the commission of the offence charged is true. The jury's task necessarily does  
        not 
         include speculation as to whether there is some  
        other 
         reason why she would lie:  
        Regina v Uhrig 
         CCA 24 October 1996 [BC 9605087] at 15-16;  
        Palmer v The Queen 
         at [8]). Nor does the jury’s task include acceptance of the complainant's evidence unless some positive answer to that question is given by the accused:  
        Regina v F 
         (1995) 83 A Crim R 502 at 511-512;  
        Palmer v The Queen  
        at [8]). 
         
         
        43 Both the Crown prosecutor and the accused are entitled to put arguments to the jury relating to the  
        evidence 
         of a motive to lie which has been asserted in relation to a witness in the particular case, and a satisfactory summing-up should include reference to those arguments:  
        Regina v Uhrig 
         at 16-17; 
         Palmer v The Queen 
         at [10]–[11]. To invite the jury to go  
        beyond 
         both the evidence supporting the asserted motive on which the accused relies and the evidence denying it on which the Crown relies, and to ask ‘Why would the complainant lie?’ is to suggest to the jury that, in the absence of any  
        other 
         evidence beyond that on which the accused relies, they should accept the complainant’s evidence. 
         
         
        44 The jury should never be asked to go beyond the evidence on which both parties rely to establish or refute a motive to lie and to consider the question ‘Why would she lie?’ Such a question simply should never be asked.” 
        
       
      
    46 The applicant accepted that it would have been proper for the Crown to attack the evidence of an asserted motive to lie, if raised by the defence, but argued that the applicant did not nominate in his evidence a motive for the victim to lie nor did counsel for the applicant address on the issue. It was the applicant’s evidence that the victim had contacted him on the day of the offence to inform him that in effect something was “going down” that evening and that he wanted the applicant to “back him up”, a request the applicant refused. It was submitted that irrespective of this piece of evidence, and whether it may have been construed as a motive to lie, in effect the Crown asked the jury to go well beyond the issue as raised, and ask generally why would this complainant lie. This, it was said, was an impermissible line of enquiry. 
     
      
    47 The applicant requires leave to argue this ground pursuant to Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, there being no request for a direction on the issue. 
     
      
    48 Although the applicant accepted that it may be argued, there being no request for a redirection, that there was no wrong decision on any question of law it was submitted that a miscarriage of justice had occurred. It was submitted that the risk of miscarriage on account of the Crown address was heightened by the absence of an appropriate warning concerning the victim’s identification evidence which improperly bolstered the identification evidence and placed an “evidential cloud” over the defence case. The applicant submitted the onus was effectively reversed in the absence of the mandatory warning. In these circumstances it was submitted that it should be concluded that there had been a substantial miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    49 The respondent submitted that the Crown Prosecutor had not posed the “impermissible question” but instead had invited the jury to consider the weight to be afforded to the recognition of the applicant by Mr Koen, having regard to the improbability that Mr Koen would knowingly misidentify the applicant, with the consequence that the real shooter would be free to later attempt to kill him. It was submitted that the impugned passage of the Crown address was directed to evidence given by the applicant that he had refused to lend assistance to the victim in relation to some illicit adventure on the day of the shooting.  
     
      
    50 I am satisfied that there has been no miscarriage of justice. The essential difficulty with the “impermissible question” is that it potentially reverses the onus of proof either explicitly or by necessary implication. It invites the jury to accept the evidence of the prosecution witness merely because a motive for lying cannot be identified. I do not believe this has occurred in the present case. The Crown Prosecutor did not ask the jury to consider whether there was any identified motive for Mr Koen to lie. Rather he was suggesting that there was good reason why he did not lie. This is a submission of an entirely different character. It is true that he added the question “why would that person do that?” but that question was directed to the consideration that the effect of a lie was to expose Mr Koen to continuing danger. The question was not directed to a speculative motive for lying. 
     
      
    51 Counsel for the applicant did not raise this issue at the trial. Although I cannot discern any tactical consideration for this course, it is apparent that counsel did not perceive the error for which counsel on the appeal (who was not trial counsel) now contends. In my opinion that judgment was correctly made and I would refuse leave to raise ground 3. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    52 In my judgment leave to appeal should be refused and the appeal dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: Bilal Skaf and Mohammed Skaf are brothers. They were convicted following trial on an indictment containing three counts. 
     
      
    2 Count 1 was in the following terms; 
     
      
       
        
        Mohammed Skaf, [for that] whereas Bilal Skaf on 12 August 2000 at Greenacre in the State of New South Wales, in circumstances of aggravation, namely being in company with a number of other male persons, had sexual intercourse with MW without her consent, knowing she was not consenting thereto, [and] before that serious indictable offence was committed, namely, on 12 August 2000, at Greenacre in the State of New South Wales, did incite, move, procure, aid, counsel, hire and command Bilal Skaf to commit that serious indictable offence. 
        
       
      
    3 Counts 2 and 3 were in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 2: 
         
        Bilal Skaf, on 12 August 2000 at Greenacre in the State of New South Wales, in circumstances of aggravation, namely, being in company with a number of other male persons, had sexual intercourse with MW without her consent, knowing she was not consenting thereto [in the first degree]; and 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3: 
         
        Bilal Skaf, on 12 August 2000 at Greenacre in the State of New South Wales, in circumstances of aggravation, namely, being in company with a number of other male persons, did have sexual intercourse with MW without her consent and knowing she was not consenting thereto [in the second degree]. 
        
       
      
    4 This was their second trial for these offences.  
     
      
    5 Count 2 related to the first offence against Bilal Skaf outlined above in respect of which Mohammed was charged as an accessory before the fact. In relation to count 3, Bilal Skaf was convicted of the offence in the second degree, for aiding and abetting the commission of an act of sexual intercourse with the complainant by another, unknown, offender. 
     
      
    6 Both appellants appeal against their conviction. They submitted that the trial judge erred in refusing a permanent stay of proceedings. A second ground, in which it was submitted that the trial judge erred in refusing a temporary stay, was not ultimately pursued. Counsel for the appellant Bilal Skaf accepted during the hearing of the appeal that, based on their submissions in relation to the first ground of appeal, no period of delay in the trial could have adequately resolved the problem. It was submitted that the extent of publicity was such that the appellants would never receive a fair trial. In addition Bilal Skaf submitted that the trial judge erred “in directing the jury that they could use other evidence in the Crown case to bolster the identification evidence” (ground 3). During the appeal a further ground of appeal was filed, being “that there was a miscarriage of justice because the pre-trial publicity and publicity during the trial meant that the appellants did not receive a fair trial” (ground 4). Both appellants also seek leave to appeal their sentences. 
     
      
    7 With respect to grounds 1 and 2 the carriage of the appeal was undertaken by counsel for Bilal Skaf. Mohammed Skaf submitted that, because before he could be found guilty of being an accessory, it was necessary for the jury to determine whether Bilal Skaf was guilty of count 2 on the indictment, the prejudice relied on by Bilal Skaf to found his submission that the proceedings should have been stayed applied equally to himself as to Bilal Skaf. It was submitted that because of the publicity given to these matters, and, in particular, the publicity to the effect that Mohammed Skaf and Bilal Skaf were members of a gang which participated together in rapes, the jury could not bring an unprejudiced mind to the question of Mohammed Skaf’s guilt. 
     
      
       
      The essential chronology 
       
      
    8 The alleged offences the subject of this appeal were committed on 12 August 2000. On 20 December 2001 Bilal Skaf was convicted in respect of offences of sexual assault relating to Ms A and Ms B which took place on 10 August 2000 at Greenacre. Between 29 April 2002 and 7 June 2002 Bilal Skaf stood trial in respect of offences relating to Ms C at Bankstown on 30 August 2000. 
     
      
    9 On 11 July 2002 Bilal Skaf and Mohammed Skaf were convicted in respect of offences concerning the present complainant. Bilal Skaf was sentenced to a total term of 55 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 39 years. In respect of the offences the subject of the present appeal Bilal Skaf was sentenced to concurrent sentences of 20 years with a non-parole period of 9 years. 
     
      
    10 Subsquently, Finanne DCJ lifted suppression orders which allowed the media to identify Bilal Skaf and Mohammed Skaf by name. 
     
      
    11 Thereafter there was an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal which, inter alia, was concerned with irregularities which were said to have occurred at the trial for the offences the subject of the present appeal (R v Bilal Skaf, R v Mohammed [2004] NSWCCA 37; (2004) 60 NSWLR 86). The appeal was successful and the convictions of both appellants in relation to the sexual assault upon MW were quashed. Although the matters were listed for retrial on 3 February 2005, the Crown announced that there would be no further proceedings because the complainant had declined to give evidence. 
     
      
    12 In May 2005 the New South Wales Parliament enacted the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Evidence) Bill 2005 incorporating s 306A – s 306G to the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. This amendment allowed the evidence of a complainant in a sexual assault proceeding where a retrial had been ordered to be read to the jury as a record of the original evidence of the complainant. On 29 June 2005 the Director of Public Prosecutions determined that the trial should proceed utilising the amendments to the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 
     
      
    13 In September 2005 an application for special leave was refused in the High Court. That application related to the offence on 10 August 2000. In that same month the Court of Criminal Appeal granted Bilal Skaf leave to appeal against the sentences imposed for the offences on 10 and 30 August 2000 and upheld the appeal (R v Bilal Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 297).  
     
      
    14 In December 2005 there was a violent altercation at Cronulla, a beachside suburb of the Sydney metropolitan area. In March 2006 those events were discussed in a television program in which Bilal Skaf was mentioned by name. 
     
      
    15 On 27 March 2006 the retrial of the appellants commenced. Application was made by counsel for a pseudonym to be used for the appellants’ real names in an attempt to avoid the impact of the publicity which had preceded the trial and which would accompany it. This application was refused. 
     
      
    16 On 29 March 2006 a jury was empanelled and addressed by the trial judge. The judge gave a strongly worded warning that the jurors were not to take into account anything seen in the media or on the internet. Shortly thereafter a juror sent a note to the judge saying “How can I be reassured that there will not be later repercussions to my safety … like getting beaten up.” Her Honour concluded that this juror could not approach the task with an open mind and proceeded to discharge the entire jury. 
     
      
    17 On 10 April 2006 the application for a stay was renewed following the publication in the Sydney Morning Herald of an article written by Mr Paul Sheehan. The article was entitled “Rough, slow justice for rape victims” and referred to several gang rape trials between 2001 and 2006 and recounted some of the publicity which had attended the trials. That application was refused. 
     
      
       
      The facts in relation to the publicity 
       
      
    18 There is no doubt that the alleged offences and the appellants’ trials have attracted very considerable publicity. All of the publicity was unfavourable to the appellants. Five volumes of documentary material were tendered before the trial court. Apart from the sensational nature of the allegations and their reporting, considerable publicity was given to the fact that some of the jurors at the first trial had misconducted themselves by carrying out their own examination of the scene of the crime. Further publicity attended the quashing of those convictions and the consequences for the complainant who declined to give evidence at a further trial. Publicity was then associated with the legislative amendment which provided for a retrial without the necessity for the complainant to give evidence in person. 
     
      
    19 During the course of the publicity the name of Bilal Skaf and photographs of him appeared on commercial television stations and on the front page of Sydney newspapers. On one occasion a newspaper displayed a photograph of Bilal Skaf on the front page with the caption “Unmasked: Exclusive pictures of gang rape leader”. The editorial on the following pages read “[L]et those four names be etched in infamy” and referred to Bilal Skaf. Other articles depicted the appellants as “Australia’s most infamous gang rapists”, the “notorious Skaf brothers”, “the odious Bilal Skaf”, “two of the nation’s most notorious gang rapists” and the “EVIL brothers Bilal and Mohammed Skaf”. One article referred to “Sydney’s notorious Lebanese gang rape case” and another described the appellant Bilal Skaf and other offenders as “they hunted as a pack, forced teenage girls to perform gross sex acts and taunted their victims with vile insults and threats as they raped them …” In particular, Bilal Skaf was referred to on numerous occasions as a “convicted serial rapist”, and the “gang rape ringleader.” 
     
      
    20 The reporting of the various events was accompanied by a discussion of the process required to try allegations of sexual assault. The theme of the articles, particularly those written by Mr Sheehan, was that the justice system did not treat complainants fairly.  
     
      
    21 I have reviewed all of the publicity. It was extensive, prominent and continued for a significant period of time. I accept the appellants’ submissions that it came to be associated with a discussion of issues relating to the behaviour of Lebanese Muslim males towards Anglo-Australian females. 
     
      
    22 The discussion of these matters occurred primarily in newspapers but is to be found in books, in television and radio programs and in material published on the internet. 
     
      
       
      The trial judge’s decision 
       
      
    23 The trial judge considered the application for a permanent stay which was refused. She delivered her reasons after the jury’s verdict had been returned. Her Honour records the submission that it was because of the intense and sustained publicity that the appellants contended they had become so notorious that they would be unable to receive a fair trial. Her Honour described the evidence in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Hard copies of most of the media publicity was tendered in support of both applications. The material adduced by Bilal Skaf was extremely voluminous, extending to five large folders. Various forms of media coverage are reproduced in these volumes: newspaper articles, transcripts of television programs and talkback radio, extracts from books, and a very significant number of reports and postings obtained through internet searches.” 
        
       
      
    24 Her Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no doubt that the two accused, Bilal and Mohammed Skaf, have been the subject of a huge amount of publicity [through] various forms of media. They have regularly been described as pack rapists and worse. For example, the front page of the Daily Telegraph on February 4 2005 had a very large headline ‘No justice’ above the photographs of both Bilal and Mohammed Skaf with the following caption in large letters ‘Gang rapist brothers escape new trial after accuser says she is too traumatised to relive her ordeal again’.”  
        
       
      
    25 However, her Honour noted that apart from the Four Corners program, the last publication at least in the print media was in September 2005, approximately 6 months before the trial. In this respect her Honour was inaccurate. There were further publications on 18 October 2005 and 3 and 4 February 2006, which are outlined later in these reasons at [41]. Her Honour accepted that much of the published material could be retrieved from the internet by anyone who sought it out.  
     
      
    26 Her Honour reviewed the relevant authorities and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not see that the pre-trial publicity in the present case, prejudicial and extensive as it was puts this case into a different category from those other notorious cases. It must be remembered that the last significant publications relating to the accused were in September last year, more than six months before the trial was due to start. The Four Corners television program on 13 March this year certainly referred to Bilal Skaf as the ‘ringleader’ of a pack rape case about four years ago. However this was a very small portion of a program relating to the Cronulla riots in December of last year. In my view it does not take the applicants’ case any further.” 
        
       
       
      The relevant principles 
       
      
    27 The problem of publicity given to an alleged offence and the offender has been considered by the courts on many occasions. Sometimes the publicity has caused a court to defer a trial for a period. The assumption which the law makes is that the public’s memory of publicity will fade with time and accordingly after sufficient time, jurors will have no difficulty in confining their deliberations to the evidence. It is of course inevitable that there will be cases where, either because of the extent of the publicity, or, because of the peculiar or sensational nature of the facts, even if the public memory has subsided, when the evidence is tendered at a trial recollections of previous publicity will return. The internet has given a new dimension to these problems. Newspaper articles which provide an account of various events including allegations of criminal activity or a report of the evidence and verdict in criminal trials can now be retrieved, effectively forever. The law must accommodate these issues whilst ensuring a process which is fair both to the accused and the prosecution. 
     
      
    28 Apart from occasions when a trial is delayed to distance it from publicity, trial judges always tell jurors to confine their consideration to the evidence in the proceedings. If a trial has previously attracted or is likely to attract publicity, judges are careful to remind jurors that they are to ignore any publicity. The contemporary view is that it is not necessary for the jury to be sequestered with exposure to the media thereby eliminated. We accept that jurors will be faithful to the directions given by the trial judge and, if they happen upon a media discussion of the events, will be able to discriminate between the evidence and media reporting of the events. In Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414 McHugh J said at [31]-[32]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The criminal trial on indictment proceeds on the assumption that jurors are true to their oath, that, in the quaint words of the ancient oath, they hearken to the evidence and that they obey the trial judge's directions. On that assumption, which I regard as fundamental to the criminal jury trial, the common law countries have staked a great deal. If it was rejected or disregarded, no one -- accused, trial judge or member of the public -- could have any confidence in any verdict of a criminal jury or in the criminal justice system whenever it involves a jury trial. If it was rejected or disregarded, the pursuit of justice through the jury system would be as much a charade as the show trial of any totalitarian state. Put bluntly, unless we act on the assumption that criminal juries act on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge, there is no point in having criminal jury trials. It is of course true that, if a jury persists in returning a verdict that is contrary to law, the trial judge must accept it. But that only means in Lord Mansfield's words that, although ""[i]t is the duty of the Judge ... to tell the jury how to do right ... they have it in their power to do wrong.’ 
        
       
       
        
        In my respectful opinion, the fundamental assumption of the criminal jury trial requires us to proceed on the basis that the jury acted in this case on the evidence and in accordance with the trial judge's directions and that they would have done so even if manslaughter had been left as an issue, as it should have been left. In Spratt, Pidgeon J said, correctly in my opinion, ""that an appellate court must proceed on the basis that the jury have understood and applied the law in reaching a true verdict"" (Footnotes omitted). 
        
       
      
    29 The obligation which the law accepts is that an accused person’s trial must be fair. A balance must be struck between the interests of the accused and the community expectation that persons charged with criminal offences will be brought to trial. In Jago v District Court of New South Wales (1989) 168 CLR 23, Mason CJ stated at 33-34: 
     
      
       
        
        “The test of fairness which must be applied involves a balancing process, for the interests of the accused cannot be considered in isolation without regard to the community's right to expect that persons charged with criminal offences are brought to trial: see Barton, at 102, 106;  
        Sang 
         at 437;  
        Carver v Attorney-General (NSW) 
         (1987) 29 A Crim R 24, at 31, 32. At the same time, it should not be overlooked that the community expects trials to be fair and to take place within a reasonable time after a person has been charged. The factors which need to be taken into account in deciding whether a permanent stay is needed in order to vindicate the accused's right to be protected against unfairness in the course of criminal proceedings cannot be precisely defined in a way which will cover every case. But they will generally include such matters as the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the accused's responsibility for asserting his rights and, of course, the prejudice suffered by the accused:  
        Barker v Wingo  
        (1972) 407 US 514;  
        Bell v Director of Public Prosecutions  
        [1985] AC 937, as explained, as explained in  
        Watson 
        , and  
        Gorman v Fitzpatrick  
        (1987) 32 A Crim R 330. In any event, a permanent stay should be ordered only in an extreme case and the making of such an order on the basis of delay alone will accordingly be very rare:  
        Re Cooney  
        (1987) 31 A Crim R 256, at 263-264.” 
        
       
      
    30 The relevant issues but in the context of pre-trial publicity of previous convictions were considered by the High Court in The Queen v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; (1992) 173 CLR 592. In that case a majority of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Victoria held that, by reason of publicity given to the accused by a radio broadcaster before trial, he could not receive a fair trial. The Crown appealed. The High Court divided with three judges deciding that special leave should be refused. However, the majority granted special leave and upheld the Crown appeal. The test provided by Mason CJ and Toohey J in their joint judgment was expressed in the following terms at page 604-5: 
     
      
       
        
        “Knowledge of an admissible prior conviction for a similar offence stands in a different position from other prejudicial information. Reception of inadmissible evidence of a prior conviction has been said to offend against one of the most deeply rooted and jealously guarded principles of our criminal law. And the wrongful reception or transmission of such evidence by or to the jury is calculated to set the prospect of a fair trial at risk. It is then for the trial judge to decide whether it is necessary to discharge the jury in the interests of securing a fair trial and, if the trial proceeds and results in a conviction, for a court of criminal appeal to decide whether the accused has been deprived of a fair trial. But it is important to distinguish between cases in which the jury are made aware of a prior conviction during the course of a trial and cases in which such awareness is not established. As McGarvie J acknowledged, ""[t]here is not an absolute insistence by the law that a jury have no knowledge of a prior conviction of an accused on trial"". His Honour went on to conclude that this case was exceptional because the prior conviction was for an offence of the same nature as the offences charged. However, this conclusion is not to the point in the absence of a legitimate finding that there was a likelihood of awareness of the conviction or at least a substantial risk of awareness.  
        
       
       
        
        In our view, the approach adopted by the majority in the Court of Criminal Appeal, in finding that there was a substantial risk that the jury were aware of the applicant's prior conviction and that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory on that score, disregarded the principled decision of Crockett J. The majority's reasoning was also based on materials which could not support the inferences drawn, took little, if any, account of the effect of the trial judge's instructions and disregarded the community's right to expect that a person accused of a serious criminal offence will be brought to trial. The last-mentioned consideration requires that a conviction be quashed as unsafe and unsatisfactory only where the materials justify a conclusion that there was a likelihood or substantial risk of prejudice arising from pre-trial publication where the conviction is challenged on that ground.” 
        
       
      
    31 Brennan J (Dawson J agreeing) in Glennon emphasised that even when jurors have knowledge of the accused and his or her alleged crime before trial there may not be a miscarriage of justice. Some degree of prior knowledge is tolerated provided the trial is “as fair as the Court could make it” (at page 614-616). 
     
      
    32 In the dissenting joint judgment, Deane, Gaudron and McHugh JJ stated at 623-624: 
     
      
       
        
        “The balancing of the legitimate interests of the accused and the prosecution will, in almost every case, mean that if the proceedings are to be stayed at all, they should only be stayed temporarily and for the minimum period necessary. Nonetheless, one cannot exclude, as a matter of law, the possibility that an ‘extreme’ or ‘singular’ case might arise in which the effect of a sustained media campaign of vilification and prejudgment is such that, notwithstanding lapse of time and careful and thorough directions of a trial judge, any conviction would be unsafe and unsatisfactory by reason of a significant and unacceptable likelihood that it would be vitiated by impermissible prejudice and prejudgment. In such a case, a permanent stay may be granted. If it is not, a subsequent conviction will necessarily constitute a miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, it must be set aside on appeal, and, if there is no other power to bring the proceedings to finality, a verdict of acquittal must be entered. The judgments of the majority of the Court of Criminal Appeal make clear that their Honours concluded, as a matter of fact, that this was such an extraordinary, extreme or singular case with the consequences indicated.” 
        
       
      
    33 It is apparent that when considering an application for a permanent stay a number of considerations justifying or militating against a stay must be examined. An accused person has a right to a fair trial for which an impartial jury is essential. The court must consider whether in all the circumstances, including the directions which can be given by a trial judge, a jury will bring an impartial mind to the issues to be decided. A fundamental assumption of our criminal justice system is that the jury will understand and abide the directions of the trial judge. Whether directions of law or a direction that the jury exclude matters from their consideration are given, unless it can be concluded that the directions could not be effective, this assumption will be maintained. Spigelman CJ expressed these principles in R v Dudko [2002] NSWCCA 336; (2002) 132 A Crim R 371 where his Honour said at [19] and [21]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Issues of this character have arisen on many occasions in which extensive publicity had been given to particular cases involving clear implications of guilt.  
        Glennon  
        involved a Roman Catholic priest who was convicted of sexual offences against a girl.  
        Murphy 
         involved the Anita Cobby murderers. Other cases include the case of Ivan Milat 
          
        (see  
        R v Milat,  
        NSWCCA, 26 February 1998, (unreported)), the “Mr Bubbles” child sexual abuse case (see  
        R v VPH 
        , NSWCCA, 4 March 1994 (unreported)), the paedophile Phillip Bell (see  
        R v Bell 
        , NSWCCA, 8 October 1998 (unreported)), the child sexual assaults committed by a former member of the Queensland parliament (see  
        R v D’Arcy  
        [2001] QCA 325) and the Childers backpacker fire (see  
        Long v R  
        [2002] QSC 54). None of these cases satisfied the test of exceptionality, despite the intensity of the media publicity involved. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        The authorities to which I have referred establish that even in circumstances of a crime of a high level of notoriety, where it would probably not be possible to select a jury panel who had not heard about the case and indeed who may have a tentative opinion, the trial must still proceed. Jurors who may have formed an opinion are not necessarily biased in the relevant sense. There is now a substantial body of judicial statements of the opinion that jurors accept their responsibility to perform their duties by differentiating between the evidence and what they may have heard before the trial.” 
        
       
      
    34 Although many applications for permanent stay have been made we are aware of only one that has ultimately been successful. In Tuckiar v The King (1934) 52 CLR 335 the accused successfully appealed against his conviction because of the trial judge’s inappropriate comments on the failure of the accused to give evidence. The court did not order a retrial because defence counsel had made public statements following conviction to the effect that the accused had admitted to him the correctness of the confession evidence. Except in this limited manner the case was not concerned with pre-trial publicity.  
     
      
    35 The most recent consideration of the relevant principles occurred in R v Ferguson; Ex parte A-G (Qld) [2008] QCA 227. In that case the accused had been granted a permanent stay by a trial judge by reason of pre-trial publicity which his Honour concluded had the consequence that he could never receive a fair trial. His Honour concluded that: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the circumstances of [the] case, [it was] impossible to conceive that a jury could be empanelled, all of whose members would be able to bring the dispassionate judgment which the law requires to a consideration of the evidence” (para 11). 
        
       
      
    36 When setting aside this decision, the Court of Appeal summarised the relevant principles including the discussion in Glennon (at [23]-[55]). I need not repeat them. Their Honours contemplated that it was conceivable that media comment adverse to an accused could be so prejudicial as to lead a trial judge to conclude that proceedings should be permanently stayed. 
     
      
    37 However, their Honours concluded that: 
     
      
       
        
        “An order for a permanent stay of proceedings is nothing less than an acknowledgment that the judicial system cannot deal with the charge. It can be justified only on the basis of a conclusion that a fair trial will not be possible within any reasonable time frame or in any venue within the court’s jurisdiction” (para 58). 
        
       
       
      Consideration of the issues 
       
      
    38 The appellants argued that the level and nature of the publicity in the present matters was such that this matter fell into “the exceptional class” referred to in Jago v District Court of NSW (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 31. The submission was advanced for the following reasons: 
     
      
       
      1. The amount of publicity surrounding the first trial, in conjunction with the other trials, and the ensuing publicity surrounding the sentences; 
       
      2. The vast range of print (both newspaper and other literature), radio (reportage, commentary and talk-back), and television coverage disseminated prior to trial referring to the appellant, Bilal Skaf, as a “pack rapist” and to both appellants as “convicted rapists” and the appellant, Bilal Skaf as the “ring leader”; 
       
      3. The spread and availability of the coverage across all spectrums of society and the community; 
       
      4. The greater access to such material given an ever increasing availability of internet access; 
       
      5. The timing of the trial in combination with media focus on accused persons of Muslim backgrounds, as well as Lebanese Muslim males and rape trials; 
       
      6. The timing of the trial in combination with a focus on radical elements of the Muslim community following the September 11, 2001 attacks; 
       
      7. The media attention given to the length of the appellants’ sentences following the original trial; 
       
      8. The media attention given to the activities of the errant jurors necessitating a new trial; 
       
      9. The increased publicity that surrounded this trial in particular given the introduction of new legislation, namely s 306B of the  
      Criminal Procedure Act  
      1986 following a strong media response when the complainant in this trial refused to give evidence on a retrial; 
       
      10. The timing of the trial following shortly after the Cronulla riots re-agitating a wave of negative commentary about Muslims in general and the appellant in particular; 
       
      11. The timing of the trial in conjunction with a television program aired on Four Corners shortly before the trial; and 
       
      12. The release of the names of both brothers (despite the juvenile status of Mohammed Skaf) following the first trial. 
       
      
    39 The appellants emphasised that the principal issue at their trial was identification and the nature of the publicity concerning their reputations and character was especially damaging. It was submitted that the directions and warnings given by the trial judge were not capable of curing the prejudice occasioned by the nature and extent of the publicity. 
     
      
    40 There is no doubt that some of the media reporting was excessive. In her reasons for rejecting the application the trial judge referred to a number of these. The article in the Daily Telegraph on 11 October 2002 featured a photograph of Mohammed Skaf with the words “wild animal” and another on 4 February 2005 featured a photograph of both appellants with the caption “gang rapist brothers escape new trial after accuser says she is too traumatised to relive her ordeal again.” However, these articles were published well before the trial and with limited exceptions there was little media reference to the Skaf brothers in the six months prior to the trial. As we have indicated, courts act upon the assumption that publicity, even intense publicity, fades in the public memory over a relatively short period. Although we accept that in many people’s minds some generalised recollection of the publicity would have continued at the time of the trial, we do not believe it was such to divert a juror from a proper consideration of the evidence.  
     
      
    41 The exception to which we referred included two articles which appeared in the Daily Telegraph on the same day – 6 August 2005. The first, a short article on page 22 referred to the appellant only by initials as “MS”. The other on page 3 referred accurately to the “alleged gang rapist bilal Skaf” and his “accomplice who can only be known as MS” and that there was to be a retrial “for that alleged rape.” An article was also published in the Queensland Courier Mail on that day. A month later, there were articles on 10, 16, 17/18 September 2005 in the Courier Mail, the Daily Telegraph, the Cairns Post, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the Australian and the Sydney Morning Herald relating to Bilal Skaf, his having been convicted of a series of gang rapes and a decision of this Court at the time having reduced his overall sentence. Two of those articles referred to Mohammed Skaf (SMH Weekend Edition 17/18 September and the Australian, 17 September 2005). On 19 September 2005 the Daily Telegraph published an article relating to Bilal Skaf’s sentence reduction and asked readers the following question, “The Court of Criminal Appeal has slashed the jail sentence of rapist Bilal Skaf. Does this make a joke of the law?” Readers could vote by telephoning the numbers provided. Two articles appear in the Canterbury Bankstown Express on 18 October 2005 and 20 September 2005 related to Bilal Skaf’s sentence reduction and his appeal to the High Court. A similar report was published by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on 18 October 2005. A month before the trial, six articles were published by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the Daily Telegraph, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Australian on 3 and 4 February 2006. These articles related to the High Court’s refusal to grant special leave to the Crown to appeal against the reduction in sentence for the “notorious gang rapist, Bilal Skaf.” Prior to these newspaper articles one had to go back to March 2005 to find reporting in the print media. 
     
      
    42 There was a suppression order made pursuant to s 11 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 prohibiting from publication the name of Mohammed Skaf or anything which may identify him in force from 5 August 2005. The order remained in force from that time until the date of sentence on 28 July 2006. There was also a previous suppression order during the first trial before Finnane DCJ between 1 July 2002 and 11 July 2002 for both appellants; in respect of Mohammed Skaf, the suppression order was lifted after he was sentenced on 10 October 2002; in respect of Bilal Skaf the suppression order was lifted on 6 September 2002, after he had been sentenced on 15 August 2002. 
     
      
    43 There was a radio news item on 3 February 2006 reporting Bilal Skaf's failed appeal to the High Court, however, any radio news item prior to that was on 4 November 2005. 
     
      
    44 The compilation DVD of the television coverage of relevant events is undated. However, the year in which each segment was televised can be worked out. Over half the segments were televised in 2002. Until Finnane DCJ lifted the suppression order in September 2002 no one was named except Belal Hajeid and Mahmoud Chami. Reference is then made to Bilal Skaf, his having been sentenced to 55 years and being the leader of a group who terrorised women in August 2000. Four segments in 2002 also refer to Mohammed Skaf. There are a few segments referring to Bilal. Skaf and a threatening letter sent to the Corrective Services Commissioner as well as a caller threatening to shoot court staff if Bilal Skaf, serving 55 years was not released. There are two segments in 2003 which refer to Bilal Skaf and MG (by his full name) wanting to overturn their convictions and two segments in 2004 referring to the fact that a new trial had been ordered. There are two segments recorded in 2004 and there appears to be no segment beyond that year. 
     
      
    45 This Court ordered a retrial of this matter in R v Bilal Skaf; R v Mohammed Skaf [2004] NSWCCA 37; (2004) 60 NSWLR 86. A similar ground of appeal ie that the appellants did not receive a fair trial due to media publicity failed.  
     
      
    46 As indicated above the internet is an ongoing problem for the criminal justice system. The law has developed some strategies intended to deal with the situation. Model directions have been formulated following the decisions in R v K [2003] NSWCCA 406; (2003) 59 NSWLR 431 and R v Skaf [2004] NSWCCA 37; (2004) 60 NSWLR 86 and s 68C Jury Act 1977 came into operation on 15 December 2004 prior to this trial. In her opening remarks to the jury the judge gave these directions. In his submissions to the trial judge on the stay application, counsel for Mohammed Skaf conceded ""The concern is not publicity or what is is (sic) available on the Internet today because your Honour will give directions in relation to that. It is the publicity which is already out there and whether a direction at the start of the trial can remove that from the psyche of the jury as of today.” 
     
      
    47 While there were spikes in media intensity refuelled by events such as Bilal Skaf receiving a sentence of 55 years in August 2002, errant jurors necessitating a new trial ordered in May 2004 and provisions introduced into the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 in May 2005, jurors would have been astute to have discerned, let alone remembered, that either appellant had been tried for more than one incident. The present offence occurred in August 2000. It was inevitable that the jury would hear, and did hear, that there had been a previous trial. As earlier mentioned the evidence in the previous trial of the complainant and in addition, Ali Skaf, who was unable to attend due to illness, was read to the jury. Appropriate directions were given during the trial to the jury.  
     
      
    48 When the jury were empanelled on Monday 3 April 2006 the judge took special precautionary steps. The jury was selected from a panel of 31 jurors. The number of challenges allowed to each appellant was increased by agreement from three to five. After each appellant was arraigned before the jury panel - the wording of the indictment detailing to the jury the names of the accused, the nature of the offences and where and when they were allegedly committed - and a list of witnesses to be called for the prosecution read out to them, the panel was addressed by the judge who then adjourned the matter for about half an hour. In her address, the judge told the jury in no uncertain terms that it was “absolutely essential"" those jurors who eventually tried the matter should be ""utterly impartial"". After informing them of considerable pre-trial media publicity, she emphasised several times that if they had ""the slightest doubt at all as to [their] capacity to give entirely open and impartial consideration to this case"", they should tell the sheriff's officer and they would be automatically removed from the panel with no questions being asked. Her Honour’s complete address was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Members of the jury panel, the reason for giving you this information is simply this, to alert all of you before the empanelling process commences to the nature of the case and the identity of the principal participants. It is absolutely essential that the jurors who are empanelled to hear this case are utterly impartial. That means that they must not be personally acquainted with anyone involved in the trial, hence giving you the list of the prospective witnesses. It also means, and this is particularly important in the circumstances of this trial, that the jurors who eventually try this matter should have no preconceived notions whatsoever about the matter, whether arising from the nature of the charges themselves or from the identity of the two accused. 
        
       
       
        
        This trial has had something of a lengthy history, and it has attracted quite considerable media publicity over the last few years. Now it is likely that many of you will have seen this, or at least some of it. It is also likely that a number of you who have seen this publicity might find it very difficult to put it out of your minds and be completely impartial in your assessment of this case. There might be others of you who will find it distressing to hear evidence relating to multiple sexual assaults. If you think you fall into either of these categories, indeed if you have the slightest doubt at all as to your capacity to give entirely open and impartial consideration to this case, given the people involved, the nature of the charges, and any publicity that you might have seen over the years, then you will have the opportunity very shortly to be excused from the panel that will be hearing this trial. 
        
       
       
        
        I urge you, that if you have any reservations at all as to your capacity to put media publicity behind you, and to deal with the case on its own merits, then please seek to be excused from dealing with this trial. It is absolutely essential that we have an impartial jury for this trial who can deal with the evidence in an entirely objective manner. 
        
       
       
        
        If you do seek to be excused you will not be seen as evading your responsibility as potential jurors. To the contrary you will be seen to be responsible and honest members of the community who take seriously your obligation of jury impartiality. 
        
       
       
        
        Now in a minute I am going to adjourn the Court, and for about half an hour or so. You will be provided, I am told, with a cup of tea, and this will give you an opportunity to think about it. Remembering that it is essential that the panel which remains from which the jury will be selected for this trial be impartial and objective to the issues and the people involved in the case. If you have the slightest doubt about your own capacity to be impartial and objective, then all you would have to do is tell the Sheriff’s Officer at some stage during the course of that adjournment before we come back into court and you will automatically be removed from the panel to deal with this case. No questions at all will be asked of you. Please, however, if you think you might have difficulty with being impartial, do not share your views with other members of the panel. This can only make matters significantly worse. I urge of you, do not mention any difficulties that you have to any other panel members.” 
        
       
      
    49 Following the empanelment of the jury, her Honour gave a further direction in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The evidence, as I have already told you, consists of the oral evidence of the various witnesses, the documentary exhibits. In other words the material that is put before you here in this courtroom. And it is absolutely essential that your deliberations be based only – only on that material. 
        
       
       
        
        Now as we went through before the actual impanelment of you, the jury, the fact that there has been considerable amount of media publicity relating to these accused and the history of this trial, it is very likely that a number of you have seen it. But as I said to you earlier, you are here to be impartial and objective. To the extent that you have read anything whatsoever outside this Court, it is absolutely essential that you put it out of your minds completely when you are looking at the issues raised during the course of this trial, and that you determine the issues in this trial on the material put before you in this Court, and only on that material. 
        
       
       
        
        There are very good reasons of fairness for this. In a trial setting the evidence that it put forward by one party or the other is available for scrutiny, contradiction, and explanation by the other party. Fairness dictates that this be so. But if you were to somehow base your determination on material that was not part of the evidence in this trial, then you would be depriving the opposing party of explaining, contradicting, giving another version of whatever you had in your head. You would be doing a serious injustice to one party or the other, and you would be untrue to your oath which was to try this case according to the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        Now for these reasons it is absolutely essential that none of you take any steps whatsoever, or ask anyone else to take any steps whatsoever to make inquiries about this case outside the courtroom, either by the Internet, by any other electronic means, or indeed by any means whatsoever. You must not consider making any private visit to any scene, or making any outside court attempt to investigate the background of this matter.” 
        
       
      
    50 During her summing up the trial judge gave the following further direction on issues relating to publicity: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now I emphasised to you right at the beginning of this trial even before you were empanelled, the necessity to put completely to one side anything that you might have read or heard about this trial or about these accused outside this courtroom. Even during the course of the trial there has been a bit of publicity, over the last week or so, about sexual assaults generally, and how victims are treated within the justice system, victims of sexual assault. I do not know whether any of you have seen this, but if you have, yet again, you must put it completely out of your minds. You must determine this case solely on the evidence that is given in this courtroom, plus of course the evidence of the view that we all went upon last Wednesday evening.” 
        
       
      
    51 The appellants asserted that these warnings were incapable of curing the prejudice created by previous media publicity. The appellants emphasised that notwithstanding the trial judge’s warnings on 29 March 2006 one juror who had been empanelled sent a note to the trial judge expressing concern for his or her safety. That jury was then discharged. 
     
      
    52 The appellants submitted that it should be inferred that this juror, and accordingly, that jury, had not effectively responded to the trial judge’s warning and only after empanelment expressed the view that he or she could not be an effective juror. 
     
      
    53 We do not accept that argument. It must be remembered that the juror did not disclose his or her concerns until after the Crown Prosecutor’s opening address in which the nature of the crimes and the violent circumstances in which they were committed, including the use of a weapon, had been discussed by the Crown Prosecutor. The Crown Prosecutor’s address would have made it apparent to the jury that the violent aspects of the case were not disputed. In those circumstances it was understandable that a juror may have come to have concerns about his or her future safety. 
     
      
    54 On the first occasion the judge instructed the jury that if they had any doubt as to their capacity to give an impartial consideration to the case, ""now is your opportunity to say so. All you need to do is simply put up your hands."" However, on the second occasion, her Honour did not require an immediate response by a public show of the hand but instructed the panel to tell the sheriff's officer during the half hour adjournment which then occurred. The impact of this change of procedure in encouraging any concerned juror to come forward cannot be underestimated. 
     
      
    55 The initial experience of a jury of the courtroom is likely to be stressful, inhibiting a person from expressing their concerns about becoming a member of the jury. With time for reflection, if the juror has concerns, they are more likely to express them once they have become reasonably familiar with their surroundings.  
     
      
    56 The written submissions on behalf of Bilal Skaf refer to passages in R v Chami; R v Sheikh [2002] NSWCCA 136; (2002) 128 A Crim R 428 at [19] - [20]; 431 (Ipp AJA) which conclude with the remarks at [20] that despite directions ""it may be difficult for a jury, with the best will in the world, to remain entirely objective."" It was submitted that these remarks are apposite to the present case. In our judgment reliance on Ipp AJA’s remarks is misplaced. His Honour was considering an application for a separate trial by one accused who was allegedly involved in only one of a series of events where the same complainant had been sexually assaulted. His Honour was not writing with respect to publicity associated with the events of concern to the trial. 
     
      
    57 The appellants complain that the judge should have required pseudonyms to be used for the names of both appellants. However, although the idea was floated no application was actually made. Senior counsel for Bilal Skaf conceded that the situation could become worse if the jury realised this device was being used to conceal the identity of the appellant. 
     
      
    58 We are satisfied that her Honour, with respect, correctly assessed the Four Corners television program on 13 March 2006. Only a very careful combing of this transcript turns up a fleeting reference to Bilal Skaf. The interviewer also refers to a ""wrong and confused"" view about this pack-rape case (itself a confusing comment). In submissions to the trial judge, senior counsel for Bilal Skaf conceded that this television program was ""on its own it's relatively minor"". 
     
      
    59 We have reviewed the seven folders of material and relevant cases provided by counsel in depth. Notwithstanding the extensive media coverage of the “Sydney Gang Rape Cases”, and in particular the focus on the appellant Bilal Skaf, we are of the opinion that the jury having been properly instructed on the issue, the pre-trial publicity was not such as to distract the jury from its proper function. As counsel for the appellant Bilal Skaf conceded, the “high point” of the media coverage was in September 2002, some three and a half years before the commencement of this trial. We are satisfied that the material would have faded in the memories of the jury over the intervening period and would no longer have had the prominence it might have had at the time it was published. The directions given by the trial judge were extensive and repeated to the jury throughout the trial. For these reasons we consider that this case does not fall into the category of the “most exceptional circumstances” referred to in Jago and other decisions of the High Court.  
     
      
    60 We reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 
       
      
    61 During the hearing of the appeal, counsel added a further ground of appeal, being that “there was a miscarriage of justice because the pre-trial publicity and publicity during the trial meant that the appellant did not receive a fair trial.” It became ground 4 in the appeal. The ground related to the article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 10 April 2006 by Mr Paul Sheehan. 
     
      
    62 The article focused on the rape of Tegan Wagner by two Pakistani brothers and the asserted failure of the legal system, reference being made to other examples of rape victims being let down by the legal system. Other than one example referring to the ""K brothers"", none of the examples named either the accused or any other victims. The example which related to the appellants was referred to as a case in 2004 and stated: ""... The victim was too traumatised to endure another trial. So the two men escaped punishment... "". As the judge observed it was unlikely the jury would link that case, which did not proceed, to this trial which was proceeding. 
     
      
    63 Trial counsel referred to a “chain of other articles in the past [week] arising out of the case that [was] at the forefront of [that] article.” Her Honour responded that although the article dealt with the issue of rape victims and court proceedings, they did not relate to the present case. Her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “We have to assume that this jury is able to put media matters out of its mind. As you have put before me, there has been much worse media coverage relating to these two accused, that clearly relates to them than anything that has come out in the last week … 
        
       
       
        
        … this jury, after the strongest possible admonitions, said that they were confident of their ability to put much more adverse media publicity behind them. So I think we have to assume that they are going to be able to do the same with this.” 
        
       
      
    64 Her Honour declined the application. In her reasons for refusing the permanent stay application on 27 March 2006, delivered on 28 July 2006, her Honour noted that “although there were two separate applications which were separately argued before me, the issues are identical in each case and these reasons therefore relate to both of them.” 
     
      
    65 We have considered the pre-trial publicity and publicity throughout the trial. The publicity during the trial did not specifically refer to the appellants and we are satisfied that her Honour’s warnings to the jury were adequate to deal with both the pre-trial publicity and publicity during the trial. We reject ground 4 of the appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 
       
      
    66 In order to appreciate this ground of appeal it is necessary to understand the factual elements of the Crown case. They may be conveniently taken from the Crown’s summary: 
     
      
       
        
        “The appellant Mohammed Skaf had known the complainant for some time, although he had never told her his correct name: she knew him as ‘Sam’. On the night of 12 August 2000 he rang her and asked if she would like to come for a drive to the city. She accepted. He arrived at her house unexpectedly with two other males. They drove to a carpark at Gosling Park, Greenacre, after Mohammed Skaf told her he had to stop off to collect some money owed to him. Throughout the trip Mohammed Skaf and the others were frequently talking on their mobile phones in a foreign language. Count 1 related to Mohammed Skaf’s role in enticing the complainant to the park and leaving her there intending that his brother Bilal would have non-consenting intercourse with her in the company of others. 
        
       
       
        
        Sometime after their arrival at the park a white van and a blue car arrived, carrying eleven males. The driver of the white van, Bilal Skaf, dragged [the complainant] by the hair to another part of the park near a pump shed where he had vaginal intercourse with her (Count 2) while surrounded by the other males. The complainant described him [as] having a scar above his left eyebrow. A second male then also had vaginal intercourse with her (Count 3) assisted by others who pinned her down. This took place in the presence of Bilal Skaf, who was doing up his pants nearby. 
        
       
       
        
        When the second male got off [the complainant], he pushed her causing her to hit her head on a cement cylinder. Another male then held a gun to her head and threatened her not to tell anyone what had happened otherwise she would be killed. She was then kicked in the stomach. She stood up, ran for her life and [was able to alert a passer-by who came to her assistance]. 
        
       
       
        
        There is a light near the cement cylinders where this took place.  
        
       
       
        
        In November 2000 the complainant identified both appellants from photo boards, although in Bilal Skaf’s case she was not 100% positive. Bilal Skaf declined to participate in an identification parade. 
        
       
       
        
        On 15 February 2001 the complainant identified Bilal Skaf in a crowd at Burwood Local Court as Sam’s brother. Arrangements [had been] made by the police for the complainant to go there on an occasion when Bilal Skaf would be there. She immediately identified him without doubt as her assailant. 
        
       
       
        
        On 3 April 2001 Bilal Skaf requested an interview with [the] police. The police had by then obtained records of mobile telephones used on the evening of the offence, which showed a number of calls between the mobile phones belonging to Bilal and Mohammed Skaf within the period leading up to the sexual assaults. He told police in an ERISP that he was at home on the night of the offence and remained there. To explain at least some of these phone calls he claimed his cousin Ali Skaf had used [his phone] to talk to Mohammed. He claimed his cousin Ali Skaf and a friend named Andre came to his house that night in Ali’s white van. He said Ali did not have a phone and he received a phone call from his brother Mohammed wanting to speak to Ali. He claimed the next day Ali told him that after leaving Bilal’s house, he had gone to Gosling Park in his van and had sex there with a girl in the company of friends. He relied on this alibi at trial. 
        
       
       
        
        Detective Walsh gave evidence that Ali Skaf was 180 cm tall, quite different from [the height] of Bilal Skaf, and did not have a scar above his left eyebrow. Due to Ali Skaf’s unavailability to attend trial due to illness, his evidence in a previous trial was also read out to the jury. He denied having gone to Gosling Park on the night in question or having sexually assaulted a young woman there. [He said that] he had not been at Bilal Skaf’s home that night, nor did he ever tell Bilal Skaf that he had had sex with a girl at Gosling Park. He was tall and of stocky build. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown called Andre Saadi. He also denied having gone to Gosling Park on the night in question or having sexually assaulted a young woman there. He had not been at Bilal Skaf’s home that night, nor did he ever tell Bilal Skaf that he had had sex with a girl at Gosling Park. He denied ever having been in a white van with Ali Skaf. He did not know Bilal Skaf. 
        
       
       
        
        On 7 December 2000 the complainant was shown a photo board which contained a photo of Ali Skaf. She did not identify anyone from that photo board. 
        
       
       
        
        Bilal Skaf’s case was that he had been wrongly identified by the complainant. He [said that he] was at home at the time. [He suggested that] the man identified by the complainant could have been his cousin Ali Skaf. 
        
       
       
        
        Mohammed Skaf disputed that his brother Bilal committed the sexual assault. He also disputed that his action in taking the complainant to the park and leaving her there (temporarily) was in the belief that she would ever be sexually assaulted. 
        
       
       
        
        Neither accused gave evidence. At trial Mohammed Skaf’s identification was not in issue, but Bilal Skaf’s was in issue. Called in the case for Bilal Skaf (but relevant also to his brother’s case) was a psychologist, Dr Richard Kemp, who had researched the topic of human face perception and recognition. He gave evidence of the ‘displacement effect’ – having seen the photograph of Bilal Skaf on a photo board there was an increased risk of mistaken identification of him as an offender because his face had become familiar to the complainant. 
        
       
       
        
        The evidence identifying Bilal Skaf included: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) Mobile phone records showed mobile phone calls between Mohammed Skaf and his brother throughout the evening; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Bilal Skaf’s phone calls were originally from his home in Valencia Street, Greenacre, but later they originated at Gosling Park. This was inconsistent with his claim to have been home at the time; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) When he initially came over to the car in which the complainant sat, he identified himself by saying: ‘How are you, I’m Sam’s older brother. My name is Sam. How do you know Sam?’ There was no evidence that Mohammed had any older brother apart from Bilal. There was also evidence (from Snr Constable Dan Davie) that Bilal Skaf had used the name ‘Sam’ on a previous occasion; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) The complainant gave a physical description to the police resembling Bilal Skaf including the scar on his left eyebrow; 
        
       
       
        
        (e) The complainant selected Bilal Skaf as ‘Sam’s older brother Sam’ from a photo board in November 2000 although she was not 100% positive; 
        
       
       
        
        (f) On 15 February 2001, she identified Bilal Skaf without doubt as her assailant from a crowd at Burwood Local Court; 
        
       
       
        
        (g) His alibi was quite inconsistent with the evidence of Ali Skaf and Andre Saadi. Bilal Skaf told police he did not speak to his brother that night at all except to hand over the phone to Ali. Yet telephone records indicated five calls by Bilal Skaf to Mohammed Skaf that night. There was also evidence, contrary to what Bilal Skaf told police, that Ali Skaf did have a mobile phone and that each of them had their respective numbers stored in each others phones. Furthermore, the complainant’s description of the offender did not match Ali Skaf.” 
        
       
      
    67 It is apparent from this summary that the identification by the complainant of Bilal Skaf as one of the persons who sexually assaulted her was an essential element of the Crown case. She gave police a description of him. She subsequently identified him from the police photo board display and during a surveillance exercise at Burwood Local Court. 
     
      
    68 The trial judge was conscious of the potential unreliability of identification evidence and the need to caution the jury about its use. During the course of her summing up her Honour reminded the jury that the real issue in relation to Bilal Skaf was whether he was at the scene at all. Her Honour said that “the case against him is completely dependent upon [the complainant’s] identification of Bilal Skaf as her assailant …. At the end of the day if you have a reasonable doubt on that issue then you will be obliged to acquit him.” 
     
      
    69 Her Honour gave the jury a number of general warnings in familiar terms about the reliability of identification evidence. Her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have to tell you this, members of the jury, that evidence of identification, if it is disputed, must be approached with extreme caution before you accept it as reliable. 
        
       
       
        
        It is the reliability of the evidence which you must put under great scrutiny. Nobody doubts the honesty of [the complainant’s] belief that the man that she saw at Burwood Court on 15 February was in fact her assailant. There is no question of the honesty of her belief. The real question is the reliability of her conclusion that that was the man who assaulted her on 12 August. 
        
       
       
        
        Identification is a particularly fraught area of the law, because it is so easy to make mistakes in identifying someone, particularly in any identifying somebody who was not previously known to the witness. 
        
       
       
        
        I have to tell you this, that the common experience of the criminal courts over the years has demonstrated that identification evidence, no matter how honestly given, can turn out to be unreliable. And indeed there have been a number of notorious cases over the years in which obviously honest evidence of identification has later been shown to be wrong, and innocent people have been convicted.” 
        
       
      
    70 Her Honour then took the jury to the relevant evidence. Because this was a retrial the jury had a transcript of the evidence available to it. Her Honour then repeated her warning and said to the jury:  
     
      
       
        
        “40. … And on 15 February 2001 she identified Bilal Skaf at Burwood Court. As I understand it there is no issue that the person whom she did identify on that occasion was in fact Bilal Skaf. At the time she simply said, as I just mentioned, that he was one of the men there that night, but later said that it was Sam’s brother Sam. And she said in evidence that she knew immediately that that is who it was. 
        
       
       
        
        41 Now having gone through the evidence of what [the complainant] said, very briefly indeed of course, and through the sequence of events, I go back to my original direction that you must treat evidence of identification with particular caution, because of the real dangers of even the most honest witness who is firmly convinced of the correctness of her identification being mistaken. You need to look at a number of matters. You need to look at any matters which might support or detract from the reliability of the identification by [the complainant]. 
        
       
       
        
        42 I will go through a few of these. First of all her familiarity with Bilal Skaf before the events in question. And of course there was none. She did not know him at all. And that is a significant matter because it is always much more difficult to get a reliable identification of a stranger than of somebody who you previously know. That is a matter of common sense you may think. And another matter to be considered is whether there were any characteristics of the subject of the identification which would tend to support the identification. Here of course there is the matter of the scar over the left eyebrow. Although you will remember what Mr Zahra said, taking you to [the complainant’s] evidence about the scar, that there are different descriptions of it, and certainly there is no doubt that the photograph shows there is a scar 2 centimetres above the eyebrow. But was this the scar that she was describing? That is all a matter for you. 
        
       
       
        
        43 More importantly there is the self-description of this man as Sam’s brother Sam. And I will be returning to that in just a couple of minutes. You also have to look at the circumstances of the witness’ observation at the time of the event. How long did she have him in her view? That is up to you. It had to be more than a fleeting view of him. And obviously when you are looking at the distance, it had to be a close-up view. After all he raped her. You have to look at the lighting; and that is entirely a matter for you. And that is why we all went there last Wednesday, essentially to give you a view of the lighting. And of course also the circumstances involved a situation of great stress for [the complainant], and as Dr Kemp said yesterday, that can be a negative factor affecting the reliability of identification. 
        
       
       
        
        44 You look at the nature of the description which she gave initially. And of course the description which she gave on 22 September you have heard it, it is in her evidence, page 11 as I recall, and Mr Zahra has taken you to that. There are some aspects in which you may think that it may or may not, (it’s a matter for you), look like the person we know to be Bilal Skaf. The fact that she made no positive identification of Bilal Skaf when she was shown the photoboard on 8 November, which included his photo, is clearly a significant matter you must take into account. Although you are entitled also to take into account, when looking at that photo, that there was no scar visible in that photo. You are entitled to look at the computer generated photos. It is up to you whether you consider that there is any real resemblance with Bilal Skaf. You may not think that there is a great deal. The Crown says that this is a difficult area. Mr Zahra says well they managed to do a reasonable job of Mohammed Skaf. It is up to you whether you agree with that. These are all issues of fact. All I am doing is just pointing you to the matters you will need to take into account. 
        
       
       
        
        45 You must also look at the length of time between the events of 12 August and her ultimate identification of Bilal Skaf as her assailant that night. And it was just about exactly six months, quite a long time; and also at the circumstances of that identification, where she was probably expecting to see somebody connected with the night of 12 August. You also need to take into account what has been described as ‘the displacement effect’ – and of course Dr Kemp gave evidence of this – that having seen the photograph of Bilal Skaf and others on the photoboard there is an increased risk of mistaken identification of him as an offender because his face has become familiar to her. As assumed familiarity from seeing it on the photoboard. That is what the displacement effect is. And of course that is a matter which you must take into account. Dr Kemp said that it adds to the possibility of a mistaken identification, because the face has assumed familiarity. 
        
       
       
        
        46 Finally you need to consider any other evidence which tends to either support or detract from the reliability of the identification, and probably the most significant piece of evidence which the Crown relies upon here is the fact that the driver of the white van, who was later, according to [the complainant], the first man to assault her, introduced himself as ‘Sam’s brother Sam’; later saying he was Sam’s older brother. 
        
       
       
        
        47 Well we know in fact that Bilal Skaf is Mohammed Skaf’s older brother. So if you do accept this evidence of [the complainant] – and as far as I can see it has never been disputed from a factual matter, that this first man who came up to her from the white van introduced himself immediately as Sam’s brother Sam – you are entitled to regard it, (it’s a matter for you), as a significant piece of the evidence in relation to her identification of Bilal Skaf. Certainly it wasn’t until almost precisely six months later that she first identified Bilal Skaf. But as it turned out, the very person whom she identified from the various people at Burwood Court on 14 February 2001 happened to be Mohammed Skaf’s older brother Bill, who had previously, at least once, adopted the name Sam, as we know from the evidence of [Mr] Davie. So you are entitled to take that evidence into account as powerful material supporting [the complainant’s] identification of Bilal Skaf as her first assailant.” 
        
       
      
    71 The essence of the appellant’s complaints is found in [46] where her Honour refers to the “need to consider any other evidence which tends to either support or detract from the reliability of the identification.” It was submitted by the appellant that her Honour erred in directing the jury that they may consider evidence that the driver of the white van and the first of the persons to assault her referred to himself as “Sam’s brother Sam” and that they were entitled to regard it as “a significant piece of evidence in relation to her identification of Bilal Skaf.” It was submitted that the probative value of identification evidence is not capable of being bolstered or supported by other evidence. Identification evidence stands or falls according to its own qualities. 
     
      
    72 The appellant referred to Domican v The Queen [1992] HCA 13; (1991-1992) 173 CLR 555 at 565 where the court in a joint judgment confirmed that the “adequacy of a warning in an identification case must be evaluated in the context of the evidence in the case. But its adequacy is evaluated by reference to the identification evidence and not the other evidence in the case.” The court confirmed that “the judge must direct the jury on the assumption that they may decide to convict solely on the basis of the identification evidence.” 
     
      
    73 It is important to appreciate that the High Court was concerned with the adequacy of the warning required to be given in relation to identification evidence. It was not at that point in the judgment concerned with the more general issue of the directions to be given in relation to the strength of the entire Crown case. The court was emphasising that the adequacy of the warning required in relation to identification evidence had to be assessed having regard to the evidence as to the knowledge of the witness of the person identified, their opportunity to observe that person, the passage of time since the incident and the identification and the circumstances in which the identification occurred. Merely because there is other evidence which may implicate an accused, the trial judge is not absolved from giving appropriate warnings. Because the jury may decide to convict solely on the basis of the identification evidence, even if the Crown case is otherwise strong, the warnings must be given. 
     
      
    74 The appellant also referred to the judgment of Levine J in R v Razzak [2004] NSWCCA 62. In that case this Court confirmed that “poor quality identification evidence of itself cannot be improved by any other evidence. It stands or falls according to its own quality. What other evidence can do is bolster the Crown case, which includes the flawed evidence that the accused was the person who committed the offence of malicious wounding (that being the only issue here)” at ([26]). There are passages to similar effect in R v Turner [2000] SASC 27; (2000) 76 SASR 163 where Mullighan J said at [102] that the jury could not be instructed that “they could use the circumstantial evidence to see if it enabled them to decide that [the victim] was selecting the robber at the identification parade.” 
     
      
    75 In the present case her Honour was careful to direct the jury in relation to the problems with identification evidence. The directions which her Honour gave which we have included at [68]-[70] above were appropriate. Before giving those directions her Honour had told the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “Then between pages 23 and 25 she described going to Burwood Local Court, being asked to indicate if she recognised anyone as being there on the night of the assault, and she saw this man when he was walking up the stairs and says she identified him immediately as Sam’s brother Sam. She said: ‘I had no doubt I had the right person.’ She said at the time she immediately identified him as one of the men, and it was a few days later that she said it was Sam’s brother Sam. On page 25 she described what it was about him that made her certain that this was the man whom she had seen.” 
        
       
      
    76 It is correct, as the appellant asserts, that poor quality identification evidence of itself cannot be improved by other evidence. However, even if of poor quality, evidence of identification may together with other evidence assist the Crown case. Problems may arise when the identification evidence is weak and the Crown seeks to establish the accused as the offender by inviting consideration of the surrounding circumstances which suggest that it was the accused who committed the crime. 
     
      
    77 There was no issue in the case that the complainant had been assaulted, the only question being whether the appellant had been involved. The complainant was confident and definite about her identification of Bilal Skaf in the crowded Burwood Local Court as “Sam’s brother Sam.” The complainant said she recognised him as the person who was introduced to her as “Sam’s brother Sam” and later identified himself as Sam’s older brother who, of course, is Bilal Skaf. The substance of her evidence was that she recognised the man at the court as the same person to whom she was introduced. This was not circumstantial evidence with a tendency to bolster confidence in her identification. Rather it formed part of the process of identification. 
     
      
    78 This case can be distinguished from Razzak where the identification evidence was appropriately described as “weak resemblance evidence.” In that case this Court was concerned that the trial judge by his directions may have diverted the jury from a proper evaluation of the probative value of that weak evidence by asking them to consider whether it could be supported or bolstered by other evidence. The other evidence was of a circumstantial nature. A similar position existed in Turner.  
     
      
    79 As the trial judge pointed out there was no issue in this case that Bilal Skaf is Mohammed’s older brother. In these circumstances the directions given by the trial judge did not diminish the strength of the warnings she gave and did not impermissibly invite the jury to weigh in the balance, on the identification issue, evidence which was not relevant to that issue. 
     
      
    80 We reject ground 3. 
     
      
       
      Applications for leave to appeal against sentence 
       
      
    81 Both appellants seek leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon them. As noted at the outset of this judgment, the first count in the indictment charged Mohammed Skaf as an accessory before the fact to the offence of Bilal Skaf the subject of the second count. The second count charged Bilal Skaf with aggravated sexual assault, based upon his own act of intercourse with the complainant. The third count charged Bilal Skaf with aiding and abetting the aggravated sexual assault of the complainant by another man. By s 61J of the Crimes Act, the aggravated sexual assault charged carries a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment. Mohammed Skaf, as an accessory before the fact, was liable to the same maximum sentence: s 346 of the Crimes Act. It is best to set out the sentences which Mathews AJ passed later, as they must be understood as part of a complex of sentences for these offences and other offences in which each applicant was involved. 
     
      
    82 For the purpose of these applications, the brief summary of the facts set out earlier in this judgment (at [66]) needs to be expanded. In her remarks on sentence, her Honour recorded the facts as she found them as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “2 The events giving rise to these charges occurred on 12 August 2000. The complainant, a sixteen year old school student, had previously been a friend of Mohammed Skaf, although he had never told her his correct name: she knew him as Sam. Early on the evening of Saturday, 12 August, Mohammed Skaf telephoned the complainant at her home at Glenwood Park, and suggested that she accompany him on a drive to the city. She agreed to do so, after getting her mother’s permission, and he arranged to collect her in his car. He told her that he was on his own. However, when he arrived at her house there were two other men in the car. The complainant had met one of them, the driver, once before. The other man, “Ibrahim”, was unknown to her. The complainant got into the back seat beside Mohammed Skaf. The car was then driven to Gosling Park in Greenacre. Mohammed Skaf told the complainant that they were going there so that he could collect a $600 debt, and he said that they would then continue their drive into the city. During the course of this journey the men were frequently talking on their telephones in a language, presumably Arabic, which the complainant could not understand.  
        
       
       
        
        3 In due course the car parked in a parking area beside Gosling Park. The two men in the front seat got out, leaving Mohammed Skaf alone with the complainant. He commenced making sexual advances towards her, but she rebuffed him and he desisted. He then left, and Ibrahim got into the car and also started making sexual advances towards her. She again resisted, and eventually she got out of the car. While she was out of the car, a white van pulled into in the carpark, followed shortly behind by a blue car. Eight men got out of the white van and three more from the blue car. They were obviously known to Ibrahim, who went over and talked to them. The driver of the white van was Bilal Skaf. He came over to the complainant and introduced himself as “Sam’s brother Sam”. He asked her if she would like to go for a walk. She declined, saying that she was waiting for Sam. He insisted, and after a little while he grabbed her beneath her hair and called out “Allah, boys Allah.” At that point some of the other men came over and assisted Bilal Skaf dragging the complainant across the park. They reached a point near a pump shed, where she was placed on the ground. There she was held down by several of the men and part of her clothing was removed. The complainant was crying and screaming and trying to escape. Bilal Skaf said “this one is a feisty one”, and then proceeded to have sexual intercourse with her whilst she was being held down. This constituted the first charge of aggravated sexual assault.  
        
       
       
        
        4 After Bilal Skaf had finished, another man came over saying “it’s my turn now”, and proceeded also to have sexual intercourse with the complainant. This constitutes the second offence charged against Bilal Skaf, he being there as an aider and abettor. 
        
       
       
        
        5 During all this time, according to the complainant, the men were standing around laughing and talking in their own language. After the second act of sexual intercourse, one of the men placed a handgun against her head. The same man kicked her in the stomach. At that stage she was in grave fear for her life. She got up and ran extremely fast across the park and through the parking area where the three vehicles had been left.. She could hear the men running after her. One of them, a man with a ponytail, tried to lure her into the white van. She kept on running and finally reached a phone box on the corner diagonally opposite the car park. She picked up the telephone but she did not know who to ring, as she did not want her mother to see her in that state. At this point the man with the pony tail approached in the white van. He had a gun underneath his jacket and he commanded that she get into the van. The complainant refused. She was screaming throughout this time. Fortunately for her another man, a stranger, came up to her at that point, and the man with the pony tail left. The newcomer, Mr Anderson, took the complainant to his nearby apartment where the complainant telephoned her then boyfriend who later came and collected her. Whilst she was at Mr Anderson’s apartment, she received a call on her mobile phone. It was from Mohammed Skaf, who asked where she was and told her that he would come and pick her up and take her home. The complainant forcefully declined. Shortly afterwards her boyfriend arrived and took her back to her home. The next day she told her mother that she had been sexually assaulted and two days later she went to the police. In the meantime she received an SMS message from Mohammed Skaf saying that he had got into a “punch-up” because of what had happened to her.” 
        
       
       
      Bilal Skaf  
       
      
    83 As noted earlier (at [8]), Bilal Skaf had earlier been found guilty of two sets of offences, unrelated to the present offences, also committed in August 2000. It is necessary to trace the history of the sentences passed upon him in relation to all three sets of offences to understand the place which the sentences passed by Mathews AJ take in a wider sentencing spectrum. Those sets of offences are as follows: 
     
      
    · The Northcote Park offences of 10 August 2000;· The Gosling Park offences of 12 August 2000 (the subject of the present appeal);· The Bankstown offences of 30 August 2000. 
     
      
       
      It is not necessary to detail the Northcote Park and the Bankstown offences; it is sufficient to refer to them globally.  
       
      
    84 In 2002 Finnane DCJ sentenced him for all three sets of offences, as follows: 
     
      
    · For the Northcote Park offences, an aggregate sentence of imprisonment of 30 years, with an effective non-parole period of 20 years, to date from 12 February 2001; 
     
      
    · For each of the offences at Gosling Park, concurrent terms of 20 years, with a non-parole period of 9 years, to date from 12 February 2021; 
     
      
    · For the Bankstown offences an aggregate term of 26 years, with an effective non-parole period of 10 years, to date from 12 February 2030. 
     
      
       
      It will be seen that the overall sentence for each of the second and third sets of offences was directed to be served cumulatively upon the overall sentence for the set of offences which preceded it, that is, at the expiration of the effective non-parole period fixed in respect of that set of offences. It was in this way that the aggregate sentence for all three sets of offences of 55 years, with an effective non-parole period of 39 years, was arrived at. 
       
      
    85 On 6 May 2004,when this Court set aside the convictions for the Gosling Park offences at the first trial, it was necessary to adjust the commencement date of the sentences for the Bankstown offences, pursuant to s 59 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Those sentences were directed to commence 9 years earlier, so that the aggregate sentence of 26 years with a non-parole period of 10 years was to date from 12 February 2021. The appellant then became eligible for release on parole on 11 February 2031. 
     
      
    86 On 12 August 2005, he was sentenced by Hulme DCJ for an unrelated offence of stealing a motor vehicle to imprisonment for a fixed term of 9 months, to expire on 11 May 2031. It is apparent that his Honour intended that he should serve an additional period of 3 months for that offence. 
     
      
    87 On 16 September 2005, this Court allowed appeals by the applicant against the sentences for the Northcote Park and Bankstown offences: R v Bilal Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 297.He was re-sentenced as follows: 
     
      
    · For the Northcote Park offences, terms aggregating 18 years, with an effective non-parole period of 14 years and 3 months, dating from 12 February 2001; 
     
      
    · For the Bankstown offences, sentences aggregating 20 years with an effective non-parole period of 14 years, dating from 12 February 2009. 
     
      
       
      The overall sentence for the two sets of offences was imprisonment for 28 years, expiring on 11 February 2029, with an effective non-parole period of 22 years, expiring on 11 February 2023. 
        
      No adjustment was made to the commencement date of Hulme DCJ’s sentence. 
       
      
    88 This is how things stood at the time that the appellant came to be sentenced by Mathews AJ. (Because the offences were committed in 2000, he was sentenced in accordance with the procedure set out in s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act before its amendment in 2002.) Her Honour sentenced him as follows: 
     
      
    · On the second count, imprisonment for 17 years with a non-parole period of 11 years, commencing on 12 February 2021;  
     
      
    · On the third count, imprisonment for 14 years with a non-parole period of 8 years, commencing on 12 February 2025. 
     
      
       
      Thus, the sentence on the third count was accumulated upon the sentence for the second count by 4 years. The aggregate sentence was imprisonment for 18 years, commencing on 12 February 2021 and expiring on 11 February 2039, with an effective non-parole period of 12 years, expiring on 11 February 2033. 
       
      
    89 As noted, the overall sentence passed by the Court of Criminal Appeal for the Northcote Park and Bankstown offences was 28 years, expiring on 11 February 2029, with an effective non-parole period of 22 years, expiring on 11 February 2023. Accordingly, the aggregate sentence passed by Mathews AJ commenced 2 years prior to the expiry of that effective non-parole period, and had the effect of extending both the overall sentence and the effective non-parole period fixed by the Court of Criminal Appeal by 10 years.  
     
      
    90 Her Honour referred to the sentence passed by Hulme DCJ, noting that its effect had been to defer the applicant’s opportunity for release on parole for a further 3 months. However, she thought it appropriate to disregard that sentence which, she observed, would be “entirely subsumed” within the sentences she was to pass.  
     
      
    91 At the time of all these offences (including the subject offences) the appellant was not quite 19 years old. He had a minor criminal history, which her Honour appears to have treated as of no consequence. He is of Lebanese origin, and a psychological report disclosed some behavioural problems during his school years but, apparently, nothing of any particular significance for the purpose of sentence. 
     
      
    92 For the whole of his period in custody to the time he was sentenced by her Honour, he had been on protection because of the nature of his offences and had been classified as “an extremely high risk inmate.” He had spent most of his time in segregation and had been deprived of educational opportunities. He had had a number of health problems since going into custody, including respiratory difficulties and bouts of depression. 
     
      
    93 Her Honour concluded that, although it was Mohammed Skaf who had lured the complainant to the park, it was this appellant who was “the orchestrator and organiser of the events of that night.” She described his offences as ”extremely serious”, although falling short of the worst category. As is reflected in the sentences passed, she found the offence the subject of the second count, in which he was the “principal assailant”, the more serious of the two. 
     
      
    94 Mr Haesler SC, for the appellant, argued that her Honour had failed properly to apply the principle of totality and that, in any event, the sentence for the second count is manifestly excessive. In the context of the totality ground, he submitted that in relative terms the appellant’s position after her Honour’s sentences is worse than it had been when he was sentenced by Finnane DCJ after the first trial. Her Honour’s overall sentence of 18 years is less than the 20 years passed by Finnane DCJ but, whereas his Honour specified a non- parole period of 9 years, her Honour’s effective non-parole period is 12 years. That said, unlike Finnane DCJ’s sentences, her Honour’s overall sentence was partly concurrent with the existing sentences to the extent of 2 years. Moreover, as Mr Haesler acknowledged, allowance has to be made for the partly concurrent sentence passed by Hulme DCJ. In the result, given that Hulme DCJ intended that the appellant should serve a further 3 months for the car stealing offence, her Honour’s effective non-parole period might be seen as 9 years and 9 months.  
     
      
    95 Mr Haesler also pointed to a difference between the structure of what might be described as the global sentence for all three sets of offences. In the global sentence passed by Finnane DCJ, 55 years with a non-parole period of 39 years, the non-parole period was, in round figures, 71% of the total sentence. The effect of the sentences passed by her Honour was to produce a global term of 38 years with a non-parole period of 32 years, that proportion being 84%. 
     
      
    96 The argument was developed by reference to the line of authority that ordinarily an accused person after a re-trial should not face a longer sentence than that imposed at the first trial. The development of that approach through the cases, beginning with R v Gilmore (1979) 1 A Crim R 416, was traced in Tarrant v R [2007] NSWCCA 124, (2007) 171 A Crim R 425. It is not suggested that the evidence against the applicant at his re-trial was different from that at the first trial, or that there is any basis upon which a more adverse view might have been taken of his criminality: cf Tarrant. 
     
      
    97 However, it is not always easy to maintain this approach when, as here, the sentences under consideration are part of a complex web of sentencing orders. That was the case when Finnane DCJ originally sentenced the applicant for the Gosling park offences, and it remained so when Mathews AJ came to sentence him after his re-trial. Not only did her Honour have to accommodate those sentences within the spectrum of the sentences for the Northcote Park and Bankstown offences, she had to do so at a time when the sentences for those offences imposed by Finnane DCJ had been reduced and restructured by this Court. 
     
      
    98 In the event, it is not necessary to express any concluded view about this argument because we are persuaded that her Honour’s sentences failed to afford adequate weight to the principle of totality. The ground that the sentence for the second count is manifestly excessive was developed in written submissions by reference to a schedule of cases dealt with in this Court which involved very serious sexual assaults. Certainly, the sentence of 17 years, against a statutory maximum of 20 years, is heavy. However, whether it is manifestly excessive is also a matter which we do not need to determine. 
     
      
    99 In oral argument Mr Haesler linked the two grounds, saying that “in a sense they’re two sides of the one coin.” It is apparent from her Honour’s remarks that she was conscious that totality was an issue which loomed large in her sentencing exercise. Having referred to the fact that there was general agreement that the sentences she passed upon the appellant should be partly cumulative upon his existing sentences, her Honour added at [35]: 
     
      
       
        
        “A tension exists between the principle of totality on the one hand, and, on the other, the need to ensure that a person who deliberately commits a series of unrelated criminal offences receives adequate punishment for each of them. This tension is particularly evident in Bilal Skaf’s case, given the very lengthy sentences which he is presently serving, on the one hand, and the extreme seriousness of these offences, on the other. The first factor would tend to support a lesser accumulation of the sentences for these offences, while the second would favour a much greater accumulation of sentences.” 
        
       
      
    100 Her Honour decided that she should be guided by the manner in which this Court dealt with the Northcote Park and Bankstown offences. She noted that the aggregate sentence for the Bankstown sentences was cumulative upon the aggregate sentence for the Northcote Park offences to the extent of 10 years. As we have said, that is the figure by which her Honour’s sentences extended the global sentence and non-parole period imposed by this Court (leaving out of account the 9 month sentence passed by Hulme DCJ).  
     
      
    101 Her Honour faced a most difficult sentencing task, highlighted by the passage from her remarks quoted above. The appellant was to be sentenced for very serious offences, committed only days after another grave criminal episode of a similar kind. To balance the demand for retribution and deterrence and the principle of totality was a challenging undertaking indeed. Nevertheless, we are persuaded that the sentences fail to afford adequate weight to the consideration of totality. This Court, in dealing with the Northcote Park and Bankstown offences, structured the sentences for those offences with an eye to totality. That principle had to be applied afresh when sentencing for the present offences, in the light of the aggregate sentence this Court had imposed. 
     
      
    102 By the time he came to be sentenced by her Honour, the appellant was a young man already facing very long sentences for those other two criminal episodes. As Mr Haesler put it in oral argument, the objects of deterrence and denunciation had already been met “to a considerable degree” by the sentences aggregating 28 years with a non-parole period of 22 years already in place. An increase of that aggregate term by 10 years for the present offences was more than was reasonably required to achieve those objects. 
     
      
    103 In the event of re-sentence, we received a body of additional material in an affidavit by the appellant and two affidavits by his solicitor, to which were annexed a psychiatric report and copies of a number of Department of Corrective Services documents. This was supplemented by two brief affidavits by a senior officer at Goulburn Correctional Centre, where the appellant has been held, relied upon by the Crown. It is unnecessary to recite that material in any detail. It is sufficient to say that it discloses that the appellant remains on protection and continues to be classified as an extremely high-risk inmate. That is likely to remain the case in the short to medium term. His conditions of custody are attended by a high level of security, and they limit or impose restrictions upon his access to work, education, welfare facilities, visits, sport and fitness training, and religious observance. It is appropriate to have regard to this material in determining the sentences this Court should impose. 
     
      
    104 We would reduce each of the sentences passed by her Honour, while maintaining the accumulation of the second sentence upon the first by 4 years. The effect would be to reduce the aggregate sentence and the effective non-parole period each by 2 years, producing an aggregate term of 16 years with a non-parole period of 10 years. The global sentence for all the appellant’s offences would be reduced to the same extent. 
     
      
    105 Accordingly, leave to appeal against sentence is granted, the appeal is allowed, and the sentences passed by Mathews AJ are quashed. In lieu, the appellant is sentenced as follows:  
     
      
    · On the second count, imprisonment for 15 years, commencing on 12 February 2021 and expiring on 11 February 2036, with a non-parole period of 9 years, expiring on 11 February 2030. 
     
      
    · On the third count imprisonment for 12 years, commencing on 12 February 2025 and expiring on 11 February 2037, with a non-parole period of 6 years, expiring on 11 February 2031. 
     
      
       
      Thus, the appellant’s total sentence will expire on 11 February 2037, and he will be eligible for release on parole on 11 February 2031.  
       
       
      Mohammed Skaf 
       
      
    106 Mohammed Skaf had not been involved in the Northcote Park offences but was a participant in the Bankstown incident. He also was sentenced by Finnane DCJ for a series of offences arising from that incident. On 16 September 2005, this Court allowed his appeal against those sentences and substituted terms aggregating (in round figures) 19 years, with an effective non-parole period of 11 years, dating from 3 January 2001: R v Mohammed Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 298. 
     
      
    107 Mathews AJ sentenced him to imprisonment for 15 years with a non-parole period of 7½ years, commencing on 2 January 2012. That is the date of expiry of the effective non-parole period set by the Court of Criminal Appeal. The effect of her Honour’s sentence was to extend the aggregate sentence for the Bankstown offences (again in round figures) by 7 years, and the effective non-parole period by 7½ years. Thus, his global sentence for all offences is 26 years with an effective non-parole period of 18½ years, that period expiring on 1 July 2019. 
     
      
    108 Her Honour found that his role in the events of Gosling Park, although pivotal, was less than that of his brother. As he had left the scene before Bilal Skaf arrived, aggravating features of the principal offence, such as “the actual and threatened violence to the complainant,” could not be attributed to him. She added, however, that she was not “ belittling” his role, and said at [43]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In fact his involvement in the evening’s activities was an absolutely crucial one. Without him, the principal offence would not have been committed at all.” 
        
       
      
    109 At the time of these offences and of the Bankstown offences, this appellant was only 17 years old. It seems that his only other offences were unrelated matters of a different nature, taken into account when he was sentenced for the Bankstown offences. He also had exhibited behavioural difficulties in his school years and, indeed, was expelled from high school. Her Honour accepted that he had always been strongly influenced by his brother, Bilal. 
     
      
    110 A matter which her Honour considered to be of great significance was that, after going into custody, he was diagnosed with a very serious illness, Hodgkin’s disease. This is a lymphoid malignancy which was once fatal, but is now amenable to treatment by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The appellant was treated by both those means. His chemotherapy was generally well tolerated, but he developed two significant complications, shingles and a venous thrombosis. Throughout his treatment he was kept in a secure unit at the Prince of Wales hospital where, her Honour noted, “he was deprived of most facilities and all educational services, and was allowed only infrequent visits from his family.” He became very anxious and depressed, and it seems that the shingles were the result of his anxiety. 
     
      
    111 His treatment, which had ceased three years before, appeared to have been effective. He had been in remission and his prognosis was favourable. Nevertheless, he still felt unwell and would continue to undergo symptoms arising either from the disease or the treatment for it. Because of his condition, her Honour found, his imprisonment had involved “much greater hardship for him than it would for other inmates.” 
     
      
    112 His counsel, Mr Dhanji, argued that the sentence is manifestly excessive and that her Honour’s approach to sentence disclosed three specific errors: an inadequate application of the principle of totality, failure to have proper regard to the appellant’s youth, and an inadequate measure of distinction between the appellant’s sentence and those passed upon his brother. It becomes unnecessary to determine any of these grounds because, as Bilal Skaf’s sentences have been reduced, it is inevitable that this appellant’s sentence be also adjusted. That adjustment must reflect his lesser role in the principal offence perpetrated by his brother, his youth and the influence of his brother, together with the state of his health and its effect on his experience of incarceration. Totality, of course, remains an important factor. His youth and his health were taken into account by this Court when sentencing him for the Bankstown offences. 
     
      
    113 In his case also, leave to appeal against sentence is granted and the appeal is allowed. The sentence passed by Mathews AJ is quashed and, in lieu, the appellant is sentenced to imprisonment for 12 years, commencing on 2 January 2012 and expiring on 1 January 2024, with a non-parole period of 6 years, expiring on 1 January 2018. Thus, the appellant’s total sentence will expire on 1 January 2024, and he will be eligible for release on parole on 1 January 2018. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      1. Both appeals against conviction are dismissed. 
       
       
      2. In relation to Bilal Skaf: 
       
       
      (a) Leave to appeal against sentence is granted, the appeal is allowed, and the sentences passed by Mathews AJ are quashed. In lieu, the appellant is sentenced as follows:  
       
      
    · On the second count, imprisonment for 15 years, commencing on 12 February 2021 and expiring on 11 February 2036, with a non-parole period of 9 years, expiring on 11 February 2030. 
     
      
    · On the third count imprisonment for 12 years, commencing on 12 February 2025 and expiring on 11 February 2037, with a non-parole period of 6 years, expiring on 11 February 2031. 
     
      
       
      Thus, the appellant’s total sentence will expire on 11 February 2037, and he will be eligible for release on parole on 11 February 2031.  
       
       
      3. In relation to Mohammed Skaf: 
       
       
      (a) leave to appeal against sentence is granted and the appeal is allowed.  
       
      (b) The sentence passed by Mathews AJ is quashed and, in lieu, the appellant is sentenced to imprisonment for 12 years, commencing on 2 January 2012 and expiring on 1 January 2024, with a non-parole period of 6 years, expiring on 1 January 2018. Thus, the appellant’s total sentence will expire on 1 January 2024, and he will be eligible for release on parole on 1 January 2018.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was convicted of a single count under s 300(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Between 31 October 1996 and 17 February 1998 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did make a false instrument, namely a letter addressed to John Preston dated 19 April 1984 with the intention of using it, namely to induce another person to accept the instrument as genuine and because of that acceptance to so [sic] do some act to the prejudice of John Preston.” 
        
       
      
    2 Although four grounds of appeal were raised by the Notice of Appeal only three grounds were pursued at the hearing. They are: 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: a substantial miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the failure of the trial judge to give proper or adequate instruction regarding the nature and scope of s 300(1) of the  
      Crimes Act  
      1900. 
       
       
      Ground 2: a substantial miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the decision of the trial judge to grant leave to cross-examine, and the manner and form of cross-examination by the Crown prosecutor in relation to the following issues: 
       
       
        
        a. the issue of an alleged misappropriation of an amount of $5,000 said to have been taken by the appellant from Mr Preston; 
         
        b. the contention on the part of the Crown that the appellant concealed the whereabouts of Ms Burden, a potential witness, from the Crown. 
        
       
       
      Ground 3: a substantial miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the failure of the Crown to obtain leave pursuant to s 108(3) of the  
      Evidence Act  
      1995 regarding the adducing of evidence of complaint by Ms Moffatt to Ms Middleton, and in that evidence being admitted in the trial. 
       
      
    3 I shall consider each ground but before doing so indicate that I have read the reasons for judgment of Simpson J in draft. 
     
      
       
      Relevant facts 
       
      
    4 The appellant is a solicitor and a partner in the firm founded by his father. In 1984 Mr John Preston placed his legal affairs in the hands of the appellant after he received a bankruptcy notice. At the same time he also retained the appellant in relation to a large dispute he had with his previous legal representatives, Strong Brown & Co. Over the years there were other matters in which the appellant acted. 
     
      
    5 In 1984 Mr Preston agreed with the appellant that the latter would act for him and his companies at a charge out rate of $85 per hour. During the next 8 years the appellant increased his charge out rate from time to time. By 1992 the appellant was charging at a rate of $200 per hour. 
     
      
    6 The professional relationship came to an apparently acrimonious end in 1992. There was a dispute over the return of Mr Preston’s files. The appellant claimed that a significant sum for fees was outstanding. Mr Preston engaged a firm of solicitors to take action to recover his files and in 1993 commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court seeking orders for delivery of bills of costs in a number of matters, a reference to taxation in respect of those matters, delivery up of files, and the taking of accounts. 
     
      
    7 Subsequently, the claim for the taking of accounts was abandoned. However, the assessment of costs was pursued. In November 1996 the appellant filed an application for the assessment of his costs under the Legal Profession Act 1987 (repealed). Mr Hattersley was appointed as a costs assessor. He wrote to the appellant and indicated that because he was required to make an assessment of costs for work done prior to 30 June 1993 (when solicitors’ fees were regulated by the Supreme Court scale of costs) and before he could accept an assessment which included a charge out rate of $200 per hour “you must seek to rely on a specific written agreement between you and your client.” Mr Hattersley sought copies of any documents which could sustain a charge out rate of $200 per hour. 
     
      
    8 Mr Zwar was the solicitor in the appellant’s firm who assisted the appellant in relation to these matters. He was tasked with the responsibility of collecting the firm’s files so that Mr Hattersley could carry out his assessment. When carrying out his tasks Mr Zwar located a carbon copy, on green paper, of a letter purporting to be the terms of engagement between the appellant and Mr Preston. That letter became Ex 1A at the trial.  
     
      
    9 The prosecutor alleged that Ex 1A was created on the appellant’s instructions years after its notional date and was not a true copy of a letter which had been created in the ordinary way bearing the date 19 April 1984. Mr Zwar gave evidence that after he found the copy letter he spoke with the appellant who said: “Well, I always thought there was a letter somewhere.” 
     
      
    10 Mr Hattersley gave evidence at the appellant’s trial. He said that he found the copy letter when he attended at the appellant’s premises to read the relevant files. He took a copy of the letter and later corresponded with both Mr Preston and the appellant in relation to it. He gave evidence that until he had himself discovered the document no-one had drawn it to his attention and he had not been advised that it existed. Mr Hattersley formed the view that the letter was capable of leading to the conclusion that Mr Preston rather than his companies were liable for the professional fees. He raised this with Mr Preston who rejected the suggestion. Mr Hattersley did not resolve the matter and he later suspended his assessment. He advised the Supreme Court accordingly.  
     
      
       
      A conversation between Ms Moffatt and Ms Middleton 
       
      
    11 Ms Jan Moffatt was employed by the appellant’s firm from February 1994 to 20 July 2001. She was the appellant’s secretary. She was granted a certificate pursuant to s 128 of the Evidence Act 1995. The trial judge gave a direction to the jury pursuant to s 165 with respect to the possible unreliability of her evidence. 
     
      
    12 Ms Moffatt said that sometime between November 1996 and June 1998 the appellant had told her that he had a letter on tape for her to type. She said that she was told that the letter was to be done in final form on a typewriter. She said that the appellant gave her some superseded firm letterhead on white paper and some green copy paper. She said that she originally typed the document that she transcribed from the tape into her word processor and saved it to her hard drive. She then printed the document and gave it to the appellant for him to check. She said that the appellant settled the letter and told her to type it in final form on the typewriter and in the same format as a carbon copy of a Preston letter that he had given her. She said that she typed the letter on a Canon electric typewriter. She then took the completed letter to the appellant who took it from her. She observed him tear up the original letter. She identified Ex 1A as the copy of the letter. 
     
      
    13 Ms Moffatt said that she had typed the initials “LN:SMB” at the top of the letter. She said that the initial “LN” stood for the appellant but Ms Moffatt did not know of any typist with the initials “SMB”. She said that she did not see a green copy of the document until a few months later when she saw it on a file. She could not recall which file it was on. 
     
      
    14 Ms Moffatt said that she remembered preparing Ex 1A between about November 1996 and June 1998. She said that she was able to recall the earlier date because when she prepared the document she was wearing a particular orange suit which she said she specifically recalled buying in November 1996. She said that she typed the document before she moved her position in the office, which occurred in mid 1998. 
     
      
    15 Ms Moffatt’s credit was challenged. It was suggested to her that she was concerned that when she left the appellant’s employment she was not given her full entitlements. It was put to her that in a conversation on 9 October 2001 she had made veiled threats against the appellant including that she would give information to Mr Preston which could be used to harm the appellant. She denied the conversation. 
     
      
       
      The evidence of Tracy Middleton 
       
      
    16 Ms Tracy Middleton was a “salaried partner” with the appellant’s firm from 1 July 1998 to 11 August 1999. She gave evidence that in November 1998, being some months after the latest date on which Ms Moffatt claims to have been directed to prepare Ex 1A, she had a conversation with Ms Moffatt. She gave the following account of that conversation: 
     
      
       
        
        “Jan came into my office and shut the door, sat down, and she had tears in her eyes and I said to her ‘what’s wrong with you?’ And she said to me, ‘what would happen to me if I was told to create a document and back date it?’ And I said to her, ‘well, you’re not going to do it’, and she said, ‘well, what if I have done?’ And I said ‘well, what would happen to me’ is what she said to me and I said, ‘well, you wouldn’t – the person who told you to do it would be the one who would be in trouble’.” 
        
       
      
    17 When Ms Moffatt gave evidence she said that she did not recall whether she had a specific conversation with Ms Middleton. The following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. At any time, in relation to documents that you have spoken about, exhibit 1 and exhibit 9, documents you say you’ve been asked to create and which in effect would be using a backdating method, did you have any conversations with Tracey Middleton about it? 
         
        A. I cannot say yes and I cannot say no. I know Tracey and I had discussions. It was extremely stressful, but -- 
        
       
       
        
        CONOMOS: I object to it in that form. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I understand that. 
        
       
       
        
        CONOMOS: I object to it. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I am not asking you about your feelings. You say you did have discussions with Tracey Middleton. Can you say if any of those conversations were related to documents that you had been asked to prepare by Leon Nikolaidis? 
         
        A. I cannot recall.” 
        
       
       
      The appellant’s evidence 
       
      
    18 The appellant gave evidence at his trial. He said that he never asked Ms Moffatt to prepare Ex 1A and could not remember it being prepared. When cross-examined he accepted that he must have had the letter prepared and agreed that he had issued it. However, he denied that he had the copy letter created during the period 1996 to 1998 to assist him in the costs assessment. 
     
      
       
      The evidence of Ms Sybil Burden 
       
      
    19 Ms Sybil Mary Burden gave evidence that she had worked for the appellant although she could not remember the precise period of her employment. She said that her initials were “SMB”. She could not recall whether she had prepared Ex 1A. She did not recall working on a Preston matter. 
     
      
    20 She said that the style and formatting of the letter could have been her own and said “I probably did type the letter, but I cannot recall.” 
     
      
       
      Ground One 
       
      
    21 The trial judge gave both written and oral directions to the jury in relation to the elements of the offence under s 300(1). The written directions which were discussed by his Honour with counsel before they were given to the jury included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Elements 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown must prove each and every one of these matters beyond reasonable doubt before the jury could find the accused guilty of the charge: 
        
       
       
        
        1. The accused 
         
        2. made a false instrument; 
         
        3. with intent that the accused or another person; 
         
        4. would use the false instrument; 
         
        5. to induce another person; 
         
        6. to accept the instrument as genuine; and 
         
        7. because of that acceptance, to do, or not do, some act; 
         
        8. to the prejudice of the victim (Preston) 
        
       
       
        
        Legal directions: Terms used 
        
       
       
        
        A.  
        Instrument: 
         means any document, whether of a formal or informal character. 
        
       
       
        
        B.  
        Made 
         a person is to be treated as making a false instrument if the person alters an instrument so as to make it false in any respect (whether or not it is false in some other respect apart from that alteration). 
        
       
       
        
        C.  
        False 
        
       
       
        
         An instrument is false if it purports or is put forward: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) to have been made in the form in which it is made by a person who did not in fact make it in that form, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) to have been made in the terms in which it is made by a person who did not in fact make it in those terms, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (g) to have been made or altered on a date on which, or at a place at which, or otherwise in circumstances in which, it was not in fact made or altered, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        D.  
        Intent 
        
       
       
        
         A person intends an event if they decide to bring it about by their act or omission. If they foresee an event as the inevitable consequence of their act or omission, they intend to bring about that result even if it was not the purpose of what he or she did. 
        
       
       
        
        E.  
        Induce 
        
       
       
        
         The Crown does not have to prove that the accused intended to induce a particular person to do the particular act. 
        
       
       
        
        F.  
        Prejudice 
        
       
       
        
         An act or omission is to a person’s prejudice if a financial advantage will be obtained from that person. That advantage can be otherwise than by way of remuneration. 
        
       
       
        
         That may be the result of a person having accepted a false instrument as genuine, or a copy of a false instrument as a copy of a genuine one, in connection with the person’s performance of a duty.” 
        
       
      
    22 In the course of his oral directions the trial judge said of the elements of the offence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Those elements are: Firstly, that it was the accused; secondly, who made the false instrument, and I have given you a definition of what ‘made’ means in this circumstance. An instrument includes any document, whether of formal or informal character. The term ‘made’ has the meaning that a person is treated as having made the false instrument if it alters the instrument to make it false in any respect. 
        
       
       
        
        The third element is that with the intent of the accused or another person would use, and here the Crown relies on it being another person. 
        
       
       
        
        Fourthly, would use the false instrument to induce another person-here Mr Hattersley-next, to accept the instrument as genuine. 
        
       
       
        
        Seventh, [sic] because of that acceptance to do or not to do some act: here the Crown alleges the act of the cost assessment. 
        
       
       
        
        Eight, [sic] to the prejudice of the victim-he is said to be, by the Crown, Mr Preston. 
        
       
       
        
        Now ‘falsity’, as I have set out in the document, can come within a number of matters. An instrument is false if it purports or is put forward 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) To have been made in the form in which it is made by a person who did not in fact make it in that form; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) To have been made in the terms in which it is made by a person who did not in fact make it in that terms; [sic] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        or 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (g) To have been made or altered on a date upon which or a place in which or in circumstances which it was not in fact made. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        ‘Intent’, as I have defined it there under heading D on the bottom of the page, going over to the second page, a person intends an event if they decide to bring it about by their act or omission. If they foresee an event, person foresees an event as the inevitable consequence of his or her act or omission. He or she intends to bring about that result even if it was not the purpose of what he or she did. 
        
       
       
        
        Here importantly also, and it is not in the written document, the intent must be established as being in existence at the time specified in the indictment. In other words, here the date specified is between 31 October 1996 and 17 February 1998. 
        
       
       
        
        You will recall the evidence of Mr Preston on which the Crown relies to establish the opening point and a closing point of those dates specified in the indictment. So the intent must be established as existing at the time. 
        
       
       
        
        ‘Induce’ is a legal term but ‘induce’ has its ordinary meaning. The Crown does not have to prove the accused intended to induce a particular person to do the particular act. 
        
       
       
        
        ‘Prejudice’ you may well think is self-explanatory but again I need to spell that out. That the act or omission is to a person’s prejudice if a financial advantage would be obtained from that person, and that advantage can be otherwise than by way of remuneration and that may be the result of a person having accepted a false instrument as genuine or a copy of a false instrument as a copy of a genuine one in connection with a person’s performance of a duty.” 
        
       
       
      Ground 1 – Misdirection? 
       
      
    23 The appellant makes various complaints under this ground of appeal. It was submitted that there was a misdirection with respect to the elements of the offence; that the evidence may support a different offence of “using” a false instrument, not “making” as charged; and that the evidence may support an offence in relation to a copy of a document provided by s 301 but not the offence as charged. 
     
      
    24 The appellant submitted that a reading of the totality of the trial judge’s directions to the jury indicates that he regarded Mr Preston as the victim of the false instrument whereas the person nominated as the person who was being induced to accept the instrument as genuine was Mr Hattersley. He submitted the statute speaks of inducing “the victim” to the prejudice of the “victim or another person.” Because Mr Preston was never deceived by Ex 1A, nor did he accept that it was genuine, it was submitted that the prosecution must fail. 
     
      
    25 If, as the appellant submitted, the jury would have understood his Honour’s reference to “another person” to be a reference to Mr Preston, to the exclusion of Mr Hattersley, a problem may have arisen. It was obvious that, in the ordinary sense, Mr Preston was the intended victim. It was no doubt for this reason that his Honour referred to Mr Preston as “the victim” when he gave his oral directions. But, in the course of those directions his Honour also correctly, identified that the Crown asserted that it was Mr Hattersley who the appellant intended to induce to accept the instrument as genuine.  
     
      
    26 In his opening address the Crown Prosecutor told the jury that the Crown case would be that the appellant used the instrument for the purpose of “inducing another person”, a “cost assessor”, to accept the instrument as genuine. Mr Hattersley was later named as the costs assessor. 
     
      
    27 In his closing address the Crown Prosecutor referred to document Ex 1A as “being produced” during the cost assessment process, to induce “another person, being the cost assessor”, to accept it as genuine and thereby act on it so that the accused would gain some financial advantage by a costs assessment in his favour. He referred to the “false instrument” as being produced to “induce the cost assessor to rely on it to the prejudice of Mr Preston”. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the file with Ex 1A on it was set up for Mr Hattersley to find. 
     
      
    28 The trial judge made comments in a similar vein in the summing up. His Honour referred to the need for the “false instrument” to induce another person, in this case Mr Hattersley, to accept it as genuine and rely on it to the prejudice of the victim, Mr Preston. His Honour referred to the need for the Crown to prove that the false instrument was made with the intent that it would be used by Mr Hattersley to make a cost assessment to the financial prejudice of Mr Preston. 
     
      
    29 The appellant’s submission extracted only part of the written direction. The opening paragraph under the heading “charge” was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Charge 
        
       
       
        
        That Leon Nikolaidis between 31 October, 1996 and 17 February, 1998 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did make false instrument, namely, a letter addressed to John Preston dated 19 April 1984, with the intention of using it, namely, to induce another person to accept the instrument as genuine and because of that acceptance to so do some act to the prejudice of John Preston.” 
        
       
      
    30 From the complete written directions, the submissions of counsel, together with his Honour’s remarks, the elements which the Crown was intending to prove must have been abundantly clear to all participants in the trial. The blemish pointed out in the appellant’s submission was not the subject of comment by anyone. The very experienced trial counsel who appeared for the appellant sought no redirection. I would refuse leave to raise this issue. 
     
      
    31 The appellant also complained that his Honour’s written direction with respect to intent was erroneous in so far as his Honour told the jury that a person may intend to bring about a result even if it was “not the purpose of their act”. It was submitted that this direction was wrong, it being necessary for the relevant act to have been done with the purpose/intention prohibited by the section. 
     
      
    32 It is clear from his Honour’s oral directions that his Honour provided the jury with appropriate assistance. His Honour told them that the offence required proof of a “double intention.” The jury must be satisfied that the appellant intended to induce another person to (a) accept the instrument as genuine and (b) because of that acceptance, to do or not do some act to the prejudice of that person or another. His Honour carefully directed the jury as to the elements of the offence. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Fourthly, would use the false instrument to induce another person – here Mr Hattersley – next, to accept the instrument as genuine. 
        
       
       
        
        Seventh, [sic] because of that acceptance to do or not to do some act; here the Crown alleges the act of the cost assessment. 
        
       
       
        
        Eight, [sic] to the prejudice of the victim – he is said to be, by the Crown, Mr Preston.” 
        
       
      
    33 The additional words in the written direction referred to in [31] above were unnecessary and may in some circumstances have been confusing. The distinction between the intention of the actor and the purposes for which they act may give rise to subtle and relevant distinctions. However, in the present case, the only conceivable purpose in creating the false document could have been to induce Mr Hattersley to rely on it to the ultimate prejudice of Mr Preston. The issue for the jury was whether the appellant had created a false instrument. If he had done so his intention was plain. I would refuse leave to raise this issue. 
     
      
       
      The false instrument 
       
      
    34 The appellant submitted that because Ex 1A was a carbon copy of an original letter it was not a “false instrument” within the meaning of the section. The submission accepted that although the original letter may have been false the copy was a true copy of that original document. It was submitted that a document is only relevantly false if it “tells a lie about itself” (see R v Ceylan (2002) 4 VR 208 at [18]; More v R (1988) 86 Cr App R 234) and because Ex 1A only purported to be a copy of another document there was no relevant “lie”. 
     
      
    35 The appellant emphasised that s 300 of the Crimes Act makes it an offence to make a false instrument with the relevant intent. However, s 301 makes it an offence, with the relevant intent, to make a copy of an instrument which a person knows to be a false instrument. Because Ex 1A was a copy of a letter, which was allegedly false, but not an original it was submitted the appellant could not have been indicted on an offence against s 300 but only an offence against s 301. 
     
      
    36 There is a fundamental problem with the appellant’s submission. Although Ex 1A is a copy document the Crown case was that the appellant’s intention was to create such a document, ie a copy document, by directing Ms Moffatt to type both an original and at the same time create the copy. Although Ex 1A is a copy of a false instrument, it is itself a false instrument. It was created, the Crown alleged, so that the file would include a copy letter evidencing the terms of the appellant’s retainer. His purpose was to create a false “copy letter” not a copy of a false letter. 
     
      
    37 The present case is similar to the circumstances in R v Ondhia [1998] 2 Cr App R 150 where the accused created false bills of lading and submitted facsimile copies of them to a supplier. He was charged pursuant to the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981 (UK) which provided in s 1 that “A person is guilty of forgery if he makes a false instrument, with the intention that he or another shall use it to induce somebody to accept it as genuine, and by reason of so accepting it to do or not to do some act to his own or any other person’s prejudice.” The prosecution alleged that the false instrument was the facsimile copy. 
     
      
    38 In that case the accused’s submission was to similar effect as that of the present appellant. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales rejected the argument pointing out that the focus of the section is on the intention of the accused at the time the document was made. The Court found that at the time the original document was made the accused had intended that a facsimile of it would go to the supplier who would treat it as a duplicate of the false original. 
     
      
    39 Although I would grant leave to raise this issue in my opinion the appellant’s argument must be rejected. The Crown case was that at the time Ms Moffatt typed the original document the appellant intended that she would create a carbon copy (Ex 1A) which would be placed on the file with the intention that Mr Hattersley would treat it as a true copy of a letter which had been sent to Mr Preston. Accordingly, if the jury accepted Ms Moffatt’s evidence the carbon copy was itself a false instrument within the meaning of s 300. 
     
      
       
      Making or using? 
       
      
    40 The appellant submitted that rather than the appellant it was Ms Moffatt who made the instrument. Although it was accepted that if Ms Moffatt was an innocent agent the appellant would be the maker of the document, it was submitted that, because she admitted lying to the investigator and sought and was granted a certificate pursuant to s 128 of the Evidence Act in respect of her evidence, she was not an innocent agent. Accordingly, it was submitted, the document was Ms Moffatt’s document. The appellant may have used it but, so it was submitted, could not be prosecuted for “making” the document. 
     
      
    41 To my mind the appellant’s submission is at odds with the known facts. On Ms Moffatt’s account she was called into the appellant’s office and told that he had a letter on tape for her to type. She was his secretary and was obliged to take direction from her employer. She originally typed the document as a draft on a computer and took the draft to the appellant. The appellant then made some changes and “settled” the letter. She was then directed to type the letter in final form using a typewriter and old letterhead and green paper for the copy. She did as she was instructed. 
     
      
    42 It is true that the evidence indicates that Ms Moffatt came to have considerable doubts about the appropriateness of the task she had performed. But she undertook that task as an employee. The evidence indicated that she questioned the appellant and asked him “why are you writing to John Preston now? You don’t act for him anymore.” She also expressed her concerns to Ms Middleton. She prudently sought to protect her position at the trial by seeking the s 128 certificate. However, none of these actions indicate that, as against the appellant, she was the maker of the instrument. It was never suggested at the trial, either to Ms Moffatt or to the jury that she was the maker of the instrument. I would refuse leave to raise this issue under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. 
     
      
       
      The trial judge’s directions with respect to the “false instrument” 
       
      
    43 The written directions with respect to “Prejudice” include a reference to both acceptance of a false instrument as genuine or “a copy of a false instrument as a copy of a genuine one.” The latter concept is relevant to an offence under s 301 where a copy is made of a false instrument with the intention that it be accepted as a copy of a genuine instrument. 
     
      
    44 Being a direction relevant only to an offence against s 301 it was submitted that his Honour misdirected the jury as to the appropriate meaning of “induce” and “prejudice.” However, the appellant’s submissions were framed with reference to written directions which, although prepared in draft were not given to the jury. The document given to the jury was appropriate in relation to “induce”, the appellant’s complaint being in respect of “prejudice”. Because the appellant was not charged with an offence under s 301 it was submitted that it was erroneous to direct the jury that they could return a conviction by a process of reasoning which was not relevant to a charge under s 300. 
     
      
    45 The trial judge provided the written directions to the jury and explained in his summing up the elements of the offence in a manner consistent with the written document. I have already included his Honour’s explanation of “prejudice” at [21]. 
     
      
    46 During the course of his summing up his Honour never returned to the detail of the written document and made no further reference to the statements in it in relation to “prejudice.” Significantly no complaint was made by defence counsel, who was greatly experienced in criminal practice. 
     
      
    47 The explanation for any lack of complaint is made apparent from a review of the addresses of counsel and the summing up of the trial judge. The essential issue at the trial did not relate to the intention of the appellant in creating the instrument. If as the Crown alleged the appellant had created a false instrument, being a copy letter which he had then placed into an old file, his intention was obvious. The intention was to induce Mr Hattersley to accept the copy letter as a genuine document so that he would rule in the appellant’s favour in respect of the allowable billing rate. The only question of any significance was whether the jury were persuaded that the appellant directed that the copy letter be created between 1996 and 1998 or whether it was created in the ordinary course of business in April 1984. 
     
      
    48 It was no doubt because the issues were confined in this manner that defence counsel at the trial raised no concerns that the written direction included matters only relevant to an offence against s 301. I would refuse leave to raise this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    49 I agree with Simpson J’s analysis and conclusion in relation to the issue to which she gives the sub-heading “Prejudice”. 
     
      
    50 In the ultimate I would grant leave to raise only one issue under this ground of the appeal and would reject that ground. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2(a) 
       
      
    51 The appellant did not raise his character during the trial. In fact his counsel indicated to the trial judge prior to him giving evidence that he would not be seeking a good character direction. 
     
      
    52 When Mr Preston gave evidence he referred to proceedings which were heard by Bell J referred to as the “Down to Earth Spring Water” case. When cross-examined Mr Preston said that in that case “Mr Nikolaidis lied in court.” Shortly thereafter he added “[Bell J] found that Mr Nikolaidis had no instructions at all from any directors to drop our claim without telling us.” 
     
      
    53 The claim made by Mr Preston that the appellant had “lied” was not supported by the findings of Bell J. 
     
      
    54 During the trial the prosecutor was granted leave to cross-examine Mr Zwar regarding matters raised for the first time in his evidence. An application was made pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act and, although defence counsel objected, leave was granted. One of the issues which the Crown Prosecutor indicated he proposed to raise was an allegation by Mr Preston that the appellant had misappropriated $5,000 from him.  
     
      
    55 The Crown Prosecutor obtained evidence from Mr Zwar that there had been a complaint to the Law Society that the appellant had misappropriated the $5,000. He was asked about inspections by Law Society investigators in relation to various allegations. It was submitted before this Court that the raising of these matters at the trial gave rise to an unfair inference which could be drawn by the jury that the allegation was soundly based because an investigation had been carried out. The cross-examination covered other matters of the appellant’s professional practice including the state of his files, the keeping of accounts, charge out rates from 1984 onwards, complaints made to the Law Society, the taking of accounts, the process of assessment of costs and whether debtor ledgers were missing. The cross-examination occupies 90 pages of trial transcript. 
     
      
    56 It was submitted that the cross-examination went further than should have been allowed and caused the trial to miscarry. It was submitted that it reflected a departure from the necessary restraint required of a crown prosecutor whose purpose must be the attaining of justice and not merely the securing of convictions. It was submitted that the trial went “out of hand” in the manner envisaged by Street CJ in R v Stalder [1981] 2 NSWLR 9 and was sidetracked by collateral issues. The appellant emphasised that the trial judge referred to the alleged misappropriation on 7 occasions during the summing-up. It was submitted that his Honour made matters worse when he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “All the evidence about the $5,000 … are matters for you to determine.” 
        
       
      
    57 It was submitted that the ultimate effect of this cross-examination was to raise as an issue that the appellant was of bad character. It was submitted that the cross-examination constituted a sustained attack on the appellant’s bona fides and fitness to practice as a solicitor and was not justified under s 112 of the Evidence Act because the good character of the appellant had not been raised by the defence and leave had not been sought to do so. It was further submitted that the evidence adduced in cross-examination of the Crown witnesses did not tend to prove that such a witness had a tendency to be untruthful as contemplated by s 104(4)(b) of the Evidence Act such as would permit the Crown Prosecutor to cross-examine on matters relevant to the credibility of the appellant without first seeking leave pursuant to s 112(2). 
     
      
    58 Although Mr Zwar was called by the Crown, a perusal of his transcript suggests that his evidence was in some respects favourable to the appellant. When granting the application pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act the trial judge observed that, although it would be inappropriate to conclude that Mr Zwar was in the appellant’s camp, it was apparent that he was giving evidence which was favourable to the appellant “not just on this matter but on a number of other matters relating to Ms Moffat and Mr Preston.” 
     
      
    59 In his evidence in chief when he was asked by the Crown about the file on which Ex 1A was found - referred to as the “Citicorp file” - Mr Zwar volunteered that he had some involvement with Citicorp in relation to an allegation by Mr Preston that the appellant had stolen $5,000. Defence counsel did not intervene when the answer was given. When asked by the prosecutor whether he had cause to go to the file Mr Zwar again referred to the matter of the alleged missing $5,000. Instead of merely indicating that he had cause to go to the file he said that he did this “to try and deal with the issue of the missing $5,000.” Again no intervention was made by defence counsel. 
     
      
    60 Subsequently, in the course of his cross-examination of Mr Zwar defence counsel raised the matter himself. His apparent purpose was to discredit Mr Preston. He put to Mr Zwar that Mr Preston had made a “litany of complaints” against the appellant’s firm, that Mr Zwar had dealt with the litany of complaints and that the Law Society had become involved and sent investigators to the firm, who had gone through the firm like “a packet of salts”. It was further put to him that a qualified accountant had established that the allegation in relation to the $5,000 was baseless. It was put that the allegation of the “pinching” of the $5,000 had proved, after investigation, to be “a fantasy” and that “there was no basis for it.” Later in response to a leading question from defence counsel Mr Zwar agreed that Mr Preston was “pretty good at making threats” by answering “very good.” 
     
      
    61 From these exchanges it would seem that defence counsel was content to have the issues raised in Mr Zwar’s evidence before the jury. His tactic is apparent and could have been effective. The defence sought to use the evidence that Mr Preston had repeatedly complained about the appellant’s integrity, but the complaints were shown to be without foundation to discredit Mr Preston in a manner which would effectively bolster the appellant’s integrity, making it less likely that he had committed the alleged offence. 
     
      
    62 Although the pursuit of these issues by the Crown took an excessive length of time I do not believe it caused the trial to miscarry. The appellant obtained the benefit of evidence vindicating his position which was to his advantage. I would refuse leave to raise this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2(b) 
       
      
    63 During the course of the trial an issue arose with respect to the appellant’s knowledge of the whereabouts of Ms Sybil Burden who was a potential Crown witness at the appellant’s previous trial in May 2005. Ms Burden was a former employee of the appellant’s firm. 
     
      
    64 Evidence was led that the appellant had given at his former trial in relation to this issue. That evidence was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: When was the last time you saw the lady? 
         
        A: About – about 1985. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q Since these Preston matters came to light have you tried to find this woman? 
         
        A. I have tried to identify her last name, and the closest I got was Barton, Burton, and I was informed of that by my mother basically. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Have you been able to locate her? 
         
        A. No.” 
        
       
      
    65 It was put to the appellant at his later trial that when he gave evidence on this issue he lied. The prosecutor put to him: it was a “straight out lie you told the court.” The appellant responded indicating that the answers he had given at his previous trial were truthful. He said that he had contacted Ms Burden in about April 2002 but was unable to ascertain which law firm she then worked for. He said that he was not then aware of Ms Burden’s home address or telephone number. The appellant said that after he had spoken with Ms Burden on the phone he tried to reconnect with her but she had left her employment and could not be located. The Crown Prosecutor put to him that he did not mention these matters when he gave evidence on the prior occasion. The appellant replied that he was not asked. The prosecutor then put to the appellant that this was “another of those fine distinctions” between the meaning of locate and contact and that he was “trying to be a bit deceptive with the court”. 
     
      
    66 This cross-examination of the appellant was not objected to by trial counsel. It was submitted on the appeal that the whole subject of cross-examination “on this issue was fraught with difficulty and the Crown Prosecutor seeking to suggest that the appellant having lied on oath in the previous trial was, in the circumstances, highly prejudicial. The state of the evidence did not support such a proposition and was devoid of any merit, particularly so when the character of the appellant was not being put in issue.” 
     
      
    67 I am not persuaded that the appellant’s criticism of this line of cross-examination was justified. It was apparent from his evidence that the appellant was able to contact Ms Burden by telephone and had done so. It was also apparent that he had sent her a facsimile. In cross-examination he suggested that being able to “locate her” meant that he did not know where she was. The prosecutor’s assertion that this evidence involved “a fine distinction” and was a “bit deceptive” was not inappropriate. 
     
      
    68 Ms Burden was a significant witness. She said that the first occasion on which she spoke to a police officer about the letter was when she was contacted in March 2006 by Detective Winter. Detective Winter said that he first became involved in the investigation in 2002 and had sought to locate Ms Burden. However, he had been given the name Sybil Burton or Sybil Barton. When he was given the correct name he was able to successfully locate her. She was working with Holman Webb, a firm of city solicitors. 
     
      
    69 It was apparent that Ms Burden’s evidence may have been unfavourable to the appellant. As it happened this was not the case. However, there was reason for the appellant to fear the evidence which she might give and in the circumstances the suggestion that he had been untruthful in relation to his efforts to find her was legitimate. I would refuse leave to raise this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 
       
      
    70 The evidence of “complaint” by Ms Moffatt to Ms Middleton was led by the Crown without objection. That “complaint” was made in about November 1998 which was two years after the earlier date alleged in the indictment and some 9 months after the latter date. When she gave evidence Ms Moffatt did not recall the terms of the complaint that she made to Ms Middleton. I have included the relevant evidence at [16] above. 
     
      
    71 It was submitted by the appellant that the evidence of this belated “complaint” would have provided in the mind of the jury a significant evidentiary link in the mosaic of the evidence led by the Crown as to who was responsible, if not the appellant, for the creation of the document. It was submitted that the evidence of Ms Middleton would have buttressed the credibility of the evidence given by Ms Moffatt. In these circumstances it was submitted that the evidence should not have been led or, in the alternative, leave of the Court pursuant to s 108(3) of the Evidence Act, incorporating the provisions of s 192, should have been obtained prior to leading this evidence. It was further submitted that the evidence of Ms Middleton was objectionable by reference to the span of dates on the indictment as it fell well outside the last date referred to. 
     
      
    72 It was submitted that, if the issue had been considered at the trial, some of the considerations raised by s 192 of the Evidence Act would have required rejection of the evidence. It was submitted that the evidence was properly categorised as evidence of a prior consistent statement rather than as evidence of a belated complaint. Being hearsay and, so it was submitted, not “fresh” it was submitted the evidence should have been rejected (s 59(1) and s 66(2)). It was further submitted that none of the exceptions to the credibility rule provided by s 108 of the Evidence Act were engaged so as to justify the admission of the evidence. 
     
      
    73 As I have related when Ms Moffatt gave evidence she said that she had been instructed by the appellant to prepare Ex 1A. She said that she had typed the letter some time between November 1996 and June 1998. She recalled stressful circumstances surrounding a conversation with Ms Middleton but was unable to recall any details.  
     
      
    74 Ms Moffatt was cross-examined. It was suggested to her by defence counsel that the allegation she made in respect of the appellant was false. Read as a whole her cross-examination did more than challenge Ms Moffatt’s account of the alleged events. There can be no doubt that an allegation of deliberate fabrication was made. 
     
      
    75 The following question was put to Ms Moffatt by defence counsel: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: What I am putting to you is that you were never requested by the accused to do what you have described. What do you say about that? 
         
        A: I say I was requested. I was instructed by the accused to type that letter.” 
        
       
      
    76 Ms Moffatt was asked about her dealings with Mr Preston. She was also asked about a telephone call with the appellant where it was suggested she had asked him to repay the mortgage on her home and it was put to her that she had told the appellant she had been speaking with Mr Preston and that the things she was able to tell Mr Preston “would do you some harm”: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. … You did telephone the accused after you’d left his employ, didn’t you? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Are you sure of that? 
         
        A. I’m quite sure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What I put to you is that on 9 October 2001 you telephoned and you spoke to the accused. You deny that, do you? 
         
        A. I deny that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I’m going to put to you now a narrative of the conversation, and if I go too quickly would you please stop me, do you understand? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. ‘This is Jan here.’ 
         
        ‘Why did you leave in the way that you did?’ 
         
          
          ‘I’ve been a faithful and hard-working employee, secretary, and you’ve underpaid me for the work that I’ve done. I think it’s time you paid me what you owe me.’ 
           
          ‘If you’re talking about your holiday pay, I think what you are owed in holiday pay is cancelled out by the loan that we made to you that has not been repaid.’ 
          
         
        ‘I think you should repay the mortgage on my house.’ 
         
        ‘What are you talking about?’ 
         
          
          ‘$100,000 may not mean a lot to you, but it means a lot to me. You owe me that. I’ve worked hard as a hard-working secretary and it’s the least that you could do in view of the time and effort that I’ve put in. I think you should know that I’ve been talking to Mr Preston and others. I can tell Mr Preston a lot of things about you that would do you some harm. You know that Mr Preston wants to see you struck off and in gaol and I can tell him what he needs, what he wants to hear. Think about that and let me know.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did that conversation take place? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But you’d agree that $100,000 odd would have been helpful to you, wouldn’t it? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And if in fact this telephone conversation did take place on 9 October 2001, it would have been three days after you saw Mr Tom Hawthorn [an investigator with the NSW Law Society] on the Central Coast at your parents’ home? 
         
        A. The telephone conversation did not take place.” 
        
       
      
    77 Ms Moffatt was also cross-examined with respect to conversations which were alleged to have occurred between her and George Voulgaropoulos (who gave evidence under the name of George Garrop). Mr Voulgaropoulos worked at the appellant’s firm as an IT specialist between July 1996 and January 2007. The following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Further in conversation with George Voulgaropoulos he said to you, ‘How is the Preston dispute running?’ You said, ‘It’s become more serious and Preston is now alleging that Leon backdated the letter which is his costs agreement.’ He said to you, ‘Leon wouldn’t do anything like that’, and you said, ‘Leon didn’t even know the letter existed. It was found by accident when Michael Zwar was running the costs assessment with the cost assessor. Michael runs the Preston dispute, Leon does not have to know about it. This Preston dispute is not all bad because if a girl plays her cards right not only will I have my employment guaranteed but I might also have an unplanned superannuation plan.’ Did you say that? 
         
        A. Most definitely not. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I put it to you that he said to you ‘How would that be?’ And you said, ‘Just think about it. This dispute has been running during the entire time I’ve been in the office. I only have to say that I typed the letter and Leon is fucked.’ Did you say that? 
         
        A. Definitely not. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I put it to you that he said to you, ‘Why would you do that?’ And you said, ‘I wouldn’t. But Leon is smart enough to know that I know all there is to know about the Preston dispute. I’ve had it in my face ever since I’ve been here. Preston hates Leon with a passion. He will do anything to cause Leon problems. I’m sure he would pay me a king’s ransom to say something that would hurt Leon’. Did you say that? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you ever approach Mr Preston for payment of any monies? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he ever offer you any monies? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I put it to you that Mr Voulgaropoulos replied, ‘I think Leon completely trusts you. Why would you do such a thing?’ And you said, ‘I wouldn’t do anything like that but it’s nice to know that if I have a problem I can call upon my superannuation plan.’ Did you say that? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Mr Voulgaropoulos said to you, ‘Jan, for you to do something like that would mean you’d have to give evidence that you typed a letter when you know you haven’t.’ And you said, ‘That would never happen because if I had to call upon my superannuation plan Leon would just give me a few dollars for me to go way quietly. He’s got so much money he would never miss fifty or a hundred grand but fifty or a hundred grand to me is a king’s ransom and could make a huge difference to my life.’ Did you say that? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did he respond, ‘Surely you wouldn’t consider doing something like that’, and you said, ‘No I wouldn’t. Only if the need arose.’ You then said to George Voulgaropoulos, ‘George, this conversation is strictly confidential. You won’t give me up, will you?’ And he said, ‘Of course I wouldn’t.’ Now in March of 2000 there was a problem in the office concerning the stealing of money. Do you recollect that? 
         
        A. I recollect an occasion. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It was Mrs Nikolaidis alleged that she left rent money sitting on the desk in her office, and she did have an office of her own, didn’t she? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. She went to another area in the office where she kept deposit books in the safe and when she returned she saw you were walking out of the office and the money was gone. Do you recollect that accusation? 
         
        A. No. I’m sure, Mr Conomos, that with Mrs Nikolaidis if anything went wrong in the office she would deal with it on the spot. If that had happened Mrs Nikolaidis would have spoken to me straight away and it certainly did not happen.” 
        
       
      
    78 The essential thrust of the cross-examination was that Ms Moffatt had fabricated her account of the events in the hope of extracting a financial benefit from the appellant. 
     
      
    79 Section 108(3) of the Evidence Act provides that notwithstanding the credibility rule evidence of a prior consistent statement of a witness is admissible “with the leave of the court if”: 
     
      
       
        
        “(b) it is … suggested (either expressly or by implication) that evidence given by the witness has been fabricated … (whether deliberately or otherwise) …” 
        
       
      
    80 The question of leave to admit Ms Middleton’s evidence was not raised by either party at the trial. Her evidence occupies one page of transcript and defence counsel did not ask one question of her. Ultimately he sought to use Ms Middleton’s evidence to the appellant’s advantage. When addressing the jury counsel said of Ms Middleton’s evidence, clearly accepting it, that its significance was that in that conversation Ms Moffatt did not give Ms Middleton “any specifics”. Having left the conversation unchallenged the jury were being asked to conclude that although Ms Moffatt spoke to Ms Middleton this was in furtherance of her fabricated account of the relevant events. 
     
      
    81 The Crown submitted that the evidence was tendered pursuant to s 108(3). It was submitted that if leave had been sought at the trial it would inevitably have been granted. It was submitted that when Ms Moffatt was cross-examined counsel suggested that her evidence was fabricated and that she had effectively sought to blackmail the appellant. Although it was not suggested to her in terms that she had fabricated her evidence this was the only inference available. 
     
      
    82 It was submitted by the appellant that the evidence would have been rejected because it did not amount to a prior consistent statement. It was submitted that because of the lack of specificity and particularity in Ms Middleton’s evidence there was a question as to whether her account was consistent with the evidence of Ms Moffatt. It was submitted that Ms Moffatt may have been speaking about some other document. 
     
      
    83 In my judgment the appellant’s submission should be rejected. The account Ms Middleton gives of Ms Moffatt telling her of her concern about being asked to prepare a false document is consistent with the sequence of events in respect of which Ms Moffatt gave evidence. Although a particular document was not identified the sequence of events described is such that it may be inferred that if the jury accepted Ms Middleton’s evidence she was recounting a conversation with Ms Moffatt which related to Ex 1A. 
     
      
    84 With respect to the criteria provided by s 192 of the Evidence Act it is plain that Ms Middleton’s evidence was short. There is no suggestion at the trial that the receipt of the evidence was unfair. The appellant’s counsel did not object to it and I cannot ascertain any basis upon which unfairness could now be suggested. The significance of the evidence was high, in that Ms Moffatt was the critical Crown witness who was subjected to a very significant challenge. If Ms Middleton’s evidence was accepted it was supportive of Ms Moffatt. 
     
      
    85 It was submitted that considerations arising under s 135 and s 137 would lead to the exclusion of the evidence. It was submitted that because the conversation allegedly occurred sometime after the period in which it is alleged the offence was committed its probative value would be diminished (see Leung v R (2003) 144 A Crim R 441 at [82]-[83]). It was further submitted that a prior consistent statement may not answer the suggestion of fabrication (see R v BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131 at 140-141). It was further submitted that a consideration relevant to the grant of leave would be the fact that Ms Moffatt could not give evidence of the content of the discussion (see Leung at [86]).  
     
      
    86 In my judgment these matters would not have led to the exclusion of the evidence if leave had been sought. Although the alleged conversation occurred sometime after the offence the concerns of Ms Moffatt were such that the primary events were likely to be impressed upon her memory. If it occurred the request made by the appellant was entirely unusual, enhancing the reliability of Ms Moffatt’s account. Although by the time of the trial she did not recall the detail of the conversation with Ms Middleton this was not surprising. Although that conversation would have been memorable so far as Ms Middleton was concerned (it would have been an extraordinary occasion) it would have been but one of a series of apparently traumatic events for Ms Moffatt. 
     
      
    87 Accordingly I am satisfied that if the prosecution had sought leave to lead Ms Middleton’s evidence at the trial that leave would have been granted. The fact that her evidence was admitted without objection has not occasioned a miscarriage of justice. I would refuse leave to raise this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    88 For these reasons in my opinion the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Sentence 
       
      
    89 The appellant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 12 months with a balance of term of 12 months. The maximum penalty for the offence is 10 years imprisonment.  
     
      
    90 I have already set out the details of the offence. The appellant was convicted on the fourth occasion the matter went to trial. The first two trials were not completed for different reasons. The third trial took place in February 2006 when the jury was unable to agree. 
     
      
    91 The sentencing judge found that the offence involved a direction by the appellant to a trusted employee to prepare a false document. He permitted the letter to be used with the expectation that it would induce Mr Hattersley to award costs at a higher level. His Honour found that this was a serious attempt to subvert the Supreme Court costs assessment process. His Honour found that the offence involved considerable planning and that Ms Moffatt suffered considerable distress by reason of the position in which the appellant had placed her. 
     
      
    92 It was submitted by the appellant’s counsel to the sentencing judge that the offender had involved himself in a single act of criminality, a stupid isolated act which would inevitably be discovered. His Honour rejected this submission finding that the appellant engaged in a continuous course of conduct with the ultimate intention that it would deceive Mr Hattersley. His Honour concluded that the criminality was within the mid-range of objective seriousness and gravity. 
     
      
    93 The appellant had no prior convictions and the sentencing judge was mindful of the evidence of his good character. Because the appellant denied the offence his Honour found there was no evidence of remorse and nothing which would indicate any prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    94 His Honour referred to various decisions where professional persons had been sentenced for a breach of trust. These authorities recognise that a solicitor, accountant or company director who abuses a position of trust must be sentenced so that other professional persons will be deterred from similar conduct (R v Pont (2001) 121 A Crim R 302 at [46]-[55]; R v Smith (2000) 114 A Crim R 8). When a professional abuses a position of trust they diminish public confidence in the entire profession. 
     
      
    95 His Honour considered a number of decisions where solicitors had wrongly taken money from their clients. When this occurs a gaol sentence is common: see Pont and R v Marvin (NSWCCA, 1 November 1995, unreported). 
     
      
    96 The principles to which his Honour referred are undoubted. A professional person, such as a solicitor is placed in a special position of trust. When that trust is abused the standing of the entire profession is compromised. Offences committed by professional persons in these circumstances merit sentences calculated to ensure that other professional persons will be left in no doubt as to the serious consequences that will follow (Pont at [47]). 
     
      
    97 The appellant was aged 52 at the time of sentencing and is now 53 years of age. He is married with two children. He was admitted as a legal practitioner in 1975 and became a partner in his father’s law firm in 1984. 
     
      
    98 Evidence was given by a number of persons who confirmed his professional expertise and in their experience his appropriate regard to the standards of personal and professional conduct expected of a solicitor. 
     
      
    99 His Honour accepted that the appellant should be sentenced as a person of prior good character but because of an absence of remorse concluded that he would require a longer than normal period of supervision. His Honour was mindful of the fact that there is presently an application before the Legal Services Commission to have the appellant removed from the roll of legal practitioners. It is almost inevitable, as his Honour found, that as a result of his conviction the appellant will lose his capacity to practice as a solicitor. 
     
      
    100 The appellant submitted to this Court that by reason of the repetition in his Honour’s remarks of the fact that the appellant had not admitted his guilt his Honour has given inappropriate weight to that matter. It was submitted that a fair reading of his Honour’s remarks indicates that his Honour considered the failure to admit his guilt to be an aggravating feature of the offence rather than confining its relevance to the issues of remorse and contrition. It was submitted that this difficulty is most apparent in his Honour’s discussion of the significance of the decision in Law Society of NSW v Carol Foreman (1994) 34 NSWLR 408 where a solicitor had admitted her dishonesty. The sentencing judge remarked that “[here] Mr Nikolaidis still denies the offence.” With respect to the matter of acknowledgment of wrong doing his Honour stated that such was “a factor which is not present with Mr Nikolaidis.” 
     
      
    101 Although it is correct that his Honour emphasised the fact that the appellant has not accepted his guilt I do not believe he impermissibly allowed this fact to influence the sentence. His Honour recognised appropriately that this fact reflected a lack of remorse and contrition. 
     
      
    102 As I have related his Honour rejected the submission that the appellant engaged in a single act of criminality. The appellant submitted that this was an error. It must be remembered that the appellant’s criminal act was the creation of the document. He was not charged with the offence pursuant to s 300(2) of using the false instrument. The use of an instrument may involve, as his Honour found, persistent and repeated criminal acts. 
     
      
    103 Although there is some force in the appellant’s submission it was nevertheless appropriate for his Honour to consider the context in which the offence occurred. Although the act of creating the false document was a single act the fact that he involved other persons in his offending conduct and intended that the document would be used to deceive Mr Hattersley to the detriment of Mr Preston were all factors relevant to the objective criminality of his offence. By identifying these matters the sentencing judge did not commit any error. 
     
      
    104 With respect to the issue of rehabilitation as I have indicated, in the absence of remorse, his Honour was not prepared to accept that there were good prospects of rehabilitation. Because there is a strong likelihood that the appellant will lose his practicing certificate, and in light of the finding of prior good character it was submitted to this Court that it was most unlikely that the appellant would re-offend and accordingly had good prospects of rehabilitation. Although this submission must be accepted it is of minimal relevance. The fact that an opportunity to re-offend may not be available does not mean that the appellant has an insight into his offending behaviour. 
     
      
    105 The sentencing judge considered, as he was required to do, sentencing options other than a period of full time custody. He concluded that there was no option but to sentence the appellant to a period of full time imprisonment. His particular reasons for this conclusion are not apparent although it would seem that his Honour was guided by the decisions in R v Hovan [2005] NSWCCA 179 and R v Vincent Cofini (NSWCCA, 4 March 1997, unreported). Both these cases involved a solicitor obtaining funds to which they were not entitled. In Hovan the solicitor committed 3 offences: the first against s 178BB of the Crimes Act and a further 2 offences against s 300(1) and (2). The first offence involved an application for a loan which stated a false purpose and the latter two offences were committed whilst the offender was on bail for the first charge and in an attempt to avoid payment of the solicitor’s legal costs to a receiver appointed to his practice. In Cofini the solicitor committed three offences against s 300(2) and a further six offences were included on a Form 2. The solicitor purported to witness a signature of a fictitious individual as a guarantor on an indemnity document, the deception being practised on the St George Bank. The solicitor also changed the wording on a document signed by another solicitor and that document was submitted to the bank. In all, the bank acting on the documents lost $1.4 million. 
     
      
    106 In Hovan the solicitor was re-sentenced on the appeal to a fixed term of 6 months on the first charge and on the second and third to concurrent terms of 2½ years with a non-parole period of 12 months. In Cofini the solicitor was sentenced to concurrent terms of 2 years imprisonment with a minimum term of 1 year. 
     
      
    107 I have already referred to the decision in Foreman. In that case, which bears similarities to the present case, the solicitor altered an internal time sheet to show, falsely, that a cost agreement had been provided to a client. However, the solicitor was not prosecuted for a criminal offence although in civil proceedings was found guilty of professional misconduct, fined $20,000 and had her name removed from the roll of practising solicitors. 
     
      
    108 The offence which the appellant committed occurred approximately ten years ago. He was first charged on 6 August 2002 and by reason of the operation of the criminal justice system was not convicted until 22 August 2007. It is true, as the appellant submitted, that he has, for an unusually long time, been left in a position of uncertainty in circumstances which would undoubtedly have been stressful for him and his family. However, his Honour recognised these matters as relevant to the appropriate sentence: see DPP v Hamman (NSWCCA, 1 December 1998, unreported) and R v Kukunoski (NSWCCA, 17 August 1989, unreported); cf R v Bragias (1997) 92 A Crim R 330 per Grove J. 
     
      
    109 In my opinion the appellant’s conduct was a serious breach of the trust placed in him as a solicitor. By his dishonest conduct he intended to deceive Mr Hattersley to the detriment of Mr Preston. Whatever may have been the personal animosity between Mr Preston and the appellant and whatever be the true situation with respect to their commercial dealings his conduct requires the imposition of a term of imprisonment. The sentence imposed was within the appropriate range. 
     
      
    110 Although I would grant leave to appeal against the sentence that appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
       
      2. Leave granted to appeal against sentence. 
       
      3. Appeal against sentence dismissed. 
       
      
    111 SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL. I agree that the appeal against conviction ought to be dismissed. What follows are my reasons for coming to that view. I do not propose to restate the facts. 
     
      
    112 The final addresses were notable for their utter simplicity and the commendable (and realistic) economy with which they were presented. Trial defence counsel recognised, correctly, that only one issue existed for the jury to determine: that was whether the document exhibit 1A came into existence or was created as alleged by Ms Moffatt in her evidence. If the jury accepted that, then conviction of the appellant was inevitable.  
     
      
    113 Defence counsel’s final address is transcribed in less than 14 pages. That is because of the narrowness of the issue the jury had to decide. Counsel focused upon that issue. He concentrated his attention upon an attempt (which proved unsuccessful) to undermine the credibility of the Crown witnesses, especially Ms Moffatt and Mr Preston.  
     
      
    114 The same simplicity and economy were not present throughout the trial. Notwithstanding the narrowness of the issues and the simplicity with which they were, in this trial, put to the jury, this was the fourth time the appellant had been indicted on this charge. The first trial was aborted, on application by the Crown, because of a failure to issue subpoenae. Two juries were discharged without verdict because they were unable to agree. 
     
      
    115 In fact, the Crown case hinged on the evidence of Ms Moffatt, although some support for her evidence was given by expert document examiners, and by, for example, Ms Middleton. Ms Moffatt gave a detailed account of how the document was created, under clear and express instructions from the appellant. The appellant denied that he had given those instructions. 
     
      
    116 The charge was brought under s 300 of the Crimes Act 1900. That section is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “300. Making or using false instruments 
        
       
       
        
        (1) A person who makes a false instrument, with the intention that he or she, or another person, will use it to induce another person:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) to accept the instrument as genuine, and 
        
       
      
    (b) because of that acceptance, to do or not do some act to that person’s, or to another person’s, prejudice, 
     
      
       
        
         
        is liable to imprisonment for 10 years. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) A person who uses an instrument which is, and which the person knows to be, false, with the intention of inducing another person:  
         
         
        (a) to accept the instrument as genuine, and 
         
         
        (b) because of that acceptance, to do or not do some act to that other person’s, or to another person’s, prejudice, 
         
         
        is liable to imprisonment for 10 years.” 
        
       
      
    117 The section contains within it some alternatives. It envisages that the false instrument might be used either by the person who makes it (person A) or by another person (person B); and that that person will use the instrument to induce a third person (person C) to accept it as genuine and act on it (positively or negatively) to the prejudice either of person C, or a fourth person (person D). 
     
      
    118 The charge against the appellant was formulated as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “That Leon Nikolaidis between 31 October, 1996 and 17 February, 1998 at Sydney … did make false instrument, namely … with the intention of using it, namely, to induce another person to accept the instrument as genuine and because of that acceptance to so (sic) do some act to the prejudice of John Preston.”  
        
       
      
    119 As formulated, the charge imposed on the Crown the burden of proving that the appellant made the false instrument; and that he did so with the intention of using it himself to induce another person (Mr Hattersley) to act on it to the prejudice of Mr Preston. 
     
      
    120 If the jury were persuaded that the appellant had given the instructions to Ms Moffatt as she claimed, it was inevitable that they would infer that he had done so with the intention of using the resulting document (the false instrument) by placing it in one of the Preston files, where it would be found by Mr Hattersley, to induce Mr Hattersley to act on it (by giving a favourable costs assessment) to Mr Preston’s prejudice. It was this inevitability that trial counsel recognised, and he thus focused upon the fundamental fact – the credibility of Ms Moffatt’s evidence. 
     
      
    121 The grounds of appeal have been set out in the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL. It is unnecessary to repeat them. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1:  
       
      
    122 In the appellant’s written submissions ground 1 is divided into three strands, outlined as: 
     
      
       
        
        “(i) contended misdirection on the elements; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) the evidence supports a different offence of using a false instrument, not making as charged; and 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) the evidence may support an offence in relation to a copy of the document under s 301 of the  
        Crimes Act  
        1900.” 
        
       
      
    123 The ground as it was argued concerns both the written and the oral directions. As effectively reframed in the written submission, the ground goes beyond any issue of directions (or “instruction”), and raises fundamental issues as to the adequacy of the evidence to support the charge on the indictment. 
     
      
       
      Directions 
       
      
    124 In the circumstances I have outlined above, there was hardly a need for the jury to be given written directions. I would not wish anything I am about to say to be interpreted as discouraging, in appropriate cases, the use of written directions. As criminal trials become increasingly complex, both as to legal and factual issues, written directions play a vital role in assisting juries to understand and recall the issues they have to determine. It is frequently too much to expect juries to absorb and recall and apply the complex directions they are given orally. They deserve the assistance they can obtain from written outlines of complex legal and factual issues. 
     
      
    125 But it is not every case that calls for that approach. This was a case that could well have been conducted without written directions. That is because of the simplicity of the trial and the narrowness of the issues actually litigated. 
     
      
    126 There would, however, have been no necessary error in giving the jury written directions. The difficulty in this case is that the directions given raised false issues, and were, in one respect, wrong. 
     
      
    127 I digress in order to deal with a misunderstanding that emerges from the appellant’s submissions in the appeal. 
     
      
    128 Two versions of written directions were before this Court. One is of two pages, one of three pages. I am satisfied that it is the two-page document that was the document given to the jury. Two circumstances persuade me of that. One is that the two-page document bears a “marked for identification” stamp. It is in fact marked for identification 22. The transcript shows (T712) that, after discussion with counsel about the written directions, the trial judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I will mark that document on the elements as an MFI exhibit so there is no mistake about that …” 
        
       
      
    129 The transcript does not then reveal the number given to the document; however, at p698 another document was marked for identification numbered 21, and at T737 another was marked for identification numbered 23. Secondly, at the conclusion of the summing up his Honour took the jury through the copies of the document that they had already been given. What he there said about the document is consistent with MFI 22, but not the three-page document: for example, he referred to lettering of the paragraphs, which exists on MFI 22 but not the three-page document; he referred to the direction on “intent” as appearing on the bottom of page one and going over to page two. That is true of MFI 22, but not of the three-page document, on which the direction on “intent” is complete on the first page. It is most likely that the three-page document was an initial draft (either of the judge, or proposed by the Crown) that underwent some revision before emerging as MFI 22. There are variations in content. 
     
      
    130 The submissions filed on behalf of the appellant proceeded on the basis that it was the three-page document that was before the jury. I am satisfied that that is a misconception. The written directions in MFI 22, and lengthy excerpts from the oral directions, are set out in the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL. I do not propose to repeat them all.  
     
      
    131 In MFI 22, under the heading “Elements”, the following appeared: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown must prove each and every one of these matters beyond reasonable doubt before the jury could find the accused guilty of the charge: 
        
       
       
        
        1. The accused 
        
       
       
        
        2. made a false instrument; 
        
       
       
        
        3. with intent that the accused or another person; 
        
       
       
        
        4. would use the false instrument; 
        
       
       
        
        5. to induce another person; 
        
       
       
        
        6. to accept the instrument as genuine; and 
        
       
       
        
        7. because of that acceptance, to do, or not do, some act; 
        
       
       
        
        8. to the prejudice of the victim (Preston).” 
        
       
      
    132 The item numbered 3. is unhelpful. The Crown case, as disclosed in the statement of the charge, was that it was the appellant who would use the false instrument. It was potentially confusing and misleading to include the reference to “or another person”. That was not the Crown case. The transcript records that, in elaborating orally on the direction, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The third element is that with the intent of (sic – that) the accused or another person would use,  
        and here the Crown relies on it being another person 
        .” (italics added) 
        
       
       
      This was simply wrong, and reflects a misunderstanding of the Crown case. It confuses “use” and “induce”. What the Crown alleged was that the appellant would use the document to induce another person (Mr Hattersley) to behave in a particular way. Although s 300(1) contemplates an offence of making a false instrument with the intention that a second person would use it, that is not the way the Crown put its case. 
       
      
    133 MFI 22 contained the following explanation of “making a false instrument”: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        B 
        .  
        Made 
         - a person is to be treated as making a false instrument if the person alters an instrument so as to make it false in any respect (whether or not it is false in some other respect apart from that alteration). 
        
       
      
    134 The oral direction was: 
     
      
       
        
        “(SU 12, AB 18 – 19) Those elements are: firstly, that it was the accused; secondly, who made the false instrument, and I have given you a definition of what ‘made’ means in this circumstance … The term ‘made’ has the meaning that a person is treated as having made the false instrument if it alters the instrument to make it false in any respect.” 
        
       
      
    135 The directions were irrelevant and did not bear upon any issue raised at the trial. No question of alteration of the document ever arose. The directions must have been confusing at best. 
     
      
    136 MFI 22 contained the following with respect to “intent”: 
     
      
       
        
        “D.  
        Intent 
        
       
       
        
        A person intends an event if they decide to bring it about by their act or omission. If they foresee an event as the inevitable consequence of their act or omission, they intend to bring about that result even if  
        was not the purpose of what he or she did 
        .” (italics added) 
        
       
       
      This direction was the subject of specific submissions and I will refer to it below. 
       
      
    137 Finally, MFI 22 included a direction on the meaning of “prejudice”, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “F.  
        Prejudice 
        
       
       
        
        An act or omission is to a person’s prejudice if a financial advantage will be obtained from that person. That advantage can be otherwise than by way of remuneration. 
        
       
       
        
        That may be the result of a person having accepted a false instrument as genuine, or a copy of a false instrument as a copy of a genuine one, in connection with the person’s performance of a duty.” 
        
       
      
    138 That, too, was the subject of specific submissions. I will return to it. 
     
      
    139 I turn now to the specific matters raised on behalf of the appellant under this ground. 
     
      
    140 The written submissions raised the following matters concerning the directions: 
     
      
       
      (a) “Intent”: 
       
       
      I have set out above the written direction on intent, highlighting that part of it which is said to constitute “a fundamental misdirection”. 
       
      
    141 It is not easy to understand the complaint now made on behalf of the appellant. Submissions were made concerning the need for the Crown to prove “double intention”: see R v Campbell (1985) 80 Cr App Rep 150; R v Tobierre [1986] 1 All ER 346; R v Garcia (1988) 87 Cr App Rep 175. The “double intention” is the intention, firstly, to induce another person to accept the instrument as genuine; and secondly, that that person will act upon it to the prejudice of that or another (fourth) person, in this case Mr Preston. (The cases cited were cases decided under comparable, but not identical, English legislation. Here, because of the language of s 300, the Crown must prove a triple intention: an intention to make an instrument that is false; an intention that the maker or another person (person B) will use the false instrument; and an intention that another person (person C) will be induced to act to the prejudice of that person (person C) or another person (person D).) In his oral directions his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Obviously the Crown needs to prove that it was not created in 1984, which is the accused’s case, and the Crown must prove  
        that it was made by the accused with the intent that it would be used by Mr Hattersley, the costs assessor, to make a costs assessment and that that would be to the financial prejudice of Mr Preston 
        .” (italics added) 
        
       
      
    142 Indeed, in the written submissions, it was acknowledged that: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is clear from his Honour’s oral directions (as to the fourth and seventh (sic) elements) as well as his written aide memoir that the need to prove ‘double intention’ was brought to the attention of the jury …” 
        
       
      
    143 The submissions go on to complain of the concluding words of the written directions. Some contrast was drawn between “intention” and “purpose”. To my mind, there is little, if any, relevant difference between “intention” and “purpose”. But this was not a matter that concerned counsel for the appellant at trial, who had the opportunity to, and did, accede to the form of the document given to the jury. Although the direction would have been better without those concluding words, I do not see it as distracting the jury from their task. In the circumstances of this case, if the appellant was responsible for making the document, it is obvious that his purpose was, firstly, to induce Mr Hattersley to accept it as genuine, and, secondly that Mr Hattersley would act upon it to the prejudice of Mr Preston. That is what his Honour said in the oral direction. There is no substance in this complaint. 
     
      
    144 (b) “Inducement” 
     
      
       
      It was also argued that the directions on “inducement” were incorrect and misleading because they (erroneously, so it was contended) identified Mr Preston as the victim of the offence, whereas the correct interpretation of s 300 is that the victim is the person induced to act on the false instrument – that is, Mr Hattersley. 
       
      
    145 That construction is, in my opinion, plainly wrong. The victim of the offence is quite clearly and unarguably the person to whose prejudice the person induced is intended to act. In MFI 22 Mr Preston was correctly identified as the victim of the offence. The alternative written directions did contain an error in this respect; element 5 was said to be: 
     
      
       
        
        “5. to induce the  
        victim 
        : 
        
       
       
        
        (i) to accept the instrument as genuine; and 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) because of that acceptance, to do, or not do, some act to the prejudice of the victim or another person.” (italics added) 
        
       
      
    146 But I am satisfied that that direction did not go to the jury; if it had it would have been incorrect in the same way as the appellant’s submission is incorrect. There is no substance in this complaint. 
     
      
    147 I have already noted that the written directions concerning the meaning of “making” or “made” were superfluous. But that was not the point taken on appeal. The point now sought to be taken is that Ms Moffatt was the real “maker” of the false instrument, and therefore the (principal) offender, and that the appellant was, at most, an accessory to her offence, or, alternatively, guilty of an offence of using a false instrument, an offence for which provision is made by s 300(2). This is a ground, not of directions, but of the capacity of the evidence to support the charge. I will deal with it below.  
     
      
    148 Under ground 1, (although sitting uneasily with the formulation of the ground) a number of additional issues were raised.  
     
      
        
       
      (i) Making or using? 
       
      
    149 I agree with the approach taken by McClellan CJ at CL in respect of this aspect of the appeal. There is no substance in this complaint. 
     
      
    150 It was acknowledged that the appellant could have been guilty of the offence of making a false instrument if he were shown to have acted through an “innocent agent”, something Ms Moffatt was not (on the appellant’s argument) because she had lied to investigators from the Law Society, and had claimed and been granted a certificate under s 128 of the Evidence Act 1995. 
     
      
    151 I very much doubt that this latter consideration could have any bearing upon the determination of whether or not Ms Moffatt was or was not the perpetrator of the offence. However, it is unnecessary to decide that. The appellant opted to defend the charge on the basis of his denials of having been involved. He maintained that the copy letter was genuine, and that the original had been sent to Mr Preston. 
     
      
    152 It is best to reproduce part of the argument advanced on behalf of the appellant: 
     
      
       
        
        “8.17 It is contended that the appellant is only liable to be convicted of making a false instrument, in circumstances where he did not physically produce the instrument himself, where he provided false information to or deceived an innocent victim into producing a false instrument – the reason being is (sic) that he ‘made’ the instrument through an innocent agent. But as it has been submitted Ms Moffatt was not such an innocent agent. See  
        Arlidge & Parry on Fraud 
          
        (2nd ed) at para 5-032.” 
        
       
       
      One flaw in this argument is the assumption that the appellant could only be responsible for making the instrument if he provided false information to, or deceived, the person who performed the physical acts to make the instrument. There is no reason why his liability should be so limited. He would be equally guilty if he had the document made by, for example, threats, intimidation or bullying. It is no different where it is made, on his instructions, as employer. It is not the physical act or acts of bringing the document into existence that identifies the person who “makes” or “made” it; the person who “makes” a document is the person who is ultimately responsible for its coming into existence. In some circumstances, that may raise a question of fact for determination by the jury. In the present case, it did not. Both parties, and the judge, proceeded, correctly, on the basis that, if the document came into existence as described by Ms Moffatt, then the appellant was its “maker”. It is not now open to the appellant to depart from that position. There is no substance in this complaint. 
       
       
      (ii) Copy of false instrument? 
       
      
    153 It was also argued that the document which became exhibit 1A was not, within s 300, a false instrument, but was, within s 301, a copy of a false instrument. That is to misunderstand the manner in which the Crown case was put. The Crown case was that the appellant created a false document; the false document purported to be a copy of another (also false) document, the original letter. As the Crown presented its case, it was essential to the appellant’s plan and purpose, that the purported copy of an original document, said to have been sent to Mr Preston, be contained in the files. The “false instrument” was just that, a false copy of a (false) letter.  
     
      
    154 It is true that the indictment identified “a letter addressed to John Preston” as the false instrument. Precision would have required the false instrument to be identified as a copy of a letter. However, nobody, including the appellant, was misled in any way by this slight imprecision. There is no substance to this complaint. 
     
      
       
      (iii) Prejudice  
       
      
    155 A fourth matter was raised, somewhat half-heartedly. It concerned the directions given with respect to prejudice. I say half-hearted because, in the opening words of the submission, it was acknowledged that “scant attention was given to this issue at trial”. The criticism that is now made concerns that part of the direction that appears in the second paragraph and incorporates the notion of the person (the person to be induced, Mr Hattersley) having accepted as genuine a false instrument (or a copy thereof) “in connection with the person’s performance of a duty”. That direction was based upon s 305. 
     
      
    156 S 305 exhaustively defines when an act or omission is prejudicial. An act or omission is to a person’s prejudice if and only if it is one that (if it occurs)  
     
      
       
      (a) will result: 
       
       
      (i) in the person’s temporary or permanent loss of property, or 
       
       
        
        (ii) in the person’s being deprived of an opportunity to earn remuneration or greater remuneration, or 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) in the person’s being deprived of an opportunity to obtain a financial advantage otherwise than by way of remuneration; or 
        
       
       
      (b) will result in any person being given an opportunity: 
       
       
        
        (i) to earn remuneration or greater remuneration from the first mentioned person, or 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) to obtain a financial advantage from the first mentioned person otherwise than by way of remuneration; or 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      (c) will be the result of the person’s having accepted a false instrument as genuine, or a copy of a false instrument as a copy of a genuine one,  
      in connection with a person’s performance of a duty 
      . 
       
      
    157 Here, it is obvious, the prejudice relied upon by the Crown was that specified in s 305(b)(ii) – that is, it was the Crown’s case that Mr Hattersley’s reliance on the false instrument was intended to result in the appellant’s obtaining a financial advantage from Mr Preston otherwise than by way of remuneration. That is all that was needed to be said. The second paragraph of the direction was superfluous. But that is not the complaint that is now made. The argument that was put was that Mr Hattersley could not be said to have been performing a duty. That, so it was said, was because he was not an officer of the court and his performance of a duty as such was not in issue. 
     
      
    158 There is nothing in s 305(c) that requires the performance of the duty to be in the capacity of an officer of the court. Plainly, on the evidence, Mr Hattersley was performing a duty – he was assessing the costs due from Mr Preston to the appellant. He was doing that in accordance with the regime laid down under the relevant legislation. He was appointed by the Chief Justice of NSW. He was performing a duty. That being so, it was not incorrect to give the jury the second part of the direction. There is no substance in this complaint. 
     
      
    159 I would reject ground 1 of the appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
      
    160 It is convenient to repeat this ground of appeal. It was formulated as follows. 
     
      
       
        
        A substantial miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the decision of the trial judge to grant leave to cross-examine, and the manner and form of cross-examination by the Crown prosecutor in relation to the following issues: 
         
         
        (a) The issue of an alleged misappropriation of an amount of $5,000 said to have been taken by the appellant from Mr Preston. 
         
         
        (b) The contention on the part of the Crown that the appellant concealed the whereabouts of Ms Burden, a potential witness, from the Crown. 
        
       
      
    161 So far as the ground concerns cross-examination on the issue of an alleged misappropriation of $5,000, it relates to the cross-examination of a witness, Mr Zwar, and also of the appellant, in relation to two specific issues, set out in the ground.  
     
      
    162 It is necessary to set out some history and background. 
     
      
       
      (a) evidence concerning alleged misappropriation of $5,000: 
       
       
      History and background 
       
      
    163 Michael Zwar was called by the Crown. He is a solicitor, a former employee and former partner of the appellant. He was employed in the firm M D Nikolaidis & Company in March 1991, became a partner in April 1992, and remained with the firm until May 1998. He became involved in some of the Preston matters. When Mr Preston terminated the firm’s services, he was asked (presumably by the appellant) to prepare bills in relation to all matters conducted on behalf of Mr Preston and his interests. It was Mr Zwar who initially found the letter exhibit 1A. He gave some evidence which I find rather curious. He said that when he found the document he left it in the file. When asked whether he had discussed it with Mr Hattersley, he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Not initially. I knew it was in the file and I remember thinking to myself ‘I wonder how long it will take him to find it’, and I actually looked at my watch and had a private bet with myself it might take 15, 20 minutes. It took about half an hour before he walked into my room with the document.” 
        
       
      
    164 He also said that when he found the document he brought it (somewhat forcefully) to the appellant’s attention. He was annoyed, he said, because having access to it earlier would have made preparation of the bills easier. He said that when he showed it to the appellant, the appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well, I always thought there was a letter somewhere.” 
        
       
      
    165 He then gave evidence about some specific bills, which could be seen to have been prepared on the basis of a charging rate of $200 per hour. He identified a document (exhibit 3) which was a “Confirmation of Retainer” between Mr Preston and M D Nikolaidis & Company in relation to litigation between Down to Earth Spring Water Pty Ltd (one of Mr Preston’s companies) and the State of New South Wales. This document included an express agreement that the firm would bill the company at a rate of $200 per hour. Mr Zwar gave evidence of another document, an application by himself and the appellant (as partners) in the firm for referral of a bill to a costs assessor. (The transcript does not indicate the matter in respect of which this application was made, but Mr Zwar said that such an application was filed in respect of each of the separate matters the subject of dispute between the firm and Mr Preston, in essentially identical terms.) 
     
      
    166 Item 2(c) of that document is an express assertion that there existed no costs agreement between the solicitor and the client. The application was prepared by Mr Zwar.  
     
      
    167 All this evidence was given by Mr Zwar in chief, and represents, effectively, the sum total of his evidence in chief. 
     
      
    168 He was subjected to what can only be described as a friendly cross-examination. He outlined his own professional history and background and his association with the appellant and his firm, culminating in his becoming a partner.  
     
      
    169 He gave evidence in considerable detail about Mr Preston and his businesses, particularly one investment in a spring water business, in relation to the financing of which the State Bank took a mortgage over certain property. 
     
      
    170 He identified a number of eminent senior counsel who were briefed from time to time by the firm, even telling the jury (in answer to a direct question from counsel for the appellant) that one of them had subsequently become a judge of this Court. 
     
      
    171 It is difficult to see the relevance of much of this, other than as a transparent (though illegitimate) means of enhancing the appellant’s credibility and standing in the eyes of the jury, as an honourable, experienced, discerning (in his choice of and association with eminent counsel) and competent legal practitioner, and corroborating, in advance, the evidence it was anticipated that he would give.  
     
      
    172 Mr Zwar also spoke of the conduct of Mr Preston in refusing to pay bills and a “litany” (the word used by counsel for the appellant) of complaints made by Mr Preston to the Law Society concerning the firm, all of which, he said, were resolved in favour of the firm. He spoke of intensive investigation by the Law Society at the instigation of Mr Preston. He spoke of threats made by Mr Preston, for example, to present statements adverse to the appellant from former clients and former employees to the Law Society investigators. He spoke of multiple claims made by Mr Preston against the firm alleging professional negligence, each of which, he said, was resolved in favour of the firm. All of this was plainly designed to impact adversely on Mr Preston’s credibility in the eyes of the jury, and to portray him as a malicious, vindictive, disgruntled former client who would, and did, make repeated false accusations of the appellant. 
     
      
    173 Counsel for the appellant then introduced the matter the subject of the first part of this ground. He asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … At that time there was an allegation by Mr Preston that someone had misappropriated $5,000, wasn’t there?” 
        
       
      
    174 Mr Zwar affirmed this, and affirmed (repetitively) that Mr Preston alleged that $5,000 had been stolen. He said that accounting records did not show any evidence of that sum of money having been received by the firm, and that the allegation proved, after investigation, to have been “a fantasy”, and baseless. He said that the sum in question had been paid by bank cheque to another firm of solicitors. This was presented as a specific instance of the malicious and dishonest allegations made by Mr Preston against the appellant and the firm. 
     
      
    175 Mr Zwar was then asked this question: 
     
      
       
        
        “(T407) Did he say to you words to this effect: 
        
       
       
        
        ‘Jan Moffatt told me today that if I don’t pay her $100,000 she’s going to ruin me’. 
        
       
       
        
        or words to that effect?” 
        
       
      
    176 “He” was a reference to the appellant. Mr Zwar’s answer was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whether I ran into him in the Supreme Court or whether he telephoned me I can’t quite recollect, but I know that he told me that he’d been rung by Jan Moffatt and told him words to the effect that if he paid her mortgage then she would let the whole matter go.” 
        
       
      
    177 This evidence was elicited from Mr Zwar at a time before Ms Moffatt had given evidence, and, obviously, before the appellant gave evidence. 
     
      
    178 The trial judge interrupted to direct the jury that this evidence could not be used as evidence that Ms Moffatt had spoken to the appellant as was asserted, but only as evidence that the appellant had so reported to Mr Zwar. 
     
      
    179 Mr Zwar said that his response to this was to say to the appellant: 
     
      
       
        
        “Maybe Mr Preston’s got to her as well.” 
        
       
      
    180 He explained what he meant by this. He said that when Mr Preston made his complaints to the Law Society they were sometimes accompanied by statements from former employees of the firm and: 
     
      
       
        
        “… it appeared to me that Mr Preston had a habit of approaching former employees and clients of MD Nikolaidis & Co with a view to obtaining statements from them, and on some occasions he was successful in doing that.” 
        
       
      
    181 When asked to explain the phrase “got to her as well” he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well that’s a reference to the fact that Mr Preston seemed to make something approaching a career of chasing every former secretary or employee of MD Nikolaidis & Co who had left the firm.” 
        
       
      
    182 An attempt was then made to have Mr Zwar say that he believed Mr Preston “had a hand” in Ms Moffatt’s assertion about the creation of exhibit 1A. This attempt was rejected. 
     
      
    183 Mr Zwar also said that the appellant told him that, when confronted with the alleged approach by Ms Moffatt, he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I told her where to get off.” 
        
       
       
      or words to that effect. 
       
      
    184 There had been an attempt on the part of counsel for the appellant to elicit from Mr Zwar evidence about another woman who had worked providing temporary secretarial services whose employment had been terminated because of alleged dishonesty, on information supplied by Ms Moffatt. This attempt also failed. 
     
      
    185 There was then this passage recorded in the transcript: 
     
      
       
        
        “So as to the suggestion that the accused directed Ms Moffatt to manufacture those file notes, do you agree or disagree with that proposition? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No, that’s just not right. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It would be fair to describe that as a nonsense allegation? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I accept that. I had the entire carriage of all dealings with the Preston files once Mr Preston had left. Mr Nikolaidis did not, for obvious reasons, didn’t want to make himself involved with them. I had to deal with them. In the context of having the Law Society inspections and also the preparing of accounts, I wanted to make sure there was some integrity in the files and that any file notes would be capable of being read by the Law Society inspectors.” 
        
       
      
    186 No objection based on relevance was forthcoming from the Crown prosecutor. Yet the transcript of the cross-examination extends over 134 pages. 
     
      
    187 It was towards the end of this lengthy cross-examination that the Crown prosecutor placed on record his intention to make an application under s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995, something he had, apparently, earlier signified to counsel for the appellant. 
     
      
    188 S 38 is relevantly in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “38. Unfavourable witnesses 
        
       
       
        
        (1) A party who called a witness may, with the leave of the court, question the witness, as though the party were cross-examining the witness, about: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) a matter of which the witness may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge and about which it appears to the court the witness is not, in examination in chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) whether the witness has, at any time, made a prior inconsistent statement. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) … 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The party questioning the witness under this section may, with the leave of the court, question the witness about matters relevant only to the witness’s credibility. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) Questioning under this section is to take place before the other parties cross-examine the witness, unless the court otherwise directs. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) … 
        
       
       
        
        (6) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in determining whether to give leave or a direction under this section, it is to take into account: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) whether the party gave notice at the earliest opportunity of his or her intention to seek leave; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the matters on which, and the extent to which, the witness has been, or is likely to be, questioned by another party. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (7) …” 
        
       
      
    189 After hearing argument the trial judge granted leave to the Crown to question Mr Zwar as though cross-examining. His Honour referred only to that part of the evidence given by Mr Zwar in cross-examination in which he recounted that he had said to the appellant, of Ms Moffatt: 
     
      
       
        
        “I said maybe Mr Preston’s got to her as well.” 
        
       
      
    190 He held that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The clear implication of that evidence is to impugn the credit, motivation and evidence of Mr Preston and Ms Moffatt.” 
        
       
      
    191 He said that that evidence had not been given by Mr Zwar in any previous trial or statement and was raised, in this trial, for the first time. He expressed himself as being in no doubt that Mr Zwar was giving evidence that was favourable to the appellant (not only on that part of the evidence, but on a number of other matters relating both to Ms Moffatt and Mr Preston), and unfavourable to the Crown. While he held back from finding that Mr Zwar was: 
     
      
       
        
        “… in the camp of the accused”, 
        
       
       
      He held that Mr Zwar had “a commonality of interest” with the appellant. 
       
      
    192 He then said that he considered it appropriate that the Crown be given leave to cross-examine: 
     
      
       
        
        “… particularly on those matters which are new either in evidence given in this trial compared to earlier trials, or not contained in other statements.” 
        
       
      
    193 He then specifically referred to the factors which s 192 of the Evidence Act requires to be taken into account when questions of leave are in issue. It is unnecessary to refer to what he there said in that respect. 
     
      
    194 The submissions put on behalf of the appellant were not easy to follow. At the outset, it was noted that, at the trial, the appellant did not seek to raise character, and made that clear at the commencement of the trial. The submissions went on to assert that, during the course of his evidence, Mr Preston claimed that, in previous civil proceedings in this Court between his company and the appellant’s firm, Bell J had found that the appellant lied in court, and that, shortly after, Mr Preston corrected that to assert that Bell J had found that the appellant had acted without instructions. 
     
      
    195 It was said that the claim that the appellant had lied in court “was completely and utterly unsubstantiated”; and it was observed that “strangely” no direction at the time was given [nor was one sought] concerning what Mr Preston had said. I find it difficult to see how these matters come within the ground of appeal as it is framed. If the remark made by Mr Preston had been perceived as particularly damaging, his counsel would, undoubtedly, have sought an immediate direction. It passed unnoticed. 
     
      
    196 The submissions then turned to the issue of the alleged misappropriation of $5,000. Not only was Mr Zwar cross-examined (by defence counsel as well as the Crown prosecutor) about this; so also was the appellant. The subject was introduced, in the first instance, by counsel for the appellant in cross-examination of Mr Zwar. It seems reasonably clear that the purpose of the cross-examination of Mr Zwar (by the appellant’s counsel), including that part of it that concerned the $5,000 allegation, was to portray Mr Preston as an unreasonable, biased and vengeful man, prepared to make wild, various and untrue allegations against the appellant and his firm. In the submissions the cross-examination of the appellant on this issue was described as “vigorous” and “extensive”. A fair reading of the cross-examination by the Crown prosecutor of Mr Zwar, and of the appellant, does not support that characterisation. The cross-examination does not suggest that the appellant had in fact stolen or misappropriated any money. As far as the purpose of the cross-examination can be discerned, it appears to have been to show that the appellant’s records were such that it may not have been unreasonable (even if it proved not to be the case) for Mr Preston to explore whether such a misappropriation had taken place.  
     
      
    197 Contrary to the appellant’s written submissions, the cross-examination was not, on my reading of it, “vigorous” or “extensive”. It was never put to him that the allegation of theft was proved or was true. 
     
      
    198 Since the subject of the $5,000 was first introduced by counsel for the appellant, and apparently for the purpose of showing Mr Preston to have been an unreliable witness, the appellant can hardly now complain that it was taken up by the Crown in order to explain or put in context what was said. 
     
      
    199 Reliance was placed upon the decision of Street CJ in R v Stalder [1981] 2 NSWLR 9. That was a case in which an accused person stood trial for murder. In the course of making an unsworn statement, a course then permitted by the Crimes Act, he made assertions that he was of a non-violent disposition. It was held that by doing so he had raised character, thus entitling the Crown to call evidence in rebuttal of his asserted good (non violent) character. His criminal history, which included two offences of armed robbery, was put in evidence. The argument there put to the Court was that, although it does not appear to have been disputed that admitting evidence in rebuttal of his claims of character was appropriate, nevertheless what was permitted to be proven was excessive. 
     
      
    200 Street CJ acknowledged authorities which may be stated as to the effect that, even where character evidence is permitted, a trial judge retains control and ought to exercise a discretion to maintain fairness in the extent to which such matters are raised. 
     
      
    201 The case is of no assistance to the appellant. The nature of the evidence there adduced was far beyond anything that was given in the present trial. Even so, Street CJ and Begg J held that no miscarriage of justice had occurred, and that it was within the trial judge’s discretion to permit the evidence to be given.  
     
      
    202 All that has happened here is that the issue of $5,000 allegedly “missing” was raised by the appellant’s counsel; it was explored, insofar as the transcript discloses, in a non-combative and non-assertive fashion by the Crown. 
     
      
    203 Criticism was also made of a number of references to this matter during the course of the summing up. Examination of the transcript of the summing up shows that this criticism is unwarranted. The issue was mentioned during the course of the judge’s review of evidence given by various witnesses, including Mr Zwar and the appellant, and in his review of counsel’s addresses. The summing up was, unfortunately, of a style that has long been out of favour, being a chronological summary of evidence given by successive witnesses. Such a summing up is not in accord with what is required: see R v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91 at 105. No particular emphasis was given to the issue of the $5,000. 
     
      
       
      (b) evidence concerning the absence of a potential witness: 
       
      
    204 The second matter the subject of this ground concerns the whereabouts of Ms Burden, a witness who had been a secretary employed in the appellant’s firm and whose initials were those that appeared on the letter exhibit 1A. The appellant had previously given evidence, in an earlier trial. In the present trial, he was cross-examined about the evidence he had then given concerning his knowledge of Ms Burden’s whereabouts; it was put to him that he had said that he had last seen her in about 1985, had tried to locate her, but was uncertain of the spelling of her surname. It was suggested to him that what he had previously said was not true.  
     
      
    205 The submission that was made was that cross-examination on this issue “was fraught with difficulty” and that a suggestion on the part of the Crown that the appellant had lied on oath in a previous trial was highly prejudicial. Counsel did not expand on this rather global submission.  
     
      
    206 Cross-examination is intended to be prejudicial. What is not permitted is cross-examination that is unfairly prejudicial. It was perfectly legitimate for the Crown to question the appellant about evidence he had previously given. There was no unfairness in the cross-examination. 
     
      
    207 I would reject ground 2 of the appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: the evidence of Tracey Middleton 
       
      
    208 Between 1998 and 1999 Ms Middleton was a salaried partner in the appellant’s firm. She gave evidence of a conversation with Ms Moffatt that, she said, took place in November 1998. Her evidence was that Ms Moffatt approached her in her office, with tears in her eyes, and asked what would happen to her if she were told to create a document and backdate it – and said that she had in fact done so.  
     
      
    209 Ms Middleton was not cross-examined. 
     
      
    210 This was evidence relevant only to the credibility of Ms Moffatt. It was therefore inadmissible under the credibility rule contained in s 102 of the Evidence Act, unless it came within one of the exceptions to that rule. It could only have been admissible under s 108(3). S 108 appears under the heading: “Exception: re-establishing credibility”. Subs (3) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “108 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence of a prior consistent statement of a witness if: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) evidence of a prior inconsistent statement of the witness has been admitted, or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) it is or will be suggested (either expressly or by implication) that evidence given by the witness has been fabricated or reconstructed (whether deliberately or otherwise) or is the result of a suggestion, 
        
       
       
        
        and the court gives leave to adduce the evidence of the prior consistent statement.” 
        
       
      
    211 It will be seen that the tender of evidence such as this requires leave. Before leave is given, one of the foundations for the admission under s 108(3) must be established: either that evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by the witness has been admitted; or that it has been or will be suggested that the evidence given by the witness has been fabricated or reconstructed or is the result of a suggestion. 
     
      
    212 Once the foundation is laid, whether leave is given is to be determined after consideration of the matters set out in s 192 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    213 It does not appear that leave was sought or granted. No objection was taken to the evidence. There has been no suggestion that defence counsel was not provided with a copy of Ms Middleton’s statement, or an outline of the evidence she was called to give, or was in any way taken by surprise by the calling of Ms Middleton. 
     
      
    214 Whether the foundation for admission of the evidence has been established depends upon analysis of the cross-examination directed to Ms Moffatt. 
     
      
    215 It was put directly to Ms Moffatt that she had not been required by the appellant to create the letter. She answered that she was requested, indeed instructed to do so. 
     
      
    216 The cross-examination then proceeded, in unmistakeable terms, to suggest that Ms Moffatt had fabricated the evidence. It was put to her, and accepted by her, that her financial circumstances were precarious and she was in need of money. It was put to her that on her leaving the employment of the appellant, she had unsuccessfully sought from him certain payments; and that, on a specified date in October 2001, she had telephoned the appellant with a request that he pay or give her $100,000; that this was accompanied by a scarcely veiled threat to provide information damaging to the appellant to Mr Preston – information sufficiently damaging to see the appellant imprisoned. It was put to her that, on another occasion, she had had a conversation with George Voulgaropoulos, an employee of the appellant’s firm, in which she had made detailed reference to the wealth of the appellant and his family; and that, in another conversation with Mr Voulgaropoulos, she had insinuated that she might benefit financially, in a substantial way, from the Preston dispute. 
     
      
    217 The only possible import of this cross-examination was a suggestion that Ms Moffatt had fabricated her evidence about the creation of the document. One clear suggestion was that her disaffection for the appellant stemmed from her perception of the way she had been treated by him on leaving the firm – that she believed that she had not been paid her “entitlements”. It was suggested that this provided her motive to fabricate evidence against the appellant. 
     
      
    218 Ms Moffatt left the firm in the middle of 2001. Any statement she had made prior to that date, consistent with her evidence about the creation of exhibit 1A, was therefore capable of rebutting the suggestion of fabrication. Ms Middleton’s evidence was that the conversation with her took place in 1999. 
     
      
    219 In these circumstances, the foundation under s 108(3)(b) for the admission of the evidence was laid. 
     
      
    220 It is true that, in the absence of any consideration of leave, the trial judge did not directly turn his attention to the provisions of s 192. S 192 requires the court to take into account the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) the extent to which to [grant leave] would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing; and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the extent to which to [grant leave] would be unfair to a party or to a witness, and 
        
       
       
        
        (c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave … is sought, and 
        
       
       
        
        (d) the nature of the proceedings, and 
        
       
       
        
        (e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or give a direction in relation to the evidence.” 
        
       
      
    221 There is not one of these which would militate against the grant of leave to the Crown to adduce Ms Middleton’s evidence. Of course, the Crown ought to have sought leave. But it was open to defence counsel to object to the evidence when leave had not been sought. He did not do so. As can be seen from the transcript, her evidence was very short indeed; it occupies only one page of transcript. Given the nature of the cross-examination of Ms Moffatt, it could hardly be said to be unfair to the appellant to permit evidence that re-established, or tended to re-establish, Ms Moffatt’s credibility – evidence that, prior to the date of her asserted disaffection, she had made a statement, or acted in a way, consistent with the evidence said to have been fabricated. The evidence was important in the overall context of the trial which was a criminal prosecution of a serious charge. No question of adjournment arose. 
     
      
    222 Had leave been sought, inevitably, it would have been granted. The failure of the Crown to seek, and of the judge to grant, leave did not occasion any miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    223 I would reject this ground of appeal. It follows that I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
       
      Application for leave to appeal against sentence 
       
      
    224 For the reasons given by McClellan CJ at CL, I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    225 HISLOP J: I agree with the orders proposed by McClellan CJ at CL and the reasons of his Honour and Simpson J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Robert Keith Matthew King, appeared for trial at the Lismore District Court upon an indictment alleging two counts of sexual intercourse without consent, said to have been committed against the same victim on the same occasion. He pleaded guilty to the first count, and that plea was accepted in discharge of the indictment. The offence, under s61I of the Crimes Act, carries a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 7 years. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years and 10 months, comprising a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months and a balance of term of 1 year and 7 months. He seeks leave to appeal against that sentence.  
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    3 An agreed statement of facts disclosed that in the morning of 1 September 2005 the victim, a 30-year-old woman, met the applicant at a house at Goonellabah, near Lismore. She had met him before, although she did not know him well. After a short time, the two of them and several other people travelled to a house in Ballina. There, the group consumed alcohol for some hours.  
     
      
    4 In the early afternoon, the applicant drove the victim back towards Lismore. However, the car broke down, apparently having run out of petrol, while they were still in Ballina. The applicant went to a nearby service station and obtained five dollars worth of petrol. He returned to the car, but was unable to start it. The two of them went back to the service station. The victim sat in an adjoining park, where the offender joined her, and they remained there until about 4.30 pm. 
     
      
    5 The victim walked to a nearby public toilet and entered one of the cubicles in the female section. While she was using the toilet, the applicant came into the cubicle. He inserted his fingers into her vagina as she was trying to adjust her jeans and underwear. She was protesting, there was a struggle and she fell to the floor, hitting the back of her head as she did so.  
     
      
    6 The applicant left the toilet, as did the victim. She went to the service station, in a distressed state, and reported the sexual assault to the service manager. The police were called, and the applicant was arrested. At the time of the offence, both he and the victim had consumed a considerable quantity of alcohol. 
     
      
       
      Subjective case 
       
      
    7 The applicant was 33 years old at the time of the offence, and is now 36. He has a bad criminal record, comprising a number of offences of dishonesty and some of violence. There are no previous offences of a sexual nature, except for a very early entry for carnal knowledge, dealt with in the Children’s Court, which the sentencing judge saw as of no consequence. His record for violence is of concern, his Honour describing it as “consistent” and noting that it included offences against women. He had served previous terms of imprisonment, and on a number of occasions had been in breach of parole.  
     
      
    8 He is an Aboriginal man, and his Honour saw him as affected by the social disadvantage from which so many of his people suffer and which engendered his “continuous drug and alcohol abuse…”. He did not complete his schooling, despite a promising start, and had had little employment. Nevertheless, he retained the support of his mother who, his Honour found, had “an abiding affection and love for him”. He has a son from a relationship which had been marred by his violence and his periods in custody. However, at the time of sentence he and his partner had been reconciled, and she also offered him her support.  
     
      
    9 He had developed skill as an artist and, indeed, had received an award for his work. His Honour saw in this “abilities and potentials which, executed appropriately, could assist him to avoid offending in the future”.  That said, his Honour was guarded about his prosects of rehabilitation. He did not see him as beyond reform, but saw his ability to rehabilitate himself as “very much dependent upon his attitude, not anything I or the Probation and Parole Service will do”. 
     
      
       
      The Application  
       
      
    10 The only ground of the application is that the sentence is manifestly excessive. His Honour arrived at the sentence of 5 years and 10 months after allowing a discount of one sixth for the applicant’s plea of guilty. His starting point, then, must have been 7 years.  
     
      
    11 The applicant was represented in this court by Mr Smith of counsel, who had not appeared in the District Court. His primary submission was that the sentence is more than was warranted by the objective seriousness of the offence. He argued that it was towards the bottom of the range of objective seriousness of offences of its kind.  
     
      
    12 He noted that s61I of the Crimes Act is concerned with a variety of forms of sexual penetration and that the type of penetration is relevant to the objective gravity of a particular offence: Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447. In the present case the sexual assault was digital penetration and, although there was a struggle and the victim hit her head in a fall, the offence was not aggravated by threats or gratuitous violence. Nor was it planned. Indeed, his Honour characterised it as “opportunistic”. 
     
      
    13 Mr Smith acknowledged that the form of penetration, while relevant to the objective gravity of an offence, is not necessarily determinative of it and that all the circumstances of the offence must be taken into account in assessing it. That is of particular significance here and, in my view, it is a matter to which his Honour gave appropriate weight. He referred to Ibbs, but went on to observe that this was “not a simple case of digital penetration…”. 
     
      
    14 The circumstances were particularly unpleasant, and might fairly be described as sordid. His Honour observed that the applicant had violated the victim’s privacy by forcing his way into the toilet and that he had exhibited “a considerable amount of belligerence…” While he accepted that he had not deliberately pushed her to the ground, he saw the struggle as a reflection of “the resistance that the victim put up” to his “unwanted advances”. 
     
      
    15 There was a victim impact statement prepared by a counsellor, which his Honour found unsatisfactory in some respects. Nevertheless, he inferred that the offence had caused her substantial emotional harm.  He did not expressly determine where he placed the offence in the range of objective gravity, but he rejected a submission by counsel then appearing for the applicant that it was “at the low end” of that range. 
     
      
    16 Mr Smith took us to Judicial Commission sentencing statistics for offences under s61I in respect of cases to which the standard non-parole period applied. The number of cases is substantial and, certainly, the sentence and non-parole period in the present case sit towards the upper end of the scale disclosed by those figures. However, on a number of occasions this Court, while accepting that sentencing statistics have their place, has commented upon the limited use of raw figures of this kind.  
     
      
    17 It was for his Honour to determine the appropriate sentence, in the light of the maximum sentence prescribed and guided by the standard non-parole period in the manner explained in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131, 60 NSWLR 168. His assessment of the objective gravity of the offence was, with respect, clearly open, and the applicant could derive no comfort from his antecedents. The sentence is severe, but it cannot be said to be outside the bounds of the legitimate exercise of discretion. 
     
      
    18 I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.   
     
      
    19 FULLERTON J: I agree with Hidden J.

      2008/3228 R v TODD ANDREW PEARCE 
       
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR : The offender pleaded guilty to Murder on 20 November 2008 at the end of a seven day trial. The offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment with a standard non parole period of 20 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    2 The offender's defence at trial was self defence, including a partial defence of substantial impairment. In view of his plea of guilty, the factual basis underlying the offender's claim to self defence namely, a threat from the victim that he would shoot the offender, falls away. Accordingly, I proceed to sentence on the basis of the Crown case at trial, unless otherwise indicated by these remarks.  
     
      
    3 The evidence at trial established that on the afternoon of 18 August 2007 the offender went to a housing commission unit complex in Hamilton South to visit Michelle Clapham. Ms Clapham was previously known to the offender and was also known to the victim, Con Karafylis. The victim had been contacted earlier in the day by Ms Clapham in the hope that he could provide her with some methylamphetamine. When the offender arrived at the unit he had possession of a large, heavy metal knife, similar in appearance to a scimitar approximately 25 to 30 cm in length, with a wide slightly curved blade. The knife had a distinctive silver metal sheath. Another friend of Ms Clapham’s, Mr Stuart Weeks, was also at the unit. 
     
      
    4 Whilst the offender was at Ms Clapham's unit, the victim arrived. The offender had an argument with Mr Karafylis wherein the offender accused him of robbing the offender's uncle's premises. This was denied by the victim who then left the unit and commenced to walk from the unit complex. The offender, carrying the knife, followed the victim outside the unit complex on to Fowler St where the offender and the victim continued to argue. Some witnesses in the trial described observing two men facing each other, gesticulating with their arms and pointing fingers. Raised voices and yelling could be heard. Mr Karafylis was unarmed. 
     
      
    5 One witness saw the offender with a silver blade in his hand. That witness then saw the offender plunge a knife into the victim’s back between his shoulders, as the victim turned to go. Whether the offender stabbed the victim in this fashion or whether he stabbed the victim by swinging his arm around to the back of the victim, whilst they stood face to face, is of little significance in my view. The forensic evidence was equivocal in this regard. I would place more significance on the fact that the offender carried a weapon which was designed to inflict serious wounds and on the force with which the stab wound was inflicted. The post mortem established that the knife was buried in the victim’s back up to its hilt and its passage had severed or partially severed two ribs.  
     
      
    6 The victim then ran towards Hassall Street yelling ""I'm bleeding, I've been stabbed"". Ultimately, the victim made his way to a bus shelter where a number of persons attended to him and an ambulance was called. He was taken to John Hunter Hospital where he died at 5 p.m. that day. 
     
      
    7 Meanwhile, the offender returned to Ms Clapham's unit where he told Ms Clapham that he had stabbed the victim and that ""it turned him on"". The offender at trial disputed that he had said any such thing to Ms Clapham. However, I accept that it was said, given that Ms Clapham bore no ill will towards the offender and her evidence in this regard was sufficiently striking to militate against fabrication. In addition, the offender’s extremely drug-affected state, to which I shall return below, explains how such a remark could have been made. 
     
      
    8 Whilst at Ms Clapham's unit, the blade of the knife was wiped with a towel in order to remove the victim's blood and Mr Weeks was asked by the offender to dispose of the knife. Mr Weeks took the knife, went to a phone box in order to ring the police and then threw the knife in some bushes behind the phone box. The knife was subsequently retrieved by police during a search of the area.  
     
      
    9 The offender changed some of his clothing and arranged to be picked up by his stepmother. He was arrested on 19 August 2007 and declined to be interviewed. 
     
      
    10 The conduct of the offender in the days and hours leading up to the murder deserves attention because of the light it throws upon the offender’s state of mind immediately before, during and after the stabbing. This information is primarily gleaned from what the offender told a number of psychiatrists in the weeks leading up to the trial, and what the offender said in evidence during the trial. 
     
      
    11 Dr Olav Nielssen saw the offender on 16 October 2008. The offender told him that he had been awake for about a week following continuous amphetamine use leading up to the commission of the offence. The offender said he was very paranoid and that he couldn't remember exactly what drugs he had taken, although he thought it was a combination of amphetamines, Rivotrol and another medication which was prescribed for his heroin addiction. Dr Nielssen was of the view that the ingestion of amphetamines over a period of time would render the offender more aroused, more fearful and disinhibited. The offender would have been irritable, found sleeping difficult, have been hypervigilant and had an exaggerated startled response. 
     
      
    12 Dr Bruce Westmore saw the offender on 28 May 2008. The offender told Dr Westmore that he was paranoid and using ""ice"" at the time of the offence. The offender said he carried a knife at all times. The offender said he had taken heroin, “ice” and Rivotrol on the day of the offence. 
     
      
    13 Dr Quadrio interviewed the offender in August 2008 over a period of two hours. The offender said that he did not clearly remember the four days leading up to the offence. The offender said that he had taken large amounts of ""ice"", that he had not slept for six nights and six days prior to the offence, and that he had taken ""a heap of heroin and some pills"" in the days leading up to the offence. 
     
      
    14 The offender's account at trial was that he obtained heroin and some ""ice"" on the night preceding the offence and that he had taken those drugs and some Rivotrol earlier on the day of the offence. According to the offender, those drugs ""made [him] feel normal"" because he took them regularly. He said he had been taking those drugs for approximately 4 weeks, every day prior to the offence. He said that as at the 17th of August he had not slept for six nights. To each of the psychiatrists and to the Court, the offender said that he did not intend to kill Mr Karafylis. 
     
      
    15 Neither the offender’s inability to remember the events leading up to and including the stabbing of the victim, nor the fact that he was in a heightened state of arousal necessarily precludes a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the offender intended to kill Mr Karafylis. The question is, did he form such an intention, not was he capable of forming one. 
     
      
    16 Having regard to the nature of the weapon, the force with which the fatal blow was struck and the location of the wound, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender did form an intention to kill, albeit that intention spontaneously arose from the unexpected confrontation with the victim only moments before. 
     
      
    17 The nature of the confrontation with the victim was also the subject of conflicting evidence at trial. Ms Clapham's account and the evidence of Mr Weeks did not support the account given by the offender at trial, namely that the victim was the aggressor in the argument and had accused the offender of sleeping with the victim’s ex-girlfriend. I accept the evidence in the Crown case over that of the accused on this issue. However, it is not entirely irrelevant that the offender’s accusation that the victim had committed a robbery on a family member may well have been a product of the offender’s confused and paranoid state of mind. 
     
      
    18 The victim was at all times unarmed. No submission was made to the contrary. Having stabbed the victim, the offender took his mobile phone and focused his efforts on fleeing the scene and concealing incriminating evidence. It could not have escaped his attention that the victim was seriously injured, even if the offender thought that the injury was not fatal. The offender did nothing to seek medical attention for the victim, whatever remorse he may have displayed to others in the days following the offence. 
     
      
    19 Taking all of these matters into account, I have come to the view that the objective gravity of the offence falls slightly below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for the offence of murder. I turn to the offender's subjective circumstances. 
     
      
    20 The offender has had the most appalling life. He is now 25 years of age. As a young child, he endured serious and repetitive violence meted out to his mother in his presence, and to himself by various adult males. Both of his natural parents were heroin addicts. His mother was periodically incarcerated, as was his father, resulting in numerous foster care placements. By the time the offender reached 14 years of age, he had at least once resuscitated his mother from an overdose while awaiting the arrival of an ambulance and was required to care for four younger step siblings while his parents supported their habits.  
     
      
    21 His education was almost nonexistent. The offender attended as many as six primary schools (that he could remember), and 4 high schools before completing year seven and ceasing his educational pursuits entirely. The offender came to the notice of Juvenile Justice in early 1998 and subsequent attempts to keep him under the supervision of the Department failed dismally. In December 1999, when the offender was 16 years of age, he was already living in a de facto relationship with an eight-month-old daughter.  
     
      
    22 In May 2000, a Juvenile Justice report noted that the offender was abusing substances, including alcohol and amphetamines, on a regular basis. However, despite attempts by the Department to provide the offender with alcohol and drug counselling, the offender persistently refused to participate. 
     
      
    23 A probation and parole report of 11 October 2001 noted that the offender had been addicted to heroin for some years. He had been assessed for entry to the William Booth program but acknowledged to the officer that he had no real intention of meeting that obligation. The offender reported that he was not motivated to enter such a program and did not wish to have any restrictions placed upon him after his release from jail. These are themes which have been repeated in every report since that time, up to the present day. 
     
      
    24 Having regard to the entrenched disadvantage in the offender’s upbringing and his spiralling drug abuse, it is not surprising that he was virtually incapable of rational reflection on the day of the offence. There is no excuse for what he did, but there is ample material from which to conclude that self restraint was completely beyond him. 
     
      
    25 The offender's criminal history commences in early 1998 and continues, unabated, over the following 10 years. The convictions recorded against the offender are primarily for motor vehicle offences, and property offences. There is no significant record for offences of violence. The most serious offence of that type is recorded in March 2008 for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, for which the offender received three months imprisonment. 
     
      
    26 It was not submitted that any allowance ought be made for the offender's plea of guilty, coming as it did at the very end of the trial and almost at the close of the offender's case. There has been no expression of remorse independently of the plea of guilty, other than what was said by the offender to his associates and to those professionals with whom he consulted prior to trial. I accept that the offender was distressed by the death of Mr Karafylis, but his distress and regret arose out of the offence’s consequences to the offender’s liberty, rather than any true remorse for the unlawful taking of a life. 
     
      
    27 The offender's counsel submitted that there is evidence that the offender is on protection within the prison system and that therefore some amelioration of the penalty ought to follow from that fact. However, it appears that the offender placed himself on protection. Moreover, there was no evidence before the court capable of establishing the prospect that this status would continue following sentence. Accordingly, there is nothing before the court which could justify any significant departure from the sentence otherwise appropriate to the commission of the offence on the basis that the offender will experience harsher conditions in custody than the balance of the prison population. 
     
      
    28 Contrary to the submissions made by the offender's counsel on sentence, I do not propose to make a finding of special circumstances. Not only will the length of the term during which the offender is under supervision be sufficiently lengthy to allow for the offender’s reintegration into the community, but the offender’s resistance to rehabilitation suggests that any more lengthy period would be of little utility. His prospects of rehabilitation remain bleak as long as he refuses to address his substance abuse. 
     
      
    29 Taking all of these matters into account, the offender is sentenced to a non parole period of 15 years, to date from 19 August 2007, expiring 18 August 2022, with a balance of term of five (5) years, to date from 19 August 2022, expiring 18 August 2027.  *******

   JUDGMENTAppeal against findings of guilt/penaltiesIntroduction1 Janice Richardson (the appellant) appeals against findings of guilt in respect of 18 charges, and if unsuccessful in that regard, then against relevant penalties, arising from the decisions of the Magistrate at the Local Court at Tenterfield on 22 January 2008. Then the appellant was found guilty of all charges brought by the respondent. She was found guilty of one count contrary to s 5(3)(c) Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (POCAA) and 17 charges contrary to s 8(1) POCAA. 2 The particulars of the respective charges were as follows: 
     
      
      In relation to the one offence contrary to s 5(3)(c) of the Act, it was alleged that the appellant, “being the person in charge of an animal (sic), to wit, 37 cattle, did fail where it was necessary for the animal to be provided with veterinary treatment for a period of time to be provided with that treatment, in that she did fail to provide veterinary treatment for a heavy burden of cattle lice”. This offence was allegedly committed between 22 October 2006 and 22 November 2006 at Bolivia, the location of the appellant’s property.  
      
    3 The other 17 allegations, each contrary to s 8(1) of the Act, allege offences concerning individual cattle of “failing to provide the animal with food which is proper and sufficient and which is reasonably practicable in the circumstances for (the defendant) to provide”. These offences were allegedly committed at the same location, between 2 September 2006 and 22 November 2006. The short particulars alleged the accused failed to provide food which was “proper and sufficient” to meet the particular cow’s “daily nutritional requirements, causing it to be in an emaciated body condition”. 4 As the matter has been argued in this Court issues relating to the findings of guilt and the penalty in each instance have been litigated before any final judgment. This was the only practical way to deal with the matter, as it was a case heard initially at Tenterfield, in the Local Court, and then argued in the District Court at Armidale, in circumstances where counsel had travelled from Sydney. It was, in fact, the last matter dealt with in the sittings and had been specially fixed to accommodate the availability of counsel and to enable the appellant to find legal representation. The Court is grateful for the cooperation of Mr King, for the appellant, and Mr Gallagher, for the respondent, in the conduct of this matter.The proceedings at the Local Court5 Evidence was called at the Local Court on 16 August and 15 November 2007. The learned Magistrate reserved his decision until 22 January 2008. This matter involved not only evidence from the prosecution but evidence from the appellant and evidence from a veterinary surgeon, Dr Krammy (sic), in support of the appellant’s case. Much of the prosecution case, so far as evidence in chief was concerned, was conducted by tender of statements, particularly from RSPCA Inspectors and veterinary officers assisting the RSPCA in its investigation of the matter and the subsequent prosecution. 6 I have had regard to the judgment of the learned Magistrate which involves some recitation at length of the evidence and some general findings on credit, particularly in relation to the appellant and her witness. Although this is an appeal by way of rehearing on the transcript, in accordance with the provisions of s 18 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, the Court is entitled to have regard to the findings of the Magistrate as discussed by Mason P in Charara v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 244`( [22]-[24]). Ultimately, I have found little assistance in the Magistrate’s reasoning and his assessment of the credibility of witnesses. There is much exposition of parts of the evidence, but little analysis. Whilst I note his rejection of the evidence of the appellant and that of Dr Krammy, there was little justifying that rejection. His reason, in part, for rejecting Dr Krammy’s opinion was based upon, it would seem, some perceived “familiarity” by the veterinary surgeon with the appellant by reason of referring to her at one stage by her christian name. This by itself, in my view, was a spurious basis for rejecting an expert opinion on the basis of perceived lack of impartiality. There were other more salient issues of the evidence that his Honour did not analyse. I will refer to this later. 7 Ultimately, I believe I am required to consider the matter on the basis of the evidence given at the Local Court, with little assistance in the Magistrate’s reasoning and some additional evidence adduced by leave pursuant to s 18 of the Act. The point made, as part of the appellant’s submissions, that there was some constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction may well have been properly made if that argument had been advanced on a question of law in the Supreme Court where the issue would have greater relevance to that jurisdiction. Here the underlying issue, that is more relevant to this Court, is the reliance it may have upon his Honour’s reasoning.8 In the conduct of the appeal, apart from the record of the Local Court, I have received additional evidence from Mr Hegney, a solicitor with in practice at Armidale and documentary exhibits. I will refer to his evidence in my assessment of the facts of the case. In my view it was proper to receive this evidence in the interests of justice, although it might not have been relevantly “fresh”. I also received some material from a New South Wales Departmental website.Submissions of the parties9 The appellant’s contentions were essentially: 
     
      
      i. that there had been a miscarriage of justice, by reason of the conduct of the Magistrate including the failure of the Magistrate to properly consider the issues and because of either apparent, or latent, duplicity in the charges.  
      
     
     
      
      ii. On the totality evidence the Court could not find the defendant guilty of the offences charged. 
      
     
     
      
      iii. In respect of the s 8(1) offences, the finding of guilt and fixing of a penalty for one charge required dismissal of the other charges (s 34(3) POCAA) – a submission I take as directed at either findings of guilt or penalty. 
      
    10 In relation to the issue of latent duplicity, there is complaint made about the failure to identify relevant contaminated cattle in respect of the one offence contrary to s 5(3)(c) POCAA. Purported duplicity in the s 5(3) charge is academic in light of my ultimate findings. Other complaints made relate to the “global” approach made by the Magistrate in relation to the seventeen other charges, and the inclination of the Magistrate, it is said, to roll all the offences into one. These issues are matters that require consideration in the context of re-examining the evidence that was before the Magistrate. There appears no latent or clear duplicity in the charges brought pursuant to s 8(1) of the Act. Each charge deals with an individual head of cattle and can be considered separately on the relevant evidence to that charge. Of course most of the evidence is generally relevant, however the observation of the condition of individual cattle was only relevant to the individual charge concerned with that particular charge. That the Magistrate may have rolled up the evidence is of no moment now. 11 The sufficiency of evidence issue is, of course, at the heart of the appeal against the findings of guilt. The argument put was that the prosecution case to establish guilt in respect of the seventeen s 8(1) POCAA offences was a circumstantial evidence case and that it was reasonably possible that the cause of the condition of the cattle was other than by the actions of the appellant. There were hypotheses inconsistent with guilt that may be identified from the evidence, notwithstanding that the appellant was in charge of the subject cattle. They included someone else being responsible for the condition of the cattle, the RSPCA recommendations for care of the cattle contributed to their condition and the cattle themselves did not eat the feed provided for them.12 The respondent submitted that there was sufficient evidence to convict the appellant and relied upon an outline of written submissions and some additional specific oral submissions in response to the appellant’s arguments. As it transpired in the course of discussion with the learned counsel for the respondent, a particular issue that arose in respect of the one alleged breach of s 5(3)(c) POCAA was whether there was any evidence that could conclude, as the legislation requires to be proved, that the relevant veterinary treatment was “necessary” to be provided to the animal. That the animals may have been lousy was, it would seem, in the absence of other evidence, not sufficient to establish the charge. It was conceded by counsel for the respondent that no such evidence was, in fact, provided to the Magistrate. Otherwise the respondent’s position was that all outstanding charges were clearly established, and that the further evidence of Mr Hegney was ultimately of little weight in the determination of these matters.General survey of the evidence of the evidence at the Local CourtThe prosecution case13 The appellant was a woman in her early sixties, living alone at a property called Hillview Park, at Bolivia, which is a hamlet 30 kms to the south of Tenterfield. The property that she occupied was approximately 150 acres in size, having been diminished in size from about 350 acres over a period of some years. A visit by RSPCA inspectors in early June revealed approximately 50 head of cattle, including cows, calves and a bull which were not in good condition. On 21 June 2006 Alistair Hills, the RSPCA Regional Inspector, returned to the property providing the appellant with a management plan and recommendations for the welfare of the cattle. The management recommendations were made to the appellant by document dated 21 June 2006 served by RSPCA officers. Those recommendations were that the cattle should be fed more protein, energy and roughage, that cattle numbers should be reduced to a more sustainable level on the pasture with a suggestion that she should keep eight to ten of the younger, better conditioned cows and other stock should be sold off. Older and poor cows should be sold for whatever price the market was prepared to offer as “current feeding requirements and costs would most likely prove uneconomical”. There were recommendations as to the handling of the bull and recommendations in relation to drenching and vaccination. 14 A visual inspection was conducted on 26 October 2006. Fifteen cattle were seen in a rear paddock in “poor to average” body condition. There was “very little” natural feed and “no hand feeding” sighted. On 7 November 2006 two Inspectors, Hills and Inspector Kelly, attended upon the property and spoke to the appellant. The appellant told the inspectors on that later date of difficulties she had had with managing the property, particularly while she had been in hospital. The appellant, both to the inspectors and subsequently in the hearing of the case, sought to ascribe responsibility for the welfare of the cattle in large part to a person called Bradley Evans, to whom she said she had entrusted the cattle from early June until after her discharge from hospital. She gave evidence that she sacked him on 2 September 2006.15 When the RSPCA inspectors attended the property of the appellant on 7 November, the appellant asserted that Evans had not followed her instructions and the deterioration and any condition of the cattle was due to his failings. Observations were made on that date of the available feed, both for hand feeding and for natural feed. The appellant was warned that the cattle were not being fed enough but the appellant disagreed with this assertion. Thirty one cattle were observed in varying condition. There was very little natural feed, with bare ground on the majority of paddocks, no standing dry fee in the paddocks and six bales of lucerne and ten bales of low quality millet hay.16 On 22 November 2006 Inspectors Hills, Kelly, an investigator, Mr Hall, and two veterinarians, Graham Doherty and Lisa Martin attended the property. Some feed was distributed to a number of cattle. Ultimately twenty-one cattle were removed, including calves, because of their poor condition. Each of these stock were allocated a number and seventeen of the cattle became the subject of the allegations of offences contrary to s 8(1) POCAA. 17 At the Local Court the statements of a number of the Inspectors and the two veterinarians who attended were admitted without objection and photographic evidence was produced purporting to show the condition of the cattle, who can be seen from the photographs to be in poor and emaciated condition to varying extents. 18 The property was described by the local Rural Lands Protection Board veterinarian, Lisa Martin, as being half lightly timbered with scant pasture and a steep gully. As at 22 November it was described by Dr Martin as having the capacity to run fifteen dry cows or steers or ten to twelve pregnant or lactating cows. There were, in fact, at least 37 cattle, including a number of the cows lactating with calves at foot.19 The history of the local climatic conditions was that the Tenterfield area had been drought affected in 2003-2004, recovery had been sporadic since that period, there was a reasonable season in spring and summer in 2005 which had allowed cattle in the area to gain condition before the cold winter season and the area in which the property was located had been removed from drought declaration on 30 November 2005. It was drought declared from 1 June 2006 but removed from drought declaration on 30 September 2006. The area went back into drought on 1 November 2006. Dr Martin expressed an opinion that was not challenged at the court below that most cattle in the local area were “quite well conditioned” (as at 22 November 2006) with “storm rains and warmer weather assisting pasture growth”. 20 The observations in June 2006 in this matter form background material to the gravamen of the allegations brought against the appellant. For the purposes of determining this matter I place little weight upon the observations made of the cattle at that point of time. It is common ground, in fact, that the opinions expressed by the Inspectors at that time were opinions outside their qualifications. Their observation was that a number of the cattle were not in good condition but little else could be gleaned from that matter. The critical issue was the condition of the cattle on 22 November 2006 and what caused that within the period of 2 September until that latter date.21 The statement of admitted facts, tendered at the Local Court, noted that, as at 7 November 2006, an inspection showed that there was “minimal natural field … no stock had been sold” and the defendant stated at that time that “20 head had been lost due to lack of feed and calving problems” but the appellant advised that she did not think there was “any problem with the cattle and they were getting enough feed”. She admitted care and control of the cattle over the relevant periods of the charges.22 When the cattle the subject of the s 8(1) charges (along with other cattle) were seized on 22 November 2006, Dr Doherty, a veterinary surgeon, retained by the RSPCA inspected the cattle. In fact, as he revealed at the Local Court, he walked a number of them to be penned for some distance. He came to the conclusion that seventeen of thirty-seven cattle that he inspected had a “body condition score” of “1”. These were the subject of the charges brought pursuant to s 8(1) of the Act.23 The evidence reveals that a “body condition score” is an accepted scale from “0” to “5” for assessing the condition of cattle. “0” represents “being incompatible with life” and “5” represents “grossly overweight”. Dr Doherty was of the view that seventeen of the thirty-seven cattle should be given a body condition score of “1”, which means “having all ribs, spine and hips visible, sunken over the rump area and no muscle mass”. Seventeen other cattle were scored at “2”, which is “having all ribs, spine and hipbones visible, sunken over the rump area and with some muscle mass”. These other cattle were not the subject of charges. A document tendered on appeal by the appellant from the web site of the NSW Department of Primary Industry (DPI) deals with “Visual and Manual assessment of fatness in cattle”. The document provides useful background, but neither its written detail, or the included unclear photographs, could be relied upon to second guess the observations of the veterinary surgeons who attended on 22 November 2006. Certainly I am not in a position to undertake a comparison with the photographs in the document with the photographs of the subject cattle to ‘check’ on the opinion of Dr Doherty.24 The local Rural Lands Protection Board veterinarian, Lisa Martin, in her report set out a very detailed account of the circumstances in which the cattle were found and the manner of the inspection. None of this evidence was challenged in the court below in any realistic way. She described the method of marking with identification labels relevant cows. I note that all the cattle recommended for seizure, because of their poor condition, or need of veterinary treatment, were fit for transport, so long as they were not transported too far. She expressed the opinion that the cattle may die of malnutrition if left on the property. Other cattle had been lost according to Ms Richardson. The cattle seized included two yearling heifers, three calves and one springing cow, which calved on, or shortly after, 22 November 2006. She was of the opinion that the property was over stocked. The recommended numbers I have referred to above.25 The evidence of the veterinarians who attended was essentially left unchallenged or unshaken on the issues of observations of cattle, the degree of emaciation, the cause of their condition on 22 November and the reasons for it. Dr Doherty was of the opinion that it was not reasonably possible that their condition was as a result of proper and sufficient food over the period between 2 September 2006 and 22 November 2006.26 It was established at the hearing that the cattle in question were mustered to be given a thorough examination by the vets with fecal (sic) and hair samples taken for further analysis. Cattle lice were detected. It was admitted by the appellant in the same statement of admitted facts that she was in hospital between 9 August 2006 and 28 August 2006. Inspector Hills conceded that at all relevant times he had contact with Ms Richardson she was mobile, but only with the aid of walking sticks or a frame. The cattle seized were treated, fed on veterinary advice and released back to the care of the defendant in about March 2007. The seventeen cattle subject of charges pursuant to s 8(1) POCAA were in improved condition after treatment and appropriate feeding. They were scored, as at early March, between 2-3 and were regarded as “very healthy”.27 The appellant was interviewed on 7 December 2006 and that “record of interview” was in evidence. The appellant in that interview was adamant that she had cared for the cattle and that any short fall in their condition arose from the neglect of the man Evans, who she said was responsible for the animals on the property from April through until September. She said “until I got very ill in March/April this year I had total responsibility. I hired an employee who has been responsible for neglect, killing and cruelty to my animals while I was in hospital in August … he used me, manipulated me, lied to me and cheated me and robbed me”. She admitted responsibility for the animals from September. She said that she had done “everything” that had been recommended to her by the RSPCA and neither Evans nor another person (Jeff Benson) had followed through with her instructions. She asserted that in the “last three months” she had used “very expensive lucerne, hay …. nuts, cotton seed meal, solflox” and that the cattle had been drenched “five times this year”. They had been provided with shade, shelter and water and that she had put a “bit of lime in their water troughs on the nuts”. She said that she had been feeding “a couple of bags of nuts every couple of days” and the lucerne was “top quality”. 28 She asserted that she thought that someone had been poisoning her cattle and that she had deceased cattle tested and there had been “several post mortems” however the results were “inconclusive”. She denied that her herd was in poor condition on 26 October 2006 stating that they were “a lot better than they were in September”, primarily because of the neglect of Mr Evans. She spoke of the problem with lice arising after mistreatment by Mr Evans and that she relied upon him during four months, three months of which she “could not walk” before she went to hospital in August. She said that she did not know that Evans was not caring for the animals adequately before she went to hospital and that she sacked him when she discovered the true situation on her return home in early September. She said that at the time of interview she was physically capable of looking after the cattle because she “(had) to be”. She made assertions that there had been improvements in the cattle in the observation of others prior to them being seized and that their condition had improved since the time that Evans had been sacked. Evans did not give evidence. 29 Hearsay representations relied upon by the prosecution from Evans and local merchants, criticising the defendant or otherwise making allegations against her I have ignored. I accept that, at least during August and before, the defendant was dependant upon others to care for the cattle. The appellant’s case30 The appellant in her evidence said that she had looked after the cattle up until June 2006 and gave details of what she had done in that period particularly in the period January through to March. She said that when she became ill, although she suffered chronic illness including “cancer, heart failure and kidney failure”, she could not look after the cattle and obtained assistance particularly from Brad Evans who started in around May 2006. She had been ill in March 2006 with what was described as “post polio syndrome”. She said that Evans took full control of the cattle in June 2006 but she was forced to sack him in early September 2006, having been hospitalised throughout August when her weight swelled up to over 90 kilograms, her normal weight being in the mid 50 kilogram range. She asserted that the cattle were in “store condition” in early August when she went into hospital but that Evans had not fed the cattle sufficiently and had not followed her instructions.31 She said in her evidence that immediately before the RSPCA attended on 22 November there had been “six inches” of rain which had revitalised pastures and that when the inspectors attended she had approximately six bales of hay because she did not have the storage facilities for large quantities of feed, she was required to have feed brought to the property a number of times a week. She gave details of the attempts she made to ensure that Evans was looking after the cattle while she was in hospital and asserted that he had misappropriated money that she had provide to him, for example the sum of $400 provided on 21 August while she was hospital had been cleared through his account. She produced in evidence invoices from a feed merchant Exhibit 17 in the proceedings, setting out details of feed that she had purchased in late 2005 throughout 2006. 32 She said in her evidence, particularly in cross examination, that she believed that she was following the recommendations that had been set out in the management plan and that she had kept feed up to the cattle at all times. She referred to the death of a heifer that was the subject of examination by a veterinary surgeon, pathology tests were undertaken, but the cause of death was inconclusive. She thought that her cattle were perhaps poisoned, referring to “toxic poisoning”. The pathology report was dated 8 May 2006 and related to the examination of a six month old female calf. Death was said to be associated with “acute periacinar hepatopathy”, with acute liver damage. Although the liver damage was not considered “lethal”. Causes could have included moderately hepatoxic plants. This report however is dated 8 May 2006. She said that she had shown the RSPCA the report in May/June 2006. I note in passing that some complaint was made by counsel for the RSPCA that this item had not been produced to the RSPCA witnesses. Ultimately this failing is of little moment because the detail of the report, in any event, does not provide any guidance to the condition of the cattle seen six months after the report was published. She was questioned about the same report, referring to the fact that the cattle were “under nutritional stress”, although the veterinary pathologist had not “examined” the cattle. 33 She conceded in cross examination that after she had dismissed Evans she was well enough to feed the cattle. When questioned as to treatment of the cattle for lice infestation, she said that they were to be treated the Tuesday after the RSPCA removed them, a number of the cattle were lactating and there were instructions on the drenching medication that lactating cows with young calves at foot could not be treated, that the cattle had been provided lice treatment in May 2006 and that she did not believe the lice was a threat to the health of the cattle. 34 When taken to the management recommendations set out in Exhibit 11 she said that she had followed the recommendations by feeding more protein, energy and roughage and that she wanted to reduce the cattle numbers, as recommended, but she had not been able to do so. Ultimately, the appellant asserted that she had cared for the cattle both in providing them with adequate feed and other appropriate treatment, however her efforts had been undermined by the negligence of her employee, Mr Evans, between June and early September.35 The appellant called one witness, Dr Krammy. He expressed opinions about the condition of cattle in the area in which the appellant lived. He was a veterinarian with practise primarily in cattle. He expressed the opinion that the feeding regime that the appellant claimed she had undertaken with the animals was “very good” and that the recommendations in the management plan provided to the appellant by the RSPCA were “unrealistic”. He said that if the animals were fed in accordance with the management plan he would expect that they would lose weight because they were not getting enough “metabolisable energy” and it was unrealistic for the cows to eat that much food. The veterinarian commented upon the pathology results of an examination of one of the animals. He also gave evidence that based upon information provided by the appellant, using a computer program provided by the “Meat and Livestock Association of Australia” concerned with nutrition, the food provided by the appellant on her claim was “quite adequate”. One problem, of course, with this evidence was that the appellant in her evidence and in the interview of 7 December 2006 claimed that she was in fact following the management plan of which Dr Krammy was critical.36 In the course of his evidence when he was asked whose evidence he was basing his opinions upon, he said; “Based on Jan’s … what she said that she’s been feeding for that time period”. This was one matter that the Magistrate seized upon as discrediting Dr Krammy completely in his findings. However, putting aside any other criticisms of Dr Krammy’s evidence, one could not reasonably dismiss Dr Krammy completely on the basis of an offhanded reference to the defendant by her first name. 37 Ultimately, I would not reject Dr Krammy on the basis of partiality. In any event, no lack of impartiality was put or established from cross examination. I cannot see any reason to rationally consider the reference to her first name as important in this case. One could not conclude that familiarity with the complainant caused the opinions to fall away. The factual assumptions upon which the opinions were based as to adequate feeding were the critical issues arising from his evidence. ConsiderationThe s 5(3) POCAA Allegation38 S 5(3)(c) POCAA requires proof that; 
     
      
      “A person in charge of an animal shall not fail at any time … where it is necessary for the animal to be provided with veterinary treatment, whether or not over a period of time, to provide it with that treatment”. 
      
    39 Veterinary treatment is defined in s 4 to include “medical treatment … carried out by … or with the directions of a veterinary practitioner … surgical treatment … a veterinary diagnostic procedure carried out by a veterinary practitioner or a veterinary consultation in respect of an animal by a veterinary practitioner”. 40 There is no requirement that the prosecution prove “veterinary treatment” need only be carried out by a veterinary surgeon (Glass v Crowley 15 Dec 1992 NSWCCA (unreported)). However, apart from an inference that might be drawn on the evidence, the Court was not assisted by any opinions as to the significance of delousing treatment in the context of a failure to provide veterinary treatment “where it is necessary” (emphasis added). Counsel for the respondent conceded that in fact whilst the relevant animals may have been lousy, the evidence of the necessity for relevant veterinary treatment, did not exist on the evidence. This tribunal of fact cannot conclude the relevant ‘necessity’ of such treatment in the circumstances in which the animals presented themselves to the veterinarians on 22 November 2006. Whilst I believe I could readily assume that the presence of lice is not good for the animals, whether in fact the need for treatment at the points of time pleaded was “necessary”, would be a matter of complete speculation on the part of a tribunal of fact, if no relevant opinion had been expressed by someone qualified so to do. Further, the defendant gave evidence that she was planning to have the cattle treated the following week and that lice were not a problem for the health of the cattle in her opinion. There was no basis to disbelieve her as to her plans and her understanding of the significance of the presence of lice, even if one rejected other parts of her evidence. This Court could not conclude that planned treatment the following week failed the test of what was necessary required by the legislation and the charge. Whilst the basic factual matters relating to the presence of lice were established and that subsequently treatment was provided by the RSPCA, the prosecution on the evidence failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt the relevant need required under the section and/or by a failure to meet that need by the appellant. A subsidiary question of whether s 5(3) of the Act in its terms should be construed in the context of the provisions in s 5(1)(2) relating to “an act of cruelty” upon an animal need not be considered at this point. The s 8(1) POCAA allegations41 The gravamen of the submissions made on behalf of the appellant was, in respect of the s 8(1) allegations, in the context of what the prosecution had to prove, that the prosecution case was “circumstantial” and on all the evidence the Court could not be satisfied that the prosecution had excluded the reasonable possibility that the appellant had provided food which was proper and sufficient to meet the needs of the individual cattle and/or was reasonable practical for her to do. It was said that the prosecution could not exclude the contribution of intervening events over which the appellant had not control, contributing to their condition. The prosecution bears the burden of proving the guilt of the appellant and guilt is required to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. The burden of proof does not shift to the defendant at any point. Only the evidence relevant to a particular charge could be considered in determining whether the appellant was guilty of that charge. It was incumbent on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant did not honestly and reasonably believe that a set of circumstances existed which would make her conduct innocent (He Kaw Teh v The Queen (1985) 157 CLR 523).42 The 17 cattle, subject of charge, were clearly in very poor condition on 22 November 2006, consistent with “a failure to provide food that (was) proper and sufficient”. The photographic and relevant opinion evidence was all ‘one way’ in this regard. However, the appellant was adamant that she had adequately cared for the cattle, had followed the instructions in the management plan and that there were contributing facts to the condition of the cattle, particularly the conduct of the employee between June and 2 September 2006 over which she had no control. Furthermore, she relied upon the opinion of the veterinary surgeon called in her case to raise the issue of the management plan provide by the RSPCA as contributing to the condition of the cattle as observed on the 22 November 2006. It was also submitted that Mr Hegney’s evidence was of importance. It showed ample natural feed in the front paddock and sufficient hand feeding. It was submitted that the appellant’s position could be summarised by the adage (by analogy) “you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink”. Mr Hegney’s evidence showed that some cattle were provided with adequate nutrition. The appellant could not control whether the cattle consumed it.43 I have had regard to the evidence of Mr Hegney, in this appeal, of his observations “a couple of days” before the arrival of the RSPCA on 22 November 2006. He saw a number of cattle in a paddock in front of the homestead, saw lush fresh growth and saw feed within the paddock for the cattle there. The difficulty with the evidence is that it does not establish which cattle in the front paddock, if any, were the subject of the alleged breaches of s 8(1). Further, whilst an inference could be drawn on that day there was fresh hand feeding occurring and recent rains had brought on growth of natural feed, this is but one matter to be considered in the context of the observations of the condition of the cattle by the two veterinarians, Dr Doherty and Dr Martin, who attended on 22 November 2006. Even if feed was provided a few days before 22 November, the offence in respect of each cow was concerned with conduct that occurred over a period of time up to the observations of their condition on 22 November 2006. Mr Hegney was not qualified to, nor in fact made, any detailed examination of the cattle. The issue is one of “proper and sufficient” food, not whether ‘no food’ was provided. Even “proper and sufficient” food on one day may not be relevantly enough having regard to the condition of the cattle at the time, or afterwards.44 I have had regard to the various tax invoices which are in evidence, produced by the appellant, from what I understand to be a farm produce merchant. Whilst they show the purchase of various quantities of feed, including bales of lucerne and “millet hay”, the last invoice produced is dated 28 September 2006, almost two months prior to the seizure of the cattle on 22 November 2006. The appellant admits taking control of the cattle and being able to feed them from September until the date of seizure by the RSPCA. The invoices show purchase of feed up to a particular date but do not confirm the continuation of hand feeding in drought or similar conditions for such period of time as to avert the condition in which they were found on 22 November 2006. It does not support purchase of adequate nutrition in accordance with the RSPCA recommendations. Given her evidence of limited storage capacity, feed purchased in August and September could have not been stored for much time after delivery. The invoices reflect purchases of more feed while Evans was supposedly in charge of the animals than from after 2 September.45 Dr Doherty was of the opinion, not shaken or seriously challenged, that “a lack of nutrition would have existed for a period of greater than a month”. Dr Krammy’s evidence did not meet this opinion. He did not see the cattle in question, or effectively comment on their condition as shown in the photographs. On the totality of the evidence I have no reason to doubt Dr Doherty’s opinion on this matter. The evidence of Mr Hegney does not disturb it. Sufficient nutrition on one day, if that be what he saw, does not make for sufficient nutrition over a longer period of time.46 I have taken into account the assertions of the appellant as to the responsibilities of Mr Evans. Even accepting the breadth of time over which he had responsibility for the cattle claimed by her, that is from June through to September, I do not accept that the condition of the cattle as at 22 November can be explained by any conduct or misconduct on his part. If the subject cattle were in such poor condition as at 2 September 2006, they could not have improved over the next two months because their condition must have been “incompatible with life” as at the earlier date if they were ‘1’ on 22 November 2006. The cattle appear to have deteriorated from 7 November 2006 in any event. 47 In fact, the invoice evidence seems to suggest that a great deal of feed was purchased (assuming it was provided to the cattle) during the period of time that Mr Evans was said to be responsible for the cattle. The appellant’s own case is that she had responsibility for the feeding of the cattle over the period of time the subject of the charge. The opinion of the veterinary surgeon called on her part that the management plan would contribute to the emaciation of the cattle, does not reasonably explain the extremely poor condition of the cattle as at 22 November. Notwithstanding assertions to the contrary by the appellant I have difficulty accepting her claim that she followed the management plan. In any event, it is contrary to the version she gave Dr Krammy. The evidence from the representatives of the RSPCA demonstrates that the appellant had a marked reluctance to accept advice or assistance in relation to the care of the cattle and, in any event, there had been long standing recommendations that there be a reduction of live stock because the property could not sustain the number of cattle that were on the property over the relevant period of time. Dr Krammy’s opinion in relation to the matter, as he conceded, was very much dependant upon accepting the appellant’s account of what she had done to feed the cattle. That account was at odds with her evidence, and neither version explains the perilous condition of the cattle that were seized. 48 Although not all her cattle were emaciated, or in extremely poor condition, the objective observations of the subject cattle on 22 November 2006 was entirely inconsistent with insufficient and proper nutrition being provided to the cattle. I have taken into account, as a circumstance, that not all cattle were rated ‘1’. In the opinion of Dr Doherty, which was unshaken, the subject cattle were one step away from a condition incompatible with life. As there is no reasonable explanation or hypothesis inconsistent with either the appellant being responsible, or with the condition of the cattle being caused by conditions inconsistent with sufficient and proper provision of food, or that someone else contributed to their condition. In the absence of any basis for concluding that it was not reasonably practicable for proper and sufficient food to be provided, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant, as alleged in relation to each of the cattle, failed to provide each animal with food that was proper and sufficient and which was reasonably practicable in the circumstances for the appellant to provide. Apart from financial constraints there was no reasonable practicality to prevent proper and sufficient food being provided. In fact, the appellant never claimed that it was reasonably impracticable to provide proper and sufficient food. Noting she bore no onus, she claimed she had in fact done what was proper and sufficient. The totality of evidence was to the contrary. There is no reasonable basis for concluding that the condition of the cattle had anything to do with any matter other than a breach of s 8(1) POCAA. S 34(3) has no applicability to the current situation. This provision is directed at the avoidance of double jeopardy, or ‘autrefois convict’ situations. That does not arise here. 49 Furthermore, the prosecution has proven that there was not an ‘honest and reasonable mistake’ as to facts that would make her acts innocent. Even if the defendant had acted to hand feed the cattle for a few days before 22 November 2006, she had not acted to properly and sufficient provide food before then, and the food that was provided was not proper and sufficient given their condition on 22 November 2006.Appeal against penalty50 On finding the appellant guilty of the various offences the learned Magistrate sentenced the appellant in the following terms. Firstly, in respect of each matter for which there was a finding of guilt he fined her $500, making a total amount of fines of $9,000. He ordered court costs in the sum of $70. Furthermore he placed the appellant on a bond pursuant to s 9 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for a period of two years with various conditions relating to permitting officers of the RSPCA to enter her premises, obeying reasonable directions of the officers etc. He ordered a moiety pursuant to s 128 Fines Act in respect of the fines and as a consequence of the conviction pursuant to s 31(1)(a)(b) POCAA that the appellant dispose of cattle within thirty days of the order and not purchase or acquire other cattle pursuant to s 33 (1)(2) POCAA. He ordered that the appellant pay costs and disbursements, pursuant to s 215 Criminal Procedure Act, in the sum of $37,311, witnesses expenses in the sum of $3,272.50 and expenses for the care and treatment of the cattle pursuant to s 30(A) POCAA in the sum of $5,388.76. 51 Although this appeal is one in which the Court is to form its own view as to the appropriate penalty in respect of the matters for which the appellant has been found guilty (DPP v Longshaw (1990) 20 NSWLR 554), there are some matters referred to in the Magistrate’s very brief reasons for sentence that may be referred to as they do not appear to be in dispute. Firstly, the Magistrate held that the appellant was a person of good character, there were prior findings of guilt in relation to possession of firearms for which the appellant received orders pursuant to s 10 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. However, as the Magistrate found, they were “unrelated” and would appear to be incidental to the appellant being a property owner, rather than in connection with any criminal purpose. 52 The Magistrate recited the various “purposes” of sentencing pursuant to s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, without particularly analysing those matter and concluded that “the facts of the case are serious” and “any offence involving animals are serious matters (sic) which come before the Court”. He said that the Court “has a general responsibility for general deterrence within the community and a specific deterrence in relation to your conduct”. He noted that she had “a number of options available to you at the time and you failed to take appropriate actions” and “accordingly the Court notes that you were convicted after a lengthy hearing”. He concluded that while the charges were “multiple charges” and were “interconnected to some extent” each matter related to “an individual animal which is of concern”. The Magistrate said that he took into account what had been put on behalf of the appellant as to her “financial circumstances”. 53 What was known from the submissions and the evidence in the hearing is that the appellant was in very difficult financial circumstances. She was living on a 150 acre property which apparently was her sole means of income, the property having been reduced in size over a number of years for reasons not entirely clear. The believed that she had been “robbed” of her lost land. The farm had been drought affected for years. She was 63 years of age with considerable health difficulties and living on a disability pension for which she received $543 per fortnight. The Magistrate was told that she had expenses of running the property combined with living expenses of $700 a fortnight. To meet this shortfall she was “chipping away at the debt she’s got” but the debt was mounting. Her only “real cash flow” came from her disability pension. She had debts of $16,500 for her mortgage and had a further $10,000 in debts for hay and farm maintenance, which were outstanding. As at the 22 January 2008 she had a total of $1,500 in a savings account, which is the balance of the $16,500 that she had drawn against her property. She was legally aided at the conduct of the appeal. I have no reason to doubt her very difficult financial circumstances.54 In sentencing the appellant at this point of course I am no longer considering the offence brought pursuant to s 5 of the Act. As to the seventeen charges outstanding, it could be said that the relationship between each of them is far more than being “interconnected to some extent”. The conduct of the appellant was common conduct to each of the cattle. There is absolutely no suggestion that the appellant singled out particular cattle for particular treatment. It is abundantly clear that there is no suggestion that the appellant deliberately set about to mistreat her stock. Not all the stock were in as poor condition as the seventeen the subject of charges and, in any event, the appellant was not charged pursuant to s 5(1) of the Act with cruelty to the animals. The evidence revealed, of course, that the appellant was reluctant to take advice from the RSPCA and may have regarded their involvement as meddling in her affairs. It is clear on the evidence that the appellant was, and is, leading a lonely existence with almost no support in the conduct of a property that has been in her control for a number of decades. She had been involved in farming all of her adult life. She appeared to be a knowledgeable farmer. I accept that the RSPCA had sought to assist her by its attendances in June and subsequently, before the ultimate seizure of the cattle on 22 November 2006 and were acting in good faith. However she was very suspicious of their motives believing that she had been singled out for special treatment on the basis that she was the subject of malicious rumours by, or a “conspiracy” of, neighbours with whom she was in some dispute. In the assessment of the matter it is not irrelevant that the cattle, once bought back to good condition, were returned to the appellant. The concern of the RSPCA officers was not of deliberate misconduct, otherwise one might have thought that the cattle would not have been returned. 55 There was evidence from the Inspectors who attended over time that the appellant was physically disabled in a range of ways and clearly had considerable difficulty in running the property in a physical sense aggravated by her difficult financial circumstances which limited the amount of assistance she could hire. I note in the report of Dr Martin of 29 November 2006 she observed that Ms Richardson “may have previously been able to care for her cattle in an adequate manner, there comes a time when ill health reduces ones ability to adequately care for cattle and my opinion is that Ms Richardson may have reached this stage”. Dr Martin was concerned for the welfare of the cattle particularly with Ms Richardson’s health declining. However as she pointed out, whilst Ms Richardson is able to choose to live her life “as she pleases … her cattle have no say in the conditions of malnutrition in which they were then being kept”. She went on to observe “ … there comes a time when ill health reduces ones ability to adequately care for cattle and my opinion is that Ms Richardson may have reached this stage”. 56 Whilst I note s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, in my view this is not a case that requires great weight to be given either to specific or general deterrence. There is not the deliberateness of misconduct that usually attracts such considerations. In any event, it must be understood that one of the contributing factors to the poor condition of the cattle was the reality that this part of the State, as with most other parts of the State at the relevant time, was emerging from on of the worst droughts of the century. Of course drought does not exclude owners of livestock from providing proper and adequate care, but with the best will in the world drought can place limitations upon persons who are unable or can ill afford to get rid of livestock which are their livelihood. Furthermore, there is absolutely no need to consider the “protection of the community”. This appellant presents absolutely no danger to the community. The “purposes of sentencing” vary in relevance within themselves from one case to the other and, of course, may point in opposing directions to paraphrase the words of the majority in Veen (No 2) v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 465. 57 The Magistrate did not have regard at all to s 33F(2) of the Act. Learned counsel for the respondent on the appeal drew my attend to s 33F(1) in the context of dealing with an argument in relation to duplicity however, on further reading of the Act it was revealed in argument that s 33F(2) had relevance in this matter. That provision states: 
     
      
      “In sentencing a person for an offence against s 5, 6, 7 or 8 a Court may take into account whether the act or omission that constituted the offence related to more than one animal. However, if the person has already been prosecuted in respect of that act or omission, the Court is to take into account any penalty that was imposed on the person as a result of that prosecution.” 
      
    58 It is arguable that provision has relevance here. Ultimately, it does not matter, as the case, in my view, can be dealt with under more general principles of sentencing. As to the submission concerning s 34(3) POCAA, that provision is not relevant to sentencing in this matter.59 Here the acts or omissions of the appellant were common to each of the seventeen offences, it was in fact the one course of conduct. In these circumstances I am required to have regard to the decision of the majority in the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 (at [45]). That decision requires consideration to the issue of appropriate penalty for each offence but also having regard to issues such as the totality of the criminality and reflecting that in consideration of appropriate concurrency and/or accumulation where it arises. In my view it was not a matter where it is appropriate to separately fine the appellant for each offence in the same amount, noting the maximum penalty for the offence. Whilst one should have regard to “totality” of criminality, the appropriate penalties for each offence should be “concurrent” in their effect, not cumulative. A conviction and good behaviour bond is an appropriate penalty for each offence.60 Having regard to the character of the offending to which I have referred, the age of the appellant, her extremely limited means, her ill health, and the background in which these offences have occurred I am of the view that I should confirm convictions and good behaviour bond(s), as the Magistrate ordered, pursuant to s 9 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for these offences. The appellant’s capacity to pay fines is extremely limited if not almost non-existent. The terms of the order made pursuant to s 31 POCAA, with a limitation placed by the Magistrate on the number of cattle to be owned, does not accord with the opinions of the experts as to the capacity of the property to sustain a particular number of cattle. I would vary that order to coincide with the views of Dr Martin as to the capacity of the property to sustain cattle.Costs61 I have set out the orders made by the learned Magistrate for costs at the Local Court. These were purportedly made pursuant to s 215 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The power of the Court to order costs on a successful summary prosecution against the defendant is in respect of “such professional costs as the Court considers just and reasonable”. In this matter the tyranny of distance was a difficulty for both the prosecutor and the defendant. The proceedings were prosecuted in Tenterfield, almost as far north in the State as one can travel to conduct a criminal case, where the defendant lived. The prosecutor, the RSPCA, based in Sydney had retained counsel and costs were incurred for the prosecutor to travel to Tenterfield. The Magistrate was provided with details of professional costs incurred as well as s 30A costs and the like. The solicitor representing the defendant complained about the extent of costs, particularly travel costs, such as the chartering of a plane by Mr Doherty and the like.62 The expression “just and reasonable” has been considered in a number of decisions relating to orders for costs either under other Acts, or the repealed s 81 Justices Act, (eg Caltex Refining Company Pty Ltd v Maritime Services Board (NSW) (1995) 36 NSWLR 553 (at 560-4): Ly v Jenkins (2001) 114 FCR 237, (2001) FCA 1640). 63 In Caltex Refining Co v MSB, Sully J summarised the position in terms of a costs order that is “just and reasonable” (considering s 52, Land and Environment Court Act, 1979), that the judge must exercise the power to make the order, that the order must be ‘just and reasonable’ and that there be a fair hearing on the merits of the application that the terms of the order finally will be in themselves reasonable, the judge may receive and relevant evidence presented in admissible form as to the terms of the final costs order, only the judge may make a final cost order, it is not permissible for the judge to make an unquantified order for costs and the judge must act judicially displaying sufficiently open process of reasoning to fix a quantum of costs.  
     
      
      His Honour said (inter alia): 
      
     
     
      
      “A result which is nothing more than an intuitive stab in the dark is neither just nor reasonable” (at 564). 
      
    64 In this matter there are specific costs sought by the respondent (informant) as claimed expenses in the conduct of the hearing at the Local Court. In the circumstances I am required to consider the material presented, which is the material presented before the Local Court, note submissions of the parties at the Local Court in respect of the issue of costs (the usual way of course in which material is presented to the Local Court where there will be less formality than in the District Court and in superior courts), and consider what is claimed in the wider context of the character of the prosecution and the outcome of the prosecution to determine what is “just and reasonable”. 65 In Ly, each of the judges discussed the costs issue by reference to s 81(1) Justices Act (now repealed). Their Honours dealt with the issue of whether the costs ordered were” just and reasonable” on the specific facts of the case, but I note what has been said, for example, of the relevance Cachia v Hanes (1994) 179 CLR 403, in respect of which Justice Moore referred to the “helpful summary” of that judgment by Doyle CJ of the South Australian Supreme Court (at [10]). Costs are for “professional legal services”, including costs incurred by the practitioner, but the indemnity may only be “partial”, they “were never intended to be comprehensive compensation for any loss suffered by a litigant”. Justices Moore and Kiefel held that “costs” referred to “professional legal costs actually incurred in the conduct of litigation” but that the award of costs was “never intended to be comprehensive compensation for any loss suffered by a litigant” (at [101], [159]). Justice Moore extensively covered a number of authorities, holding that there was a wide power to reimburse costs, including investigation costs, but so long as the costs are “just and reasonable”. Justice Kiefel observed that costs are not referrable to disbursements paid to people such as witnesses and advisors and that the Magistrate was “in error” in allowing disbursements paid to witnesses and advisors as costs ([159]). 66 It must be fairly said that the costs issue was not extensively argued before me and to my mind was not particularly well argued before the learned Magistrate, at least in relation to the detail of what was being claimed as costs. At this point I am not concerned with the costs sought pursuant to s 30A POCAA which call for separate and different consideration to an application for ‘professional costs’ pursuant to s 215 Criminal Procedure Act. The matter is complicated by my finding that the prosecution had not proved beyond reasonable doubt the charge brought pursuant to s 5 POCAA. In the context of considering “just and reasonable costs”, whilst the means of the defendant are not relevant, the circumstances of the prosecution are not either. The RSPCA is a charitable organisation that performs a very valuable function in our community protecting animals from cruelty, mistreatment and neglect, amongst many other functions. There is no doubt, reading the statements of the inspectors, that the RSPCA sought to assist this defendant, but she was either unwilling or incapable of following advice or embracing the assistance that was being offered. 67 However whilst the RSPCA is a noble charity it is not entitled to special consideration. Neither is the appellant. I must confess to having some concern at the fact that the case was in fact prosecuted. This is not a case of cruelty and the RSPCA officers who attended the appellant’s property were well aware of the many difficulties the defendant had both financial, physical and emotional. It appears, given the character of the allegations against the defendant, that the needs of the situation could well have been met by care for the animals (their return, a matter of no moment) and requiring the defendant to pay for that care. Instead, this prosecution on the informant’s part necessitated the attendance at a court in a far corner of the State by a barrister and solicitor for the prosecution of the defendant for offences which, on the prosecution’s own case, were at the lowest order. The number of cattle involved in fact was relatively small. Most importantly, bearing in mind it permeated the prosecution case, was the fact that the cattle were held by the defendant during the period of one of the worst droughts in history. That having been said, the prosecution was commenced, all bar one of the offences have been ultimately proven. I must deal with the current reality.68 In all the circumstances however, it is not just and reasonable for a global order to be made rubber stamping all costs claimed by the informant for the purposes of the prosecution. Amongst other matters, in light of the observations of Justice Kiefel in Ly, I do not propose to allow any witnesses expenses. Further, I do not believe it was “just and reasonable” even considering the location of the hearing for the matter to be prosecuted by both counsel and solicitor. The matter was a simple matter, the proof of the guilt of the appellant in respect of the s 8 matters was a straight forward matter. 69 I note in the decision of Caltex Refining Co v MSB, after the distillation of principles relating to s 52 Land & Environment Court Act, Sully J reflected upon the order Bannon J had made in the context of a claim for costs in the sum of $120,232.00, which he reduced to $60,000. Although Justice Sully ultimately did not resolve the issue of costs, the matter was remitted back to the Court below notwithstanding fresh evidence on the point, his Honour amongst other things agreed with Bannon J’s view that a claim for “solicitor/client” costs in such circumstances was in excess of what was “just and reasonable”. Sully J observed that he would agree with the view that “such fact alone required the gross figure suggested in the relevant exhibit to be reduced”. I note in passing also that Justice Sully thought in the context of a summary prosecution in the Land and Environment Court that the sum therein claimed in Caltex Refining Company was “an enormous sum” for the costs of a summary prosecution. In context, a costs order of the character made by the Magistrate here was disproportionate to what was “just and reasonable” for a two day hearing and a day for judgment (at the request of the Court) in the Local Court, albeit in a court away from Sydney. 70 This preliminary view is confirmed by a close examination of what was claimed and “rubber stamped” by the Magistrate. The “professional costs” are itemised with great particularity and clearly are itemised on a “solicitor/client” basis. The solicitor’s professional costs include on a “time basis” per minute all aspects of the preparation of the matter, travel and attendance at the Local Court. This was charged out at $300 per hour. The solicitor claimed $10,425 plus $1,042 GST, totalling $11,467 for the first 2 days of the hearing and preparation. This amount is grossly excessive of what is ‘just and reasonable’ in all the circumstances. There was a claim of 540 minutes travel to Tenterfield Local Court as “professional costs”. In my view, is also quite unreasonable. Counsel’s fees totalled $11,660. This included a claim for $1,100 for “return travel” and $1,980 for “preparation”. The memo of the solicitor refers to an: “Invoice July-August $5,280”, from the barrister with no particulars. In the context of an award of costs in this jurisdiction that claim is not just and reasonable. A “brief fee” at commercial rates, in addition to a preparation fee, is not only ‘unreasonable’, it seems inconsistent with what a ‘brief fee’ generally means, when it is greatly in excess of a refresher rate, if a refresher rate can be divined given the lack of particulars for the “Invoice – July-August”. 71 I point out that there is a further claim for disbursements for travel and the like in the sum of $4,768.40 for both legal representatives. This includes entries such as “Counsel travel August 2007 $554.86 … Solicitor travel August 2007 $554.86 … Travel counsel November 2007 $171.14 … Travel solicitor November 2007 $171.14”. One assumes this includes airfares, given the claim for the time it took to travel. In handwriting there are further figures: “Airfares $995.18 …”. I assume this figure is for proceedings of January 2008. When the matter was listed for judgment on 22 January 2008 the solicitor claimed professional fees in the sum of $3,036 and counsel claimed the sum of $6,380, this included reading the transcript in preparation $1,980, “Return travel’ – in the sum of $1,100, a “brief on hearing” fee for 22 January 2008 (in the sum of $3,300) for what was obviously the taking of the judgment and some submissions in relation to the issue of penalty and costs. This claim is extraordinary. It is grossly excessive as costs that are just and reasonable. This claim is neither just nor reasonable given other claims for earlier proceedings. This figure includes the same (emphasis added) preparation fee as for the hearing. This is, in my view, an unreasonable claim. It was the same barrister at all times according to the transcript. I have a great deal of difficulty understanding why a barrister had to be briefed at all to take the judgment of the Magistrate and make some submissions in relation to penalty and costs, or alternatively be accompanied by a solicitor. In this matter, a “brief on hearing” fee of $3,300 for a matter in the Local Court, for junior counsel, where junior counsel claims a preparation fee as well is neither ‘just and reasonable’ in an award of costs. A clerk could have instructed.72 Witnesses expenses were claimed for Lisa Martin who apparently is employed by the local Rural Lands Protection Board and for Dr Doherty including $1,980 for him to travel to Tenterfield by aircraft. In my view witnesses expenses ought not be allowed. The claim for the cost of Chartered air travel by one witness is not just and reasonable in all the circumstances. No explanation was before the Magistrate in any intelligible way, as to why such expensive air travel was required in all the circumstances, notwithstanding the complaint of the defendant’s solicitor, in the context of the particulars supplied in the document provided to the Magistrate. In the context of the terms of s 215(1)(a) and the facts of the case I do not believe a claim for “witnesses expenses” was just and reasonable.73 Every case has to be decided on its own facts, in the context of the principles, which are laid down by superior courts. The exercise of a discretion to award costs on the basis of a sum that is “just and reasonable” will require consideration of a range of matters. Taking all matters into account, I would allow costs to the RSPCA in respect of the Local Court proceedings in the following amounts; solicitor’s fees in preparation for the hearing and attendance at court for the first two days in the sum of $2,512, representing elimination of travel time, and calculating the time rate at $150 an hour, to more closely represent party/party costs. As for the taking of judgment, given both counsel and solicitor perused the transcript the work of the solicitor in my view was unnecessary. I will allow one hour for preparation of the solicitor for the taking of judgment proceedings. Thus I will allow a further $150 for that. I will allow for counsel’s fees involving three attendances at court and preparation, $4,600 ($1,200 per day and $1,000 in preparation) plus GST. I will not allow travel time, I will allow transcript costs, costs of air travel and accommodation and car hire. As earlier indicated I query the need for solicitor and counsel to appear at Court, particularly on the last day, when judgment was handed down and sentencing and costs issues resolved. Thus I will effectively halve the disbursements claimed for the proceedings in January 2008. 74 I confirm the s 30A POCAA expenses of $5,388.76 
     
      
      Thus the total amount I would award as costs which are “just and reasonable” in this particular matter are as follows: $2,662 for solicitors’ costs (plus GST), $4,600 for counsel’s fees (plus GST) and disbursements in the sum of $4,553. This is a total of $12,681 (including GST) (subject to confirmation). 
      
    ORDERS:1. Appeal against finding of guilt re s 5(3) POCAA offence upheld. Charge dismissed, consequent orders quashed.2. Appeals against finding of guilt re s 8(1) matters (x 17) dismissed.I confirm convictions, quash the fines and moiety order but confirm the s 9 bond(s) ordered for these matters.I vary the s 31 order in terms to be advised.I award costs for the Local Court proceedings in the sum of $12,681(subject to confirmation).Cost of the appeal to be decided.

      2008/12423 R v Peter Reuben WEBB 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 1 December 2008 the offender, Peter Reuben Webb, pleaded guilty on arraignment to a charge that on 28 January 2007 he murdered the deceased, Mohammed Kader. A co-offender Michael John Jackson pleaded guilty to manslaughter arising from the killing of the deceased, this plea being accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of the indictment. The pleas of guilty came on what was to be the first day of a trial before a jury was empanelled. However, at a mention of the matter the previous week there was an indication that the offender was likely to plead guilty. The offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and there is an applicable standard non-parole period of twenty years. 
     
      
    2 At the sentencing hearing the Crown produced a certificate under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act in respect of an offence of being carried in a stolen conveyance. The offender acknowledged his guilt of that offence and, therefore, I am to sentence him for that matter as well as the murder. 
     
      
    3 An agreed statement of facts was handed up. I am required to sentence the offender in accordance with this document as no other material from the prosecution brief was tendered. A plan and some photographs of the restaurant were tendered so that I could better appreciate the facts contained in the statement. In a psychiatric report tendered on behalf of the offender there is an account given to the psychiatrist that is in a significant way inconsistent with the statement of facts placed before me. Counsel for the offender, Mr Stewart, conceded that I should ignore that account. 
     
      
    4 Briefly the facts are that the two offenders decided to commit a robbery on an Indian restaurant in Petersham. They arrived outside the restaurant in a car stolen about 24 hours earlier for this purpose. The offender Webb armed himself with a “club Lock” obtained from the vehicle. He entered the restaurant and walked to the far end of it where there was the entrance to the area behind the counter. The deceased was in that area washing dishes. The offender and the deceased became involved in a struggle for the club lock, during the course of which the deceased was struck to the head with the weapon. The offender then picked up a knife from the kitchen bench and stabbed the deceased twice to the abdomen. 
     
      
    5 While the offender was involved with the deceased, Jackson entered the premises and grabbed the cash register from the counter. He and the offender then fled from the restaurant. As they entered the stolen vehicle, the deceased, who had staggered from the restaurant clutching his abdomen, struck at the vehicle with the club lock. He then collapsed to the pavement. Paramedics later attended upon him but he was dead by the time he reached hospital. The offenders escaped with the cash register containing just over $600. 
     
      
    6 The deceased suffered a number of injuries including a blunt force injury to the head. He had four stab wounds to the neck area and two, which caused his death, to the abdomen. 
     
      
    7 About 8 hours after the robbery the stolen car was located in Newtown. The empty cash register was found nearby in a garbage bin. Not far away police located the cash drawer and the kitchen knife in a garden bed in front of a house. Fingerprint and DNA evidence identified the involvement of both offenders with the vehicle and hence the robbery at the restaurant. Telephone records linked the two offenders about the time of the robbery. 
     
      
    8 Jackson was arrested on 30 May 2007. After receiving legal advice he maintained his right to silence when interviewed by police. However a phone call between him and his de facto partner from gaol was intercepted and contained statements implicating him in the robbery. 
     
      
    9 This offender was at Bankstown Police Station on 1 June 2007 for unrelated matters. Conversations between him and an undercover police officer were lawfully recorded which contained statements implicating the offender in the killing. He was arrested on 4 June 2007 and declined to answer questions of police after receiving legal advice. 
     
      
    10 The offender was born on 27 October 1969 and hence is 39 years of age. He has a bad criminal record dating from 1984 when he was dealt with in the Childrens Court for stealing. Thereafter there are frequent convictions mainly for dishonesty matters. In 1992 he was sentenced in the District Court for robbery offences and received a relatively short gaol sentence given the nature of the charges. Thereafter he was dealt with in the Local Court for minor matters of dishonesty or street offences, for which he received short gaol sentences, almost continuously up until 1997. In that year he was sentenced in the District Court for offences of robbery with violence, stealing a motor vehicle and possessing implements. He was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years to date from 1 February 1997. In 1999 he was sentenced in the Local Court for stealing from the person and received a sentence with a non-parole period of 18 months. In 2002 he received a fixed term of 12 months for break and entering. In that year he was sentenced in the District Court to a prison term with a non-parole period of 2 years for assault with intent to rob. In June 2006 he was placed on a good behaviour bond for 12 months for the offence of larceny. He was subject to that bond and another for assault when he murdered the deceased. 
     
      
    11 The offender was the subject of a psychiatric report by Dr Allnutt dated November of this year. The report discloses that at the time of the killing the offender was living with his parents. He was taking a variety of substances including, amphetamine, cocaine, heroin and methadone. His history of drug abuse commenced in 1989. The offender is diabetic but, because of his use of drugs, it was not being controlled. The offender told Dr Allnutt that he had been having seizures since a stroke in 2003 but none since 2006. His mother in giving evidence indicated that the seizures had continued into 2007. The offender told the psychiatrist that he had been suicidally depressed and having paranoid hallucinations. 
     
      
    12 The offender gave the psychiatrist a mental health history commencing with a referral to a psychiatrist in 1989 after the death of his brother. He related four suicide attempts and a number of admissions to a psychiatric hospital, the last about a week before the offence. He has been diagnosed as suffering from epilepsy, diabetes and high blood pressure. There is nothing in his upbringing of any relevance except that he comes from a stable and loving family who still support him. He has had little employment and few stable relationships due to his drug usage. 
     
      
    13 The psychiatrist concluded the offender was suffering “symptoms of an ‘underlying condition’, that being fluctuating mood, anxiety and fluctuating psychotic symptoms aggravated by chronic but persistent substance abuse, intoxication and withdrawal”. Apart from the fact that the offender abuses illegal substances, there is no apparent nexus between any underlying condition and the offences he has committed. 
     
      
    14 There was also a report from a psychologist. Testing of the offender revealed that he fell well within the Extremely Low range of intellectual functions and that he met the criterion on his IQ score of Mild Intellectual Disability. There is no suggestion that his offending on this occasion, or on others in his past, is related to his psychological level of functioning. 
     
      
    15 The offender’s mother gave evidence. She is a highly articulate and, no doubt, intelligent woman. As the psychiatrist noted, there is not the slightest suggestion that anything in the offender’s upbringing has led to his abuse of drugs and resultant serious criminal behaviour. His mother described the difficulties the offender experienced at school and his learning disabilities. However, his father succeeded in finding him work with the local council. The applicant told the psychiatrist that he stopped working to take up a disability pension. His mother thought that he lost the job because of his drug taking. As would be expected from such caring parents they tried to assist him by taking him to a drug rehabilitation centre in the north of the State earlier in his addiction. However the offender left almost immediately his parents were gone and, according to his mother, beat them back to Sydney. 
     
      
    16 One of the offender’s elder brothers died in tragic circumstances when the offender was aged 26. This affected the whole family but the offender in particular and there followed a number of suicide attempts over the next 12 months. One of those led to his first admission to a psychiatric hospital. Shortly before the murder the offender’s parents had been away and when they returned his behaviour had deteriorated and he had become withdrawn, apparently because of drug usage. 
     
      
    17 As I pointed out to his counsel, although the offender was not blessed with even average intelligence, he was very fortunate in that he had a stable and loving upbringing with his parents unlike many of his race. His parents have always supplied him with accommodation and support whenever he is not in custody. 
     
      
    18 The offence is a serious one. It is aggravated by the use of a knife although this was a weapon that came to hand when he was finding himself struggling to overcome the deceased. Still he entered the restaurant with a weapon capable of causing significant harm and he used it at some stage to strike his victim. Although the murder was not planned the assault upon the victim that led to the killing was part of a planned criminal activity. Although Mr Stewart disputed that this aggravating factor applied, it matters little seeing that the murder occurred in the course of a serious offence of armed robbery. The most seriously aggravating factors were the offender’s record and that he was subject to bonds for assault and for dishonesty. This is clearly a situation where his criminal record does more than deprive him of leniency. The murder occurred while he was carrying out an offence of the type that he has committed on a number of occasions and for which he has been sentenced to gaol. 
     
      
    19 To some extent individual and general deterrence are not so significant as would have been the case if the offence for which he was being sentenced were simply another robbery. The offender has now entered into a different class of offending, the worst type. He has taken another life by violence and, if that does not teach him to overcome his drug problems in the lengthy period he has before him in custody, then there is little that rehabilitation or deterrent sentencing can do. He is no longer a young man and when he will be released, even at the earliest available date, he will be well into the latter part of middle age. Unfortunately, it may be that his parents are no longer able to physically assist him as they have done in the past. It is a very bleak picture and it is impossible for me to form any view about his prospects for rehabilitation despite some apparent insight into his conduct and its effect upon others. 
     
      
    20 The only matter of any significant mitigation is his plea of guilty. Even though it occurred very late, the Crown accepts that, so far as this offender was concerned, it knew well in advance of the trial that the only possible issue to be litigated was whether a defence of substantial impairment was available. A discount of 15 per cent seems to be appropriate. The fact that the offender pleaded guilty has the result that the standard non-parole provisions do not strictly apply. Although the offender has had some mental health issues they do not seem to me to amount to the type of mental illness whereby this court would mitigate the sentence either by reduced culpability or the need to give less weight to general deterrence.21 However it is still necessary to consider the specified standard non-parole period as a benchmark or guide. Objectively this was an offence just below mid-range of seriousness because the weapon taken into the robbery was not one that would normally result in the infliction of death and the knife was, as I have indicated, by chance available to the offender during the struggle with the deceased. I am unable to determine how the other wounds came to be inflicted upon the deceased. 
     
      
    22 However there are present aggravating factors in that the offender had a serious criminal record for robberies and that he was subject to conditional liberty at the time of the offending. I do not believe that there are any special circumstances but in any event the application of the statutory ratio will result in a sufficiently lengthy period of parole for the applicant to be supervised and assisted when released and there is no other reason to reduce the non-parole period. I have allowed a discount of just over 15 per cent for the plea of guilty. The overall sentence will be one of imprisonment for 22 years. 
     
      
    23 The sentence for the offence of being carried in a conveyance should be a fixed term to be served concurrently so serious is the murder offence and so lengthy the sentence imposed. For that offence the offender is sentenced to 18 months imprisonment to date from 18 April 2007 and expired on 17 October 2008. 
     
      
    24 For the offence of murder the offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 16 years 6 months to date from 18 April 2007 and to expire on 17 October 2023, the date upon which the offender is eligible to be released to parole. There is a balance of term of 5 years 6 months from 18 October 2023. 
     
      
    25 You might tell your client the effect of those sentences and that 16 years and 6 months is a good deal less than the standard non-parole period of 20 years and I imposed that because of his plea of guilty, mental problems and other matters.

   JUDGMENT 1. In April of 2007 Hilal Abbas was a diagnosed schizophrenic. His schizophrenia was sufficiently florid for him to be in receipt of a disability support pension. While it is not clear over what period of time Hilal Abbas had been diagnosed, his visits to his psychiatrist had ceased some 18 months before this offending. It would seem that shortly after these visits to his psychiatrist stopped Hilal Abbas also stopped taking his medication. 2. As is not infrequently the case, the failure of Mr Abbas to take his medication makes him dangerously ill-equipped to handle stress. When taking his medication he can function normally. In the absence of medication he is potentially lethal. 3. Rabbih Obeide, apparently a young employee at the Woolworths Auburn store, found out to his horror how unpredictably dangerous an unmedicated schizophrenic can be when he was gratuitously punched and then knifed in the upper left side of his stomach region by Hilal Abbas who was simply upset by the quality of fruit on offer at Woolworths. 4. On 7 December 2007 Hilal Abbas began the process of being accountable for his criminal conduct at the Auburn Woolworths store on 18 April 2007. 5. On 7 December last year he adhered to his plea of guilty earlier entered before Magistrate Mottley at the Burwood Local Court on 26 September 2007. 6. On that day he pleaded guilty to maliciously wounding Rabbih Obeide. There was also an offence of having custody of an offensive weapon in a public place. That also must be finalised pursuant to section 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 7. As sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing contentions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for this offence, for this court, committed by this offender, harming this victim in this community; R v Gladue (1999) 1SCR 688 [80]. 8. My initial task requires the assessment of the objective criminality of the offence before the court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender, the subjective matters. 9. The starting point for any assessment requires me to make findings of fact in the evidence before the court available to the offence and to the offender. 10. The offender's rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed even if looking through a glass darkly. Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts, whether a non-parole is to be set, the section 166 matter that I earlier referred to and ultimately the length of terms of imprisonment that are to be imposed. None of these can be commenced until the primary facts are determined. 11. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community will also need to be determined; see R v Cuthbert (1967) 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby (1977) NSWLR 597, R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740. The facts12. A statement of facts has been tendered by the Crown. There has been no attempt by the defence to quibble with any aspect of the allegations made in the statement of facts. A reading through of the DPP's statement of facts makes clear it is a cut and paste job from a number of eye witnesses who in this case do not agree. Of course, I must find a set of facts from that material rather than leave it indeterminate as it appears in the exhibit. 13. For my purpose and for the purpose of sentencing, the statements of fact I find are these: On Wednesday 18 April 2007 Hilal Abbas attended Woolworth’s store at Auburn with his girlfriend and his then one year old son, who was in the stroller. Rabbih Obeide was employed as a produce manager at Woolworths Auburn. Abbas began to complain about the quality of fruit in the store saying, ""The fruit is shit."" Obeide said, ""If the fruit is shit, don't buy it."" That remark triggered a response in Abbas who approached Obeide and punched him in the face knocking his glasses from his face. 14. It would seem that prior to that approach Abbas had thrown some fruit at Obeide. There may have been a headbutt by the offender upon Obeide and then followed a scuffle. There was screaming, there was pushing from side to side, and each of the men was holding the other by his shirt. 15. Abbas was able to grab hold of Obeide's head and place him, as it were, in a headlock under his left armpit. He reached into a black bumbag around his waist, took out a 20 cm knife from the bag and stabbed the sharp end into the left side of Obeide. The knife was then withdrawn. 16. The stab wound was to the left side, of Obeide's abdomen. It went deep enough to separate the dermis and epidermis, but missed any vital organs penetrating no more than soft tissue. The offender was detained by a security guard and the knife was surrendered by Abbas after a short discussion. 17. Upon arrival of the police and his formal arrest by them, the offender participated in a record of interview. He told police he carried the knife for personal protection intending to use it ""to scare people off"". He agreed to throwing lychees at Obeide prior to any physical altercation. He agreed he headbutted and threw a punch with the knife in his hand. Plainly that had occurred before they started to wrestle. My view is it occurred towards the end of the wrestling. Significantly, though, as I say, he did agree that he had stabbed Obeide. 18. He then went on to say that he did not know that he had stabbed him at the time until the lady came and said that he had been stabbed. 19. Abbas also says that there was a size difference between he and the man he attacked. I have not seen a full frame picture of Mr Obeide, although from what pictures I do see, he seems to be heavy set. But my memory of Mr Abbas, when I first saw him was that he was relatively heavy set at that time too. More than that I cannot say about the size of the two men. Objective criminality 20. From the facts as he finds them to be, a sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offences as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of this offender. The way that is done is to compare objectively the criminality exhibited in this case against the criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in that which the objective seriousness of criminality to this offence can be evaluated. The objective criminality has an important impact upon the overall sentencing outcome. Indeed, as I said to the offender before I began these remarks, it is the objective criminality, that is the stabbing and circumstances in which it occurred, that requires a sentence of imprisonment to be imposed. 21. The starting point is to understand that all men and women are entitled to the integrity of their body and any assault upon the person of another is anti-social conduct. That anti-social conduct becomes increased where that assault results in a wounding. Where that wounding is done by the use of a weapon the anti-social content of the behaviour is even further increased. It is the nature of the criminal law that it seeks to punish anti-social behaviour such as that. 22. I am satisfied the knife was produced from Abbas' bumbag after the altercation had begun. It is described as a 20 cm knife, which must mean that the blade was something in the region of 10 cm. 23. As I say, I am unable to determine with any precision the depth to which the knife was thrust into Obeide. It is said to have passed between the dermis and epidermis. In the absence of expert evidence I cannot say what that means in centimetres. What is clear is that it penetrated deep enough potentially to have caused serious injury to important bodily organs, for example, the kidney or the liver.24. Nor have I been informed as to the treatment necessary in this case, although I have assumed some medical attention including a cleansing of the wound, suturing and tetanus injections were at least required. I am also uninformed as to the sequelae of the injury and to what extent it meant that Mr Obeide needed to take time off work or any other measure of inconvenience to him. 25. Although the two men were scuffling when the knife was produced, I am satisfied its production was not required for any reasons related to self-defence. 26. Hilal Abbas commenced the aggressive behaviour by throwing lychees at Obeide and punching him to his face and commencing to wrestle with him. Nonetheless, the criminality I am dealing with is less than had the offender's first reaction to Obeide's retort, ""If the fruit is shit, don't buy it,"" been to commence immediately his attack upon Obeide with the knife. I am satisfied the offender's gross over-reaction to the retort by Obeide was contributed to, if not caused by, the offender's then untreated schizophrenic condition. It is unfortunate no mental health profile was conducted upon this offender at or near the time of the offence. 27. In December of 2007 Abbas had elevated mood, heightened activity levels, irritability, impatience, a heightened paranoia score, impulsive and increased levels of anti-social features. I am prepared to postulate from the December profile coupled with his substantial untreated status in April of 2007 and his otherwise unaccountable reaction that his mental health was in equal disarray when he committed this offence. 28. Further, his heightened irritability, impatience and impulsivity contributed to his loss of composure, his throwing fruit and his unwarranted punch. 29. The offence was unplanned, impulsive and reactive. There are mental health issues impacting upon the offender's decision to act with the malice that he exhibited towards Mr Obeide. Of concern is that a person lacking mental stability was in possession of a knife in a public place. The potential for danger to unsuspecting innocent persons including Obeide was palpably real. I have determined, as I said, that a sentence of imprisonment is required in light of those objective features. Subjective features 30. I turn now to the subjective factors. I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence, but I am also sentencing this offender for it. Each offender coming before the court varies from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to an offender may offer to the court some explanation and insight into the commission of this offence by this offender. That is a particularly important situation in this case. There is clearly some reason why a less sentencing outcome is appropriate than a full-time custodial outcome arising from the subjective features. Background, social dynamics, relationships 31. Hilal Abbas is the fifth of seven siblings. He is now 26 years of age. He resides with his mother and sister in the suburb of Granville where he has lived all these past 14 years. That relationship within the family is supportive. He does not seem to communicate much with other relatives and does not consider anyone to be a significant other besides his girlfriend and his son.32. The offender's father did gaol time, although for what offence is not revealed but I suspect it may be related to domestic violence. Once released from prison the father returned to Lebanon. Abbas has not spoken to his father since he moved from Lebanon. That does not, it would seem, mean that his father is out of his mind. There are still unresolved issues in relation to the parent’s breakdown in marriage, which apparently occurred when he was in his teens and he appears to be heavily effected by it. There is also, I think, some anger that has been suggested to relate to the absence of support from the father and perhaps unresolved issues between the son and father. 33. About three or four years ago he met his girlfriend. The relationship developed and a son, Noah, was born. Noah is, as I say, a very significant person in the eyes of his own father and the source of happiness for him.34. The girlfriend and Abbas do not live together but separately. As best I can tell, the relationship is at least functional to the extent that they are from time to time together. In December last year they were visiting each other on a daily basis. He does not appear to have support or associates outside the family, although he was involved in Australian Poker League last year, which is of course classified now as a sport that has gained significant popularity.Education skills and employment35. He completed primary education at Auburn Public and then went to Granville Boys High. He left this school in year 10 in 1998. He gained work in bricklaying for about six months and then roof tiling for a couple of months. He left Sydney to work in a tobacco farm in Albury, returned three years later and worked in a number of casual jobs. Most recently he has been involved in carpet laying for two to three days weekly and the last pre-sentence report notes it is anticipated once the Court proceedings are finalised a full-time position would become available. It is indicated that he would take up a full-time employment position.General health36. When Hilal Abbas first entered his plea before this Court he appeared to be in poor general physical condition. He was unresponsive to events in Court with eyes downcast. He was difficult to engage. Even his own legal team seemed to have difficulties obtaining responses from him. By contrast, after a hearing on s11 bail, he appears to be in better physical shape. He has engaged in proceedings and willing to stand from his seat in the well of the Court and address the Court. From my perspective that is a remarkable change for the better.Mental health issues37. Again, the starting point to last year was an unresponsive, unmedicated schizophrenia. While there is no formal diagnosis before me, the author of the pre-sentence report of December last year spoke to his treating psychiatrist who apparently gave to that author the diagnosis.38. Hilal Abbas was referred to a personal support programme by Centrelink psychologist in November of last year and was assessed then as suffering from anger management issues, personal social difficulties relating to his child born out of wedlock, which because of culture his family regard as a sensitive issue. There are literacy and numeracy issues and poor communication issues. That appears to have improved. Generalise anxiety and poor impulse control. He attended his monthly session and was dealing with his issues with a caseworker, Christopher Koletti.39. John Jacmon, a consultant psychiatrist, has had eight treatment sessions over the past 12 months in which the issues of depression, anxiety and anger management were covered. Jacmon recommends quarterly consultation to maintain the progress thus far made. In the order for the s12 bond that I intend to give, that will be a condition of the bond.40. A condition of the s11 bail was the daily taking of medication. Initially, I required photos taken daily to prove the consumption of the prescribed medication. His sister and mother, daily oversaw Abbas’s consumption of medication. That regime was changed to an observation by the sister of the daily ritual and more recently a requirement simply that medication be taken.41. The improvements in his demeanour are so remarkable that I am confident Hilal Abbas understands and appreciates them and will continue to take the medication to maintain or perhaps even improve his current situation.Contrition42. As is often the case where mental health issues play a part, the offender has difficulty understanding his criminality or understanding the impact his offending conduct must have had upon his victim. While I accept he understands it is legally wrong to stab an employee of Woolworths while shopping for groceries, his mental issues are blocking his path to recognising why that sort of conduct is so reprehensible. Character43. The offender is still a young man of 26. He is secure within his family. He is a devoted father to his boy Noah. He is now enjoying better health and pursuing strategies to maintain it. He has begun to make a contribution to the community through carpet laying. His criminal antecedents are minor. Three matters at the Burwood Local Court dismissed in 2003 pursuant to s10; significantly, though, one of those matters is custody of a knife in a public place. 44. As I earlier mentioned, Mr Abbas pleaded guilty to this offence at the outset in September of 2007. He is entitled to a benefit for that. The benefit that he will be given is not a discount as frequently happens but a suspended sentence rather than a period of full-time custody.Rehabilitation prospects45. If the appellant should continue to improve in the next 12 months as he has in the past, I am confident that he is unlikely to reoffend. The underscoring of that rehabilitation has been the consumption daily of his medication. Flowing from that better general feeling has been, a greater involvement with others and now the first steps taken towards working on a full-time basis and becoming what we would call, to use a cliché, a productive member of the community.Deterrence of setting sentence46. Given the mental health issues in this case, the issue of general deterrence does not loom as large as it normally would. However, Mr Abbas's intellect and mental health situation is such that he can understand personal deterrence and the sentence that I have set, that is one of imprisonment, is meant to indicate to him that in the event that he should do anything that is not of good behaviour in the next 12 months he will go to gaol.47. Stand up please, Mr Abbas.48. I should have already convicted you of this offence in order to give you the s11 bail. Hilal Abbas, you are convicted of the crime that you between 1.48 and 2.30pm on 18 April 2007 at Auburn maliciously wounded Rabbih Obeide. For that offence I take into account all you have done on the s11 bail I have given you. Nonetheless you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months. That sentence is suspended upon condition that you enter into a bond to be of good behaviour. There are three conditions of the bond I impose and two that statute impose. The first, you will be of good behaviour; the second is that you will daily consume your medication as you have been doing for the next 12 months; the third is that you will consult four times annually with Dr Jacmon. Are you prepared to do those things? OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. HIS HONOUR: In that case there are only two other conditions you need to know about. The first is that you have to provide the Registry with your address, upstairs, that is not hard. The second is that in the event that you do commit an offence, I do not think you will, but in the event you do, you have to come back before me and we will then sort out the matter. I should indicate that I am not setting a fixed term which leaves open that I can set a non-parole period if I have to send you to gaol. The second thing is if you do breach the bond my capacity to do anything else but send you to gaol becomes very, very limited because the Act requires that I send you to gaol, so there is no second chances.49. The sentence is suspended conditional upon you entering into a bond containing the conditions I put pursuant to s12. In respect of the 166 matter, I set a fixed term of three months imprisonment suspended. Again, conditional upon you entering into a bond. I think you have to enter two bonds; the first one finishes in three months and the second one finishes in 12 months. Do you think you can do this? OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour; thank you very much. HIS HONOUR: I have seen big improvements. I do not think you have stopped improving because the improvements I noticed mostly have been the last six-months. I think the next six or eight months you will be a different man.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Joshua Tate appears for sentence today on two separate offences of break enter and steal. When I sentence him for the first of those committed on 3 October 2006, he asks that I take into account a number of other matters also of aggravated break enter and steal. They appear on a Form 1. The circumstance of aggravation of each of the two offences on the indictment and all of the offences on the Form 1 is that the offender was in company at the time he committed these offences.2 These aggravated break enter and steal offences carry with them a standard non-parole period of five years. Of course given the circumstance that the offender pleaded guilty the standard non-parole period is not of direct application but it remains as an important guidepost which I should bear in mind when I assess the appropriate sentence for each of the offences.3 The fact that aggravated break enter and steal offences appear in a list of matters carrying a standard non-parole period suggests that Parliament was concerned to ensure that those who commit offences of this kind are adequately punished. There is the unfortunate problem that because offences such as this have become so commonplace that their perceived seriousness is reduced. For years the court of Criminal Appeal has been emphasising the seriousness of offences such as these and the consequences for the community generally of their regular commission. Those are matters I will also bear in mind when I formulate the appropriate sentences.4 The offender, who was working, was living with two mates who were not. For reasons which are not entirely clear, he and his co-offenders found themselves in the early hours of 3 October 2006 at the Scone Race Club. The club was to hold a race meeting a few days later and so the club had brought in a lot of extra alcohol. The offender and his two mates decided that they would break into the club and steal a lot of the property inside it. It was not the offender’s ute so he does not know what the jemmy bar was doing in the back of the ute but that was what was used to break the lock on the club door. Once inside they were able to remove a large quantity of alcohol. They also took a television and moved, and so technically stole, another one. There is some difference between the Crown and the accused as to precisely what was taken but there is no doubt that there was a large quantity of alcohol stolen. Taking into account the alcohol and the two televisions, the value of the property was in the order of $11,000. Fortunately the offender left behind one of his thumb prints and so he was soon shown to be one of those involved.5 It was said that this offence was not a planned one. The offender gave evidence and there is nothing to contradict him that he and his mates went out to do doughnuts rather than going out to commit this offence. On the other hand it must also be recalled that they took so much stuff that it took them two trips to take the booty away from the club and get it back to their home. So whilst perhaps the initial breaking and entering was not planned, the stealing was as it required the transport of a large quantity of alcohol over two separate trips. A lot of that was given away and some of it was drunk but when police went to the accused’s premises later on and took photographs of the alcohol that was left, it was apparent that stealing that quantity of alcohol was a significant endeavour,6 Whatever can be said about the spur of the moment decision to commit the offence on the Scone Race Club, the same cannot be said about the other offences. It was not too long before the offender committed the first of his offences at the Scone TAFE. He and his two mates broke into the building by smashing a window and from there they took a computer system including a printer. The system was valued at $2,500 and the damage was assessed at $1,600. That offence is the first appearing on the Form 1.7 Next the offenders turned their attentions to the Scone Soccer Club. To get in, they had to remove a section of the roof and knock a hole through the plaster ceiling. Once there they stole soccer balls, a gas cylinder, three boxes of potato chips, some Mars Bars, Wagon Wheels, and other lollies. The property stolen was not greatly valuable, $300. Presumably those who conducted their sporting activities at the Scone Soccer Club were somewhat disappointed to discover that someone living in their community would do what the offender and his mates did. What they were going to do with eighteen soccer balls is a bit of a mystery.8 One of the matters to be taken into account in assessing the seriousness of an offence of break enter and steal, is according to the R v Ponfield48 NSWLR 327 guideline judgment, whether there were repeat entries into the same premises. I mention that factor now because on 24 October the offender and his mates were again at the Scone TAFE. This time they had to smash a hole in a gyprock wall. Once inside they stole a large amount of electrical equipment, two data projectors, a laptop computer, two digital cameras and a video camera. The items were valued at about $9,000 and the cost of the damage was about $3,500.9 It is important to note at this stage that what they were doing was to steal valuable education equipment. It is not a case that the only people who suffered were one or two people who owned the TAFE premises. All of those who were educated at the TAFE who needed that equipment would have suffered as a result of the offenders’ misconduct. On the same night as going to the TAFE the offenders also went to a storage container at the rear of a shop. Using bolt cutters they cut five steel padlocks and from the storage container they stole a number of items suitable for giving as gifts. They were not terribly valuable, about $300, and the cost of the damage was $500. That offence also appears on the Form 1.10 The same night as doing the TAFE and the storage container, the offenders went to the local Scone Target store. They got inside by removing a roof panel and they took from both the store and a container outside, a large number of video game consoles, a large number of games, DVDs, and other valuable electrical equipment. These items were valued at about $6,000. Once again they caused damage in the order of $1,000.11 All of the property, apart from the alcohol which as I mentioned was either given away or drunk, was kept in the offender’s premises. Police went there on 25 October and discovered the proceeds of the various offences. 12 The offender was much less than frank with police, providing a false alibi. He lied to them saying that he was the rightful owner of some of the items identified as being stolen. What eventually led to the offender being detected was that one of his co-offenders dobbed him in, presumably once the co-offender was told that the offender was blaming him. Then the alibis were investigated and it was shown that they were false. There was a statement from a former girlfriend of the offender to whom he had made some admissions. And of course there was the fingerprint that I mentioned found at the Scone Race Club. Given this accumulation of evidence against him, it is not surprising that eventually the offender pleaded guilty. It was not a plea of guilty entered at the first opportunity and indeed was only entered after efforts to mislead the police had failed. Nevertheless it was not a late plea either and I will discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed, that is the overall sentence on these two matters by nine months to reflect the plea of guilty and when it was entered.13 The offender, is like most people in the community, a person who is capable of being kind and doing good works. References tendered on his behalf suggest that that is the case. There are very few people in the community who are not able to say that they have done some kindness to a neighbour or a family member in the past. Nevertheless despite such references being commonplace I will take into account that there is a lot to be said in favour of the offender. The fact that he was working at the time of these offences is an important matter.14 The offender has only one matter on his criminal history which post-dates these offences, an offence of goods in custody. The most relevant aspect of that offence is the response of the offender to the bond that he was put on for that offence. The pre-sentence report tendered before me today notes that although the offences for which I must sentence him occurred before the offence for which he was put on a bond and thus they are not a breach of that bond. Due to his poor response to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service breach action had been instigated.15 The offender told the author of the Probation and Parol report that he had a normal upbringing and had a close relationship with his parents. There is clearly a possibility that the offender’s involvement in these matters was that he was dragged into them by the other two offenders but it would be exaggerating matters considerably from the material before me to say that he was a reluctant participant. There is no suggestion at all as to who the ringleader was and as to whose suggestion it was to commit the offences and on the material before me all three of them are equally culpable.16 The offender reported being bullied in his early school years and at one stage there was thought to be a problem with ADHD symptoms. He was assessed by a psychiatrist in 2002 and found to have mild ADHD. 17 There are prospects for the future, and prospects for the offender’s rehabilitation. He presents in the witness box as a young man who is going to make efforts to avoid further offending in the future although that is difficult to reconcile with his response to the Probation and Parole Service attempts at supervising him. I cannot find that his prospects of rehabilitation are good or that he is unlikely to re-offend. Perhaps the most important thing in considering the likelihood that he will offend in the future is the deterrent nature of the sentence which I will shortly impose upon him. He accurately said that gaol is a place where the worst type of people is to be found. Gaols are truthfully terrible places and although that aspect of incarceration is not a purpose of incarceration, it cannot be denied that one of the matters which will exercise the offender’s mind in the future when he considers whether to commit further offences are the prospects of returning to such a terrible place.18 I am required to assess the objective gravity of these two offences on the indictment and in particular where they appear in the range of objective seriousness. I consider that both of them are slightly below the middle of the range. I take into account that the offence of break enter and commit an indictable offence can be committed by the commission of other forms of indictable offences other than stealing, that the premises broken into were not residential premises and there was no prospect of anyone being at home at the time. On the other hand as I mentioned, the quantity of property involved was considerable in relation to the first count and involved the educational equipment of the community in the second count. For those reasons I am unable to find that as Mr Torpey suggested, the objective gravity of these matters was well below the middle of the range.19 Mr Torpey referred to the conditions of bail the offender has been on until he was put into custody on 26 September 2008. He had to report daily and was subject to a curfew. As I understood the law, those conditions of bail were not such that they would affect in any way the sentence to be imposed upon the offender but Mr Torpey referred me to sentences of the former CJ at common law where reporting and a curfew were taken into account albeit in a relatively minor way. I will take therefore the conditions of bail into account but they are one of a large number of factors affecting the appropriate sentence to be imposed.20 The offender is eligible according to the Probation and Parole Service for periodic detention but given the length of the sentence that I will impose upon him, periodic detention is not an option.21 These were all offences committed against the community. The Form 1 matters suggest that there needs to be a longer sentence on count 1 to reflect the need for retribution and personal deterrence, the retribution being particularly appropriate given the number of offences and the fact that as I have just said, they were committed with the community at large as their victims. Because of the Form 1 offences, the sentence on the first count will be longer than the sentence on the second.22 For the first count, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of eighteen months to date from 26 September 2008. I set a total sentence on that count of three years.23 For count 2 on the indictment the offender is sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of one year to date from 26 September 2009 and to expire on 25 September 2010 and an overall sentence of two years three months on count 2. Which means I think that there is an overall period of imprisonment of two years with a three year three month non-parole period.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Conlon DCJ in Wollongong District Court. The applicant was arrested on 7 February 2007 and charged with offences which I will shortly detail. He has been in custody since that date. He pleaded guilty to charges in Wollongong Local Court on 18 July 2007, which his Honour found was the earliest opportunity so to do. The three victims were therefore spared the potential ordeal of giving evidence about what they had suffered. 
     
      
    3 The applicant was born on 26 July 1963 and is now aged 45. In about 1987 he formed a relationship with a woman (M) who already had a son (JC) born on 9 June 1981 and a daughter (MC) born 4 October 1983. The new relationship resulted in the birth of two further children, a daughter (CW) born on 1 November 1987 and a son (JW) born on 6 April 1989.  
     
      
    4 It is apparent that the household was other than a zone of contentment. His Honour found that the applicant drank alcohol to excess and was a heavy user of cannabis. He was physically abusive to M and physically and emotionally abusive to the children. He was for most of the time unemployed but M worked at two jobs, in a local chicken shop and as a cleaner. M’s employments required her to work into the evenings and more often than not the children were in the care and custody of the applicant in those hours.  
     
      
    5 Upon arrest the applicant, in accordance with his entitlement, declined to be interviewed by police. He chose not to give evidence in the sentencing proceedings. An affidavit by him was filed but he did not refer to the circumstances of the offences. There was some history given to Dr Allnutt, a psychiatrist who saw the applicant on two occasions in October and November 2007. There was also before his Honour the Justice Health file and this contained a report by a Mr O’Driscoll, a clinical nurse consultant. Mr O’Driscoll had the police fact sheet but did not canvass the detail in his interview with the applicant which took place on 6 March 2007. Mr O’Driscoll was responding to a request from the Local Court for a report concerning the applicant’s mental health. Save what might be gleaned from the opinions formed upon the limited source material, there was no explanation for the applicant’s criminal conduct. 
     
      
    6 His Honour expressed a conclusion about the objective seriousness of the offences in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The objective seriousness of these offences is patently obvious. He has used his own daughter, his stepdaughter and stepson, as objects for his sexual gratification over a span of years dating from 1989 to 2001. He has also abused his position of trust in the worst possible way. His use of the complainants as sex objects, commenced when they were but mere children and continued on into their teenage years.” 
        
       
      
    7 That undoubtedly accurate statement by its brevity cloaks somewhat the enormity of the applicant’s persistent predatory attacks on the children. His Honour recounted detail in his remarks on sentence elsewhere and from them counsel for the applicant has constructed a summary which it is useful to reproduce: 
     
      
       
        
        “The first three counts in the indictment are in respect of (CW). Count 1 is sexual intercourse child under ten years of age (s 66A). 
        
       
       
        
        In 1995 the complainant was eight years old. She was at her home on an evening when her mother was at work. She was in the bath when the offender entered the bathroom. There was no lock on the bathroom door. He knelt down beside the bath and commenced to stroke the complainant’s vagina. He was also kissing the breast area of the complainant. She was upset at what was happening and she felt pain to the vaginal area. She said to the offender, ‘I don’t like this, it hurts.’ He removed his finger and left the bathroom. 
        
       
       
        
        The next matter is the matter on Form 1, in respect of (CW), aggravated act of indecency (s 610(1)). 
        
       
       
        
        In 1997 the complainant was ten years old. One evening she was in the bathroom of the family home having a shower. The offender has entered the bathroom and pulled open the shower curtain to reveal the complainant standing there naked. He said to the complainant, ‘You’re growing up, your boobs are getting bigger, you have a good body.’ He then uncovered his penis and made the complainant touch his penis. At this time the offender was also touching his penis. The complainant was also touching his penis at this time and she remembers the offender ejaculating. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2, aggravated act of indecency (s 610(1)). 
        
       
       
        
        In 2000 the complainant was thirteen to fourteen years old. At that time she was playing representative soccer for the Wollongong Wolves ladies team. The offender drove the complainant to a match in Sydney. After the match he was driving back towards Wollongong along the F6 freeway. He left the F6 and drove to the Mt Keira Lookout. He drove to a very secluded area where he stopped the vehicle. The complainant was terrified of what was going to happen to her in this secluded area. She remembers seeing condoms and toilet paper in the glove box of the car. The offender has exposed his erect penis in the car. He then made the complainant masturbate him with her hand while sitting in the car. The complainant recalls the offender has ejaculated on her hands. The complainant used the toilet paper to clean his semen from her hand. She claims to have felt scared and angry at this time. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3, aggravated sexual assault (s 61J(1)). 
        
       
       
        
        In 2001 the complainant was fourteen to fifteen years old. After a training session at Albion Park with the Wollongong Wolves ladies soccer team, the offender drove the complainant to a secluded area. She remembers there were no streetlights, it was very dark and it looked like a construction area. He stopped the vehicle in what she believed was a dead-end road. The offender has then made the complainant remove her pants. He then touched her on the vaginal area before inserting his finger into her vagina. The complainant was very scared at this time and has attempted to get out of the car. The offender has leant across her and kept the door closed. He then placed the front passenger seat in the recline position and forced the complainant to lean back on the car seat. The offender has then leant down and began licking the complainant’s vagina with his tongue. The complainant kept telling the offender to stop what he was doing but he continued to lick her vagina. He then lay on top of the complainant. She could feel that his penis was erect. He then placed his erect penis on her vagina. He attempted to penetrate her vagina. He did not fully insert his penis into her vagina but the end of his penis did penetrate her vagina. He then stopped what he was doing. At this time the complainant was very scared, crying and bewildered at what her natural father was doing to her. 
        
       
       
        
        The next four counts are in respect of (MC). Count 4, sexual intercourse, child under ten years of age (s 66A). 
        
       
       
        
        In 1989 the complainant was six years old. On one evening at the family home, the offender called the complainant to the bathroom. When she entered she saw the offender sitting on the toilet with his pants around his feet. He asked her to get him a roll of toilet paper, which she did. After handing the toilet roll to the offender she has attempted to leave the bathroom. The offender has leant forward and taken hold of the complaint’s (sic) arm and stopped her from leaving the bathroom. He then said, ‘Let me look at it and touch it, let me see it.’ The offender has pulled down the complaint’s (sic) pants and started to rub the complainant’s vagina with his fingers. He then placed his finger inside the complaint’s (sic) vagina. The complainant felt pain when he was penetrating her vagina with his fingers. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 5, sexual intercourse child under ten years (s 66A). 
        
       
       
        
        In 1989/1990, the complainant was six/seven years old. The complainant remembers one evening when she was at home with the offender. He was in the bathroom when she heard a knock on the wall and he asked her to get him some toilet paper. She got the toilet paper and walked into the toilet, where she saw the offender sitting on the toilet. She handed him the toilet paper and attempted to leave the toilet. Before she could leave the offender took hold of her arm and stopped her from leaving. He then pulled down her pants and started rubbing her vagina with his fingers. The offender has then inserted a finger inside her vagina. The complainant felt pain when the finger was inserted inside her. On this occasion the complainant noticed the offender had an erect penis. He then lifted the complainant on to his lap, placed his erect penis inside her vagina. The complainant described feeling excruciating pain when the offender placed his penis inside her vagina. 
        
       
       
        
        The next matter is referrable to the Form 1 matter, aggravated sexual assault (s 61J(1)). 
        
       
       
        
        In 1996 the complainant was thirteen years old. She was at the family home with the offender one day when he told her to clean out a bird shed at the rear of the premises. The complainant has gone to the shed and was cleaning it when the offender has entered the shed. He said to the complainant, ‘Come here, tell me how much you love me.’ The complainant complied with the offender’s request because she felt scared. She told him, ‘I love you so much.’ With this the offender has taken hold of the complainant and pulled down her pants. He then bent her over at the waist and had sexual intercourse with her by inserting his penis into her vagina.  
        
       
       
        
        Count 6, aggravated sexual assault (s 61J(1)). 
        
       
       
        
        In 1998 the complainant was fourteen years old and about in August of that year, the offender has approached the complainant at the family home and forced her to have sexual intercourse with him. As a result of the penile/vaginal sexual intercourse, the complainant has fallen pregnant. The complainant gave birth to a son (N) on 1 June 1999 at Wollongong Hospital. The complainant has kept the child and he is not aware that the offender is his real father. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 7, sexual intercourse without consent (s 61I). 
        
       
       
        
        In 2000, the complainant was seventeen years old. At that time the offender was coaching a junior soccer team in which the complainant’s younger siblings were members. The complainant travelled with her sister (CW) and the offender to an area in Sydney for a match. They had a tent with them at that time and it was arranged for the two sisters to sleep in the tent and the offender would sleep in the motor vehicle. The tent was pitched and just before bed, the offender called the complainant to the motor vehicle. She got in the car and the offender said, ‘I’ll make love to you tonight.’ The complainant refused and told the offender that her sister was nearby. He told her that he would turn up the music on the radio and he also said, ‘If you don’t do it, I will go out to (CW).’ The complainant has then let the offender have sexual intercourse with her, in order to stop him from hurting and sexually assaulting her sister, who was about fourteen at the time of this incident. 
        
       
       
        
        The next matters are in respect of (JC). The first is the Form 1 matter, sexual assault, incite indecent assault under sixteen and under authority (s 61E). 
        
       
       
        
        In 1989, the complainant was eight years old. One evening the offender has called the complainant into the bathroom. When he entered the bathroom he saw the offender was in the bath and was laying there masturbating himself. The offender asked the complainant to pass him a block of soap. The complainant passed him the soap which he lathered in the water and used to continue masturbating his erect penis. He said to the complainant, ‘This is what boys do, to make themselves feel good.’ He told the complainant to masturbate him. The complainant did what he was asked and rubbed the offender’s erect penis. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 8, attempt homosexual intercourse with male between ten and eighteen years (s 78L). 
        
       
       
        
        In 1995, the complainant was fourteen years old. One evening the offender was watching a pornographic movie at the family home. The complainant made a cup of coffee for the offender and took it into the lounge room, where he was watching a pornographic video. The offender then directed the complainant to get on his hands and knees on the floor in front of him. The offender has got behind the complainant and attempted to insert his erect penis into the anus of the complaint (sic). The offender was unable to penetrate the complainant’s anus, so he then rubbed the complainant’s anus with his fingers. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 9, homosexual intercourse with male between ten and eighteen years (s 78N). 
        
       
       
        
        In 1996, the complainant was fifteen years old. One evening the complainant was asleep in his bed when he was awoken by the offender calling him to the lounge room. When the complainant entered the lounge room, he saw the offender laying naked on the lounge. He was masturbating his erect penis whilst watching a pornographic movie. He said to the complainant, ‘Come and suck it’. As a result, the complainant then carried out oral sex on the offender. He then said to the complainant, ‘Sit on it.’ After saying this, the offender has removed the complainant’s underpants and physically moved him to a position, where his backside was in front of his penis. He then held the complainant by the hips guided his erect penis into the complainant’s anus. He then moved the complainant’s head to his penis where he made him perform oral sex. The offender has the ejaculated into the mouth of the complainant, as well as on his face and neck. The offender handed the complainant a towel, which he used to clean himself before going back to bed.” 
        
       
      
    8 It should be observed that the circumstances of the child N born as a result of the offence charged in count 6 has a potential for further causative damage beyond the presently perceived consequences of the conduct of the applicant when the child may become aware at some time in the future of the criminal act by the applicant which led to his being. 
     
      
    9 The maximum penalties prescribed for the offences against various provisions of the Crimes Act 1900 referenced in the above are as follows: 
     
      
       
      Section 66A – 20 years imprisonment 
       
      Section 61O(1) – 5 years imprisonment 
       
      Section 61J(1) – 20 years imprisonment 
       
      Section 61I – 14 years imprisonment 
       
      Section 78L – 5 years imprisonment 
       
      Section 78N – 14 years imprisonment 
       
      
    10 His Honour imposed sentences in respect of the victim CW: 
     
      
       
      Count 1 (taking into account the Form 1 offence), imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 7 February 2007 and expiring on 6 February 2010 with a balance term of 2 years. 
       
       
      Count 2, a fixed term of 2 years imprisonment commencing on 7 February 2007 and expiring on 6 February 2009. 
       
       
      Count 3, imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 7 February 2009 and expiring on 6 February 2014 with a balance term of 3 years. 
       
      
    11 For the offences in respect of the victim MC: 
     
      
       
      Count 4, a fixed term of 4 years imprisonment commencing on 7 February 2014 and expiring on 6 February 2018. 
       
       
      Count 5, imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 7 February 2013 and expiring on 6 February 2018 with a balance term of 3 years. 
       
       
      Count 6 (taking into account the Form 1 offence), imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 6 years commencing on 7 February 2015 and expiring on 6 February 2021 with a balance term of 5 years. 
       
       
      Count 7, imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 7 February 2014 and expiring on 6 February 2019 with a balance term of 3 years. 
       
      
    12 For the offences in respect of the victim JC: 
     
      
       
      Count 8, a fixed term of 3 years imprisonment commencing on 7 February 2012 and expiring on 6 February 2015. 
       
       
      Count 9 (taking into account the Form 1 offence), imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 6 years commencing on 7 February 2011 and expiring on 6 February 2017 with a balance term of 3 years. 
       
      
    13 The overall practical effect of these impositions was to require a minimum term of custody for 14 years from the date of arrest with a balance term of 5 years. The structure was such that the sentences imposed for the offences in respect of which JC was the victim would be served wholly concurrently with the impositions for the offences upon the female victims, CW and MC. 
     
      
    14 The applicant has a significant record of prior offending and his Honour’s finding that it disentitled him to leniency was clearly open. The most serious prior matters were dealt with at Central Criminal Court on 21 October 1983 following charges which had been preferred on 14 November 1982. On the lastmentioned date the applicant would have been 19 years of age and the reference in the police print-out (repeated in the Particulars of Trial) to Central Children’s Court is an obvious error, apart from anything else, no Children’s Court could have imposed penal servitude. 
     
      
    15 The applicant received concurrent sentences of 5 years penal servitude for malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm and robbery with striking and wounding and a further 4 years penal servitude cumulative on those sentences for maliciously inflicting actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse. On two counts of sexual intercourse without consent the applicant was sentenced to 2 years penal servitude to be served concurrently with those and for a third offence of sexual intercourse without consent to 2 years penal servitude cumulated on the previous impositions. This amounted to an overall head sentence of 11 years with a non-parole period of 4 years being specified. 
     
      
    16 In addition, the applicant has been convicted of numerous offences including possessing and supplying prohibited drugs, cultivating cannabis, assault, contravening an apprehended violence order and serious traffic violations. 
     
      
    17 When the application was called on for hearing senior counsel for the applicant notified the Court that ground 1 which had asserted that the learned sentencing judge erred in his approach to the evidence of the applicant’s mental condition was no longer pressed.  
     
      
    18 The remaining ground 2 asserted that the learned sentencing judge failed to give full effect to his finding that there were special circumstances pertaining to the applicant’s sentencing. 
     
      
    19 It should be stressed that no submission was advanced that any individual sentence, nor the enveloping resultant total, was excessive and argument was limited in its focus to the consequential fact that the overall non-parole period, expressed as a ratio, was equivalent to just under 74 percent of the total term. 
     
      
    20 The effect of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is that, requiring a balance term not to exceed one-third of the non-parole period unless special circumstances are found and reasons given, in the absence of special circumstances a non-parole period would be equivalent to 75 percent of total term. 
     
      
    21 In his remarks on sentence his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I find special circumstances. I have considered not only the fact of the accumulation of the sentences but having regard to the reports of Stephen Allnutt and Mr Colman O’Driscoll and the conclusions and recommendations therein, the offender will require an extended period of supervision to assist in his rehabilitation.” 
        
       
      
    22 The argument of the applicant sought to deduce from the reference to special circumstances that his Honour had expressed an intention to set a non-parole period in relation to total term of less than 75 percent. It is contended that error can be identified because the “arithmetic” reveals the proportion to be just under 74 percent. 
     
      
    23 His Honour did not express an intention to achieve an overall non-parole period representing specifically less than 75 percent of total term. As above noted his stated intention was to create a potential term during which the applicant may have the opportunity to be released to parole and which would be long enough to allow for an extended period of supervision. A balance term of five years is obviously more than adequate for such a purpose. 
     
      
    24 To the extent that it was suggested that his Honour had an intention to set a non-parole period (significantly) less than 75 percent of total term, it can be observed that his final remarks were: 
     
      
       
        
        “Consequently, the offender will be eligible for release to parole on 6 February 2021. That is a total effective sentence of fourteen years with an additional period of five years.” 
        
       
      
    25 It is clear that his Honour was fully conscious of the ingredients of the total sentence and their relationship to each other. The period of five years amply fulfilled his expressed intention to establish a potential extended period during which supervision might take place.  
     
      
    26 The effect of the sentences was to impose a very lengthy time of minimum custody but the offences committed by the applicant were grave. The applicant could regard himself as fortunate not to have had any cumulative term for the offences committed upon JC. 
     
      
    27 I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    28 HOWIE J: I agree with Grove J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: On 6 August 2007, the appellants were arraigned before Conlon DCJ on a joint indictment that charged that they:  
     
      
       
        
        On the 21st day of October 2005, at Farmborough Heights, in the State of New South Wales, did break and enter the dwelling house of Nicole and Stephen Muir situated at 146 Waples Rd, Farnborough Hts, and did commit a serious indictable offence therein namely did steal a black Caribee bag, a Nintendo game cube, 18 assorted games, a Compaq laptop computer and computer bag, a red Nike sports bag, a mini Sony Play Station 2 console and controller, a JVC digital video recorder, a Polaroid digital camera and Takstar headphones and a quantity of jewellery, the property of Nicole and Stephen Muir in circumstances of aggravation namely they were in company of one another.  
        
       
      
    2 They pleaded not guilty, and they were tried before Conlon DCJ and a jury. On 13 August 2007, the jury returned a verdict of guilty.  
     
      
    3 On 13 December 2007, each of the appellants was sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 months and an additional term of 18 months.  
     
      
    4 The appellants appeal from their conviction.  
     
      
       
      Some history  
      
    5 The trial in August 2007 was the third trial of the appellants in respect of this charge commenced before Conlon DCJ.  
     
      
    6 The first trial commenced on 13 November 2006. There was a voir dire concerning the admissibility of evidence concerning tracking by a police dog; and on 14 November 2006, the trial judge gave a judgment in which he ruled the evidence to be admissible. On the fourth day of that trial, after two jurors had to be discharged owing to illness and personal matters, the trial was aborted.  
     
      
    7 The second trial commenced on 19 March 2007. On 20 March 2007, counsel for the appellant Muldoon renewed her application to have the evidence of dog-tracking excluded, and the trial judge came to the same decision as before. That trial also was subsequently aborted, because of a problem with a juror.  
     
      
    8 As noted earlier, the third trial commenced on 6 August 2007. Counsel for Mr Muldoon again applied to have evidence of dog-tracking excluded. The trial judge had regard to the transcript of the voire dire evidence taken in November 2006, and also to accreditation certificates concerning the particular police dog. On 7 August 2007, the trial judge gave a further judgment giving reasons for admitting the evidence.  
     
      
    9 On 8 August 2007, counsel for Mr Muldoon applied to have the trial judge disqualify himself, on the ground that in 1999, as a Crown prosecutor, the trial judge had prosecuted Mr Muldoon in respect of another offence. The trial judge gave judgment on that day refusing that application.  
     
      
    10 This history has some relevance, because a ground of appeal relied on by Mr Muldoon is that the trial miscarried because the trial judge erred in failing to disqualify himself; and a ground of appeal relied on by both appellants is that there was a miscarriage of justice because the trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of the tracker dog.  
     
      
    11 The only other ground of appeal, relied upon by both appellants, is that the verdict cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.  
     
      
       
      Crown case  
      
    12 The Crown case was that Mrs Muir arrived at her home in Waples Road, Farnborough Heights, at about 1.40 pm. She saw three men near her house, one wearing a red tee-shirt and another with a flannelette shirt tied around his waist. After pulling into her driveway, she saw them go downhill behind her car, and noted that one was carrying a bag that looked like a bag of hers.  
     
      
    13 On entering her house, Mrs Muir discovered it had been broken into. She returned to her car, backed into the street, and turned it to face east (downhill). At about this time, she called her husband and asked him to phone the police. She saw a man entering a bush area (which was to the left of the road at the bottom of the hill, about 300 metres away).  
     
      
    14 Mrs Muir drove to where she believed the man entered the bush area, and wound down her window. She heard voices in the bush for a few minutes, that gradually moved away, sounding as though they were going up towards a fence-line at the back of houses facing an intersecting street Murrogun Crescent.  
     
      
    15 A neighbour Mr Mannix was looking from his home opposite this bush area in Waples Road. He saw three men come down the street and enter the bushland, and crouch behind a clump of trees at a point he identified as being near bulrushes (these being around a creek at the bottom of the hill). He said one man was wearing black tracksuit pants and a dark red maroon long-sleeved tee-shirt, another was wearing track pants with a white long-sleeved tee-shirt with stripes going down the sleeves, and another was wearing dark clothing.  
     
      
    16 About 60-90 seconds later, he saw two of the men go further into the bush, in a direction that would lead them to the fence-line; while the third, who was in dark clothing, came back out of the bush and crossed Waples Road into bush on the south side of that road. He saw Mrs Muir’s car pull up near where the men had entered the bush.  
     
      
    17 An off duty police officer, Senior Constable Wright, who was exercising his police dog, responded to a radio call and arrived to where Mrs Muir was stopped at around 2 pm. Other police officers, Constables Barlow and Berringer, arrived just afterwards. Mrs Muir indicated a point of entry into the bush, and Senior Constable Wright placed a tracking harness onto his dog, and “cast” the dog in an arch to locate a track.  
     
      
    18 According to Senior Constable Wright, the dog indicated a trail of human scent, and by its movements indicated it was fresh (within 15 minutes). The dog moved along a cleared area along the fence-line. After about 100 metres, the dog stopped tracking, and raised its head. Senior Constable Wright saw black track pants and a white tee-shirt hanging in a tree above him. The dog then continued tracking, and after another 50 metres or so veered to the left away from the fence-line down a decline into thick scrubland. The dog then tracked another 100 metres, before stopping momentarily, indicated more human scent to the west. The dog then resumed tracking. At this point, there was no worn pathway. After another 100 metres or so into thick scrub and lantana, Senior Constable Wright then heard a person or persons running a short distance ahead. He then saw two men running about 50 metres in front of him.  
     
      
    19 Senior Constable Wright called out to the men to stop, informing them that if they did not stop he would set the dog on them. They did not stop, and Senior Constable Wright released the dog with a command to apprehend. He heard a male voice yell, “OK I’ve stopped. He’s got me. Can you get him off?”.  
     
      
    20 Senior Constable Wright (and also Constable Barlow, who had followed him) found the dog holding Mr Muldoon, and also found Mr Carter standing nearby with his hands in the air. Mr Muldoon was wearing blue jeans and a black tee-shirt, and Mr Carter was wearing a white tee-shirt and black trousers.  
     
      
    21 Senior Constable Wright later returned to the location where the dog had earlier indicated more human scent to the west. The dog pulled hard into thicker lantana and indicated a black nylon carry bag very similar to a laptop bag and a maroon luggage bag, each containing property taken from the Muirs’ house.  
     
      
    22 The appellants did not give evidence. Certain photographs were tendered in the defence case, and the accreditation certificates concerning the police dog were also tendered.  
     
      
       
      Failure to disqualify  
      
    23 On 1 March 1999 in Wollongong District Court, Mr Muldoon had been prosecuted by the trial judge, then a Crown prosecutor, for an offence of robbery in company at Puckey’s Estate Reserve, in 1997. The appellant’s two co-accused in that matter pleaded guilty to more serious charges involving a vicious attack on a man. The case had some publicity at the time. The appellant was convicted. As noted earlier, an application was made that the trial judge disqualify himself, this application having been made on the third day of the present trial after the trial judge’s involvement in the previous trial had been brought to the attention of the appellant’s counsel.  
     
      
    24 Mr Haesler SC for Mr Muldoon submitted that a judge should be disqualified if a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question that the judge is required to decide: Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63; (2000) 205 CLR 337 at [6]. The principle applies in relation to judges sitting with a jury: R v Kearns [2003] NSWCCA 367.  
     
      
    25 Mr Haesler submitted that a fair-minded observer might reasonably apprehend that the trial judge’s prior prosecution of Mr Muldoon for a very serious offence would interfere with the apparent fairness of the trial.  
     
      
    26 In my opinion, the following matters are important in relation to this question:  
     
      
      (1) The ultimate question is whether a fair-minded lay observer  
      might reasonably 
       apprehend the judge  
      might not 
       bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question that the judge is required to decide:  
      Ebner 
       at [6],  
      Johnson v Johnson 
       [2000] HCA 48; (2000) 201 CLR 488 at [11].  
      (2) This principle applies to judges sitting with a jury: Kearns. (In the present case, the trial judge’s rulings on admissibility of evidence were particularly important.)  
      (3) As regards the characteristics of the relevant lay observer, this observer, being reasonable and fair-minded, would “ordinarily be taken to have sought to be informed on at least the most basic considerations relevant to arriving at a conclusion founded on a fair understanding of all the relevant issues”: Johnson at [53] per Kirby J.  
      (4) Amongst such considerations would be that the person being observed is a professional judge whose training, tradition and judicial oath and/or affirmation require [the judge] to disregard the irrelevant, the immaterial and the prejudicial: Johnson at [12] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ, quoting from Vakauta v Kelly (1988) 13 NSWLR 502 at 507 per McHugh JA.  
      (5) In the case of the suggestion of appearance of bias because of previous role as a prosecutor, one relevant consideration would be that, although a Crown prosecutor adopts an adversarial role in a criminal prosecution, it is the prosecutor’s responsibility to act fairly and honestly and not to struggle for a conviction: McCreed v The Queen [2003] WASCA 275 at [33] (per Steytler J with whom Malcolm CJ agreed). There was no suggestion in the present case that the trial judge acted otherwise than in accordance with that responsibility.  
      (6) Judges should not accede too readily to suggestions of an appearance of bias lest parties be encouraged to seek such disqualification without justification: Johnson at [45] per Kirby J, Re JRL (1986) 161 CLR 342 at 352. (In the present case, the circumstance that disqualification would cause a third trial to be aborted was not itself relevant to the issue to be determined, but is illustrative of the necessity to apply the test for apprehended bias realistically.)  
      (7) There was in this case a lapse of time of over eight years; and it did not occur to Mr Muldoon that it was the trial judge who had prosecuted him unless well into the third trial. Also, it did not occur to the judge, and the judge had no recollection of the circumstances of the earlier prosecution.  
      
    27 I note that in McCreed, Steytler J (Malcolm CJ agreeing) expressed the view that the fact that a defendant to a criminal proceeding had previously been prosecuted for a serious criminal offence by a judge who was to preside at his trial would often be sufficient to result in the judge’s disqualification, and that the prudent course would ordinarily be one of self-disqualification. However, in that case, even though the previous prosecution had been for murder, all three judges of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Western Australia were not satisfied that it was a case in which the trial judge was required to disqualify himself, particularly having regard to the lapse of time (in that case, eleven and a half years).  
     
      
    28 In my opinion, having regard to all the considerations I have set out, and having regard particularly to the lapse of time, this too was not a case in which the trial judge was required to disqualify himself.  
     
      
       
      Tracker dog evidence  
      
    29 The evidence given by Senior Constable Wright on the voir dire held on 13 November 2006 was usefully and fairly summarised as follows by the Crown prosecutor on this appeal:  
     
      
       
        
        Wright’s Experience  
         
         
        1. Wright gave evidence that he'd been attached to the dog unit for 11 years. He first undertook a 16 week novice dog training course in 1996; in 2002 he undertook a 10 week training course with his current police dog (Haas, who he used on 21 October) (t 1, 6).  
         
         
        2. Wright was also an operational trainer, involved in setting up operational scenarios for handlers once per week (t 7).  
         
         
        3. Wright gave evidence that the type of dog deemed suitable to become a police dog was one which had a high prey drive -"" 
        the want to chase and play with an article and have tug of wars and bring it back to you 
        "" (t 2).  
         
         
        Training 
          
         
         
        4. Wright gave evidence that during the novice training course, dogs are taught all aspects of police work (obedience, tracking, searching, agility, and criminal apprehension); the emphasis is on tracking - teaching a dog to follow a trail of human scent that has been laid down (t 2).  
         
         
        5. Wright's evidence was that for a number of weeks dogs are trained 5-6 times a day in the early morning. The dog being trained is taken into a sterile paddock (one not subject to pollution or game or foot traffic) so there are not too many other scents. A track is laid (in the initial stages of the training only, this is done by the handler of the dog being trained), which means that the handler ‘walks' along the leg of a track. An article is left at the end of it and the dog is shown this. The handler walks back along the track without the article. The dog is then encouraged to place his nose on the ground and search for the track; this is done through the use of a repetitive command, which is given throughout this type of exercise. When the dog reaches the end of the track it is rewarded with the article (t 2). The sterile environment, as well as the double laying of the track, means that the only scent in front of the dog is human scent, which is what the dogs are trained to detect (t 5).  
         
         
        6. Wright gave evidence that dogs are kept on a 10 metre tracking lead. The line is released and allowed to move through the handler's hands when the dog is on the track. The dog is only allowed to move forwards. If the dog stops, or if it lifts its head or goes off the track, pressure is applied to the line to stop the dog from moving, and it is not allowed to move until it indicates the true track and puts its nose back down (t 2, 4). This imprints in the dog that the only way it will find its reward (the article) is by following the trail of human scent (t 5).  
         
         
        7. After the first 4 weeks of training, the dog no longer needs to see the track being laid (t 3). The training starts to involve longer tracks, the addition of comers, the use of different legs, and increases in time between the laying of a track and the dog walking the track (t 3).  
         
         
        8. Wright gave evidence that a dog does not pass the novice training course until a track of 4 legs is successfully completed. Each leg must be at least 250 metres in length. The track must be at least one hour old. Each leg must also have one article placed there by the handler who has laid the track, and the dog must indicate this or pick it up (t 3). This forms part of a dog's annual accreditation (t 3).  
         
         
        9. Another aspect of the annual accreditation is the use of operational tracks, which involves laying a track through peoples front yards and across a variety of surfaces including hard ones. In order to remain operational, a dog must complete 3 legs of an operational track. Each leg must be 250 metres in length and be placed 30 minutes before the dog commences tracking, with one article on each leg (t 3). These were the minimum requirements; however, operationally much more difficult tracks were laid, for instance, going over fences, through creeks, with a total distance exceeding 1 km, and the time delay being over one hour (t 4).  
         
         
        10. Wright gave evidence that other advanced training methods included laying tracks in areas of animal pollution and where there are cross-tracks (where other people walk across the track being laid). Dogs are trained to follow the initial track and are not allowed to track anything other than the initial track, though Wright agreed that dogs (as well as handlers) could make mistakes, though this was less likely when not on a hard surface or on an area with numerous cross-tracks (t 5, 18-19, 23). Wright's evidence was that where a dog encounters cross-tracks it may falter for a short time and might become confused, but Wright said that dogs will work hard and will soon work out which is the individual scent that they initially started to follow, and which they were initially encouraged and commanded to track, and they will continue with the original track and overcome the cross-tracks (t 5-6, 18). This was a matter of skill (and training) of both the dog and the handler (t 24).  
         
         
        11. In cross-examination Wright was questioned about situations where there was more than one scent on a track. He said it could be difficult but the dog would indicate the presence of two trails if they had been laid side by side by putting his nose to the ground and moving across to indicate another track (t 15-16). He agreed that where more than one person was walking single file then it could be difficult to know how many persons were being tracked (t 16).  
         
         
        12. Wright gave evidence that in addition to the above training, ongoing training blocks (using paddock and operational tracks) were also conducted, on average 3 consecutive days per month. Once a week operational scenarios were also also set up for the handlers (t 7).  
         
         
        Body Language when Tracking  
         
         
        13. Wright explained that during the initial stages of training the handler knows where a track has been laid. As dogs are being taught they are watched and the handlers learn the intricacies of their dog's body language and the way they indicate when they are tracking. He said,  
        'you very quickly learn how your dog tracks and you become very familiar with his body language 
        ""; in particular, he said that dogs develop a ""tracking gait"", similar to a bunny hop (t 4). Dogs indicate by putting their nose on the ground and pulling forwards, low down in their tracking harness which "" 
        tells you when the dog is on the true track 
        "" (t 4).  
         
         
        Backtracking 
          
         
         
        14. Wright gave evidence that although dogs have the ability to backtrack, they do not backtrack. They were able to distinguish the direction of travel and track in the direction of travel; he guaranteed this 100% and said that this was consistent with what he'd observed in his training, and he had never had a dog track the other way. He said that a dog does not backtrack on a trail with any intensity and he believed it came down to the age of the footsteps (t 15,26).  
         
         
        Dissipation of Human Scent  
         
         
        15. Wright gave evidence that the majority of the scent which comes off a freshly laid track is not human scent but rather ground scent (e.g., crushed vegetation). Each individual also has a scent which falls down. This combines with the ground scent (t 4). Concrete and hard surfaces do not contain much scent other than that of the person laying the track, and the scent will dissipate depending on the weather conditions especially if it is hot (t 6). With grass or scrubland there is a lot more vegetation to contain and hold human scent, so the track will stay available for the dog to track for a lot longer; lush grass was ideal for tracking (t 6).  
         
         
        16. Wind can blow an individual scent a few metres off the true track, depending on its strength. It is up to the handler to stop the dog if the dog moves towards the individual scent (t 4). The handler needs to get an indication of the location of the true track. This is done by putting pressure on the lead. The dog then comes back and indicates the track along the ground again (t 5). Wright explained that there was a change in body language when a dog was not following the true track; a handler must consider factors such as wind direction and the lay of the land and use pressure on the tracking line to gauge the dog's intent and bring the dog back to the true track (t 22-23).  
         
         
        17. In cross-examination Wright said that it was possible that a dog would indicate the presence of other people nearby, though experienced operational dogs would be well aware of the differences in scents when compared with the scent they were initially encouraged to follow (t 18). He added that humans smelt differently but agreed that he had no qualifications in biochemistry or in animal behaviour other than his operational experience and the courses he'd undertaken (t 18).  
         
         
        Haas' Training  
         
         
        18. Wright gave evidence that Haas undertook all of the training noted above. He said that Haas was proficient in tracking and had never failed an accreditation (t 7). As at 21 October 2005 he had 2 accreditations. Haas had reached a satisfactory level in tracking, searching, agility, criminal apprehension, man work and obedience (t 7). In cross-examination Wright agreed that Haas had some remedial training within the previous 12 months for "" 
        gaming issues 
        "" -picking up the scent of animals (kangaroos and deer) and becoming distracted (t 19).  
         
         
        Conditions for Tracking on 21 October  
         
         
        19. Wright gave evidence that 21 October was a warm (though not hot) sunny day, with minimum wind (t 7). The conditions were ideal for tracking. There was lush soft grass at the start of the track, no hard or concrete surface, and movement into shrub which held a scent well (t 25, 28). The conditions were unlikely to lead to problems with deviations caused by cross-tracks (t 24).  
         
         
        Haas's Tracking on 21 October  
         
         
        20. Wright gave evidence that on 21 October Haas was taken to an area of lush grass, approximately 15 cm high (t 8). Haas was placed on a tracking harness with a tracking lead attached; this was a silent command, indicating that Haas was about to commence a tracking exercise. The dog was then commanded to search for a track. It moved across the area with its nose right on the ground in an arcing-type pattern at a fairly quick pace. Wright gave evidence that Haas indicated a trail of human scent. He described what Haas did when he hit a trail of human scent -he jerked down very suddenly, lowered his body and pulled extremely hard into the tracking harness, went into a tracking gait (the bunny hop) and started following the trail (t 8). Wright's evidence was that dogs pulled harder and more intensely when following a trail of more recent scent. In his opinion, as soon as Haas indicated and pulled hard on 21 October, he was tracking a very recent trail of human scent (t 12). In cross-examination he said that he could tell the difference between a 30 minute track and a 5-10 minute track (t 15). Wright was also certain that Haas was tracking in the direction which the person being tracked had walked, as opposed to a backtrack (t 15).  
         
         
        21. Wright agreed in cross-examination that he had not been to 146 Waples Rd, nor had he given Haas any item that the offenders may have touched. He said that that was not a method he used to locate a track (t 14).  
         
         
        22. Wright gave evidence that Haas stopped 100 metres on the worn pathway alongside the fence line. Haas lifted its head. The dog's body language changed. It took the pressure off the harness and looked up. Wright looked up and saw a long-sleeved t-shirt and black track pants in a tree (t 8-9).  
         
         
        23. Wright made a mental note of the location and encouraged Haas to put its nose back down, commanding him to continue searching for the track. He said that the dog "" 
        didn't need much encouragement 
        "" and it moved forward, again in the tracking gait (t 9).  
         
         
        24. The track continued 50 metres along the fence line (6 or 7 metres to the left of the fence line) and the dog veered off into dense, thicker scrub, down a decline into a gully. He was still indicating the presence of human scent (t 9).  
         
         
        25. In cross-examination Wright said that it was at this point that he left the worn pathway (t 16). In cross-examination he agreed that this bordered the back of 20 or so houses and that there was a large rock further up (t 13). He did not recall other paths to the left along the pathway (t 14). The pathway was about a metre wide (t 16). He agreed that it was a possible shortcut to the houses and was obviously worn; however, he said that he could not see the area to the left as being a very practical shortcut (t 17). He agreed with the possibility that on the pathway there may have been another track parallel to the track which Haas was following (t 17). He also agreed that he did not know how many people had traversed that trail within the previous half an hour. He said it was fairly remote and that it was a weekday, but he agreed that even one other person on the trail could pose difficulties (t 25).  
         
         
        26. Wright gave evidence that after Haas had veered off the pathway it stopped pulling again and lifted its head up and looked in a westerly direction. The change in body language meant that Haas was searching for something close by. The only explanation according to Wright (based on his experience with Haas and other dogs) was that Haas was indicating an item with human scent. Wright gave evidence that after one or two seconds Haas wanted to continue tracking and indicated that the track continued. From Wright's operational experience, he said that this indicated to him that property had possibly been dumped (t 9-10). Wright said that if Haas had been indicating the actual person being tracked then he would have pulled him into the location and started barking (t 9). Wright did not see anything at this stage but he made a mental note of the location (t 10). He subsequently returned there and found two bags (t 11).  
         
         
        27. Wright let Haas resume the track in the same direction and they moved into thicker scrub. Wright found it hard to move through the vegetation. His forearms were getting lacerated from the lantana and blackberry bushes (t 9). Wright kept his pace with the dog, but at one point he fell and became entangled in thick scrub. At that point he became aware of 2 males ahead of him and he yelled at them to stop, warning them that he was from the police dog squad and that he would send his dog if they did not stop (t 10). The males continued running, and Wright released Haas from the tracking line and commanded him to apprehend. Wright freed himself, ran after the dog and saw Haas seconds later with a hold of Muldoon (t 11). In cross-examination Wright said that dogs were trained to bark only if they were sent off-lead to locate an offender, particularly during an open search of an area; Haas, in particular, did not bark whilst tracking (t 27). The reason why Haas did not bark when the dog caught up with the applicants was because it was given a command to apprehend them as no perimeter had been set up to prevent any escape (t 27).  
        
       
      
    30 Senior Constable Wright gave similar evidence at the trial before the jury. The appellants relied on two annual accreditation results of the tracker dog as shown in accreditation certificates. Senior Constable Wright was cross-examined about the results from the accreditations on 23 June 2005 and 22 June 2006, and he agreed that these were the only accreditations evaluated by someone other than himself. The effect of these accreditations and Senior Constable Wright’s evidence in relation to them were usefully and fairly summarised as follows in the Crown prosecutor’s submissions:  
     
      
       
        
        57. In 2005, the dog scored an overall 80% and was assessed one level up from novice to a level 1; he achieved the following results:  
         
         
         Soft Surface Tracking: 166 (out of 240)  
          
         Hard Surface Tracking: 122 (out of 160)  
          
         Searching: 265 (out of 300)  
          
         Obedience: 166 (out of 200)  
          
         Agility: 95 (out of 100)  
          
         Manwork: 270 (out of 300)  
         
         
        58. In 2006, the dog scored an overall 75%, insufficient to achieve level 1 status (which required 80%), so he reverted to a novice level; he achieved the following results:  
         
         
         Soft Surface Tracking: 118 (out of 240)  
          
         Operational Tracking: 115 (out of 160)  
          
         Searching: 275 (out of 300)  
          
         Obedience: 87 (out of 200)  
          
         Agility: 79 (outof100)  
          
         Manwork: 300 (out of 300)  
         
         
        59. Wright said in cross-examination that for a dog to remain operational it needed to reach 70% each year (t 106). However, the dog cannot fail on the discreet "" 
        cease attack 
        "" test (following the capture of a suspect) nor on the "" 
        manwork 
        "" component. If there is failure in these areas, the dog would be removed from duties until the issues are remedied. Failure in other individual components would be addressed individually, though the dog would remain operational as long as the overall score remained at least 70% (t 145).  
         
         
        60. Wright outlined the various categories as follows:  
         
         
         a.  
         Soft surface 
          meant lush, soft open-paddock grass, and it also included ""dirt paths"" like the one he and the dog walked on during 21 October 2005 (t 108,141). Soft surface tracking was affected by weather conditions, but no handicap was allowed for weather changes on the day of testing (t 145). Wright could not recall the conditions on the day of the accreditation testing (t 161).  
          
          
         b.  
         Hard surface 
          was either gravel or bitumen (t 108. 141). In 2006 this changed to "" 
         operational tracking 
         "" which meant a track laid in a residential area with pollution, cross tracks and distractions (t 144-145).  
          
          
         c.  
         Searching 
          was made up of three categories, open, building and property; the first two involved searching for a secreted person either in an open area of bushland (at least 100 metres away), or within a building, and the third involved searching for small items of property dropped in an area of 30 square metres (t 142).  
          
          
         d.  
         Obedience 
          related to exercises dealing with the dog's response to its handler and its response to signal commands (t 143).  
          
          
         e.  
         Agility 
          related to negotiating obstacles (t 144).  
          
          
         f.  
         Manwork 
          related to criminal apprehension, and there was greater importance attached to that rather than to obedience (t 107).  
         
         
        61. Wright gave evidence that in February 2006 his dog was subject to remedial training as a result of gaming issues -a tendency to become distracted by scenting animals (t 147-148). When Stephen Muir was cross-examined he agreed that he'd heard some lizards and birdlife in the bush when he entered the bush land on 22 October to searching for the remainder of his property which had not been recovered, and there were also deer further up in the cleared area (t 50). Wright explained in re-examination that the gaming issues generally related to when the dog was away from him at a distance. Scenarios were set up and these showed that the dog was definitely prioritising what was being searched for (t 161). There was never an issue with tracking whilst the dog was on a lead where he was affected by game (t 162).  
        
       
      
    31 Mr Haesler submitted on behalf of both appellants that Senior Constable Wright’s evidence concerning the activities of the police tracker-dog were not admissible, as the prosecution failed to establish the reliability of the police dog; and that in the alternative, the evidence should have been excluded pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995, which provides as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        137 Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings  
         
         
        In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.  
        
       
      
    32 In order for that evidence to be admissible, Mr Haesler submitted, it was necessary that the prosecution demonstrate that the dog’s training and experience and any testing of that training and experience justify the reception of the evidence: R v Joe Saccu (unreported, Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal, 13 February 1980).  
     
      
    33 Mr Haesler also referred to Pieterson and Holloway v R [1995] 2 Cr App Rep 11 at 16 and 17.  
     
      
    34 Mr Haesler submitted that the evidence on the voir dire failed to establish that the police dog was properly qualified to track on soft surfaces. The certificates showed that both before and after October 2005, the dog had problems tracking on soft surfaces. Senior Constable Wright’s assessment of his dog’s and his own abilities were insufficient to justify the admission of the evidence.  
     
      
    35 Mr Haesler submitted that opinions expressed must be shown to be wholly or substantially based on the expert’s specialised knowledge, and the reasoning process of the expert must be sufficiently exposed to establish how his or her conclusions were based on this specialised knowledge: R v Keller [2006] NSWCCA 204 at [24]; R v Nguyen [2007] NSWCCA 249; Makita (Australia) Pty Limited v Sproules [2001] NSWCA 305; (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 at [85].  
     
      
    36 Mr Haesler submitted that the evidence should in any event have been excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act. There was a real risk that the jury would not make its own assessment of the evidence and rely instead on what Senior Constable Wright said the dog was indicating. Such exclusion was a result reached in similar circumstances in R v Benecke [1999] NSWCCA 163; (1999) 106 A Crim R 282. There was a substantial risk that the scent the dog was tracking was laid down by someone other than the appellants, possibly the real burglars or possibly someone who had recently used the track along the fence-line; and it remained possible that the dog was not following a scent at all.  
     
      
    37 Mr Haesler also submitted that the evidence of a dog-handler should not go beyond a description of the dog’s behaviour and surrounding circumstances: explicit opinions about the thoughts or intent of the dog or the drawing of inferences from the dog’s behaviour should be excluded, particularly because of their potential to result in unfair prejudice to the accused: cf Benecke at [18].  
     
      
    38 In my opinion, the detailed evidence given by Senior Constable Wright on the voir dire, and repeated at the trial before the jury, did establish that he had specialised knowledge, based on his training and experience, and that the opinions he expressed were wholly or substantially based on that knowledge, satisfying the requirements of s 79 of the Evidence Act 1995.  
     
      
    39 In my opinion also, his training and experience did qualify him to interpret the behaviour of the tracker-dog in terms of indications that it was following human scent, and the recency of that scent, and that its behaviour indicated human scent off the track that it was tracking. His ability to draw these inferences was sufficiently established by his evidence about his training and experience, and his extensive experience with the particular dog. It is true that the evidence did not make wholly transparent the process of reasoning giving rise to these interpretations; but in my opinion inferences of that kind are not such as could reasonably be expected to be supported wholly by explicit inferential steps.  
     
      
    40 The mark that the dog received for soft surface tracking in 2005 and 2006 did not make the evidence inadmissible. Senior Constable Wright gave evidence as to his experience of the reliability of the dog and of certain limitations in the dog’s performance. This evidence was not shown to be in any way unsatisfactory, by any detailed exploration of deficiencies that may have been disclosed by the particular marks in question.  
     
      
    41 In my opinion, this was not a case where the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, within s 137 of the Evidence Act. Any unfair prejudice must lie in the danger that the evidence might be misused by the jury and, in my opinion, that danger could be and was adequately addressed by appropriate directions. The criticisms of and potential unreliability of that evidence was agitated in cross-examination and addressed in counsel’s addresses, and also in the directions by the trial judge.  
     
      
    42 Accordingly, in my opinion this ground of appeal fails.  
     
      
       
      Whether the verdict can be supported by the evidence  
      
    43 Mr Haesler submitted that the Crown had to establish that the dog that ultimately led Senior Constable Wright to the appellants was tracking the offenders who left the house: that is, there had to be a direct connection between the people who left the house with the property and the appellants. Mr Haesler submitted that a number of aspects to the evidence showed that the verdict could not be supported:  
     
      
      (1) The dog did not commence tracking at a point where either Mrs Muir or Mr Mannix told the jury the burglars entered the bushland: the position where the dog was cast was close to a well worn path obviously used by many people.  
      (2) The assessment that the dog had picked up a fresh scent was based solely on the subjective and untestable opinion of Senior Constable Wright.  
      (3) Senior Constable Wright’s subsequent evidence of what he interpreted the dog to be indicating was similarly a subjective, untestable opinion based on no recognised or established field of expertise.  
      (4) The dog did not track to the appellants. Rather, Senior Constable Wright heard and saw them and gave the command to apprehend.  
      (5) Neither accused wore clothing similar to that described by Mrs Muir or Mr Mannix, nor was any clothing matching that described found to be discarded in the area.  
      (6) As the dog did not track directly to the stolen goods, it cannot be presumed that the track it was following was in fact that of the burglars.  
      
    44 Mr Haesler submitted that, applying the test in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487, an independent assessment of the evidence leads to the conclusion that the verdict cannot be supported by the evidence. This was not an exercise that required assessment of witnesses’ credibility.  
     
      
    45 In my opinion, the jury could in this case reasonably give substantial weight to the evidence concerning tracking by the police dog:  
     
      
      (1) Although the evidence of Mrs Muir and Mr Mannix suggests that the men who entered the bush after leaving Mrs Muir’s house did so near the bulrushes, this evidence also suggests that they moved behind the trees to the cleared area along the fence-line; so although Senior Constable Wright cast the dog near the commencement of the cleared area rather than near the bulrushes, the dog could well have picked up their scent on that cleared area.  
      (2) No other person entered that cleared area along the fence-line from Waples Road in the 15-20 minutes before the dog started tracking.  
      (3) The dog pulled strongly, indicating fresh human scent, according to Senior Constable Wright.  
      (4) The dog left the cleared area taking a route that went to the location where the stolen property was found, indicating a very high probability that the dog had in fact followed the trail of the persons who had broken into Mrs Muir’s house.  
      (5) From that point, the dog took Senior Constable Wright through thick scrub for a further 100 metres, indicating a very high probability that it was still following the fresh trail of persons who had broken into Mrs Muir’s house.  
      (6) At that point, Senior Constable Wright saw two men running 50 metres away; and although the dog did not track from that point up to these men, there was a very high probability that these were the men who had left the trail that the dog had been following, especially in circumstances where no one else was in the vicinity, these men were running away, and they did not stop when the police called out to them to do so.  
      
    46 The absence of the red tee-shirt and the shirt with stripes down the arms could be taken into account; but in my opinion the failure to locate those items did not mean that the jury could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellants.  
     
      
    47 In my opinion, on the basis of that material, there was evidence capable of satisfying the jury beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellants.  
     
      
       
      CONCLUSION  
      
    48 For those reasons, in my opinion the appeals of the appellants against their conviction should be dismissed.

      Regina v Steven Momir KATIC  
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIDDEN J: The offender, Steven Momir Katic, is to be sentenced for offences arising out of a tragic incident at Glenfield in the afternoon of 20 February 2007. He held up a newsagency, carrying an air rifle, obtained money and ran from the shop. The proprietor pursued him and, in circumstances which I shall describe shortly, he struck the proprietor in the head with a fence paling, causing his death.  
     
      
    2 The offender was indicted before me for murder and for robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, that being an offence under s97(2) of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment. He pleaded not guilty to the murder but guilty to the aggravated armed robbery. His trial for murder proceeded, but the jury found him guilty of manslaughter. He stands for sentence, then, for manslaughter and the robbery. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    3 The offender lived in rented premises not far from the newsagency. In the afternoon in question, he went to the newsagency with an accomplice. He was carrying an air rifle, which was unloaded. He went into the shop, wearing a mask, while the accomplice remained outside as the lookout. He pointed the rifle at the proprietor, Mr Chinh Nguyen, and demanded money. It seems that, despite the mask, Mr Nguyen recognised him as a customer of the newsagency. Mr Nguyen handed over notes amounting to a little under $200, and the offender ran from the shop. All this was witnessed by Mr Nguyen’s mother, Ms Susan Huynh, who had been in a back room of the newsagency. 
     
      
    4 Unfortunately, Mr Nguyen, who must have been a man of no little courage and who could not have known whether the air rifle was loaded or not, pursued the offender. What then occurred was the subject of a good deal of evidence at the trial, but I can state my findings for the purpose of sentence fairly briefly.  
     
      
    5 The newsagency was on Railway Parade, Glenfield. The pursuit took the two men into a side street, leading to Waterloo Place. There Mr Nguyen caught up with the offender, there was a struggle, the offender discarded the money and Mr Nguyen wrested the air rifle from him. Waterloo Place is a cul-de-sac, with a pedestrian laneway leading back to Railway Parade. The offender ran into that laneway and Mr Nguyen pursued him, holding the rifle. To one side of the laneway there is a paling fence, and about half way down the laneway there is what could be described as a metal barrier. At that point the offender picked up a loose paling from the ground and struck Mr Nguyen forcibly to the head. 
     
      
    6 The offender ran into Railway Parade and made good his escape. Mr Nguyen, despite being seriously injured, managed to make his way back to the newsagency, where his mother was. He was clearly in a bad way and was unable to speak. An ambulance was summoned and he was taken to Liverpool Hospital. Treatment over a period of days was unable to save him, and he died in the early hours of 27 February 2007. A post-mortem examination confirmed that his skull had been fractured and that he had died of severe brain injury. 
     
      
    7 The count of murder had been left to the jury on two bases: what is still loosely termed felony murder, or an act causing death accompanied by an intent to kill or to inflict really serious bodily injury. As to felony murder, there was an issue whether the killing occurred “immediately after” the robbery for the purposes of s18 of the Crimes Act. As to murder based on intent, the alternative of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act was left to the jury. However, in both bases of murder self-defence was an important issue and the jury was directed about the possibility of manslaughter by excessive self-defence.  
     
      
    8 Whatever might have been the reasoning of the members of the jury, it is a matter for me to determine the basis of manslaughter for the purpose of sentence. Counsel for the offender, Mr Cattini, did not urge one basis over the other. However, consistently with the stance of the Crown prosecutor, I am satisfied that it is excessive self-defence. I do not think that the offender intended to kill Mr Nguyen and, indeed, it was never the Crown case that he did. He stands for sentence on the basis that he struck Mr Nguyen, intending to cause him really serious bodily injury. He did so because he feared that Mr Nguyen was going to attack him but, in the circumstances, to have struck Mr Nguyen in the way he did was not a reasonable response to the threat which he believed he faced. 
     
      
    9 His case at the trial was that Mr Nguyen had in fact struck him with the rifle, causing him injury. That was also his account to a psychologist, who prepared a report for the purpose of sentence. However, this finds no support in the eyewitness evidence at the trial, it was not pressed by Mr Cattini in submissions on sentence, and I do not accept it. That is not to say that his account is a deliberate fabrication. What I do accept is that he had been drinking spirits in the morning in question and had later taken a number of serapax tablets, and it is possible that the combination of those substances clouded his perception of events at the critical time. 
     
      
       
      Victim impact statements 
       
      
    10 Ms Jan Fuller, of the Homicide Victims Support Group, read to the court victim impact statements by the deceased’s mother, his wife, and his children. They are eloquent testimony to their grief and to the enduring effects of this tragedy upon their lives. The statement of his mother is particularly moving. It traces her family’s struggle to escape from their native Vietnam during the period of unrest after the country came under Communist rule, and records the death of her daughter at sea during that process. It also expresses her pride in the achievements of her son, the deceased, after settling in this country. I conveyed my sympathy to Ms Huynh and to the deceased’s wife and children after those statements were read, and I do so again now. 
     
      
       
      Subjective case 
       
      
    11 The offender was 29 years old at the time of the offences and is now 31. He has a brief criminal history, of no significance for present purposes. It includes an entry for violence, but that was dealt with many years ago by a non-custodial order in the Children’s Court. He has been in custody in respect of the present matters since 26 February 2007.  
     
      
    12 I have the benefit of a comprehensive and insightful report by Ms Kathryn Wakely, psychologist. It discloses the offender’s troubled background, particularly in his teenage years and early adulthood. He is a member of a large family, but his six siblings are considerably older than him and were the product of an earlier relationship of his mother’s. When he was ten years old, his father separated from his mother. He returned to the family home regularly, but to the offender he remained a remote figure. 
     
      
    13 The offender was close to his mother and described his childhood with her as “great.” Sadly, she died of cancer when he was sixteen. Thereafter, he lived on and off with each of his siblings, but he found this difficult. He felt different from them because they did not share the same father. Also, they were significantly older and had families of their own to care for. At times, he lived on his own or with friends. 
     
      
    14 His education did not progress beyond year eight, and he was poorly disciplined during high school. He tried a number of TAFE courses but did not complete any of them. He had some employment after leaving school, but at the time of his arrest for the current offences he had not worked for five years. 
     
      
    15 Against this background, it is perhaps not surprising that he abused alcohol and drugs. This began with alcohol and cannabis when he was only eleven, but from the age of sixteen he became a daily user of heroin and, subsequently, amphetamine. He also took prescription medication, such as serapax and rohypnol. For some years prior to his arrest he was on methadone, and that program has continued since he has been in custody.  
     
      
    16 He found a measure of stability through a long term relationship with a woman, and for four years prior to his arrest they had lived together at Glenfield. To Ms Wakely he described this as “the most stable time since mum died”. However, she terminated the relationship upon his arrest and they have had no contact since. 
     
      
    17 There have been some positive developments during his time in prison. He has regained contact with his father, who has visited him, and he feels that they are now closer than they ever have been. For the past twelve months or so, he has been working five days a week in the cabinet shop. He has undertaken a number of courses and has obtained certificates of achievement in various endeavours, such as alcohol and drug awareness and skills for work and training.  
     
      
    18 To Ms Wakely he displayed an awareness of the difficulties which he would face in ""getting his life back on track” upon his eventual release, but he appeared motivated to do so. She recorded him as saying: 
     
      
       
        
        When I’m out it’s going to be different. I found myself in here, I know who I am, I’m not on drugs, I’ve been going to church every day here, I want to keep doing that and be a good person. I haven’t felt this healthy and alive since I was a teenager, I’m getting back to who I used to be, it shouldn’t have taken this but it has.  
        
       
      
    19 Predictably enough, Ms Wakely’s psychological testing revealed aspects of his personality and his pre-custodial lifestyle requiring treatment. She concluded that he requires a period of psychotherapy and “admission to a structured, long-term residential rehabilitation unit to help him overcome his substance dependence and develop relapse prevention skills for when he is released”. She questioned whether the treatment he needs would be available to him while in custody and added that, upon his release, he would require “close and consistent monitoring by the Probation and Parole Service”.  
     
      
    20 I am satisfied that he is remorseful for these crimes, particularly the manslaughter. He expressed it in no uncertain terms to Ms Wakely, commenting upon Ms Huynh’s distress when giving evidence at the trial, and saying that he thought about what he had done every day and felt bad about it every day. He did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings, but there is confirmation of the genuineness of those expressions. Evidence was led in the trial of a conversation between him and his accomplice in the robbery in a police cell, which was intercepted by a listening device. Clearly, what he said on that occasion was unguarded. Among other things, he said, “I feel real bad for his family. …I am sorry I killed a man. It’s the worst thing I’ve have ever done. …It’s only my fault.” Moreover, I observed him to be obviously distressed in court when the victim impact statements were read. 
     
      
      Sentencing 
       
      
    21 None of this is to deny the gravity of the criminality for which he stands for sentence. Manslaughter in its many and varied forms is always a serious crime, involving the unlawful killing of a human being. The circumstances of the present offence are, or course, both distressing and reprehensible. While it must be accepted that the offender believed that he had to act in self-defence, the situation in which he found himself was of his own making. 
     
      
    22 Aggravated armed robbery is also inherently serious. The offender gains little comfort from the fact that the weapon involved was an air rifle, which was unloaded, and the proceeds of the robbery were relatively modest. The offence was committed in the company of his accomplice and it was the subject of a measure of planning, albeit by no means sophisticated. In sentencing for it, it is appropriate that I have regard to the guideline in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111, 46 NSWLR 346, bearing in mind that that case was concerned with armed robbery in its unaggravated form.  
     
      
    23 I must have regard to his background, including his lack of any significant criminal history. I think that he has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation, but it is important that they be fostered by a lengthy period of parole eligibility. It is in the community’s interest that he serve a significant part of his sentence at liberty, under supervision and the sanction of parole. Accordingly, I find special circumstances justifying a departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period. 
     
      
    24 He is entitled to a reduction of sentence for the aggravated armed robbery in recognition of the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty. That plea was entered at the outset of the trial, but I understand that it had always been his intention to plead guilty and that this was known to the Crown well before the trial. As to the manslaughter, there should be a modest reduction of sentence because he had offered to plead guilty to that offence a few weeks before the trial, an offer which the Crown did not accept: cf R v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377, 160 A Crim R 1, per Spigelman CJ at [121]. 
     
      
    25 It is necessary to determine the appropriate sentence for each offence, but to structure them in such a way as to give effect to the principle of totality. I agree with the Crown prosecutor that this would best be achieved by imposing a fixed term for the robbery, reflecting what the non-parole period for that offence might have been, and then passing a partly cumulative sentence for the manslaughter. 
     
      
    26 But for the offender’s plea of guilty, I would have imposed a fixed term of 5 years for the robbery. In the light of his plea, I shall reduce that to 4 years. The manslaughter calls for a sentence of 10 years, which I would reduce to 9 years because of his offer to plead guilty to that offence. That sentence will commence 2 years after the commencement of the sentence for the robbery. That measure of accumulation is an additional reason for finding special circumstances, and I shall fix a non-parole period of 5½ years. The overall sentence, then, will be imprisonment for 11 years, commencing on 26 February 2007 and expiring on 25 February 2018, with the offender becoming eligible for release on parole after 7½ years, that is, on 25 August 2014. 
     
      
    27 Steven Momir Katic, you are sentenced as follows: 
     
      
    · For the aggravated armed robbery, imprisonment for a fixed term of 4 years, commencing on 26 February 2007 and expiring on 25 February 2011. I decline to set a non-parole period for that offence because of the sentence I am about to pass. 
     
      
    · For the manslaughter of Chinh Nguyen, imprisonment for a non-parole period of 5½ years, commencing on 26 February 2009 and expiring on 25 August 2014, and a balance of term of 3½ years, commencing on 26 August 2014 and expiring on 25 February 2018.

    IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL CCA 2007/00003912 ALLSOP P BLANCH J  HALL J 16 December, 2008  
     
     Mohamed RAZZAK v Regina 
    1 ALLSOP P: I have had the advantage of considering the reasons of Blanch J. Having considered the material at the trial, there is nothing that I would wish to add to his Honour’s reasons on the conviction appeals. The views that his Honour expresses reflect mine. As to the application for leave to appeal against sentence, I also agree with his Honour’s reasons, though I would add the following comments of my own.2 I have given anxious consideration to the question of the sentences for convictions that are not to be set aside. Mr Ramage on behalf of Mr Razzak quietly, but powerfully (if I may be permitted to say), emphasised the relative youth of Mr Razzak and the likely heavy burden of his sentence. There are also the considerations contained in the psychologist’s report, and the family circumstances to which Blanch J makes reference.3 Giving the fullest possible weight to these considerations, they do not lead to the conclusion that the sentences that were imposed were or are manifestly excessive. This is not the occasion to discuss the relative merits or efficacy of the concepts of specific and general deterrence. These notions, however, undoubtedly form a integral part of the fabric of the law concerning sentencing. It is important that Mr Razzak appreciate the reasons for a sentence of this kind, given that it will affect him and his family so directly. 4 The residents of Mons Street, Condell Park (not just MD and his associates) were subjected to a deliberate, and no doubt terrifying, episode of wilfully dangerous and violent activity which could have caused serious injury or death to children or men or women going about their daily lives at or near their homes on a Saturday afternoon. Of course, Mr Razzak should only be subjected to punishment for the crimes for which he has been duly convicted. But these crimes reflected a deliberate attack on MD, the execution of which put at risk the lives of others in a suburban street. 5 The residents of Mons Street and the people of New South Wales are entitled to expect that attacks of this kind will not occur. They are also entitled to expect (and anyone who might contemplate such activity should understand) that the undertaking of an attack of this kind will be condemned by the courts in unambiguous terms. The sentences that remain after the setting aside of the convictions on counts 4, 6 and 8 are not excessive. They were and are not at the outer limit of severity for these particular crimes committed by Mr Razzak. They remain within the range that legitimately reflects the serious criminality of the acts for which he has been convicted.6 BLANCH J: The appellant appeals against convictions and sentences in the District Court. The trial began on 5 February, 2007 and the jury retired to consider its verdict on 12 March, 2007. The verdicts of the jury were returned on 23 March, 2007.7 The appellant stood trial with two co-accused, Rabia Abdul-Razzak and Samear Razzak. They were each charged with shooting at MD with intent to murder with an alternative count of maliciously discharging a loaded firearm with intent to do grievous bodily harm to MD in company. The three co-accused were also charged with similar charges in respect of Mohamed Douar, Bassim Said and Rami Homsi. They were also charged with one count of firing a firearm in a public place. The appellant was acquitted of each of the four charges of shoot at with intent to murder but he was convicted of the four alternate charges of maliciously discharge a loaded firearm with intent to do grievous bodily harm in company and he was also convicted of the charge of firing a firearm in a public place. The two co-accused were acquitted of all counts.8 The offence of discharging a firearm with intent to do grievous bodily harm in company is contrary to s29 of the Crimes Act, 1900 which specifies a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. The offence of firing a firearm in a public place is contrary to s93G(1)(b) of the Crimes Act, 1900 which specifies a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. The sentences imposed were as follows: 
     
      
      1. On count 6 relating to the victim Bassim Said eight years fixed term from 27 July, 2005. 
       
      2. On count 9, which was the charge of firing a firearm in a public place, four years fixed term to date from 27 July, 2005. 
       
      3. On count 8 which related to the victim Rami Homsi eight years from 27 January, 2006. 
       
      4. On count 4 which related to the victim Mohamed Douar eight years fixed term from 27 July, 2006. 
       
      5. On count 2 relating to the victim MD a non-parole period of eight years to date from 27 July, 2006 with a balance of term of four years, making a total sentence of 12 years to date from 27 July, 2006. The non-parole period was set to expire on 26 July, 2014. 
      
    The effective total sentence was one of 13 years with a nine year non-parole period.9 MD gave evidence that he was living at 10 Mons Street, Condell Park on 8 May, 2004 and he had lived there for more than seven years with his wife and children. He said that at about 4.15 p.m. he drove his friend Mohamed Douar to the Condell Park shops and then back home. As he drove up to his house he saw a light coloured Honda parked near the tree outside his house and he saw two friends, Rami Homsi and Bassim Said standing in front of the car. He parked in front of that car and he and Douar got out and had a conversation with Homsi and Said. His mobile phone rang and he answered it and while speaking on his phone he heard a shot and he saw a white car travelling along Mons Street towards Milperra Road. This call was apparently monitored by the Police and occurred at 5.19 p.m. He thought it might have been passing No. 6 Mons Street when he saw it. He said he could not recall the speed the vehicle was travelling. He jumped behind a tree but was hit by a bullet. He looked around the tree and saw the car was a Toyota Rav 4. He said he instantly recognised three of the occupants. He said Samear Razzak was sitting in the front passenger seat, the appellant was sitting behind him and a person he knew by the name of Balaboof, who was the son of Ahmed Razzak, was protruding out of the sunroof of the vehicle. He said he had known all three for a number of years and the appellant since 1995.10 He could see that Samear Razzak was holding a black Glock pistol in his right hand and was firing it. He said at first he was firing in the air but then he fired directly at him. He said the appellant was leaning out of the passenger rear door window with his arms and upper body out of the car. He was holding a black Glock pistol in his right hand and an extended magazine in his left hand. He said the appellant was taking aim and shooting directly at him. He said the man Balaboof had his upper body out of the car and was shooting bullets into the air but as he came closer he shot at MD and when he passed he started firing into the air again. He recognised the driver of the car but he was not able to specify a name. He said he did not know the other passenger sitting behind the driver. The last few shots occurred when the car reached No. 14 Mons Street and some of the shots hit a truck parked out the front and some penetrated the house next door. The victim managed to get up his driveway before collapsing on the ground at the back of his house and he asked his son to call the police and the police and ambulance subsequently arrived. In cross-examination he said the appellant had been shooting at him and nowhere else. He said he had known the appellant since he was 11 or 12. He could not recall how many times he had seen him but said it was “a few times – a lot of times”.11 Mohamed Douar said he and the victim arrived at the victim’s place at about 5.00 p.m. He said that after they had parked, a vehicle containing Bassim Said and another person pulled up. He said after that a four-wheel drive car, possibly a Toyota, drove past at about 50 km per hour. He thought there were three or four people in the car. He said a number of shots were fired from the car at the group of men but he did not recognise anyone in the car and did not remember seeing any guns. He gave some assistance to the victim after the shooting.12 Leave was granted under s38 of the Evidence Act, 1995 to cross-examine this witness who had made a statement on 2 December, 2004. In that statement he said he had a clear view of the front passenger seat and Samear Razzak who had a black gun and was shooting towards them. He also saw the appellant kneeling on the seat holding the seat with his left hand and holding a gun with his right hand. He said the appellant’s arm was extended and he was pointing the gun at the group. The appellant had a smaller black gun with an extended magazine and he was firing more than the other two and shooting the whole time. He also said that sitting behind the driver and shooting as well was a person he knew as Balaboof Razzak. He said that as the car drove past they continued to shoot and that the victim was behind a tree. In a further statement on 20 December, 2004 he said that he originally told the police he had seen nothing because he was too scared to get involved in case someone came after him.13 This witness agreed that he had appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal against a sentence he had received for an unrelated drug offence and he swore an affidavit promising assistance in this matter based upon the statement he had made on 2 December, 2004. He also said that not everything in the statement was true but he admitted he had identified the appellant and the co-accused. In cross-examination he said that some of the details were right but he could not identify anyone in the car.14 The man Bassim Said said he went with Rami Homsi to the victim’s place. He said when they pulled up the victim and Douar were standing and talking out the front and Homsi parked his car behind the victim’s car. They got out and were talking to the victim and Douar when he heard shots and he dropped to the ground. While he was on the ground, he said he could see nothing because he had his head down but after the shooting stopped he saw the victim had been wounded.15 Rami Homsi gave evidence that he was driving his Honda Prelude with Bassim Said as a passenger and they went to Mons Street on 8 May, 2004. He said they arrived at the victim’s house somewhere between 4.30 p.m. and 5.00 p.m. and they saw the victim and Mohamed Douar outside. He parked his car behind the victim’s car and they got out and began talking to the victim and Douar. He was about to leave when he heard gunshots. He dropped to the ground and stayed down but walked around his car for safety. He indicated that at the time of the shooting there were a few children in the front yards of the houses.16 The Police collected 22 fired cartridges from the vicinity of the shooting consisting of twelve .99mm ammunition and ten .40mm calibre ammunition. The latter ammunition could be fired by a Glock pistol. The cartridges were spread over a distance of 83 metres. A white Toyota Corolla car was damaged to its front windscreen, there was damage to a large tree which had missing bark, the premises next door to the victim at 8 Mons Street had damage to the flyscreen of the window of the master bedroom with corresponding damage to a wall inside the bedroom caused by a bullet.17 On 26 July, 2004 Detective Senior Constable Walker executed a search warrant at 29 French Street, Bankstown. In the second bedroom lying on the carpet south of the bed he found a Glock .23 self-loading pistol. It was black and had a magazine inserted in the grip. It contained 15 cartridges with another magazine lying next to it which contained two cartridges. The appellant was in the unit at the time the police officer arrived. Swabs were taken from the pistol and the forensic biologist’s evidence was that the major component of the DNA was a mixture from two individuals. She said the appellant could not be excluded as one of the major contributors and it was 1,000 times more likely to obtain this major profile if it originated from the appellant and an unknown unrelated individual than from two unknown unrelated individuals. She agreed there was no way of knowing how the DNA got on the gun nor how long it had been there.18 A ballistic expert who examined the Glock .23 found in the French Street unit gave evidence that the ten .40mm cartridges found at the scene of the shooting were fired from that Glock pistol.19 The lessee of the French Street unit, Adam Khlil, gave evidence that the appellant came to stay in his unit. At first he stayed in the lounge room and then in the second bedroom. He noticed the appellant had a Glock pistol and one day he saw it in a bag on the floor and he saw the appellant handling the gun. He said he told the appellant he did not want the gun in the unit and the appellant told him he would get rid of it.20 In the appellant’s case evidence was tendered that sunset on 8 May, 2004 was at 5.09 p.m. and that civil twilight ended at 5.35 p.m. and nautical twilight ended at 6.05 p.m. Evidence was also called from Brian McDonald, a consultant molecular geneticist, who prepared a DNA report. He found there were three contributors to the DNA on the pistol and was critical of the testing done by Freedman.Ground of Appeal 121 The first ground of appeal is that the trial miscarried but this assertion is based on the remaining grounds of appeal.Ground of Appeal 2“The jury was kept deliberating for too long.”22 The jury retired to consider its verdict at 3.16 p.m. on 12 March, 2007. The verdicts were returned at 3.05 p.m. on 23 March, 2007. The trial judge gave a direction in accordance with Black v R [1993-1994] 179 CLR 44 on 15 March at 2.42 p.m. On 16 March counsel for the appellant raised concerns about the length of time being taken by the jury and on 19 March counsel for a co-accused expressed similar concerns. On 20 March counsel for the other co-accused expressed concerns. An application by all counsel for the three accused to discharge the jury on this basis was rejected on 20 March.23 The submission is made that the jurors could not adequately recall the witnesses after 11 days and would give too much weight to the transcript. It is also submitted that after such a long time jurors are more likely to compromise their views.24 The trial itself lasted 16 days and taking into account the intervention of a weekend and the loss of a half day for a juror to attend a funeral, the actual period of deliberation was in reality less than eight days although the verdict came 11 days after the jury were sent out. At no stage did the jury indicate they would not be able to reach a verdict on any counts. The question asked before the Black direction was about unanimity in respect of “any of the defendants” and after the Black direction, no further difficulty was adverted to by the jury.25 There are many trials which last longer than this trial and it is not uncommon for jurors to have to recall the evidence of witnesses a month or months after that evidence is given. It would not be appropriate to specify an arbitrary period after which a jury should be discharged. Each case should be considered on its merits and in this case where there were multiple accused facing multiple counts and significant attacks on the credibility of some witnesses, it is not surprising the jury needed considerable time to consider the verdicts. I would dismiss this ground of appeal.Ground of Appeal 3“The verdicts of conviction were unsafe and unreasonable.”26 This ground is argued on the basis that the reliability of the evidence of MD’s identification of the two accused who were acquitted must have been rejected. It is certainly true that the jury was not prepared to convict on this evidence even supported to the extent it was by the evidence of Douar.27 The points raised in this respect on behalf of the appellant are that it was twilight and one witness described the light as dim. The shooting was at 5.19 p.m. and civil twilight ended at 5.35 p.m. MD said he had jumped behind a tree for protection and it is said he was not in a good position to observe. He is supported by the statement made by Douar but neither Said nor Homsi saw anything of the shooting because they were on the ground protecting themselves. Criticism is made of various accounts by eye witnesses and it is true there are discrepancies in the accounts given. It was, however, a brief episode where witnesses might be expected to be fearful and under stress. It is not unusual in such cases for discrepancies to occur. The question is whether they are of such a kind as to discredit the evidence.28 In this case I do not believe it is material that Said and Homsi did not see MD dive behind a tree. They were obviously more concerned with their own situation. Nor is Mrs Raso’s account that “all the boys dropped to the floor, got up and got in the car and took off” in a general sense inconsistent with the other evidence. Nor does any other account contradict the essential features of the case that the four men were standing outside the victim’s premises when a car came by firing shots and they sought cover.29 The claim is made that MD was demonstrated to be an unreliable witness. In support of that proposition it is pointed out that he said that he heard bullets hit the tree and saw bullet holes in the tree whereas the police did not locate any bullet holes but did see an area of bark missing off the tree. He also described the other men on the footpath as freezing in their positions and not as dropping to the ground. He also said that he was bleeding behind the tree and he put his hands on the wound to stop the bleeding and then subsequently touched the tree but no blood was found on the tree or on the ground near the tree. Blood was found on the driveway.30 It is claimed the opportunity to identify was also difficult because of the speed of the car going by. MD said he could not estimate the speed. The witness Elharis said the vehicle was speeding. The witness Raso said the vehicle “came screeching around the corner from Eldridge Road and screeched past her”. Douar said the car was doing 50 kph.31 These matters are all matters for a jury to consider in the light of the directions the trial judge gave. No challenge is mounted here to the directions given by the trial judge as to identification evidence. That is understandable because the directions given by the trial judge were careful, full and drew appropriate attention to matters for the jury to consider.32 The challenge which is mounted in respect of this ground is that the verdict is “unsafe and unreasonable”. This ground is based upon s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1912 which states that the Court of Criminal Appeal must allow an appeal against conviction if the Court is: 
     
      
      “… of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the grounds that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the Court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice”. 
      
    The High Court considered the history of this section of the Act in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487. The majority of the Court in a joint judgment of Mason CJ, Deane J, Dawson J and Toohey J considered the terms which have been used over the years in setting aside a verdict as unreasonable. These terms include “unjust or unsafe”, “unsafe or unsatisfactory”, or “dangerous or unsafe”, see at page 492. They went on to quote the view of Isaacs J in Hargan v The Queen (1919) 27 CLR 13 at page 23: 
     
      
      “If (the appellant) can show a miscarriage of justice, that is sufficient. That is the greatest innovation made by the Act, and to lose sight of that is to miss the point of the legislative advance.” 
      
    33 They also quoted the statement of Barwick CJ in Ratten v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR at page 516 that: 
     
      
      “It is the reasonable doubt in the mind of the court which is the operative factor”. 
      
    34 It was suggested in the majority judgment that some cases had indicated that such broad tests place insufficient emphasis upon the fact that the jury had seen and heard the evidence. In Whitehorn v The Queen (1983) 152 CLR 657 at page 687 Dawson J said: 
     
      
      “In particular, a court of appeal does not usually have the opportunity to assess the worth of a witness’s evidence by seeing and hearing that evidence given … These considerations point to important differences between the functions of the jury and those of a court of appeal. A jury is able, and is required, to evaluate the evidence in a manner in which a court of appeal cannot.” 
      
    35 In M v The Queen Brennan J at page 504 to 505 expressed the view that the test was “…to determine whether a jury, acting reasonably and appreciating the burden and standard of proof, could have convicted on the evidence available to support the conviction.” Applying that test to the facts of that case he concluded the conviction should not be overturned whereas the majority concluded the conviction should be overturned. McHugh J at page 525 came to the conclusion that the appropriate test was “If, after considering the evidence, the court concludes that a reasonable jury must have acquitted, the verdict is unreasonable even though there may be sufficient evidence, in law, to support the verdict.” Applying that test he also concluded the conviction should stand.36 In the majority judgment at page 494 it was said: 
     
      
      “But it is, we think, possible to make too much both of the view expressed by Barwick C.J. and of the qualification suggested. In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. Although the propositions stated in the four preceding sentences have been variously expressed in judgments of members of the Court in previous cases, we have put aside those differences in expression in order to provide authoritative guidance to courts of criminal appeal by stating the propositions in the form in which they are set out above.” 
      
    37 In the context of an appeal relating to the application of the proviso to the various Criminal Appeal Acts in Australia in Weiss v The Queen (2005) 224 CLR 300 in a unanimous judgment of six judges, the High Court said at paragraph 39 on page 315: 
     
      
      “Three fundamental propositions must not be obscured. First, the appellate court must itself decide whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. Secondly, the task of the appellate court is an objective task not materially different from other appellate tasks. It is to be performed with whatever are the advantages and disadvantages of deciding an appeal on the record of the trial; it is not an exercise in speculation or prediction. Thirdly, the standard of proof of criminal guilt is beyond reasonable doubt.” 
      
    And at paragraph 41 on page 316 it was said: 
     
      
      “That task is to be undertaken the same way an appellate court decides whether the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The appellate court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence and determine whether, making due allowance for the “natural limitations” that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record, the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty.” 
      
    38 The identification evidence in this case does need to be considered with care bearing in mind it was dusk, the incident happened quickly and the victim was diving away to save his life so that he did not have the benefit of a calm observation. On the other hand he was recognising someone he knew and not a stranger and not from any great distance. He was somewhat vague about how often he had seen the appellant but his answers demonstrated he had known him over a considerable period of time and recognised him instantly. Moreover he identified the appellant as one of the shooters to Senior Constable Higgins that evening while he was being conveyed in an ambulance from the scene of the shooting.39 The evidence of the victim is supported by the statement of Douar to the extent that can be relied upon, bearing in mind the changes in his version and that he had been attempting to gain an advantage for himself in his own sentencing proceedings and that he did not come forward to make the statement until seven months after the event.40 The finding of one of the guns used in the shooting incident in a flat occupied by the appellant is another piece of evidence which is available to the Crown to help prove the case. The evidence of Khlil proves the association of the appellant with a Glock pistol in that unit. The DNA evidence is not such as to prove anything other than a possible association with the gun. It cannot prove when that association might have been. It is the fact it was found in the premises occupied by the appellant and where he was seen in possession of such a gun beforehand. That is significant evidence.41 In R v Micallef (2003) 136 A Crim R 127 Dunford J said at [44]: 
     
      
      “I am satisfied that in the present case it was open to the jury to be satisfied that in the ordinary course of human experience and affairs, the combination and totality of the circumstances proved by the Crown were not consistent with the innocence of the appellant; and to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was the second person involved in the armed robbery. It was essentially a question for the jury representing, as it does, the common experience of the community, and I can see no significant possibility that an innocent man has been convicted.” 
      
    42 In this case it is the combination of the pieces of evidence which, on my independent assessment of the evidence, amount to proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant. MD was positive in his recognition of the appellant. From the totality of the evidence it was clearly light enough to be able to see. He nominated the appellant as one of the shooters to the police immediately after the shooting. He also said that Glock pistols were used and even though he said all the pistols were Glocks and that is clearly not correct, a Glock pistol was recovered and identified as one of the weapons used. Furthermore, a Glock pistol was found in premises occupied by the appellant just over two and a half months after the shooting and where the evidence was that the appellant had been handling such a pistol sometime before it was found by police. It is that evidence, leaving aside the evidence of the witness Douar, which in my view proves the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt and consequently it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty. I would dismiss this ground of appeal.Ground of Appeal 4“The verdicts were inconsistent.”43 This ground relies on the assertion that the verdicts of acquittal in respect of the two co-accused cannot be reconciled with the conviction of the appellant. Nor can his conviction be reconciled with the acquittal on the charge of shoot at with intent to murder. It can be seen from what I have said in relation to Ground 3 that in my view the evidence in relation to the finding of the gun was a significant part of the Crown case against the appellant. The jury obviously were not prepared to accept the evidence of MD of the identification of the two co-accused even bearing in mind the earlier statement of Douar. The critical difference is the evidence of the finding of a gun used in the shooting in premises occupied by the appellant and that does explain the different verdicts. 44 In MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606 at 617 it was stated by Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ: 
     
      
      “Since the ultimate question concerns the reasonableness of the jury’s decision, the significance of verdicts of not guilty on some counts in an indictment must necessarily be considered in the light of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Furthermore, it must be considered in the context of the system within which juries function, and of their role in that system. A number of features of that context were emphasized in  
      MacKenzie 
      . They include the following. First, as in the present case, where an indictment contains multiple counts, the jury will ordinarily be directed to give separate consideration to each count. This will often be accompanied by a specific instruction that the evidence of a witness may be accepted in whole or in part. Secondly, emphasis will invariably be placed upon the onus of proof borne by the prosecution. In jurisdictions where unanimity is required, such as New South Wales, every juror must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of every element in the offence. In the case of sexual offences, of which there may be no objective evidence, some, or all, of the members of a jury may require some supporting evidence before they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the word of a complainant. This may not be unreasonable. It does not necessarily involve a rejection of the complainant’s evidence. A juror might consider it more probable than not that a complainant is telling the truth but require something additional before reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. The criminal trial procedure is designed to reinforce, in jurors, a sense of the seriousness of their task, and of the heavy burden of proof undertaken by the prosecution. A verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that a complainant has been disbelieved, or a want of confidence in the complainant. It may simply reflect a cautious approach to the discharge of a heavy responsibility. In addition to want of supporting evidence, other factors that might cause a jury to draw back from reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt in relation to some aspects of a complainant’s evidence might be that the complainant has shown some uncertainty as to matters of detail, or has been shown to have a faulty recollection of some matters, or has been shown otherwise to be more reliable about some parts of his or her evidence than about others.” 
      
    45 Because of the difference in evidence available against the appellant as opposed to the evidence available against the two co-accused there cannot be said to be any inconsistency in those verdicts. Nor can there be said to be any inconsistency with the verdict the appellant was not guilty of shooting with intent to murder. It was entirely a matter for the jury to determine if an intent to kill was proved. In view of the fact that the car carrying the shooters went past without stopping, it can be readily understood that a jury might have a doubt about proof of an intent to kill.Ground of Appeal 5“The verdicts of convictions on the 4th, 6th and 8th counts were unsafe and unreasonable.”46 This ground raises a question as to whether the verdicts of guilty in respect of the offences of shooting at Douar, Said and Homsi are unreasonable and again this requires an examination of the evidence by this Court to assess whether the evidence is sufficient to prove the guilt of the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt.47 The victim MD said Samear Razzak who was in the front passenger’s seat was at first shooting in the air and then “he continued to shoot directly at me” and after the car had passed the house he continued to shoot in the air. He said as Samear Razzak was shooting at him he was looking at him and pointing the gun at him.48 MD said when he first saw Balaboof he thinks he was sticking out of the sunroof. When he first saw him he was shooting “in the air” and then “as he came closer to me he was shooting bullets at me and as he passed No. 12 or No. 14 he started to shoot back up in the air”.49 MD first saw the appellant leaning out of the rear passenger’s window with his arms and upper body out of the window. Then he said “He was shooting at me, I actually believe he was the one that actually shot me.” He said he believed the appellant was “aiming at him”.50 Douar in his evidence said “There was a car driving past and like it shot at us”. He was asked “Did you see any shots fired at you as the vehicle was going past?” He said “No, just went, like turned around and went down.” He said he did not see any shots fired at the other three. Subsequently the Crown was given permission to cross-examine him on the earlier statement he had made. He agreed in that statement he had said “I realised someone was shooting at us.” He also had said “I could feel bullets flying past my head.” He said also that the appellant “was pointing the gun at the group of us.” He also said as the car drove past “they continued to fire at us.” He said he was “fearful for my life as I thought I was going to be shot.”51 The other two persons standing outside the premises were Said and Homsi. Neither of them saw the shooting because they were on the ground taking cover. The only direct evidence then comes from the victim MD and Douar and their accounts are contradictory on the question of whether any of the shooting was directed at Douar, Said or Homsi. It might be possible to construct an argument that the actions of the shooters demonstrated an intention to shoot at all four men who were outside the premises. On the other hand it appears from the evidence that Homsi and Said had only just arrived and were about to leave again so their presence could not have been expected. Even Douar was a visitor. Any common purpose would have had to spring up immediately prior to the shooting. Bearing in mind the positive evidence of MD that he was the only person being shot at, I do not believe the evidence supports a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the shooters shot at Douar, Said or Homsi. The evidence of Douar in his statement to the contrary has to be significantly discounted because of the changes to his version, his attempts to utilise the court processes to obtain a reduction in his own sentence and the seven month delay in making the statement.52 In order to prove its case the Crown relies also on the fact the men were standing close together when the shooting occurred so that it can be said they were all shot at. However, Homsi gave evidence he and Said were about to leave and he had walked to the driver’s door of his car and he had the door open. The only other evidence came from Maria Raso who was visiting at a house across the street and the most she could say was that the shooting was “in the direction” of the four men. I do not believe the evidence establishes they were so close together that it can be said the shots were fired at all of them.53 I would allow this ground of appeal and quash the convictions on counts 4, 6 and 8 and enter verdicts of acquittal on each of those counts.Ground of Appeal 6“The verdict on the 9th count was unsafe and unreasonable.”54 The evidence I have summarised and accepted clearly indicates the appellant fired a number of shots. Clearly some of those shots did not strike the victim and they amounted to the offence charged. 55 There was also overwhelming evidence of a joint enterprise to fire shots in the air as the car approached and drove past the premises. The evidence of MD established shots were fired in the air both before and after the car passed No. 10 Mons Street.56 The trial judge gave appropriate directions on the law of common purpose. A later ground of appeal focuses on the directions relating to a common purpose which might spontaneously arise when it was seen there were a number of people outside the premises. That common purpose was said to be to shoot at Douar, Said and Homsi. On the other hand there can be no doubt at all there was a pre-formed common purpose for guns to be discharged in a public place outside the victim’s home. All the evidence indicated a number of persons leaning out of the car with guns firing shots before reaching the home of MD and all continuing to fire shots driving past the home of MD. I would dismiss this ground of appeal.Ground of Appeal 7“The trial judge erred in her directions on intent.”57 The complaint made is that the judge told the jury “Where a specific result is the obvious and inevitable consequence of a person’s act and where he deliberately does that act, you may readily conclude that he did that act with the intention of achieving that specific result.” It is not suggested this direction was wrong – see Parker v R [1962-1963] 111 CLR 610. The suggested error is that it was a dangerous direction in the circumstances of this case because it might lead the jury to believe they were being told it was legitimate to presume a person intends the natural and probable consequences of his act. However, the judge prefaced her remarks by observing “In some cases a person’s acts may themselves provide the most convincing evidence of his intention.” There is no suggestion of any “presumption” and no danger the jury could so interpret the directions.58 The problem with speaking of a presumption of intention is that it transfers the burden of rebutting the presumption on to the accused – see R v Stokes and Difford (1990) 51 A Crim R 25. That did not occur in this case. The trial judge gave full and clear directions as to the onus and burden of proof. It is suggested by the appellant the judge should have given a direction relating to circumstantial evidence. In Knight v The Queen (1992) 175 CLR 495 at 502 in the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ it was said as to this: 
     
      
      “However, it is a direction which is no more than an amplification of the rule that the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt …” 
      
    59 I do not believe there was any error of law in the directions given and I would dismiss this ground of appeal.Ground of Appeal 8“The trial judge erred in her directions in respect to the criminal enterprise.”60 This ground relates to the convictions on count 4, 6 and 8. Since in my view those convictions should not stand it is not necessary to consider this ground further.Ground of Appeal 9“The trial judge erred in permitting the Crown cross-examination of the witness Douar.”61 In my view it was necessary for the Crown to call Douar as a witness in this case. He was one of the four men on the footpath when the shooting began. Moreover, in his evidence given prior to the s38 application, he said “There was a car driving past and like it shot at us.” He said that the car was doing “50 ks”. He went on to say that he did not see the shooting but he heard it and that he then went to the ground. His evidence that “… it shot at us” is the only evidence which directly supports counts 4, 6 and 8. The only other witness to give some evidence in support about this was Mrs Raso who was a visitor to a house on the other side of the street and she said that the shooting was “towards where the boys were in the car” and at another point she said the guns were “facing where the boys were, on that direction, across the road from me.”62 In Whitehorn v The Queen (1983) 152 CLR 657 at 674 Dawson J said: 
     
      
      “All available witnesses should be called whose evidence is necessary to unfold the narrative and give a complete account of the events upon which the prosecution is based. In general, these witnesses will include the eye-witnesses of any events which go to prove the elements of the crime charged and will include witnesses notwithstanding that they give accounts inconsistent with the Crown case. However, a prosecutor is not bound to call a witness, even an eye-witness, whose evidence he judges to be unreliable, untrustworthy or otherwise incapable of belief.” 
      
    63 To the same effect was the observation of Heydon JA in R v Le (2002) 54 NSWLR 474 at page 486, paragraph 68, where he observed the witness “…was essential to the unfolding of the narrative underlying the Crown case.” In this case Douar was not only an eyewitness, he was the nominated victim in three of the charges on the indictment.64 The leave granted to cross-examine Douar under s38 of the Evidence Act had the result that he admitted making a statement identifying the shooters on 2 December, 2004 which was some seven months after the shooting and in circumstances where he had originally told the police he didn’t see who did the shooting. It was also clear that he used that statement which he had made on 2 December, 2004 in order to gain for himself a discount in respect of sentencing he was facing for an unrelated matter. He then resiled from that statement and gave evidence that it was wrong and he could not identify the shooters. Because of that evidence, the judge cautioned the jury about Douar’s evidence and it is because I regard his evidence as unsatisfactory that I do not believe that, unsupported as it is, it can be relied upon to prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused in respect of counts 4, 6 and 8.65 The complaint made on this appeal is that it introduced material into the trial which unfairly prejudiced the appellant. In Adam v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 96 at 109 in a joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Kirby and Hayne JJ it was pointed out in respect of s60 of the Evidence Act, 1995 (NSW): 
     
      
      “… the difference being that, by s60 of the Act, the prior statements would be admitted as evidence of the truth of their contents. But that difference brought about by s60 was one of the significant alternations in the rules of evidence that the Act was intended to effect. No longer were tribunals of fact to be asked to treat evidence of prior inconsistent statements as evidence that showed no more than that the witness may not be reliable. The prior inconsistent statements were to be taken as evidence of their truth.” 
      
    66 In a criminal trial where an application to cross-examine in relation to a prior inconsistent statement is made under s38, it is necessary to have regard to:  
     
      
      “ 
      s38(6)(a) whether the party gave notice at the earliest opportunity of his or her intention to seek leave and  
       
       
      (b)  
      the matters on which, and the extent to which, the witness has been, or is likely to be, questioned by another party 
      .”  
      
    It is also necessary to consider s192 which allows the court to grant leave to cross-examine “on such terms as the court thinks fit” and the court should consider: 
     
      
      “s192(2)  
      Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account: 
      
     
     
      
      (a) the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing; and 
       
      (b) the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness; and  
       
      (c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought; and 
      
     (d) the nature of the proceeding; and  
     
      
      (e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.” 
      
    In addition it is necessary to consider s135 which allows the court to “refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might: (a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party; or (b) be misleading or confusing; or (c) cause or result in undue waste of time.”The Court should also consider s137 which states: 
     
      
      “ 
      In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.” 
      
    The Court may also limit the use to be made of the evidence under s136.67 The appellant referred to R v Esposito (1998) 45 NSWLR 442 where at 456 Woods CJ at CL said: 
     
      
      “… whether or not the contents of any prior statement can be placed before the jury, by leave, either through cross-examination of that person, or through another witness (Evidence Act, s38 and s108), will depend upon the particular circumstances of the case, and upon the use to which the evidence is sought to be put. 
       
       
      In any such instance, for the reasons mentioned by Adams J, careful consideration will need to be given to the contemporaneity and reliability of any prior statement. For example, leave may well be refused in a case where the witness has given a series of conflicting statements; or in a case where the statement sought to be relief upon by the prosecution was made well distant in time from the events described; or where it is only partially consistent with his evidence at trial. Neither s38, nor s108, is in my view available to the Crown to introduce potentially unreliable evidence to bolster the “credibility” of a prosecution witness.” 
      
    68 The case of Esposito was one where the Crown sought to lead evidence from a witness of his own prior consistent statements made to the police and to the manager of a hostel for homeless people. This witness had been a co-accused in the charge of murder but the Crown had accepted a plea of guilty to robbery. It was submitted it was admissible under s66 of the Evidence Act and the prosecution said it was relevant to show he had volunteered information to the police believing he had nothing to fear. Wood CJ at CL also said at pages 455-456: 
     
      
      “I observe, in passing, that the proper course for the prosecution in a case such as the present is to adduce the evidence of the witness directly through him, that is, so far as his recollection extends; and not to seek to prove some earlier account that he may have given, as hearsay through other witnesses”.  
      
    He went on to observe that whether he would be allowed to refresh his memory would be another question. The question in the instant case is quite a different question to the one in Esposito where the evidence was sought to be adduced solely for the purpose of bolstering the witness’s evidence by reference to his own earlier statements.69 A helpful analysis of the development of the law in respect of s38 of the Evidence Act, 1995 is contained in the judgment of Johnson J in the case of R(Cth) v Petroulias (No. 29) [2007] NSWSC 1005. His Honour there points out that s38 has not been confined to the situation where a party calling a witness is confronted unexpectedly by unfavourable evidence (R v Parkes (2003) 147 A Crim R 450). His Honour went on to say: 
     
      
      “14. The interests of justice, the public interest and the administration of justice may be served by the testing of the evidence of a witness by way of a s38 examination: R v Le (2002) 54 NSWLR 474 at 487; R v Ronen [2004] NSWSC 1298. A grant of leave may permit a truer picture of the situation to be presented to the jury than would have been the case had the Crown been refused leave to cross-examine. This is the very purpose underlying s38: R v Parkes at 464 [81], [83].” 
      
    70 In the case of Adam v R supra at page 104-105 in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Kirby and Hayne JJ the question arose as to whether a statement should have been admitted by virtue of s38 of the Evidence Act. The Court considered Blewitt v The Queen (1988) 62 ALJR 503 where it was said: 
     
      
      “ 
      It is established that the calling of a witness known to be hostile for the sole purpose of getting before the jury a prior inconsistent statement which is inadmissible to prove facts against the accused is improper and might well give rise to a miscarriage of justice.” 
      
    71 It was pointed out that that was the situation at common law but under the Evidence Act if a prior inconsistent statement were admitted it was admissible to prove facts against an accused if tendered as evidence of the truth of its contents. It was pointed out that if admitted only to prove that the witness was not telling the truth then Blewitt’s Case would still be relevant.72 It was further pointed out that the first question as to admissibility was to determine if the statement was relevant in the sense of whether it “… could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding” see at page 105, paragraph 21. The Court went on to say: 
     
      
       “ 
      Contrary to the appellant’s contention, deciding 
        
      whether the evidence was relevant neither required nor permitted the trial judge to make some assessment of whether the jury would or might accept it. Section 55(1), with its reference to: if it [the evidence in question] were accepted”, requires that relevance be determined on the assumption that the tribunal of fact accepts the evidence. Relevance is demonstrated if, were the evidence to be accepted, it could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue 
      .” 
      
    73 The Court went on to acknowledge that the prior inconsistent statement might also have a bearing on the question of whether the witness was to be believed but said the evidence in that case related to more than that question.74 In this case the trial judge stated she had come to the view that leave should be granted and said that rather than delay the jury she would not give reasons at that time but would “make it clear coming to that decision I have had regard to s192 and indeed s127”. It is clear her Honour intended to refer to s137 which she had referred to earlier in discussions with counsel. A mistake appears to have arisen because the Crown Prosecutor had mistakenly referred to it as s127. During the course of the discussions her Honour was referred to R v Adam in the judgment of the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal and she was also referred to R v Esposito (1998) 105 A Crim R 27. Unfortunately her Honour’s reasons for allowing cross-examination were either not given or if they were, they have not been transcribed.75 It appears that her Honour did advert to ss135 to 137 of the Evidence Act because she said she had done so and “in particular”, s137. She also subsequently said she had to have regard to s192 of the Evidence Act. I believe it might be safely concluded that her Honour has properly exercised a discretion under those sections. That does not mean this Court cannot review the matter to determine whether the trial miscarried because the evidence should not have been admitted.76 In my view the evidence was properly admitted. It was in the interests of justice that the whole story in relation to the witness Douar be made available to the jury. In one sense it redounded to the appellant’s advantage in that it demonstrated the unreliability of his evidence about being fired at. The objection to his evidence is based on the possible prejudice from his statement identifying the three accused as the shooters which became evidence in the case by virtue of s60 of the Evidence Act. It is that prejudice which needs to be weighed in the question of considering whether it was unfair prejudice which outweighed its probative value. Had the course which her Honour followed not been taken, the jury would have been left with only part of the story relating to Douar’s involvement in this case. It simply became a matter for her Honour to give appropriate directions to the jury about the evidence. In my view the probative value was not outweighed by unfair prejudice and juries can be relied upon to make appropriate judgments about such matters. In this case they were obviously not prepared to rely on Douar’s statement, even supported by MD’s evidence identifying the two co-accused.77 In assessing the question of unfair prejudice outweighing probative value, it is important to bear in mind all evidence is prejudicial and the focus in relation to the inquiry under s137 is on “unfair” prejudice. In looking at the question of probative value it was said in R v Mundine [2008] NSWCCA 55 in the judgment of Simpson J in paragraph 33: 
     
      
      “ 
      What is to be considered is the role that that piece of evidence,  
      if accepted, 
       would play in the resolution of a (disputed) fact – or the contribution it might,  
      if accepted 
      , make to that resolution. Apart from anything else, to make the assessment of probative value on the basis of the perceived credibility or reliability of the witness through whom it is given, or perceived weakness in the evidence, would be to attempt to anticipate the weight the jury would attach to it, a task to be undertaken by the jury when all the evidence is complete.” 
      
    78 In my own independent assessment of the material and the relevant discretions to admit or exclude it, I believe it was appropriate for leave to be granted to cross-examine the witness Douar. The evidence was relevant for the jury to assess whether the account in the statement was true as well as the issue of the credibility of the witness. I believe the evidence could not be excluded under s192(2) of the Evidence Act. In particular it was not unfair because the witness was available to be tested by cross-examination – see Adam v R (supra) at 107 [30]. The evidence may have been prejudicial but it was not unfairly so and it should not have been rejected under ss135, 136 or 137 of the Evidence Act.79 Accordingly, I would dismiss this ground of appeal.Ground of Appeal 10“The trial judge failed to direct or sum up properly on Douar’s evidence.”80 The complaint is made that the trial judge’s direction left the statement of Douar as evidence in the case. That direction is in accord with the decision of R v Adam supra and which I have discussed above. A complaint is further made that the trial judge failed to identify the limited opportunity Douar had to identify the shooters. The trial judge did give extensive directions on identification and drew attention to relevant matters such as the opportunity to observe the speed of the car, the light and how well the person was known to the witness. The trial judge specifically states as to his evidence “That is evidence of identification just as MD’s evidence is evidence of identification and you must exercise the same degree of caution and carefulness in respect of that evidence if you accept it because of the reasons that I have already identified.” The trial judge went further and said to the jury that as to Douar’s evidence that they might accept one of his versions or the other or “… just reject Mr Mohammed Douar’s evidence completely, putting it to one side because you cannot decide what it is you should accept.” The trial judge in the summing up drew attention to the history of Mr Douar’s statements and evidence in the case and said to the jury “You must therefore exercise caution in determining whether to accept his evidence or any part of it and the weight you give to such part of the evidence that you may accept.” In my view the directions given by her Honour were adequate to alert the jury to the care they should exercise in respect of Douar’s evidence and I would dismiss this ground of appeal.The Sentence Appeal81 There is before the Court an application for leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed in this case. With the quashing of the convictions and sentences in respect of counts 4, 6 and 8 the following sentences are involved: 
     
      
      1. On count 9 of firing a firearm in a public place contrary to s93G(1)(b)  
      Crimes Act 
      , 1900 four years fixed term from 27 July, 2005 to expire on 26 July, 2009. The maximum penalty is ten years. 
      
     
     
      
      2. On count 2 of discharging a firearm with intent to do grievous bodily harm in company contrary to s33A(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 
      , 1900 a total sentence of 12 years made up of a non-parole period of eight years from 27 July, 2006 and a balance of term of four years. The maximum penalty is 20 years. 
      
    82 A number of specific matters have been raised by the applicant. They are: 
     
      
      1. the sentence was unduly harsh; 
       
      2. the sentencing judge breached the rule in  
      de Simoni 
      ; 
       
      3. the sentencing judge erred in her assessment of criminality involved; 
       
      4. the sentencing judge erred in failing to make any or specific allowance to the principle of totality; 
       
      5. the sentencing judge erred in respect to subjective matters. 
       
      
    83 The argument is advanced firstly that the sentence was unduly harsh. Counsel has discovered only three cases since October, 2000 where an offender has been sentenced for an offence under s33A(2) where the highest sentence was seven years with a five year non-parole period. His research as to sentences under s33 which carries a maximum penalty of 25 years and relates to an offence of malicious wounding with intent, showed sentences ranged from two to 16 years with non-parole periods of 12 months to eight years.84 It must be said that three cases do not establish a tariff. The nature of offences of this kind can vary significantly and each case should be determined on its own facts. Certainly a head sentence of 12 years where the maximum sentence available is 20 years cannot be said to be anywhere near approaching the maximum penalty available. The offences we are dealing with arise because of an on-going dispute between the Razzak family and the Darwiche family. In the report of the psychologist, Mr Diment, it is reported that arising from this dispute an uncle and cousin of the applicant have been killed and a brother shot. The applicant’s own prior conviction for contempt arose in a case arising from this dispute. The facts of the case involving at least three men driving down a suburban street firing handguns on a Saturday afternoon amount to an act of urban terrorism such as is rarely seen in our Courts. In my view it is the sort of act which should be denounced in the strongest terms because of the need for general deterrence.85 There are at the end of the day convictions for two offences and the offence of discharging a firearm in a public place in the same circumstances must also give rise to a sentence which denounces that offence. There were 22 spent shells recovered from the scene by police and a further one brought to the police station. There were people going about their normal business in their front gardens and there was evidence that children were playing outside No. 10 or nearby. I have earlier noted damage to a motor vehicle and the house next door from bullets. That offence should also attract an additional penalty. In my view leaving aside the other considerations it cannot be said that a total sentence of 13 years with a non-parole period of nine years dating from 27 July, 2005 is excessive.86 It is also asserted the sentencing judge in fact sentenced for a more serious offence contrary to principles laid down in R v de Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. It is certainly true the judge mentioned the fact that the victim was shot in the buttock. However, her Honour correctly stated the offence was one under s33A(2) with a maximum penalty of 20 years. There is no reason to believe she lost sight of that fact when imposing sentences. In setting out the facts she was merely outlining what had occurred and the fact that she mentioned a wounding must be understood in that context. It is true that in structuring the sentences she did, the sentence imposed on count 2 was in fact greater than the sentence imposed on counts 4, 6 and 8. However, the reason for that appears to be because she did not fix a balance of term on those sentences and merely imposed a fixed term. The fixed term on counts 4 and 8 was eight years from 27 July, 2006 which is exactly the term of the non-parole period on count 2. She obviously did not consider it necessary to impose a balance of term on those offences because a parole period had been set in relation to count 2. If the sentence on count 2 were to be reduced to the same sentence, then the applicant would end up with a fixed term of imprisonment and be released without any form of supervision at all after nine years. That is highly undesirable.87 The mandate of this Court under the Criminal Appeal Act, 1912 s6(3) is to reduce a sentence where “… it is of opinion that some other sentence … is warranted in law and should have been passed …”88 I do not believe there was any error by the sentencing judge in assessing the criminality involved in this case. The Crown case clearly was that the victim was the intended target of the shooting and it is also abundantly apparent that all of the persons in the car knew that guns were to be discharged in the street.89 The sentence is also criticised because the judge failed to take into account the principles of totality. On the other hand the judge specifically said she had taken into account the principle of totality and it appears to me she certainly did so because of the fact she only accumulated one year on to the major sentence. In my view a greater accumulation may have been justified.90 The last criticism raised is that the subjective circumstances were not taken into account adequately. The sentencing judge did know the applicant was only 20 at the time of the offences and that he had been in continuous custody since his arrest on 26 July, 2004. She was careful to backdate the sentences to give him credit for all the time he had spent in pre-sentence custody and she gave him the benefit of some concurrency in respect of a six month sentence for drive while disqualified. The judge noted the psychologist’s report and noted the evidence of the applicant’s mother who believed he had matured since the time of the offences. The psychologist had set out in his report the background of the appellant who was born in Australia to a Lebanese migrant family. His parents separated when he was 15 and it appears the applicant first began to misbehave at about that time. It was properly noted that he had a conviction on 24 May, 2001 in Lidcombe Children’s Court for possessing a loaded firearm in a public place and that he had been dealt with and sentenced for offences of drive while disqualified and contempt of court. I believe the subjective circumstances were adequately considered by the sentencing judge.91 The quashing of the convictions and sentences in respect of three of the charges does raise a question as to whether or not on the principle of totality there should be a reduction in the sentence. In my view it should not because the sentences quashed were concurrent with the non-parole period and two of them are the same length as the non-parole period. Nor do I believe that any less severe penalty is warranted in law in respect of two such serious offences as are disclosed on the facts of the two convictions which are confirmed. 92 Accordingly, the orders I would propose are that: 
     
      
      1. the appeal against conviction in respect of counts 4, 6 and 8 of the indictment be allowed and the convictions and sentences be quashed and verdicts of acquittal entered; 
       
      2. the appeal against conviction in respect of counts 2 and 9 be dismissed and the convictions confirmed; 
       
      3. grant leave to appeal against the sentences on counts 2 and 9 but dismiss the appeal. 
      
    93 HALL J: I agree with the reasons and orders proposed by Blanch J. I also concur with the observations made by Allsop P in his judgment.

    JUDGMENT 
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff is the younger son of Violet Edwina Hastings who died on 29 February 2008. He seeks an order for provision out of her estate pursuant to s 7 of the Family Provision Act 1982 (NSW). Mrs Hastings was survived by two sons: John (the defendant) and Phillip (the plaintiff). Her estate was initially valued for probate purposes at $643,789. The principal asset is a house at 4 Rayner Avenue, Narraweena. Market appraisals of that property range between $610,000 and $760,000. The average is in the order of $685,000.  
     
      
    2 T Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that he should receive an order for provision calculated as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        i) To pay off his car loan and credit card debts, ~ $35,000 
         
        ii) To assist with retraining, and/or to help establish  
         
        a small stone importing business, ~ $40,000 
         
        iii) To assist with medical treatment (orthopaedic  
         
        condition) ~ $20,000 
         
        iv) Accommodation ~ 
         
        v) As a capital fund to meet unexpected contingencies  
        $25,000 
         
          
        Total 
          
        $140,000 
        ” 
        
       
      
    3 The deceased had three sons: the defendant, now aged 61; Robert, who died on 29 July 2004; and the plaintiff, now aged 57. By her last will made on 18 February 2005, she appointed the defendant the executor and gave him all her estate. In earlier wills made on 16 August 1993 and 7 September 1998, she divided her estate (or in the case of the 1993 will her residuary estate) between the defendant and Robert equally. In none of her wills did she provide for the plaintiff.  
     
      
    4 The principal question in this case is whether the plaintiff’s criminal conduct and long absences disentitle him from being considered as a proper object of his mother’s testamentary bounty. That question is to be answered having regard to the circumstances as they exist today. 
     
      
    5 The plaintiff committed serious crimes involving the importing and distribution of marijuana in America. He left Australia in 1969 when he was 18. After travelling extensively he settled in Hawaii in about 1976. He deposed that he moved to California in the mid-1980s and that during his time in the United States he was involved in the drug trade. He further deposed that in the early 1980s he went into a property development business with his brother Robert and provided finance to the company established to operate that business from the proceeds of criminal activity.  
     
      
    6 In 1988 he was arrested when on holiday in Mexico on charges of drug importation. He remained in custody for three and a half years. He says he was tortured whilst in custody and was ultimately acquitted. There is hearsay evidence, not objected to, that the plaintiff’s release in 1991 was procured by bribes provided by his brother Robert. 
     
      
    7 Newspaper articles were published in Australia in 1990 and 1991 in relation to the plaintiff and his alleged ill treatment. The newspaper articles said that he had been arrested on drug-running charges. At the time, the deceased thought that people avoided her or gossipped about the charges.  
     
      
    8 The plaintiff returned to Australia in 1991 and to Hawaii in 1992. He deposed that he started a charter fishing business. At that time, according to the plaintiff, he was receiving income from Robert’s property development company which he had financed through the proceeds of criminal activity. There was a falling out with Robert and payments from that source ceased. The plaintiff deposed that in about 1996 and 1998 he became involved with a number of people selling marijuana in California.  
     
      
    9 A warrant for his arrest was issued on 13 March 1998 in California to answer an indictment of conspiracy to import and distribute marijuana. The indictment alleged that the plaintiff, along with 19 other defendants, conspired to import and distribute 18,000 pounds of Thai marijuana. 
     
      
    10 The plaintiff learnt of the indictment when he was in Australia. He fled Australia to Canada and then to Fiji where he lived under an assumed name. In July 2001 he was arrested in Fiji and imprisoned, awaiting extradition. He deposed that the United States did not have an extradition treaty with Fiji and that whilst in custody he reached a plea agreement with the Californian authorities. He pleaded guilty to a charge of distributing Marijuana, was deported to Canada, and thence to the United States where he served a term of imprisonment. He was released in July 2005. 11 The plaintiff deposed that all of his assets were seized by the drug enforcement authorities and forfeited. 
     
      
    12 Even on the plaintiff’s evidence, he had little contact with his mother after he left Australia in 1969. He said he sent gifts to her on her birthday and at Christmas. The defendant denies this. I am not satisfied that he did so. The plaintiff says that his mother visited him in Hawaii on several occasions in 1977 and 1980. The evidence is not corroborated and I do not accept it. There is no dispute that the deceased visited the plaintiff in 1984.  
     
      
    13 The defendant said that until 1984, the family had no idea where the plaintiff was living and had no way of contacting him. I accept that evidence.  
     
      
    14 The plaintiff said that after he left Australia in 1999 on hearing of the fact that charges had been laid against him in the United States, he deliberately had little contact with his mother so that she would not be put in a difficult position if the police made inquiries as to his whereabouts. The plaintiff said that after his arrest in Fiji he and his mother spoke regularly by telephone and that he was also in communication with her when he was imprisoned in California. In March 2004 she obtained a copy of his birth certificate and sent it to the prison in California so that he could apply for an Australian passport after his release. 
     
      
    15 After the plaintiff’s release, he worked for a company in California which produced surfboard “blanks”. A blank being the core of a surfboard. He and some unidentified partners established a business manufacturing such products and leased a factory in Mexico for their manufacture.  
     
      
    16 In July 2007 the plaintiff was advised by the defendant that their mother had been diagnosed with cancer. The plaintiff left Mexico on or about 28 July 2007 and returned to his mother’s house. A couple of weeks later, he returned briefly to Mexico but was refused entry. He returned to Sydney and then left for 18 days to travel to Thailand to investigate the possibility of being appointed a distributor in Australia of Thai stone. On about 17 September 2007, he returned to the Travelodge at Manly and then to his mother’s house for a couple of weeks before moving to Queensland where he established a residence. He stayed with his mother over Christmas 2007 and then returned to Queensland before returning to stay with his mother in mid to late January. He stayed until his mother’s death on 29 February 2008. He has continued to reside in his mother’s house, without paying rent to the defendant. On 13 November 2008 Windeyer J ordered that he give vacant possession of the property to the plaintiff by 11 December 2008. 
     
      
    17 The plaintiff’s counsel submitted that the plaintiff had left his business in California and Mexico to look after his mother on learning of her terminal illness. While there is a measure of truth in that, nonetheless, in the seven months after he returned to Australia at the end of July 2007 until his mother’s death on 29 February 2008 he spent no more than two and a half months with her. 
     
      
    18 I accept that during the time the plaintiff was with his mother, he provided her with care. Nonetheless, that belated and short contact affords no substantial basis for a claim on her estate. 
     
      
    19 The deceased’s solicitor, Mr McDarra, made a contemporaneous file note of his conference with the deceased on 9 February 2005 when he received instructions for a new will. The deceased told Mr McDarra that she needed to update her will because Robert had died. She said she wanted to leave everything to the defendant and nothing to the plaintiff. Mr McDarra recorded her reasons as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        She wants to leave everything to John only 
         
         
        - Phillip to get nothing -  
         
         
        Because 
        :- 1. she gets on with John & his two sons – they visit her and call her regularly 
         
          
           
            
            2. re:  
            Phillip 
             – she hears from him only every couple of years now 
             
            - but he disappeared for about 20 years at least (between 1968-1988) 
            
           
          
         
         - he rang her out of the blue about 15/20 years ago 
         
          
           
            
            - his lifestyle has been ‘fast’ – ‘rich & then in jail then rich again.” He even dragged his brother Robert into it – all the stress killed Robert (heart attack) 
             
            - she believes he sold drugs. He’s been in the paper – charged with drug smuggling – very embarrassing for her – her name was even printed (illegible) 
             
            - he has lived in S/Africa, England, USA, Mexico (illegible) 
            
           
          
         
         - she knows Phillip will blow his share immediately 
         
          
           
            
            - she looked after the house for years and she’s worried he’ll just piss it up against the wall 
             
            - she doesn’t know if he’s well off but he manages to get by 
            
           
          
         
         - John is more  
        responsible 
         and has earned it. 
         
          
           
            
            - he has also helped with the house over the years & added value to it. 
            ” 
            
           
          
         
          
        
       
      
    20 Mr McDarra advised her of the possibility of a claim under the Family Provision Act. His file note reads “Told her about FPA – she wants to take the punt”.  
     
      
    21 Mr McDarra was again consulted on 2 July 2007. At her request, he prepared a power of attorney appointing the defendant as her attorney. When Mr McDarra met the deceased they had a conversation to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Me: Do you still want to leave your will as it is and leave him out completely? 
        
       
       
        
        Deceased: Yes. Leave it as it is. 
        
       
       
        
        Me: Do you think your son Phillip will make a claim against your estate? 
        
       
       
        
        Deceased: I don’t know. I don’t really know him as a person because I have had so little to do with him for years and years, so I don’t know what he might do. But John can take care of it whatever happens. 
        
       
       
        
        Me: There is always the option of leaving something in your will to Phillip, to prevent a claim, but the question is always how much is adequate. 
        
       
       
        
        Deceased: No. I don’t want him to get anything. 
        ” 
        
       
      
    22 There were numerous conflicts between the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s evidence. I prefer the defendant’s evidence. Even where there is no conflict, I do not accept the plaintiff’s evidence unless it is corroborated or is in accordance with the objective facts. My adverse assessment of the plaintiff’s credit is partly due to his criminal record. He was also cross-examined to some effect on a false application he signed in late 2007 to obtain car finance. He signed an application for finance which stated that in the preceding five years he had not been imprisoned for three months or more, nor been convicted of any criminal offence. I was unimpressed by what I consider to be his pretence in the witness box of not being able to find the particular statements in the form on which he was being cross-examined and to which his attention had just been drawn. The purpose of that pretence seemed to be to attempt to convince me that the plaintiff had not known to what statements he had placed his signature. 
     
      
    23 The plaintiff deposed that at about the end of January 2008, his mother said to him “You’re not going to like what is in my will. But now I know you are not the person I thought you were, you can work it out with your brother.”  
     
      
    24 That evidence was not corroborated and I do not accept it. In any event, it does not indicate that the deceased had changed her mind and regretted not leaving any part of her estate to the plaintiff. She was familiar with the steps needed for making or changing a will. Her solicitor had previously visited her on her giving a power of attorney. Had her testamentary wishes changed, she would have asked for Mr McDarra to attend on her to change her will.  
     
      
    25 The plaintiff has considerable financial needs. He currently lives in the deceased’s home but has been ordered out of the property by 11 December 2008. He deposes that he has no assets of any substance except his car. There is no contrary evidence and I assume that that is so. The plaintiff has no current income except social security benefits. He owes a debt of $15,728 in respect of a loan for the car. He owes about US$12,000 on various United States credit cards. No repayments have been made on those cards for many months and it is likely that the debts will be written off. Nonetheless, the plaintiff is liable for those debts. The plaintiff will be unable to return to the United States for five years.  
     
      
    26 The plaintiff has significant health problems, most particularly with his back. These prevent him from taking employment requiring physical labour which places strain on his back. 
     
      
    27 The defendant has powerful claims on his mother’s bounty which she recognised. The defendant lived with his mother for many years after his brothers moved out in the 1960s to the mid-1980s. He is a plumber by trade and did a lot of work around his mother’s house. The deceased told Mr McDarra in 2005 that the defendant had been a good son, had looked after the house and done work on it and that she saw the defendant and his sons regularly and that they talked regularly by telephone. 
     
      
    28 The defendant lives in Jindabyne. He has sold his house there and bought an investment unit in Jindabyne for $475,000. He proposes to live in the house that belonged to his mother. He is substantially better off than the plaintiff, but not wealthy. After settling the purchase of the Jindabyne property, he will have cash funds of about $210,000 as well as the investment unit. He owns three motor vehicles. He is 61 and has no superannuation. He currently works in Jindabyne as a plumber and intends to seek work in Sydney. His current net income before tax is about $600 per week.  
     
      
    29 Sections 7 and 9(2) and (3) of the Family Provision Act provide: 
     
      
       
        
        “7 Provision out of estate or notional estate of deceased person 
         
         
        Subject to section 9, on an application in relation to a deceased person in respect of whom administration has been granted, being an application made by or on behalf of a person in whose favour an order for provision out of the estate or notional estate of the deceased person has not previously been made, if the Court is satisfied that the person is an eligible person, it may order that such provision be made out of the estate or notional estate, or both, of the deceased person as, in the opinion of the Court, ought, having regard to the circumstances at the time the order is made, to be made for the maintenance, education or advancement in life of the eligible person. 
        
       
       
        
        ... 
        
       
       
        
        9 Provisions affecting Court’s powers under secs 7 and 8 
         
         
        ... 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The Court shall not make an order under section 7 or 8 in favour of an eligible person out of the estate or notional estate of a deceased person unless it is satisfied that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the provision (if any) made in favour of the eligible person by the deceased person either during the person’s lifetime or out of the person’s estate, ... 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ... 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          is, at the time the Court is determining whether or not to make such an order, inadequate for the proper maintenance, education and advancement in life of the eligible person. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) In determining what provision (if any) ought to be made in favour of an eligible person out of the estate or notional estate of a deceased person, the Court may take into consideration: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) any contribution made by the eligible person, whether of a financial nature or not and whether by way of providing services of any kind or in any other manner, being a contribution directly or indirectly to: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) the acquisition, conservation or improvement of property of the deceased person, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) the welfare of the deceased person, including a contribution as a homemaker, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the character and conduct of the eligible person before and after the death of the deceased person, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) circumstances existing before and after the death of the deceased person, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) any other matter which it considers relevant in the circumstances. 
          ” 
          
         
        
       
      
    30 All the circumstances relevant to what would be “proper” maintenance and advancement in life for the plaintiff must be considered at both stages of the two-stage process the Act mandates (Singer v Berghouse (1994) 181 CLR 201 at 209-210).  
     
      
    31 The character and conduct of the plaintiff is not only relevant in determining what provision ought to be made if it is found that the will made inadequate provision for the plaintiff’s proper maintenance and advancement in life. It is also relevant to determining what is “proper” maintenance and advancement in life for which adequate provision should be made.  
     
      
    32 In Hughes v National Trustees Executors & Agency Co of Australasia Ltd (1979) 143 CLR 134, Gibbs J, with whom Mason and Aiken JJ agreed, said (at 156): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        The question whether conduct is sufficient to disentitle an applicant to relief must depend not only on the nature of the conduct itself, but also, to some extent, on the strength of his need or claim to provision from the estate of the testatrix. The stronger the applicant’s case for relief, the more reprehensible must have been his conduct to disentitle him to the benefit of any provision. 
        ” 
        
       
      
    33 Gibbs J also cited with approval the statement of Philp J in Re Hatte [1943] SR (Qld) 1 at 26 as follows (at 148): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        ... a just father’s moral duty is to assist the lame ducks amongst his offspring, provided they be not morally or otherwise undeserving. 
        ”  
        
       
      
    34 In In re The Will of Gilbert (1946) 46 SR (NSW) 318, Jordan CJ, speaking of s 3(2) of the Testator’s Family Maintenance and Guardianship of Infants Act 1916 (NSW), said (at 321):  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Section 3(2) of the Act provides that the Court may refuse to make an order in favour of any person whose character or conduct is such as to disentitle him to the benefit of such an order. I think that this means character or conduct relevant to the purposes which the Act is intended to serve, for example, misconduct towards the testator, or character or conduct which shows that any need which an applicant may have for maintenance is due to his or her own default 
        .” 
        
       
       
      (See also per Maxwell J at 326.) 
       
      
    35 The context of this statement was the rejection of a submission that perjury committed by the plaintiff in her application for provision disentitled her from relief. 
     
      
    36 In Price v Roberts (23 September 1992, Court of Appeal, unreported) Clarke JA, with whom Handley JA agreed, said (at 6): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        It cannot be doubted that the character and conduct spoken of are related to the purposes of the Act but I do not think that there should be an inflexible approach to the application of s 9(3)(b) of the Act nor should the field of inquiry be limited by the terms of the illustrations given by the judges in  
        Gilbert 
        . ... 
        
       
       
        
        Because the statutory provision is expressed in such general terms I do not think that there should be any qualification upon the character or conduct taken into account except insofar as it must be borne in mind that it must be relevant to the purposes of the Act. 
        ” 
        
       
      
    37 In Price v Roberts, the plaintiff was the deceased’s daughter for whom no provision was made by the will and for whom in ordinary circumstances, provision would have been required. But the plaintiff had been convicted of murdering her husband. Clarke JA said (at pp 7-8): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        The appellant had been convicted of a very serious crime and although the deceased was not, in the strict sense, a victim of that crime the evidence supported two conclusions. First, that the deceased’s attitude to the appellant changed following the conviction and, secondly, that the need which the appellant established was contributed to in a significant way, if not caused by, her own criminal conduct. 
        
       
       
        
        In these circumstances I do not think that it can be said that the Master was wrong when he concluded that sensible members of the community would not have felt that in the circumstances the appellant should have been provided for in the will. 
        ” 
        
       
      
    38 Here also, the plaintiff’s criminal conduct affected the deceased. She felt that she was shunned and was embarrassed by the publicity. 
     
      
    39 Moreover, the plaintiff’s present impecuniosity is the direct result of the confiscation of his property by United States authorities. That confiscation is the direct result of his crimes. That is so even if, as the plaintiff said, the property confiscated was not the proceeds of crime. 
     
      
    40 A criminal record is not as such a bar to a claim under the Act. A good example is Hoadley v Hoadley (17 February 1987, Young J, unreported). There, Young J (as his Honour then was) made an order for provision in favour of an adult child who had spent 20 years in prison, where his Honour considered there would be good prospects of rehabilitation which an order for provision would promote. 
     
      
    41 In this case it was submitted that the plaintiff, having served his sentence, had paid his debt to society for his crimes and should not be further punished by being deprived of any part of the estate to which he otherwise had a proper claim under the Act. It was also submitted that the plaintiff was contrite and acknowledged his wrong-doing. As to the latter, it is true that the plaintiff acknowledged his criminal conduct. He could hardly have done otherwise. I do not regard that as an act of contrition. It is only partly true to say that the plaintiff has paid his debt to society. He admits having engaged in unspecified criminal conduct during the 1980s involving the drug trade for which he has not been tried and convicted. Nonetheless, he is not to be punished for that by now being denied provision.  
     
      
    42 In my view, the plaintiff’s submission mischaracterises the true question. It would not be further punishment for the plaintiff for him not to receive provision from the estate. Rather, that would be a recognition that his conduct, when considered with all other factors, is such that he does not have a legitimate claim on the deceased’s testamentary bounty. Refusing his claim under the Act means that he is not relieved from the financial predicament to which his own crimes have brought him. In that sense, to deny him a claim under the Act means that there is no mitigation of the punishment entailed by the forfeiture of his property. However, punishment, or mitigation of punishment, is not a relevant consideration. Rather the question is whether his character and conduct, when considered with all the other relevant circumstances, is such that, considering matters as they presently stand, no provision need be made for his proper maintenance or advancement in life out of the estate.  
     
      
    43 The deceased was well able to judge the relative desserts of her children. The defendant had substantial claims on her as she recognised. The plaintiff’s character and conduct, the fact that his financial needs are due to his own fault, the shame his conduct brought on the deceased and the family, and the very slight contact he had with his mother during his adult life, indicate that he does not have a legitimate claim on his mother’s property. That is so notwithstanding his impecuniosity, his health problems and his belated care for his mother at the very end of her life. I do not think sensible members of the community would feel that in circumstances the plaintiff should have been provided for in the will even had the testatrix known of the plaintiff’s current financial circumstances and his current state of health. 
     
      
    44 The defendant did not press for an order for mesne profits pursuant to the cross-summons. The defendant said that the benefit that the plaintiff has had in being able to live rent-free in the property since his mother’s death was a reason for concluding that he was not entitled to further provision.  
     
      
    45 For these reasons I order that the summons be dismissed and that paragraph 3 of the cross-summons be dismissed. I order that the plaintiff pay the defendant’s costs of the proceedings. Exhibits may be returned after 28 days.

      JUDGMENT 
       
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: 
       
       
      (1) INTRODUCTION 
       
      
    1 Henry Charles Landini (“the plaintiff”) commenced proceedings on 20 November 2002 by way of statement of claim filed on that date seeking damages for malicious prosecution in respect of two charges on which he was indicted (referred to as “the 1980 charge” and “the 1982 charges”). Those charges arose from separate and independent events. In summary, they were:- 
     
      
       
      (1) A charge that on or about 15 January 1980 he supplied a prohibited drug, namely, heroin ( 
      “the 1980 charge” 
      ). 
       
       
      (2) Two charges that between 1 March and 19 July 1982 he conspired to supply a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, heroin, and that on 19 July 1982 he was in possession of an unlicensed pistol ( 
      “the 1982 charges” 
      ). 
       
      
    2 The plaintiff pleads his case in relation to the charges upon the basis of the tort of malicious prosecution. No other cause of action was pleaded to support the claims made. 
     
      
    3 The plaintiff’s claims were for damages for loss and damage, deprivation of liberty and economic loss, aggravated and exemplary damages. 
     
      
    4 He is presently aged 64 years (date of birth, 7 July 1944). 
     
      
    5 In respect of the 1980 charge, the plaintiff appeared before the Central Local Court on 16 January 1980. On that date, he was released on bail upon payment of a surety of $10,000. In 1981, he was committed for trial. On 11 October 1983 and before the hearing of the proceedings in relation to the 1980 charge, the plaintiff was found guilty of the 1982 charges in respect of which he was subsequently sentenced to a period of imprisonment of 16 years with a non-parole period of six years. The term of the sentence was to commence on 19 July 1982, being the date upon which he was arrested and taken into custody in relation to the 1982 charges. 
     
      
    6 It was the plaintiff’s case that in 1984, having been sentenced for the 1982 charges, he decided to plead guilty to the 1980 charge in the expectation that the sentence imposed with respect to that charge would be made to operate concurrently with the sentence imposed in 1983. 
     
      
    7 On 7 June 1984, he was sentenced in relation to the 1980 charge to a period of imprisonment for 15 years to date from 19 July 1984 concurrent with the sentence imposed with respect to the 1982 charges with a non-parole of four years expiring on 18 July 1988. 
     
      
    8 The plaintiff was released to parole on 12 August 1987 having served five years and 25 days imprisonment. 
     
      
    9 On 2 November 2001, the Court of Criminal Appeal set aside the convictions in respect of the 1980 charge and the 1982 charges and entered an acquittal in respect of each charge. The applications to the Court of Criminal Appeal that led to the acquittals being entered followed upon evidence being given by Mr Trevor Haken and a former Federal police officer referred to in these proceedings as “Mr X” to the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service. The applications to the Court were not opposed by the Crown. 
     
      
    10 The present proceedings were commenced the next year. 
     
      
    11 At the hearing of proceedings in this Court, the plaintiff was represented by Mr C Steirn SC, Mr P Barham of counsel and Mr P Strain of counsel. The State of New South Wales was represented by Mr J E Maconachie QC, who appeared with Mr P D Mallon of counsel and in respect of the causes of action based on both the 1980 and the 1982 charges, Ms A Katzmann SC appeared with Mr I F Butcher of counsel on behalf of the Commonwealth of Australia and Mr P M Strickland SC appeared on behalf of the fourth defendant, Mr Dennis Reginald Pattle in respect of the cause of action based on the 1982 charges. The fifth defendant, Mr Glen John Matinca was not represented, apart from a short period when Mr L Tyndall of counsel appeared with Mr G Pulsford of counsel on his behalf. He was called to give evidence in the plaintiff’s case and, at one point, Mr Tyndall appeared on his behalf on a question of privilege. 
     
      
    12 The statement of claim was amended several times. At an early stage of the hearing application was made for leave to further amend the plaintiff’s claim. That application was strongly opposed by the first defendant, the State of New South Wales. 
     
      
    13 On 12 October 2006, I granted leave to the plaintiff to amend (Landini v State of New South Wales & Ors (unreported 12 October 2006). The plaintiff, accordingly, proceeded on the basis of the Fifth Further Amended Statement of Claim. 
     
      
    14 The plaintiff claimed against the first defendant, the State of New South Wales, in respect of the 1980 charge in relation to the alleged acts of then Detective Sergeant Third Class Les Knox, Detective Senior Constable Glen Ross, Detective Senior Constables Michael Leary, Trevor Haken, Stephen Chidgey and Michael Gardiner. The plaintiff, in relation to the 1982 charges, claimed against the State of New South Wales in respect of the alleged acts of Ray Donaldson and against the Commonwealth of Australia (second defendant), Dennis Reginald Pattle (fourth defendant) and Glen John Matinca (fifth defendant) in respect of the 1982 charges. Pattle and Matinca were at the relevant time police officers employed by the Australian Federal Police. 
     
      
    15 The proceedings against the State of New South Wales, were, in part, based upon the Crown Proceedings Act 1988. Section 5 of that Act authorises a claim to be brought against the Crown under the title “State of New South Wales” in any court of competent jurisdiction by “any person having or deeming himself, herself or itself to have any just claim or demand whatever against the Crown”. The “Crown” is defined in s.59 of the Act to include the Crown in the right of New South Wales. 
     
      
    16 The plaintiff also relied upon Police Legislation Amendment (Civil Liability) Act 2003 and the Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act 1983 (the “Vicarious Liability Act”) which Act commenced on 28 October 1983. 
     
      
    17 The Commonwealth of Australia was sued in relation to the 1982 charges pursuant to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 (Cth). 
     
      
    18 The hearing of the proceedings commenced on 29 March 2006 and thereafter continued on a number of split hearing dates. Final oral submissions were made on 13 December 2007. 
     
      
       
      (a) The action for malicious prosecution  
       
      
    19 In order for the plaintiff to establish the tort of malicious prosecution, he has the onus of establishing that:- 
     
      
       
      (1) Actionable proceedings were instituted or continued by the Crown in the right of the State of New South Wales (referred to in this judgment as  
      “The State” 
      ) in respect of the 1980 prosecution and the Commonwealth and the individually named defendants in respect of the 1982 prosecution. 
       
       
      (2) The proceedings were terminated in his favour. 
       
       
      (3) The proceedings were initiated or continued without reasonable and probable cause. 
       
       
      (4) The respective defendants were motivated by malice. 
       
       
      (5) Special injury or damage was caused to the plaintiff. 
       
       
      The Laws of Australia 
       (Volume 33.8.1630) 
       
      
    20 The tort of malicious prosecution, it has been observed, involves and protects complex interests. The public interest is safeguarded in not permitting legal procedure to be used for improper motives and without reasonable cause. However, the public interest is also protected in allowing the judicial process to proceed in appropriate cases without fear of a malicious prosecution action: see The Laws of Australia, 33.8.1640. 
     
      
    21 The absence of reasonable and probable cause is a specific element of the cause of action in an action for malicious prosecution and is a central matter in these proceedings. It is not to be gauged by simply identifying weaknesses in the Crown case or by an analysis directed to establishing a reasonable doubt as to the plaintiff’s guilt of the charges upon which he was indicted. Accordingly, the exposure of inconsistencies or doubt, many years after a trial culminating in a guilty verdict, will not suffice nor will it in many circumstances assist a plaintiff in a malicious prosecution action. A plaintiff will need to go well beyond that. 
     
      
    22 In the present case, the factual matters concerning the 1980 occurred on one day– 15 January 1980 – whereas the investigation that led to the 1982 charges was more protracted and complex. The plaintiff’s case in relation to the 1980 charge is essentially based on his allegation that particular police officers conspired with one another to fabricate evidence against him by stopping him in his Mercedes vehicle, placing bags of heroin in the boot of his car and then claiming that the bags of heroin were being transported by him. They were found by Mr Ross during a search. 
     
      
    23 The plaintiff, additionally claims that the same thing happened a little later on the same day when Mr Gardiner, in Mr Ross’ presence, searched the boot of a Ford Landau which belonged to the plaintiff and which was positioned in a carport at his home in Leonay. He claimed that police placed bags of heroin into the well of the boot of that vehicle. 
     
      
    24 The facts associated with the 1980 charge will be analysed later in this judgment. 
     
      
    25 In relation to the 1982 charges, the issue of reasonable and probable cause is to be determined by materials that were available to the prosecutor at the time the plaintiff was indicted and during the period in which the proceedings were maintained.  
     
      
    26 In the submissions for the plaintiff, reference was made on more than one occasion to the contention that the case against the plaintiff in respect of the 1982 charges was no more than guilt by association. A fundamental question is whether, at the relevant times, the prosecutor, in fact, had available material that established an agreement between the plaintiff and others to supply heroin. 
     
      
    27 An agreement or combination to engage in a common enterprise to that end is the essence or nub of the offence: Ahern v Crown (1988) 165 CLR 87. 
     
      
    28 Criminal liability ensures once such an agreement is made and it is unnecessary for anything to be done to execute the agreement (Regina v Rogerson (1992) 174 CLR 268 per Brennan and Toohey JJ at 281) though conspiracy is often proved through inference from evidence of what was subsequently done. 
     
      
    29 The Crown relied upon circumstantial evidence to establish that the plaintiff had entered into such an agreement. In considering whether or not to prosecute him, it was essential that the prosecutor had admissible evidence to establish his involvement or association in the unlawful enterprise alleged in the indictment. 
     
      
    30 In the majority judgment in Ahern (supra), it was observed, at 93:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… Conspiracy is the agreement of two or more persons to do an unlawful act or to do an unlawful act by unlawful means and it is the fact of the agreement, or combination, to engage in a common enterprise which is the nub of the offence. This fact can seldom be proved by direct evidence of the making of an agreement and must, in almost all cases, be proved as a matter of inference from other facts, that is to say, by circumstantial evidence. For this purpose, evidence may be led which includes the acts or declarations of one alleged conspirator made outside the presence of the others provided such evidence is not led to prove against the others the truth of any assertion or implied assertion made by the actor or the maker of the statement. It may take the form of evidence of separate acts or utterances from which the fact of combination might be inferred. Led in that way, it is not hearsay …” 
        
       
      
    31 The Court in that case referred to the observations in Tripodi v Regina (1961) 104 CLR 1 at 6 wherein the High Court said that proof of the crime of conspiracy “may well consist in evidence of the separate acts of the individuals charged which, although separate acts, yet point to a common design and when considered in combination justify the conclusion that there must have been a combination such as that alleged in the indictment”. 
     
      
    32 In this case, the Crown’s contention was that the conspiracy involved a sophisticated joint enterprise involving 10 or more persons including persons by the name of Pak, Merle Thompson, Donald Thompson, Waddell, Smittant, Naktrakul, Wong and the plaintiff. For the purpose of investigation, police investigators employed physical and electronic surveillance in detecting the alleged activities and movements of the conspirators over a lengthy period of time especially in the period between 4 July 1982 to 19 July 1982. In the latter period, police investigators gathered materials involving the location, the activities and the communications between various of the participants on various dates which collectively suggested pre-concert or a joint enterprise between them. 
     
      
    33 The evidentiary materials available to the prosecutor before the plaintiff’s arrest on 19 July 1982 came from a number of sources. Evidence against two or more of the conspirators of separate activities that were close in time indicative of pre-concert was a basis from which a combination could be inferred. Such evidence would be admissible evidence against each alleged conspirator. In Ahern’s case, at 94, it was stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… it would be possible to reach the conclusion, admitting the evidence for the purpose described  
        [proving facts from which a combination might be inferred] 
         and considering it against each accused separately, not only that there was a conspiracy but also that each of the … accused was a participant.” 
        
       
      
    34 The High Court in Ahern (supra) cited dicta in Regina & Attorney General (Cth) v Associated Northern Collieries (1911) 14 CLR 387 wherein it was observed that both the fact of combination and the participation of the participant may be proved by the same evidence. In that case, the Court said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… though primarily each set of facts is attributable to the person whose acts they are, and to him alone, there may be such a concurrence of time, character, direction and result as naturally to lead to the inference that these separate acts were the outcome of pre-concert, or some mutual contemporaneous engagement, or that they were themselves the manifestations of mutual consent to carry out a common purpose, thus forming as well as evidencing a combination to effect the one object towards which the separate acts are found to converge.” 
         (at p.400) 
        
       
      
    35 The element of reasonable and probable cause in the tort of malicious prosecution is not a purely objective one. It is not a concept regardless of the knowledge or belief of the prosecutor that there was reasonable and probable cause for a charge to be laid but also involves the issue as to whether the prosecutor had reasonable and probable cause to do what he did: A v State of New South Wales (2007) 230 CLR 500 at 514. 
     
      
    36 The question as the High Court observed in that case “… involves both an objective and a subjective aspect”. 
     
      
    37 In establishing an absence of reasonable and probable cause, the High Court in A (supra) emphasised that the relevant circumstances of the particular case must be considered. These include:- 
     
      
       
      (1)  
      The nature of the allegations 
      . In the present case, the allegation in relation to the 1980 charge was that the evidence relied upon was fabricated by  
      “loading” 
       the plaintiff with bags of heroin. In relation to the 1982 charges, he alleged that evidence had been fabricated and particular evidence was falsified. 
       
       
      (2)  
      The known facts 
      . In relation to the 1980 charge, Mr Ross claimed that police had received information from a police informer of an intended supply of drugs by the plaintiff. In relation to the 1982 charges, police investigators claimed that the facts establish a liaison between the plaintiff and a Mr Donald Thompson as an integral part of a conspiracy formed for the purpose of supplying heroin. 
       
       
      (3)  
      Actual knowledge of the facts 
      . The extent to which the prosecutor was aware of relevant facts. The materials gathered by police were the relevant source of the prosecutor’s knowledge. 
       
       
      (4)  
      The particular Prosecutor 
      . 
        
       The prosecutor’s experience and capacity to form a sound judgment on the known facts are material to his or her capacity to assess the basis and viability of the Crown case. 
       
       
      (5)  
      An assessment of the case.  
      The relevant assessment required an opinion be formed as to the strength and reliability of the case based on known facts. 
       
       
      (6)  
      An honest belief 
      . The requirement is that the prosecutor formed an honest belief as to the Crown case against the plaintiff before charges were laid. The belief must be a reasonable one based upon identified materials. 
       
      
    38 The element of reasonable and probable cause is not established by the plaintiff only seeking to prove that he was innocent. In Abrath v The North Eastern Railway Company (1882-1883) 11 QBD 440 at 449 to 450 (cited by the High Court in A v State of New South Wales (supra) at 515, footnotes 30, 31 and 32) Brett MR stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In order to shew that there was an absence of reasonable and probable cause for instituting the prosecution for conspiracy, I cannot doubt that the plaintiff was bound to give some evidence of the circumstances under which the prosecution was instituted, and I wholly differ from the suggestion that it is sufficient for the plaintiff to shew that he was innocent of conspiracy, and that in the end there was no substantial ground for charging him with conspiracy. If the plaintiff merely proved that, and gave no evidence of the circumstances under which the prosecution was instituted, it seems that the plaintiff would fail; and a judge could not be asked, without some evidence of the circumstances under which the prosecution was instituted, to say that there was an absence of reasonable and probable cause. The evidence, which is to determine the question whether there was reasonable and probable cause, must consist of the existing facts or the circumstances under which the prosecution was instituted …” 
        
       
      
    39 The issue of reasonable and probable cause, accordingly, requires a court to examine evidence as to the facts and circumstances that were available to the prosecutor at the time or times the charges were laid and maintained and to determine whether reasonable care was exercised by the prosecutor informing himself or herself as to the true state of the circumstances as then known. 
     
      
    40 The plaintiff’s onus, in the present case, is to establish that the facts and circumstances established in evidence concerning each prosecution instituted in 1980 and in 1982 were inconsistent with the existence of reasonable and probable cause. 
     
      
    41 A prosecutor, in making an assessment for the purposes of making a sound judgment as to whether to charge an individual with a criminal offence, is entitled to have regard to all information held. This includes both information which constitutes admissible evidence in a criminal trial and other information which, though not admissible as evidence, may nonetheless have value in evaluating or assessing the reliability of evidence that is admissible: Thomas v State of New South Wales [2008] NSWCA 316 at [105] per Gyles AJA, with whom Hodgson and Campbell JJA expressed agreement on the point:- 
     
      
       
        
        “105 The material to be considered cannot be limited to that which is admissible in evidence. A reasonable basis for a decision by an investigating police officer to lay a charge is not to be equated with a magistrate’s decision as to committal for trial or a trial judge’s ruling on whether there is a case to go to the jury. The hypothetical reasonable prosecutor is not a judge or barrister specialising in criminal law. Neither is it necessary that the prosecutor be assured that all necessary witnesses will attend the hearing and give evidence in accordance with the information provided by them. The prosecutor may not be a public official. The decision to charge will often be taken promptly, if not immediately, in all kinds of circumstances. Investigations can be expected to continue where necessary, at least up to preparation of the brief of evidence for committal. That is not to suggest that these topics are not properly to be considered under this head. A practical assessment is required. Situations vary so much that it is not helpful to endeavour to lay down strict ground rules. (See Lister v Perryman (1870) LR 4 HL 521 per Lord Westbury at 538, Lord Colonsay at 540 and 542; Hicks v Faulkner (1878) 8 QBD 167 at 173-4; Birchmeier v Council of Municipality of Rockdale (1934) 51 WN (NSW) 201 at 202-3; Mitchell v John Heine & Son Ltd (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 466 at 469-471).” 
        
       
      
    42 It is a commonplace fact that “police intelligence” and circumstantial evidence are, in combination, utilised in the investigation stage to further investigations and may be examined in the pre-prosecution stage in the decision-making process leading to the laying of criminal charges. I will return below to the role of police intelligence in the assessment of admissible evidence in determining the reliability of evidence. 
     
      
    43 In Abrath (supra), Bowen LJ observed at 459:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… The question whether there was want of reasonable and probable cause depended upon the materials which were in the possession of the prosecution at the time it was instituted, and also on the further point whether those materials were carefully collected and considered. Now there might be two views of the materials which were in the possession of the prosecution. It may be said that the materials were evidently untrustworthy, or that they were obviously trustworthy, according as the one view or the other is taken of the facts. The burden of shewing carefulness in the inquiry would be shifted according to the view of the facts adopted. If the materials were admittedly untrustworthy, that would be a strong reason for throwing on the defendants the burden of shewing that they, nevertheless, had been misled, after all their care, into relying upon worthless materials. If the materials were obviously trustworthy, they would be enough prima facie to justify those who trusted to them …” 
        
       
      
    44 In the present case, the plaintiff, by virtue of the fact that the convictions against him were set aside, is to be treated as innocent of the charges. However, that, as observed by Brett MR in Abrath (supra), is insufficient to establish the case of malicious prosecution pursued in the present proceedings. Bowen LJ in Abrath (supra), in that respect, also observed at 462:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Something has been said about innocence being proof, prima facie, of want of reasonable and probable cause. I do not think it is. When  
        mere innocence 
         wears that aspect, it is because the fact of innocence  
        involves with it other circumstances 
         which shew that there was want of reasonable and probable cause; as, for example, when the prosecutor must know whether the story which he is telling against the man whom he is prosecuting, is false or true. In such a case, if the accused is innocent, it follows that the prosecutor must be telling a falsehood, and there must be want of reasonable and probable cause. Or if the circumstances proved are such that the prosecutor must know whether the accused is guilty or innocent, if he exercises reasonable care, it is only an identical proposition to infer that if the accused is innocent there must have been want of reasonable and probable care. Except in cases of that kind,  
        it never is true that mere innocence is proof of want of reasonable and probable cause 
        . It must be  
        innocence accompanied by such circumstances 
         as raise the presumption that  
        there was a want of reasonable and probable cause 
         …” 
         (emphasis added) 
        
       
       
      (b) The onus of proof on the plaintiff 
       
      
    45 The onus of proving each of the elements of the tort lies with the plaintiff. In that respect, given the serious nature of the allegations made by him as to fabrication of evidence the relevant principles concerning proof of serious impropriety apply. In Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 361 to 363 Dixon J observed that:- 
     
      
       
      • Reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. 
       
       
      • The seriousness of an allegations, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the Tribunal. 
       
       
      •  
      “Reasonable satisfaction” 
       should not be produced by inexact proofs, indefinite testimony, or indirect inferences. 
       
      
    46 In the submissions made on behalf of the State, reliance was placed upon the observations of the High Court in Neat Holdings Pty Limited v Karajan Holdings (1992) 67 ALJR 170 to the effect that the strength of the evidence necessary to establish a fact or facts on the balance of probabilities may vary according to the nature of what is sought to be proved. In particular, “cogent or strict proof” was said to be necessary when so serious a matter as fraud is to be found and that a judicial approach requires that a court should not likely make a finding that, on the balance of probabilities, a party to civil litigation has been guilty of engaging in fraudulent or criminal conduct. 
     
      
    47 In Re H & Ors (Minors) [1996] AC 563, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead at 586 adverted to the fact that the inherent probability or improbability of an event is itself a matter to be taken into account when weighing the probabilities and in deciding whether, on balance, the event occurred. The more probable the event, the stronger must be the evidence that it did not occur before, on the balance of probability, its occurrence will be established. 
     
      
       
      (c) Landini’s background and reputation 
       
      
    48 The plaintiff’s evidence in chief was that he left school at the age of 14 and three months. He was then in third year of high school. He said that after leaving school he worked as a storeman for approximately a year. He ran away from home as he said he did not have a good relationship with his step-father and went to Western Australia. He was charged there with fare evasion and at some point returned to New South Wales where he said he was in the “Boys’ House”. He was placed there, he said, by reason of “assault and rob and break and enter” matters. He said that his first sentence was served at the age of 15 in the “Boys’ Home”. He agreed he had served the majority of time in custody up until about 1976. 
     
      
    49 He said that in 1966, he served a three year term of imprisonment. The offence for which he was sentenced did not involve prohibited drugs. At some later time in 1966, he was arrested on a break and enter charge and, on 27 May 1966, he was sentenced by the Sydney Court of Petty Sessions at Darlinghurst to an 18 month term of imprisonment. He was released in November 1968. 
     
      
    50 Following release, he worked at the Centennial Hotel, Paddington but then spent time in custody apparently in respect of a malicious wounding charge in respect of which he obtained an acquittal. 
     
      
    51 He said that he worked as a waiter at the Centennial Hotel for approximately 18 months. He subsequently served a further term of imprisonment in about 1969 or 1970. He received a term of imprisonment of two years with a non-parole period of one year and three months in respect of a conviction for malicious wounding. 
     
      
    52 On 9 April 1971, he was convicted at Central Court of Petty Sessions on a charge of receiving possession of a firearm and was sentenced to six months hard labour. 
     
      
    53 On 23 April 1971 at the Waverley Court of Petty Sessions, he was convicted of consorting and having goods suspected of being stolen in his custody. He said he served a term of imprisonment in respect of that matter. 
     
      
    54 His criminal history otherwise included the following:- 
     
      
       
      (1) A charge of stealing at the Cronulla Children’s Court. 
       
       
      (2) In April 1961 he was committed to an institution for break, enter and steal and assault and robbery. 
       
       
      (3) In 1962 he served a six months sentence of imprisonment for larceny of petrol and illegal use of a motor vehicle. 
       
       
      (4) In 1963, he was charged with an offence of stealing and on 28 April 1963 in Brisbane he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years for breaking and entering a dwelling with intent and receiving stolen property. 
       
       
      (5) In August 1964, he was charged with an offence of stealing and goods in custody. 
       
       
      (6) In 1964, he was dealt with for an offence of living on the earnings of prostitution. 
       
       
      (7) In 1965, he was dealt with on a charge of receiving stolen property. 
       
       
      (8) In May 1966, he was sentenced to 18 months’ hard labour cumulative on two charges of breaking and entering and stealing. 
       
       
      (9) In May 1966, he was charged with receiving stolen goods. 
       
       
      (10) In November 1968, he was charged with malicious wounding. 
       
      
    55 The plaintiff gave evidence that on 20 June 1972 he was convicted at the St Kilda Magistrates’ Court, Victoria in respect of a charge of possession of the drug LSD and a second charge of possession of Indian hemp. He was sentenced in his absence. 
     
      
    56 On 15 December 1972 at the Central Court of Petty Sessions, he pleaded guilty to being in possession of Indian hemp for which he received a sentence of 10 days’ hard labour. 
     
      
    57 On 4 May 1978, he was convicted in the Kogarah Court of Petty Sessions of being in possession of Indian hemp and fined $200. 
     
      
    58 The plaintiff gave evidence that, prior to 1980, he had never been charged with supplying or being in possession of heroin. He said that in the year 2001 he pleaded guilty to being in possession of cocaine for which he received a suspended sentence. 
     
      
    59 The plaintiff accepted that from 1960, he was convicted in respect of a number of “crimes of dishonesty”. 
     
      
    60 In cross-examination in relation to his past history of dishonesty, Ms Katzmann, on behalf of the Commonwealth, put to him:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You are prepared to lie in order to obtain a benefit for yourself, aren’t you? 
         
        A. I have. I have. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You have on many occasions, haven’t you? 
         
        A. I said I have, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And on many occasions? 
         
        A. On a number of occasions. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Most of your life, haven’t you? 
         
        A. Some of it, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Most of it, I suggest to you? 
         
        A. Well, some of it, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        …” 
        
       
      
    61 It was put to him that at his trial in 1983 he had told the Court that he resided at 48 Parklands Avenue, Penrith with his wife and his three year old son but that he said in the present proceedings the evidence in that respect was false but that there was “… a reason for that”. 
     
      
    62 It was then put to him by Ms Katzmann:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You don’t have any problems then about telling lies in court, do you? 
         
        A. Neither do many others. 
        
       
       
        
        …” 
        
       
      
    63 In later cross-examination, the plaintiff said that he had at different times used a number of different names. Exhibit 9 includes as alias names, Reeves, Charles Medina, Moore, Lando and Little. He accepted that he could have used the names “Danny Reeves”, “Michael Charles Madina” and “Daniel Moore”. When asked why he had called himself by different names, he responded “Well, I, I don’t remember”. He accepted that on 27 February 1982, he represented to police that his name was “Daniel Lando”:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You represented that your name was Daniel Lando on that occasion because you, yourself, didn’t have a driver’s license, did you? 
         
        A. That’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It was a matter of complete indifference to you, wasn’t it, whether you drove a car lawfully or unlawfully? 
         
        A. I have to answer that as yes.” 
        
       
      
    64 The plaintiff rejected the suggestion that whether he complied with the law was a matter of complete indifference to him. He acknowledged the warrant of commitment upon a conviction or order for a penalty recorded against “Daniel Lando” driving with a high PCA at Yalla on 27 February 1982 and agreed that it, in fact referred to a conviction against him. The address on the document 2/16 Duntroon Street, Hurlstone Park, which he acknowledged was Judy Waddell’s address. Ms Waddell was indicted in 1982 with him in relation to the 1982 charges. He acknowledged that he gave “a false license” under that name. 
     
      
    65 It was put to him by Ms Katzmann in cross-examination that he used different names to avoid arrest:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. I put it to you that the purpose of your different names was in order to avoid lawful arrest; you would agree with that, wouldn’t you? 
         
        A. Well, I don’t know what for. I know that those names had been there on me record for years. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But the purpose of you describing or calling yourself different names was in order to avoid lawful arrest, wasn’t it? 
         
        A. I don’t agree with that.” 
        
       
      
    66 A little later it was put to him:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I asked you yesterday whether at one stage you called yourself Peter Krysyna; do you remember? 
         
        A. Yes, I do. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I can’t now recall what your answer was. What do you say about that? 
         
        A. I can remember an incident going back to about 1988 when I just moved down the South Coast where I was stopped by a police officer … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. … Did you come before the Narooma Local Court on or about 17 September 1988? 
         
        A. Yes, I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You came before the court on that occasion because you were up on a charge of fraudulently using a license, weren’t you? 
         
        A. That was the charge, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The circumstances in which you came before the court were that you produced a license to a policeman which was a license in the name of Peter Krysyna, pretending that it was your license, didn’t you? 
         
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    67 The plaintiff accepted in cross-examination that he had spent an amount of time during his career in gaol for a variety of offences including offences involving violence and dishonesty. 
     
      
    68 In respect of trading in drugs, it was put to him by Ms Katzmann in cross-examination:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. No, we’re obviously at cross-purposes, Mr Landini. You admit to selling cocaine in a period of time at least up until your arrest in January 1998, don’t you? 
         
        A. Yes, for about four months prior, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you accept that at least for that period of time you could be described as a seller of hard drugs? 
         
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    69 The plaintiff, over the years, continued to maintain his association with persons with criminal backgrounds as acknowledged in the Plaintiff’s Submissions (p.22). 
     
      
    70 Ms Katzmann specifically referred to the evidence that established:- 
     
      
       
      • The plaintiff’s use of aliases over the years. 
       
       
      • The likelihood, on the evidence, that he misled a finance company to secure finance for the Leonay property. 
       
       
      • Misleading information given to his solicitor, Mr Meakin, and to the Parole Board in order to secure parole. 
       
       
      • False evidence given to the jury at his trial as to his place of residence. 
       
       
      • The incorrect evidence as to having lodged tax returns for the period 1976 to 1980 and subsequent admissions that he would not have done so (on the premise that he did, in fact, work as claimed). 
       
       
      • The possession of a false driver’s license. 
       
      
    71 Ms Katzmann submitted that, the plaintiff having lied in order to obtain a benefit for himself in the past, there is no good reason as to why he would not do so in the present proceedings when he stands to gain a considerable financial benefit in doing so. The plaintiff’s past dishonesty must be taken into account in assessing his credibility. However, the assessment fundamentally turns upon an analysis of all the evidence called in the plaintiff’s case and that called by the defendants. 
     
      
       
      (2) THE 1980 CHARGE  
       
      
    72 The plaintiff’s case is premised upon the vicarious liability of the State of New South Wales at common law in respect of the alleged actions by certain police officers on 15 January 1980 in fabricating evidence. In particular, the contention is that the State is liable for actions taken before and after 28 October 1983 (on which date the Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act 1983 came into operation). After that date, the plaintiff alleges that the prosecution of the 1980 charge proceeded upon the basis of fabricated evidence. He contended the pursuit of the charge up to the date upon which he was sentenced involved maintaining the prosecution on a false basis. 
     
      
    73 I will deal, firstly, with the basis relied upon to establish vicarious liability in the Crown in the right of the State of New South Wales in respect of the alleged actions of the relevant police officers prior to the institution of proceedings and subsequently in maintaining them. 
     
      
       
      (a) Questions as to the vicarious liability of the Crown in respect of the actions of police officers before 28 October 1983 
       
      
    74 The Crown at common law enjoyed an immunity in respect of the exercise of the independent discretion of a constable of police officer in the exercise of powers incidental to his or her office. The relevant principle underpinning this position was that, if the law charges a public officer with a discretion and a responsibility in the execution of an independent legal duty, that public officer is solely responsible for tortious acts which may be committed in the course of the office. The government or body, which he or she serves or which appointed the officer, incurs no vicarious liability for such acts: The Laws of Australia, 33.6.610. This doctrine was enunciated by the High Court in Enever v The King (1906) 3 CLR 969. 
     
      
    75 The relevant police officers in respect of the 1980 charge were constables appointed under s.6 of the Police Regulation Act 1899. Section 6 of that Act provided as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “6(1) The Commissioner may, subject to disallowance by the Governor, appoint so many sergeants and constables of police, of such grades as are specified by rules made under this Act, as he deems necessary for the preservation of the peace throughout New South Wales. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Such constables shall, unless and until their appointments respectively are disallowed by the Governor, have all such powers, privileges, and advantages and be liable to all such duties and responsibility as any constable duly appointed now has or hereafter may have either by the common law or by virtue of any statute now or hereafter in force in New South Wales.” 
        
       
      
    76 The State relied upon the principle in Enever (supra) in support of its contention that it was not vicariously liable at common law. 
     
      
    77 In Enever (supra), the appellant was wrongfully arrested in a public street in Hobart by a police constable purporting to act in discharge of his duty and detained by him upon a false charge that he had committed a breach of the peace. 
     
      
    78 The appellant brought an action against the Government of Tasmania and a jury returned a verdict in his favour. 
     
      
    79 In determining whether or not the Government was responsible for the police officer’s wrongful act in arresting a person without a warrant pursuant to the Police Act 1865, it was necessary for the Court to consider the nature of the office of a constable and what, according to the law of Tasmania, was the nature of the relationship between a constable and the Executive Government by whom he was appointed. 
     
      
    80 In his judgment in Enever, Griffith CJ observed that at common law the office of constable or peace officer was regarded as a public office and the holder of it as being, in some sense, a servant of the Crown. The Chief Justice held that the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Tasmania, had been correct in holding that the constable, in effecting the arrest, was not acting as an officer, agent or servant of the Government of Tasmania, so as to make the Crown responsible for his act. 
     
      
    81 The analysis that led to this conclusion was based, firstly, upon the nature of the office and, secondly, on the relationship between the Government and the police officer. At common law, constables had large powers that were necessarily incidental to the discharge of their functions as peace officers or conservators of the peace, amongst which the most important was the authority to arrest on suspicion of felony. Griffith CJ observed (at 976), that it was settled law that, although a peace officer was himself responsible for unjustifiable acts done by him in the intended exercise of his lawful authority, no responsibility for such acts attached to those by whom he was appointed. 
     
      
    82 As to the second aspect, Griffith CJ considered the general doctrine of the law of agency applied in the case of a constable. That was said to lead to the same conclusion as the first of the two bases for his analysis. The Chief Justice observed that the powers of a constable, qua peace officer, whether conferred by common law or statute, are exercised by him by virtue of his office, and cannot be exercised on the responsibility of any person but himself. If he arrests on suspicion of felony, the Chief Justice stated, the suspicion must be his suspicion, and must be one that is reasonable to him. 
     
      
    83 Accordingly, Griffith CJ concluded that a constable, when acting as a peace officer, is not exercising a delegated authority. His authority is an original one, and the general law of agency has no application. 
     
      
    84 In the same case, Barton J (at 982), dealt with the argument that the appellant police officer was, on the occasion in question, acting as the servant of the Government in such a sense that the maxim respondeat superior applies. His Honour rejected the proposition and dealt with the question as to the responsibility residing in a superior based upon that maxim. His Honour stated that for it to apply, it was plain that the person to whose act it is sought to attach responsibility to the superior “… must have been under the control of that superior at the time of the doing of the act … It appears to me that in order to establish that position, it must be shown that the control, if any, under which the person acted was that of the Executive Government of the State. The difficulty of sustaining that position was obvious …” (at p.982). 
     
      
    85 The question of “control” was raised in the submissions for the plaintiff in the present case, in that it was argued that “… from the hierarchical structure of the NSW Police Force, that junior officers were, in preparing statements of evidence in preparing the matter for hearing, were under the direction and control of superior officers. The superior officers were Knox and Ross, with Knox being the superior officer. The planting of the evidence, the planning of the operation, the arrest, the charging, the preparation of witness statements and the prosecution was all done under the direction and control of the superior officers, Knox and Ross, but particularly Knox …” (p.19). 
     
      
    86 It was submitted on behalf of the State that it had no control, power or authority over the police officers in question in these proceedings for any of the acts that they were alleged to have carried out such as to give rise to vicarious liability. 
     
      
    87 It was also submitted on behalf of the State that the fundamental proposition as expressed by Lee J in Griffiths v Haines [1984] 3 NSWLR 653 was that a constable of police performed a public duty and exercised an original authority which was not subject to the control of the Government. It was observed in submissions that that independent authority came from the common law and from s.352(1) and (2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (relating to the power to apprehend without a warrant in circumstances referred to in each sub-section). 
     
      
    88 The State also relied upon dicta of the High Court in New South Wales v Ibbett (2006) 229 CLR 638 in which (at paragraph [4]) reference was made to Enevers case and Griffiths v Haines (supra) and wherein it was stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In former times, the circumstance that police officers often acted in the exercise of common law or statutory powers and according to ‘independent’ discretions would have taken an action such as that of [the appellant] outside the scope of the vicarious liability of the Crown.” 
        
       
      
    89 It was, accordingly, argued on behalf of the State that, for there to be vicarious liability, the State must be “the master exercising control over the police officer and not the ‘superiors of the police officers’ (Plaintiff’s Submissions of 25 June 2007, pp.19 and 20) …” (First Defendant’s Outline of Submissions, paragraph [61]). 
     
      
    90 I accept the State’s submission on his aspect. The control as alleged by the plaintiff by Messrs Knox and Ross is not, in my opinion, control of a kind that, at common law, would make the State liable under the maxim respondeat superior. For that principle to apply the control under which the police officer or officers acted must be that of the Executive Government of the State. There is, of course, no suggestion of such control in the present case. 
     
      
    91 In the final submissions for the plaintiff, it was accepted that, where a police officer exercises an independent discretion, the State is not vicariously liable for the wrongful exercise of that discretion (p.19). However, reliance was placed upon what were said to be the observations of Yeldham J in Oriental Foods (Wholesalers) Co Pty Limited v Commonwealth (1983) 50 ALR 452. 
     
      
    92 However, the passage relied upon by the plaintiff in Oriental Foods (supra) was, in fact, an extract from the text, Liability of the Crown (1971) by Professor Hogg at p.104 to 106 which text was quoted by Yeldham J in his Honour’s judgment. 
     
      
    93 Oriental Foods (supra) involved an application for summary disposal of the plaintiff’s claim against the Commonwealth of Australia for damage to and loss of food stuffs imported into Australia. Certain goods were opened and examined by Customs officials under the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). It was held that there was no question of the exercise of an independent authority but rather the performance of a purely ministerial and somewhat menial task and this did not involve “special duties’ and discretions of the type considered by the High Court in Baume v Commonwealth (1906) 4 CLR 97. I do not consider that Oriental Foods (supra) is of any assistance to the plaintiff’s case on the question of vicarious liability of the Crown at common law. 
     
      
    94 On the facts of the present case, even if it be assumed for the purpose of analysis that there were acts by police officers by way of fabricating evidence and otherwise acting improperly in relation to the arrest and charging of the plaintiff at the direction of superior officers, those superior officers, like other officers were themselves subordinate officers, albeit of a higher rank. As I have earlier noted, there is no evidence that any such acts were performed under or by reason of any form of control exercised by the Executive Government. 
     
      
    95 In Attorney General for NSW v Perpetual Trustee Co Limited (1951-1952) 85 CLR 237 (a case involving injury to a member of the Police Force of New South Wales sustained in a road accident, in which it was alleged that the Crown was thereby deprived of his services by reason of his disability), Dixon J observed at 252 that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… in most respects, a member of the Police Force is subject to the direction and control which is characteristic of the relation of master and servant. It does not matter that there is a chain of command. That is necessary in some degree in all organisations military and civil, public and private. It is only when, in the course of his duties as a servant of the Crown, he is confronted with the situation involving the liberty or rights of the subject, that the law places upon him a personal responsibility of judgment and action.” 
        
       
      
    96 The alleged actions of the police officers in fabricating evidence leading to the plaintiff’s arrest, would involve the liberty or rights of the subject. The power of arrest and charging the plaintiff with a criminal offence in such a case would involve the personal responsibility of judgment and action of the individual officers responsible for the exercise of such powers. 
     
      
    97 Professor Hogg, in his text quoted by Yeldham J in Oriental Foods (supra), footnoted (footnote 45) a number of cases concerning with the commission of torts by policemen performing general police duties under the direction and control of superiors. That footnote cites a South African article entitled The Vicarious Liability of the State for the Delicts of the Police (1967) 84 SALJ 25 by J L R Milton. The learned author of the article considered the question of control exercised by the State over police officers. Two types of “control” are identified. The first is the control which a master exercises over his servant. The legislature may lay down circumstances in which police officers may be said not to be acting as servants. The other source lay in State control of police by virtue of the fact that they are members of the relevant police force. The South African Police Acts of 1958 and the Regulations thereunder were said to create an obligation in a member to obey all lawful orders given by superiors in the Police Force. The learned author continued quoting from a South African case, Union Government (Minister of Justice) v Van der Vlies [1931] OPD 79 at 85 to 86 in which it was stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Here is a servant who is acting under a legal duty of such a nature as to deprive the Crown of the power to direct or control the carrying out of the duty, but, in spite of that, the Crown intervenes by means of a direct order to the servant (who is still a servant in the Crown’s employ even though acting under a legal duty) … now it seems to me,  
        if the Crown intervenes and … issues a direct order to the servant and if the servant then acts under that order 
        , in obedience to that order,  
        and not in obedience to his legal duty 
        , then the Crown becomes liable under the ordinary principles of the law of master and servant.”  
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    98 That analysis, in my opinion, emphasised the distinction between “control” of the Executive Government and “control” as exercised by superior officers over subordinate officers in the performance of police functions. 
     
      
    99 Although, as earlier noted, the written submissions for the plaintiff relied upon the abovementioned passage which has been attributed to Yeldham J (but, as I have said, was in fact an extract from Professor Hogg’s text) an examination of the authorities referred to by Professor Hogg does not support the proposition contended for the plaintiff in this case, namely, that, at common law, if superior police officers at an intermediate level in the hierarchy, direct or involve other officers in unlawful activity or misconduct in the arrest and charging of a citizen, that that thereby constitutes an exception to the principle enunciated by the High Court in Enever’s case. 
     
      
    100 It is clear from the authorities to which Professor Hogg refers that an exception to the Enever principle at common law may arise where there is a lawful order issued by the Crown requiring police officers to act in obedience to the direction or order given. However, as I have stated above, that is not the case here. 
     
      
    101 In Griffiths v Haines (supra), Lee J similarly observed that, in terms of vicarious liability, “control” referred to control by the Government as distinct from any control exercised by subordinate officers. See also, in this respect, the observations of O’Connor J in Enever (supra) at 993 to 994 wherein his Honour referred to the arrest made by a police officer in the discharge of his duties as a holder of the officer of constable and “… not by the direction or under the control of the Government”. 
     
      
    102 As earlier indicated, the submissions for the plaintiff, with respect, incorrectly proceeded upon the basis that, for the purposes of applying the abovementioned common law exception, those alleged to have fabricated incriminating evidence was acting under the orders of “superior officers”, namely, Messrs Knox and Ross. Even if it could be said those two officers, who were higher in the police hierarchy, gave such “orders” it could not be said, for the purposes of the common law, that they did so as agents of the Government or State of New South Wales. 
     
      
    103 Finally, as to the submission made on behalf of the plaintiff in the Plaintiff’s submissions in reply, paragraph 5, to the effect that the State “through the Attorney-General, could have no billed the prosecution at any time” any action taken in that respect by the Attorney-General could not provide a basis for retrospectively converting the earlier alleged actions of the police officers involved in the plaintiff’s arrest and prosecution into actions for which the State can then be said to be vicariously liable. Any failure to exercise the power to no bill, in my opinion, could not, in law, create a basis for such vicarious liability. A failure to exercise the power to no bill a prosecution could not, in other words, impose either a direct or an indirect liability in the State. 
     
      
    104 Accordingly, I am of the opinion that prior to the Vicarious Liability Act, there could not arise at common law in the State of New South Wales liability in respect of the alleged fabrication of evidence leading to the plaintiff’s arrest on 15 January 1980. 
     
      
       
      (b) The Vicarious Liability Act – operative 28 October 1983 
       
      
    105 The State’s fundamental contention was that it cannot be vicariously liable after the Vicarious Liability Act came into operation on 28 October 1983 in respect of the alleged manufacture of evidence against the plaintiff. It conceded that each of the relevant officers were constables appointed under s.6 of the Police Regulation Act 1899 and that officers Michael Leary, Trevor Haken, Glen Ross, Stephen Chidgey and Michael Gardiner were Detective Senior Constables. Mr Les Knox and Mr Ray Donaldson (the latter in respect of the 1982 charges) were Detective Sergeants, Third Class (Exhibits W and AD). 
     
      
    106 The Vicarious Liability Act was assented to on 22 April 1983. 
     
      
    107 Section 2 provides that ss.1 and 2 commence on the date of the assent to the Act. 
     
      
    108 Section 2(2) provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Except as provided by sub-section (1), this Act shall commence on such day as may be appointed by the Governor in respect thereof and as may be notified by proclamation published in the Gazette.” 
        
       
      
    109 Section 3 importantly provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “This Act does not apply to or in respect of a tort committed by a person or arising out of a wrongful act or omission occurring before the day appointed and notified under s.2(2).” 
        
       
      
    110 The date appointed under s.2(2) was 28 October 1983. 
     
      
    111 Section 6 provides that, for the purposes of the Act, a member of the Police Service shall be deemed to be a person in the service of the Crown and not a servant of the Crown. 
     
      
    112 Section 7, Vicarious liability of masters, provides that, notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a master is vicariously liable in respect of a tort committed by his servant in the performance or purported performance by the servant of an independent function whether performance or purported performance of the function:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) is in the course of his service for his master or is an incident of his service (whether or not it was a term of his contract of service that he perform the function); or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Is directed to or is incidental to the carrying on of any business, enterprise, undertaking or activity of his master.” 
        
       
      
    113 Section 8, Further vicarious liability of the Crown, provides as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the Crown is vicariously liable in respect of the tort committed by a person in the service of the Crown in the performance or purported performance by the person of a function (including an independent function) where the performance or purported performance of the function:-  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) is in the course of the person’s service with the Crown or is an incident of the person’s service (whether or not it was a term of the person’s appointment to the service of the Crown that the person perform the function), or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) is directed to or is incidental to the carrying on of any business, enterprise, undertaking or activity of the Crown. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to or in respect of a tort committed by a person in the conduct of any business, enterprise, undertaking or activity which is:-  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) carried on by the person on the person’s own account, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) carried on by any partnership, of which the person is a member, on account of the partnership.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    114 The State has pleaded, in its defence, not only that vicarious liability cannot arise at common law but also that there were no active steps by way of prosecution that occurred after 28 October 1983 that could make it vicariously liable under the Vicarious Liability Act. 
     
      
    115 In the State’s Outline of Submissions, reference is made to the written submissions for the plaintiff which contended that there was “uncontroverted evidence that various of the first charge officers attended court proceedings after the introduction of the Vicarious Liability Act and as such they took ‘active steps’ in relation to the prosecution of the plaintiff after 28 October 1983”. 
     
      
    116 In the defendant’s Outline of Submissions, it is recorded:- 
     
      
       
        
        “71. It is respectfully submitted that evidence of merely ‘attending court’ after 28 October 1983 could not satisfy this Court to the requisite standard that there was any active step of prosecution by any one of the police officers post 28 October 1983. 
        
       
       
        
        72. It appears from the record of 31 October 1983, that it was a date set for the trial of the plaintiff. There is no evidence to suggest that Mr Knox was present to ‘instruct’ the Crown Prosecutor. At the highest, on that date, he was to give evidence, but never did so. Accordingly, there was no actual prosecution by Mr Knox on that day. 
        
       
       
        
        73. Again on 19 March 1984 there is a reference to ‘all police present’ but there is no evidence to suggest that any of the police officers ‘instructed’ the Crown Prosecutor on that day as is alleged. Again, the plaintiff had been remanded for trial on that day and, if anything, any police officers who were present were there to give evidence, but this never occurred. Accordingly, there was no act of prosecution by them on that day. 
        
       
       
        
        74. There is also a record of 19 March 1984 that facts and antecedents were tendered. There is no evidence to suggest that the ‘facts’ tendered was a ‘fact sheet’ prepared by Mr Knox and was tendered in his presence. 
        
       
       
        
        …” 
          
        
       
      
    117 In the fifth amended statement of claim, the plaintiff alleges that after 28 October 1983, the relevant police officers “failed to inform the police prosecutor or anyone else in a position to cause the prosecution of the plaintiff to be terminated” that statements made by them contained false evidence or otherwise failed to cause the termination of the prosecution. 
     
      
    118 In the State’s Outline of Submissions, reliance was placed upon dicta of Harvey ACJ in Daniels v Telfer (1934) 39 SR (NSW) 99 in answer to the plaintiff’s case “… that the police officer should have ‘come clean’” (see paragraph 52 of the Plaintiff’s Submissions of 27 July 2007 and paragraph 75 of the State’s Outline Submissions). 
     
      
    119 I will return to consider Daniels (supra). 
     
      
    120 It was submitted for the State that, in the present case, “inactivity” by the State after 28 October 1983 was insufficient to support a claim for malicious prosecution.  
     
      
    121 Mr Maconachie submitted for the State that the only inference that could be drawn from relevant court notations on the court file (Exhibit W) commencing 23 February 1983 was that whilst police had attended on various listings of the matter, the only conclusion available was that they had attended merely for the purpose of giving evidence at the trial (first defendant’s outline of submissions, paragraph 77). 
     
      
    122 When the matter was listed for trial on 19 March 1984, the Crown Prosecutor was noted as appearing on the record and “all police present”. A plea of guilty was then entered. The circumstances which are said to have given rise to the guilty plea are referred to below. There then followed the tender of facts and antecedents by the Crown. The police officers, it was contended for the State, were there only in the capacity of witnesses for the purpose of giving evidence if required. Issue was taken with the submission for the plaintiff that the relevant police officers were present to assist the prosecutor in the performance of his function. It was contended that the evidence of Mr Ross - that he had secured the presence of a member of the arrest team on “each adjournment” in order to assist the prosecutor - was evidence related merely to the position in the lead up to the committal proceedings and that these listings took place well prior to 28 October 1983. There was no evidence given in the present proceedings by Mr Ross, it was contended, which related to the position after that date. 
     
      
    123 Exhibit W comprises the documents relating to the prosecution in the then Court of Petty Sessions. The documents within that exhibit confirm the following matters:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The apprehending officers were Detective Sergeants Ross, Knox and Chidgey from the Drug Squad. 
       
       
      (2) That the plaintiff was charged on 16 January 1980 with supplying a prohibited drug, namely, heroin  
      “… in that he did have in his possession a quantity of such prohibited drug in excess of the quantity prescribed in respect of that drug” 
      . 
       
       
      (3) On 20 August 1980, the proceedings were listed before the Court on which occasion Mr Conomos of counsel appeared for the plaintiff. The proceedings were adjourned by consent, bail to continue. 
       
       
      (4) The proceedings were again listed on 2 April 1981 when a committal hearing commenced. 
       
       
      (5) On 3 April 1981, the plaintiff was committed to the Sydney District Court for trial on which occasion bail was continued. 
       
       
      (6) On 6 January 1983, the Secretary of Justice advised the solicitors for the plaintiff, Messrs Colin W Love & Co, that the Attorney General had directed that the case against the plaintiff was to proceed to trial. 
       
       
      (7) The proceedings in the District Court were listed for mention on a number of dates in 1983 and 1984 as follows:- 
       
       
        
        (a) 28 February 1983: proceedings stood over to 25 July 1983. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) 25 July 1983: on an application by the defence stood over by consent to 5 August 1983 (noted Supreme Court drug conspiracy trial to commence on 5 September 1983). 
        
       
       
        
        (c) 5 August 1983: proceedings fixed for trial on 31 October 1983. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) 14 October 1983: application to vacate trial date by accused. The application was refused and the trial date confirmed. 
        
       
       
        
        (e) 31 October 1983: the hearing was vacated. A note  
        “possibly plea?” 
        . Remanded for trial on 19 March 1984. Detective Knox was present. 
        
       
       
        
        (f) 19 March 1984: plea of guilty entered. Facts and antecedents tendered. Noted that  
        “all police present” 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        (g) 29 March 1984: stood over. 
        
       
       
        
        (h) 7 June 1984: sentence – a term of imprisonment of 15 years to date from 19 July 1984 concurrent with existing sentence. Non-parole period to expire on 18 July 1988. Noted Detective Sergeant Knox present. 
        
       
      
    124 It was contended for the plaintiff that there was evidence that the relevant police officers, including in particular Mr Ross, had attended court proceedings after the Vicarious Liability Act had come into operation on 31 October 1983 and, that by attending court, they had taken “active steps” in relation to the prosecution of the plaintiff after that date. 
     
      
    125 It was submitted for the State, as earlier noted, that the evidence of “attending court” could not constitute the taking of an active step by way of prosecution by any one of the police officers after 28 October 1983. 
     
      
    126 For reasons set out in paragraphs [71] to [74] inclusive of the Outline of Submissions for the State (extracted in paragraph [116] above), it was contended that there was no act by way of prosecution by the relevant police officers after 28 October 1983.  
     
      
       
      (c) Interpretation and application of the Act 
       
      
    127 In s.5(1) of the Vicarious Liability Act, Definitions, the following expressions are defined:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Independent function 
        , in relation to a servant or a person in the service of the Crown, means a function conferred or imposed upon the servant or person, whether or not as the holder of an office, by the common law or statute independently of the will of the servant’s master or the Crown, as the case may require. 
        
       
       
        
        Office  
        includes the office of special constable within the meaning of Part 4 of the Police Offences Act 1901. 
        
       
       
        
        Police tort claim 
         – see s.9B(1).” 
        
       
      
    128 Section 5(2) provides that a reference in the Vicarious Liability Act to “a function” includes reference to a power, authority and duty and the “performance of a function” includes a reference to the exercise of the function and the failure to perform or exercise the function. 
     
      
    129 Section 6, as earlier noted, provides that, for the purposes of the Vicarious Liability Act, a police officer shall be deemed to be a person in the service of the Crown and not a servant of the Crown. 
     
      
    130 Part 2 of the Vicarious Liability Act entitled Vicarious Liability of Masters for independent functions contains s.7 which is set out in paragraph [112]. 
     
      
    131 In Part 3 of the Vicarious Liability Act entitled Vicarious liability of Crown for persons in its service, the Crown is made vicariously liable in respect of a tort committed by a person in the service of the Crown in the performance or purported performance by the person of a function (including an independent function) where the performance or purported performance of the function falls within the provisions of s.8(1)(a) or (b). 
     
      
    132 In Part 4 of the Vicarious Liability Act entitled Legal proceedings for damages for torts by police officers, s.9B provides as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “9B(1)  
        A police tort claim is a claim for damages for a tort allegedly committed by a police officer (the  
        police officer concerned 
        ) in the performance or purported performance of the officers’ functions (including an independent function) as a police officer, whether or not committed jointly or severally with any other person. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Except as provided by this Part, a person may not in any legal proceedings make a police tort claim against the police officer concerned, but may instead make the claim against the Crown. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) A person who makes a police tort claim against the Crown in any legal proceedings may join the police officer concerned as a party to the proceedings only if the Crown denies that it would be vicariously liable for the alleged tort if it were established that the police officer concerned had committed the tort. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) …” 
        
       
      
    133 I have earlier set out the provisions of s.3 (paragraph [109], which states that the Vicarious Liability Act does not apply “to or in respect of a tort committed … or arising out of a wrongful act or omission occurring before the day appointed and notified …”. 
     
      
    134 It was contended for the plaintiff that, in attending court, the police officers who participated in the plaintiff’s arrest on 15 January 1980 assisted the Prosecutor and that their attendance was part of the performance or purported performance of a police officer’s function (written submissions, p.20).  
     
      
    135 Mr Steirn, for the plaintiff, specifically relied in this respect upon submissions made on behalf of the plaintiff in support of the application to amend the statement of claim and upon final written and oral submissions made in the substantive proceedings concerning the application and operation of the Vicarious Liability Act. 
     
      
    136 In paragraph 38 of the last-mentioned submissions, it was contended, in relation to both the first and second charges, that the Crown was vicariously liable for the commission of a tort committed by a “… large number (of) police officers, and not in the exercise of an independent discretion whilst arresting somebody, but while performing general police duties under the direction and control of superiors in the action of planting false evidence upon the plaintiff, manufacturing cases against the plaintiff and then prosecuting the plaintiff …” (p.18). 
     
      
    137 Insofar as the plaintiff relied upon the Vicarious Liability Act as supporting the action against the State, reliance was also placed upon what was said to be a failure by police officers after 28 October 1983 or an omission “… to inform the police prosecutor or anyone else in a position to cause the prosecution of the plaintiff to be terminated”. This referred to a failure to advise the police prosecutor that evidentiary statements were fabricated or “concocted” evidence. It was also claimed that this constituted conduct by omission in failing to cause the termination of the prosecution. 
     
      
    138 Section 8 of the Vicarious Liability Act makes it clear that the plaintiff cannot rely upon the provisions of the Act with respect to the vicarious liability of the Crown with respect to either a “tort committed” by a person or one “arising out of a wrongful act or omission” occurring prior to October 1983. 
     
      
    139 The tort of malicious prosecution may arise from either the institution of proceedings or the maintenance of proceedings. That is evident in the High Court’s judgment in A’s case where consistent reference is made by the Court to “instituting or maintaining” or “commencing or maintaining” proceedings. 
     
      
    140 Further in A’s case, the Court expressly referred to the temporal dimension in the tort of malicious prosecution:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… the action for malicious prosecution has a temporal dimension. To ask whether a prosecution was  
        commenced or maintained 
         without reasonable and probable cause directs attention to the state of affairs when the prosecution was commenced,  
        or when the prosecutor 
         (the defendant in the subsequent civil claim)  
        is alleged to have maintained that prosecution 
        . Moreover, it necessarily directs attention to what material the prosecutor had available for consideration when deciding whether to  
        commence 
         or  
        maintain 
         the prosecution not whatever material may later have come to light.” 
         (at p.520) (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    141 The temporal dimension in the present case concerns (a) the alleged absence of reasonable and probable cause as at the date Mr Ross laid the charge (15 January 1980) and (b) the absence of reasonable and probable cause in the period during which the proceedings were maintained up to 7 June 1984, being the date on which the plaintiff was sentenced. The maintenance of proceedings would, in my opinion, include all acts by “the prosecutor” after October 1983 in maintaining and pursuing the proceedings including the re-listing of them for ultimate hearing and disposal by conviction and sentence. 
     
      
    142 The significance of later steps in a prosecution independently of the preferring of an indictment in constituting the same as malicious proceedings has been established long ago. In Fitzjohn v Mackinder (1861) SC 30 LJCP 257; 142 ER 199, M sued F in the County Court for a debt. F claimed a set-off in answer to which M produced his ledger containing an acknowledgment signed, as he swore, by F. F denied the signature, which he averred to be a forgery. However, the trial judge, induced partly by the statement of M and partly by the conduct of F when giving evidence, disbelieved F’s denial. The judge committed him for trial for perjury and bound M over to prosecute. M did pursue the prosecution but F was acquitted. F then brought an action against M for maliciously and without probable cause causing him to be prosecuted on an unfounded charge. 
     
      
    143 The Court held on appeal, by majority, that the action was maintainable. Bromwell B noted, at p.205, that the action was not one for damages for preferring the indictment. The proceedings were only for what was referred to as “the residue of the prosecution and the damage consequent upon it”. Bromwell B then observed (at pp.205 to 206):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… Where an action is maintainable in respect of the whole prosecution, including the preferring of the bill  
        it is in part maintainable for the subsequent stages and conduct of it 
        , - then why should it not be maintainable for those parts, even where it is not for the mere preferring of the bill …”  
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    144 Similarly, Cockburn CJ stated (at p.208):- 
     
      
       
        
        “Without, however, going thus far – assuming that the defendant ought not to be held responsible for the act of the judge in directing the prosecution of the plaintiff, I am still of the opinion that the defendant is liable in this action …” 
        
       
      
    145 At 208 to 209 it was further observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “But the main argument relied on in favour of the defendant is that he did not originate the proceedings or, as the phrase is, set the law in motion … I do not feel at all pressed by this argument … a prosecution, though in the outset not malicious … may nevertheless  
        become malicious in any of the stages through which it has to pass 
        , if the prosecutor, having acquired positive knowledge of the innocence of the accused, preservers malo animo in the prosecution with the intention of procuring per nefas a conviction of the accused …” 
         (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    146 Similarly in Daniels (supra), observations were made as to the significance to an action of malicious prosecution of the co-existence of the element of malice at a time, after proceedings commenced, with active steps taken in the pursuit of the proceedings. Harvey ACJ observed at p.102:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, malicious prosecution connotes an active prosecution of the plaintiff. It must be shown that  
        at some time when the defendants took some 
         steps towards pressing on the prosecution they were actuated by malice … They must at the time when they  
        do something by way of prosecution 
         of the defendant be actuated by malice and without reasonable and probable cause … Had they taken any steps such as by giving evidence in support of the prosecution, had they actively prevented the giving of evidence by persons who were qualified to give evidence,  
        had they suppressed evidence 
        , then I think on the authorities … I think the Court is justified in saying that they took an active step actuated by malice without reasonable and probable cause sufficient to establish malicious prosecution; but mere abstaining from doing or taking any action at all is not, in my opinion, malicious prosecution …”  
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    147 In Coleman v Buckingham’s Limited [1963] SR (NSW)171, Heron CJ at Walsh J discussed the principles that apply to the institution and to the continuation of proceedings as an element of the tort. Their Honours, at 178 observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… we think that this question should be answered as a matter of principle by saying that an action of this kind will lie if active steps are taken in furtherance of the proceedings by a defendant who is, at the time when he takes them, acting maliciously and without reasonable and proper cause within the meaning of these expressions as understood in this form of action. See  
        Daniels v Telfer 
         …  
        Fitzjohn v Macinder 
         … But once the view is taken that an action will lie, subject to proof of relevant damage, for maliciously  
        instituting 
         civil progress, in principle it seems that it will lie also for maliciously  
        continuing 
         a civil proceeding.”  
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    148 Their Honours later also observed (at 180):- 
     
      
       
        
        “The principles to which we have referred cannot be questioned and they were accepted as valid in  
        Cabassi v Vila 
         … But in our opinion, it is consistent with those principles and is in accordance with authority to hold, that an action may be maintained for instituting or pursuing legal proceedings (criminal or civil), maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause, notwithstanding that the facts are such that the plaintiff will inevitably seek to support his case by proving a swearing of a false affidavit by or at the behest of the defendant. If the action is founded simply on the false swearing it does not lie. But if it is alleged and proved that there was an instigation of proceedings or an active prosecution of them by the defendant and that this was done maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause, and damage of the requisite kind followed, and if the false swearing is merely a means by which the defendant did these things, the action will lie …” 
        
       
      
    149 Returning to the facts of the present case and to the provisions of s.3 of the Vicarious Liability Act, the restriction specified in that section does not apply to steps taken after October 1983, being steps taken in the proceedings by the prosecution with a view to obtaining a conviction and ultimately the imposition of a sentence. In the event that findings were made that police fabricated the evidence leading to the plaintiff’s arrest on 15 January 1980, then any and all steps taken after October 1983 to maintain or continue the proceedings using such tainted evidence would plainly be taken “malo animo”. A finding to that effect would necessarily imply that the police officer or officers, as prosecutor(s), though knowing the true position, suppressed their knowledge of the true facts thereby falling within that category of case referred to by Harvey ACJ in Daniels (supra). 
     
      
    150 If it be that the prosecution for the 1980 charge was based on fabricated evidence, the prosecutor(s) responsible for its manufacture would be under a duty to disclose it. Suppression of the truth where a duty exists to disclose false information is “conduct” in the maintenance of proceedings as is a specific step taken in pursuing them. Similar concepts arise in other areas of the law. Failure to provide information in trade practices law (s.52, Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth)) can be actionable as misleading and deceptive conduct. See for example Costa Vraca Pty Limited v Berrigan Weed & Pest Control Pty Limited (1998) 155 ALR 714 per Finkelstein J at 722. 
     
      
    151 If a finding were to be made that police “loaded” the plaintiff with heroin and then charged him on the basis of such fabricated evidence (a matter considered below), the police officer or officers responsible, as prosecutor(s), would thereafter be subject to a duty to disclose his/their wrongdoing and not allow the prosecution to go forward based on manufactured evidence. On such a finding in this case, by pursuing the proceedings including attending court from time to time up to sentence, they would be maintaining a prosecution with respect to the 1980 charge prior to and beyond 28 October 1983. 
     
      
    152 I turn to s.8(1) of the Vicarious Liability Act. In considering whether that section entitles the plaintiff to rely upon that Act for the purposes of suing the State on the basis of maintaining the prosecution based on fabricated evidence, as the plaintiff contends, the provisions operate on satisfaction of three matters:- 
     
      
       
      (1) That the person concerned committed a tort  
      “… in the service of the Crown” 
      . 
       
       
      (2) That the person was actually or purportedly performing a  
      “function” 
      .  
      “Function” 
       is defined in s.5(2)(a) as including  
      “… a reference to a power, authority and duty” 
      . 
       
       
      (3) That the  
      “function” 
       must be in the course of the person’s service with the Crown, or incidental to his service: see  
      Prior v State of New South Wales 
       (CA 40615/96 unreported, 2 September 1998, Meagher, Handley and Sheller JJA at pp.3 to 4). 
       
      
    153 As I understand it in the present case, the State contends that, at the time leading up to and including the plaintiff’s arrest, if it were found that the arresting police officers, as contended by the plaintiff, fabricated evidence against him, they could not be said to have been performing a function and, accordingly, in those circumstances it could not be said that the tort occurred in the course of their service with the Crown or incidental to that service. 
     
      
    154 The argument in this respect advanced on behalf of the State was, in substance, that actions involving the fabrication of evidence against a person could not be considered to be a “function” being so obviously foreign to a police officer’s duty that it could not be considered as being in the course of his or her duty or incidental to it. 
     
      
    155 In the present case, the evidence, which I accept, was that prior to 15 January 1980, the plaintiff had been the subject of police investigation, including observation. He had, according to the evidence, been “targeted” for investigation prior to 15 January 1980. This occurred at least over several weeks in the 12 months before his arrest. In that factual context, I consider that it would be open to a jury to conclude (or a trial judge to find) that the alleged illegal activity of police in fabricating evidence, if true, arose in the context of and in the course of an ongoing investigation into the plaintiff’s activities. 
     
      
    156 In Prior (supra), the police officers concerned were “… guilty of an outrageous and disturbing assault on an elderly man for no apparent reason”: per Meagher JA at p.2. The assault occurred in the context of the performance by the relevant police officers of a breath-testing operation. Although such conduct by police officers, involving as it did, an assault or trespass, nonetheless was held to fall within the provisions of s.8(1) of the Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act. The State was, accordingly, held liable in respect of the tort committed by the police officers in question. 
     
      
    157 Similarly, in Knight v New South Wales [2004] NSWSC 791, liability arose in circumstances in which a finding was made that certain police officers had assaulted the plaintiff. The issue was whether or not he had sustained injuries whilst climbing a wall and falling or whether the officers concerned had assaulted him causing grievous injury, including a fracture of the skull. In those proceedings, the only defendant was the State of New South Wales, the police officers not themselves being parties to the proceedings. 
     
      
    158 In State of New South Wales v Eade [2006] NSWSC 84, the plaintiff signed a handwritten statement in which admissions were made concerning the sale and use by him of heroin. He was charged with supplying and administering a prohibited drug (heroin). He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. 
     
      
    159 In 1996, the plaintiff in that case gave evidence before the Wood Royal Commission to the effect that the confession signed by him had been procured by Mr Eade (the cross-defendant) through a series of threats, the threats being that he would be “loaded up” with heroin if he did not confess. 
     
      
    160 On 28 February 2002, the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed his conviction accepting his evidence that he signed the confession statement because of the threats made by Mr Eade. 
     
      
    161 In its defence to the amended statement of claim relied upon by the plaintiff, the State admitted vicarious liability for the conduct of Mr Eade and another police officer. Hoeben J stated that he assumed that this had been done in accordance with the provisions of s.8 of the Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act. His Honour referred to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Prior (supra) and observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “31. The torts relied upon by the plaintiff were wrongful arrest, wrongful imprisonment and malicious prosecution. At the heart of each of those torts was the conduct of the cross-defendant in arresting the plaintiff on a false basis and then subsequently proceeding to charge him. It seems to me that those activities involved the performance of a function as defined by a police officer.” 
        
       
      
    162 His Honour went on to state that the particular vice associated with the police officer’s conduct was that it involved the exercise of his power and authority as a police officer in the purported performance of his duty, but in a corrupt way ([32]). 
     
      
    163 Hoeben J referred to dicta in Tiger Nominees Pty Limited v State Pollution Control Commission (1992) 25 NSWLR 715 at 721, and noted that in that case vicarious criminal responsibility attached to an employer. His Honour then stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “34. … Accordingly, it seems to me, that the actions of Mr Eade in wrongfully arresting and wrongfully imprisoning the plaintiff and in maliciously bringing charges against him, can be properly characterised as incidents of a police officer’s function but carried out in an improper manner. 
        
       
       
        
        35. I am of the opinion that for the purposes of s.5(3A) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 the State was vicariously liable under s.8 of the Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act 1983 for the actions of Mr Eade.” 
        
       
      
    164 It is, in my opinion, clear that the application of s.8 is not to be determined simply by asking the question as to whether the acts of a police officer (such as assault, false imprisonment, obtaining admissions under duress or using fabricated evidence for the purpose of maintaining a prosecution) were “so foreign to a police officer’s duty”. Its application depends upon whether, on the facts of the particular case, it can be said that, though they be actions that are contrary to the sworn duty of a police officer and involve criminality, they nonetheless, on the facts, attract the operation of the provisions of s.8 because they can be said to be “in the performance or purported performance of a function”. 
     
      
    165 In the above cases, the tortious conduct occurred during the course of exercising a function, in particular, a power. The present case is not as clear cut. However, it is not too distant from the circumstances in Eade (supra). In that case, the extraction of a confession under duress can be characterised as having falsely created evidence by way of a purported admission for the purposes of charging the plaintiff to those proceedings where a search warrant had been executed on the plaintiff’s premises but no heroin was found. Subsequently, possibly on the same day, the plaintiff was taken to Gosford Police Station where he was further interviewed and it was there that the impugned confession statement was made. Accordingly, the statement was not produced during the actual exercise of a power (the power to execute a search warrant) but followed not long afterwards during an interview. 
     
      
    166 In the present case, as I have earlier stated, the asserted “loading up” of the plaintiff, if it is shown to have occurred, arose in the context of an ongoing investigation by police into the plaintiff’s activities and is alleged to have occurred immediately prior to Mr Ross and other officers exercising their power of arrest. 
     
      
    167 Accordingly, by reference to the principles and approach in the above authorities, I am of the opinion that, if the alleged facts concerning the fabrication of evidence are proved to the applicable standard, then the provisions of s.8 of the Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act would operate to render the State vicariously liable for the maintenance of the prosecution. 
     
      
    168 I turn to consider the fundamental question of fact, namely, whether the evidence in the plaintiff’s case does establish to the applicable standard that police fabricated evidence by “loading” the plaintiff with heroin. 
     
      
       
      (d) The evidence of events leading to the 1980 charge 
       
      
    169 The plaintiff’s case in relation to the 1980 charge essentially rests upon his own evidence and that of Mr Trevor Haken. The State has submitted that the credibility of both the plaintiff and of Mr Haken is such that the Court, applying the relevant standard of proof, could not find that the plaintiff’s allegation that police manufactured evidence has been made out. 
     
      
    170 I have, as previously indicated, necessarily proceeded on the basis that the fact of the plaintiff’s past history including, in particular, his involvement in acts of dishonesty requires appropriate caution to be exercised in evaluating his evidence. 
     
      
    171 As the discussion of the events of 15 January 1980 later in this judgment will indicate, I have not relied upon the plaintiff’s evidence as to what occurred on that date unless and to the extent that it is corroborated by other evidence. The issue of corroboration in that respect directs attention to and is dependent, to a significant extent, upon findings to be made in respect of evidence given in these proceedings by Mr Haken. 
     
      
    172 The plaintiff stated that in 1980 he lived at 48 Parklands Avenue, Leonay near Penrith. He was, at that time, living with his de facto wife, Joy Catherine Moore. Ms Moore died on 2 October 2004. His evidence was that on the day of his arrest, he and his wife were planning to travel to the Spanish Club in the city.  
     
      
    173 The plaintiff said that on 15 January 1980, he was at his Leonay home. It was a hot afternoon and at some point he said he noted a green Falcon vehicle parked 30 or 40 yards up the road from his house. This is consistent with the evidence of Mr Chidgey. He saw three people in the vehicle. He said that they were in the car for over an hour during which time he was out at the front of his premises washing his car. He thought it was strange that they remained in the car, given that it was such a hot day. 
     
      
    174 He said that he first noticed the vehicle at about 4.00 pm. It was about 6.00 pm when he and his wife got into his Mercedes car. He said that when they drove off, he noticed that the green Ford car followed them. After entering the F4 Freeway, the plaintiff said that they travelled over the Nepean River following which the car travelling behind them accelerated and held up a “police” sign. 
     
      
    175 Mr Landini said that he pulled the car to the side of the road and stopped. A police car parked in front of him and Detective Sergeant Knox walked towards him. The green Falcon car had pulled in behind his car. 
     
      
    176 The State, admitted that the officers in question who were involved in the investigation were then officers in the New South Wales Police Service. 
     
      
    177 Mr Knox, according to Mr Landini said, “we have reason to believe that you have got drugs at your place and we would like you to accompany us back”. 
     
      
    178 The plaintiff said that he replied that he had seen the green car parked near his place and asked “Why didn’t you come and see me then?”. Mr Landini said he added “I reckon you are going to try and load me up here, that’s why you pulled me up here”. 
     
      
    179 He said that he was then pulled out of the car and he repeated to police that they were going to try and “load him up”. He claimed he was pushed down to the ground and handcuffed. The officers involved in his arrest maintained that he was not placed in handcuffs. 
     
      
    180 The plaintiff said that he saw someone open the boot of his car. He thought the officer was Detective Gardiner. He said that Detective Gardiner said “Look what we’ve got here”. He turned around and saw one of his running shoes had a plastic bag or bags which contained white powder. Mr Landini said that the police then took his wife and put her in another car and said to him “We are going to go back and search your house”. 
     
      
    181 I note at this point that Mr Ross, in his statement dated 16 January 1980 (Exhibit 30) stated that it was he and not Gardiner who found bags of heroin in the running shoe in the boot of the Mercedes vehicle. 
     
      
    182 Mr Landini said that, apart from the boot, he did not see police search the Mercedes vehicle either when it was stationary on the F4 or later at his home. The evidence of Mr Ross and Mr Chidgey was to the contrary. 
     
      
    183 He was placed in the green car with Detective Ross and travelled back to his home. The garage doors were open and three officers went through the garage. Detective Gardiner went to the back of a Ford Landau vehicle which was in the garage and opened the boot. The plaintiff said that he noticed that he moved something from under his shirt, and that Gardiner then made out that he was searching the boot of the car and in the next minute he had some bags and said “Oh, look, look what we’ve got here” and was “dancing up and down”. He said that he added “We’ve got you now. Look at this”. 
     
      
    184 The plaintiff said that Detective Gardiner had walked straight to the Ford Landau car. He did not see him search any other part of the garage before going to that vehicle. He said that he did not see police search any other part of the garage before Detective Gardiner approached the Ford Landau. He did not see any search of the garage after the drugs were allegedly found in the boot of the Landau. 
     
      
    185 The plaintiff said he was then taken upstairs. He saw his wife sitting down. He said that he was abusing police and said to his wife “They haven’t shown you a search warrant”. He said that he asked police whether they had a search warrant. He said that he knew that the police officers were going to “do something else in here as well”. He said the police told him to “shut up”. The plaintiff said that the next thing that he was aware of was police stating that they had found some hash “or something in our bedroom”. However, he said he was not shown any drugs. 
     
      
    186 The plaintiff said that at no stage was he shown a search warrant. He said that the search lasted for about half an hour. 
     
      
    187 He said he was still handcuffed when placed back in the police car and taken to Central Police Station and charged. He was then placed in the cells and remained there overnight. The following day, he appeared in the Central Local Court. 
     
      
    188 He said that he had never seen the drugs said to have been found in his Mercedes vehicle or the drugs said to have been in the back of the Landau vehicle. 
     
      
    189 In relation to the hash which it was claimed by police was found in the house, Mr Landini’s evidence was that at the time there were two brothers and their girlfriend who had stayed in the house for a week or so. He referred to them as Fred and Abdul Cako. He said that the last time he saw Mr Cako was three days after he was arrested and had not seen him since. He said he did not know where he lives. He observed that they would have been in the house and denied that the hash found in his bedroom was his. He also denied that the hash said to have been found in his pocket by police belonged to him.  
     
      
    190 In cross-examination, the plaintiff agreed that there were six detectives involved in the investigation leading to his arrest. He said that they were at his home for about an hour and a half. 
     
      
    191 On 16 January 1980, he was granted bail and said that he was subsequently represented by Mr Graham Berry, solicitor, and Mr J Conomos of counsel. 
     
      
    192 The plaintiff, initially said that he did not return to his home at Leonay after the grant of bail as he said he felt “uneasy going back there” by reason of what had happened to him the day before. He said “… I was scared that something else could happen, might happen”. He explained that he meant by this that police “could load him up again”. In other evidence, however, he said that he remained in Sydney until June 1980 until his son, Daniel, was born. He could not recall when the family moved to the South Coast into rented premises. In cross-examination, he said he remained at the premises in Leonay for some three or four months and then rented out his home. He recalled that the premises were leased for a six month period. He said that his de facto wife and son, in due course, moved back into the premises. He said that he later sold the property for financial reasons. 
     
      
    193 The plaintiff said that between January 1980 and July 1982 he lived on the South Coast. In that period he was coming to Sydney every week and would attend at the Etna Club. He said, in some weeks, he might go there two or three times a week. 
     
      
    194 He said that he had no prior association with the officers involved with his arrest on 15 January 1980. He denied that Detective Sergeant Knox had advised him that they had received information that he would be taking heroin to the city that day. 
     
      
    195 In refuting the suggestion that on 15 January 1980 he was engaged in taking drugs to Sydney from his home, he stated that, having seen persons whom he suspected were police in a car near his home, he would hardly have embarked upon a trip involving taking drugs to Sydney. 
     
      
    196 In relation to the search of his car on the freeway, Mr Landini denied that he was standing at the boot of his Mercedes car when the shoe and the drugs were produced. He denied that he walked to the rear of the car with Detective Ross and Detective Chidgey as they stated in their statements dated 16 January 1980. He said he did not open the boot for the police at any stage and rejected the suggestion put to him in cross-examination that he saw police search the interior of the Mercedes. 
     
      
    197 The evidence given by Mr Ross and Mr Chidgey at the committal hearing was that they went with the plaintiff to the rear of the vehicle (Exhibits 30 and 31) before the search of the boot commenced. 
     
      
    198 The plaintiff denied making any admissions to police. In particular, he denied that he said “who gave me up?”. He denied that Detective Ross said “Is this heroin?”. He denied saying “You know what it is, you’ve got it, don’t expect me to say anything about it”.  
     
      
    199 He denied Detective Ross said that police had a search warrant to search his home. He said he had no recollection of being shown a search warrant. 
     
      
    200 Mr Landini said when stopped on the F4, Detective Sergeant Knox said to him “we’ve information received that you have drugs at your premises and we’d like you to go back there with us”. However, he rejected any suggestion that Mr Knox said that he had information that the car was carrying heroin. He would not accept that Knox said that he intended to search the car and denied that he, the plaintiff, said “do you best”. To his recollection, there was no search made of the front portion of his vehicle. 
     
      
    201 He denied that Detective Ross said “I’m going to search the boot of the vehicle. I want you to come with me when I do”. 
     
      
    202 The plaintiff agreed that Mr Meakin of O’Connor Bellamy, solicitors, later acted for him on his application for parole. In respect of a submission Mr Meakin prepared on 7 October 1986 for the plaintiff, Mr Landini said that Mr Meakin had said to him that in his experience he had found that if a prisoner admitted his guilt he would be more favourably looked upon for the purposes of parole then if he did not. He had previously been told that he would not be considered for parole for another year after his initial application. Mr Meakin’s advice was that if he admitted his guilt, then in his experience, parole would be granted. Mr Landini said that he decided to tell the Parole Board that he had been involved “which wasn’t the case, to obtain parole for my release”. 
     
      
       
      (e) Mr Haken’s evidence 
       
      
    203 In 1980, Trevor Dale Haken was a detective attached to the New South Wales Drug Squad. As at that date, he had been in the Police Service for 11 years. He gave evidence that he was approached by Detective Senior Constable Glenn Ross who said to him that he was intending, with other police, to lock up Henry Landini and ask him whether he was willing to be a party to locking him up or whether he would rather not join in. Mr Haken said he was new to the team and Detective Ross was giving him the opportunity to say if he did not want to be involved. He gave evidence in chief as follows (transcript, p.643 to 645):- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Mr Haken, what did Mr Ross say to you when he first approached you in relation to Mr Landini? 
         
        A. Mr Ross said that he was intending to lock up Henry Landini with other police and asked me whether I was willing to be a party to locking Mr Landini up or whether I would rather not join in … 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did Detective Ross say anything to you as to how Mr Landini was to be locked up? 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can you answer that question Mr Haken? 
         
        A. Yes, certainly. Mr Ross told me that he had a quantity of heroin and that Mr Landini was going to be loaded up and charged. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was anything further said as to how that was to be done, at that stage, we are talking about? 
         
        A. I don’t think it was said at that early stage. It was carried on fairly quickly and the matter was put into progress. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What conversation was had as to who the names of those police present – wrong, mentioned by Mr Ross? 
         
        A. He mentioned that his team, that being myself and Steven Chidgey and Glen Ross’ team – sorry. Lez  
        [sic] 
         Knox’s team, being Lez  
        [sic] 
         Knox, Tony Gardiner and Michael Leary, would be the police involved in this operation … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Either at that stage or a later stage were you shown anything in relation to what Mr Ross had told you was going to happen? 
         
        A. Yes, I was. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What were you shown? 
         
        A. I was shown a plastic bag containing white powder. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And were you told anything about the white powder? 
         
        A. Yes, I was. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I withdraw that. 
         
        A. I was told that it was a bag. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Go on? 
         
        A. I’m sorry. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I interrupted you. Go on. 
         
        A. It was a bag of heroin. It was a bag of heroin which had been located on a roof of a building in the eastern suburbs and had been handed in by a civilian. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Who told you that? 
         
        A. Glen Ross. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did he in fact produce a bag of heroin to you? 
         
        A. Yes, he did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And were you given any instructions as to what to do with it? 
         
        A. Yes, I was. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What instructions were you given? 
         
        A. I was given the task of cutting the heroin, that is, diluting it into a larger quantity and placing it into small plastic bags to give the effect of being bagged heroin. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Were you given any instructions in relation to diluting the heroin? 
         
        A. Yes I was. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And by whom? 
         
        A. I was told by Mr Ross and Mr Knox to dilute the powder down to a quantity where it could be bagged up and made into a sufficient number of 5-gram bags. I believe it was 5-gram bags that we made up. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you said that Mr Ross gave you the heroin, who else was present at the time you were given the heroin to bag? 
         
        A. Certainly Mr Knox was there. I can’t recall, I can’t recall if any of the others were there in the room at that stage. 
        ” 
        
       
      
    204 Mr Haken gave evidence of having a number of conversations in relation to what was referred to in evidence as the “methodology” for the operation with “all six officers, that’s Knox, Ross, Chidgey, myself, Gardiner and Leary, had a number of conversations in relation to the methodology of the operation carried out …”. 
     
      
    205 He was asked where the conversations took place. He replied:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I don’t believe I am in a position to answer that question. They were in varying places. This is a long time ago and I have not got the wherewithal in memory to tell you where or when those conversations took place.” 
        
       
      
    206 He was asked:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Could you give us your best recollection of the discussions had between you and the other police as to the methodology to be utilised in relation to fabricating evidence against Mr Landini? 
         
        A. Certainly. The methodology was that we were to drive to an area close to Landini’s home, in Leonay I think, and wait for him to leave his home and drive on to the expressway where he would be stopped and he would be found to be in possession of the quantities of heroin. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was there anything discussed as to why you would wait till he left his home first? 
         
        A. My recollection is that it would appear that he was leaving his home to go somewhere to supply a quantity of heroin that would be found in his car. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was there any other reason discussed that you recall? 
         
        A. There may have been, but nothing that I can bring to mind at the moment. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was there anything discussed as to where the drugs were to be found, in inverted commas? 
         
        A. There was a discussion and, to my recollection, the drugs were to be found in the boot of the car driven by Mr Landini. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was anything discussed as to who was to actually find the drug or drugs? 
         
        A. There may have been, but I have no recollection of that, either that conversation or who actually found the drugs in the boot.” 
        
       
       
      (f) Mr Haken’s observations of events leading to the plaintiff’s arrest 
       
      
    207 Whilst Mr Haken said that he participated in the execution of the operation in re-bagging the heroin and was part of the team that travelled to Leonay, he did not say that he actually handled the heroin at Leonay. 
     
      
    208 He said he travelled to Leonay with five other police and there were two police cars involved in its execution. He said he was in a car with Glenn Ross and Stephen Chidgey. He could not recall the time of leaving or arriving at Leonay but said he attended at the Leonay Golf Course clubhouse first. He said the clubhouse was frequented by Les Knox and it was “close by to the area where Landini would drive past”. He could not recall how long they remained at the clubhouse. He said police pulled the plaintiff up when on “the western freeway”. At that point he did not think that he personally had possession of the heroin and had no recollection of who did. 
     
      
    209 As to when he next saw the heroin, he said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I saw it located in the running shoe which had been located in the boot of the Mercedes car driven by Mr Landini.” 
        
       
      
    210 When asked which officer located the heroin in the boot, he replied:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. No. I have given a great deal of thought to that, but the time factor between then and now has clouded the issue and I can’t be specific as to who that person was.” 
        
       
      
    211 He said he could not recall anything else being produced from the boot of the car. He said he recalled the shoe being held up “… in the format of ‘we’ve found it’, but nothing more than that”. He said he could not recall anybody “specifically” saying anything. He was asked:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you recognise those drugs as being the same drugs that you had placed in the separate bags? 
         
        A. When I did examine them they certainly appeared to be the same packages that I had prepared.” 
        
       
      
    212 Mr Haken’s evidence was that Mr Landini was then taken with two cars of police to his premises at Leonay. He said he searched a room in the premises and other police searched outside. He did not recall being present when the garage was searched. He said “once the search had been concluded and all items of interest taken into custody, Mr Landini was transported to the police station where he was charged”. 
     
      
    213 Mr Haken said that he was not able to say whether the making of his police statement about the matter was discussed with other police:- 
     
      
       
        
        “At this point I am not able to say I recall whether there was or was not statements with others. The matter is a long time ago and I can’t be clear whether there was or was not.” 
        
       
      
    214 He confirmed that he could not recall whether he conferred with other police in making his statement. He later said he had “discussions” with police before his statement was made but that he could not be more explicit “as to the exact nature of those discussions”. 
     
      
    215 In cross-examination, he agreed that he had spoken of the events in question on a number of occasions:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A. I’ve spoken of this event on a number of occasions at the time when the arrest took place and obviously at subsequent court matters and then not again until 1994 I would suppose when I was associated with the Royal Commission.” 
        
       
      
    216 He also agreed that he had spoken about the matter when he provided an account to an author, Sean Padraic, for a book entitled “Sympathy for the Devil”. 
     
      
    217 Mr Haken further agreed that before giving evidence at the Royal Commission hearings “about this incident at Leonay” he had spoken to Commission investigators and had provided a statutory declaration. He also said he conferred with counsel assisting the Commission about the matter.  
     
      
    218 In cross-examination, it was put to Mr Haken’s that there was, in effect, a conventional motivation for police attending at Leonay, being the investigation of police intelligence against Mr Landini:- 
     
      
       
        
        “You were told before you went to Leonay that Mr Knox and/or Mr Ross had received intelligence from an undercover police officer that Mr Landini would be transporting drugs to Sydney on 15 January 1980? You were told that weren’t you? 
         
        A. No, I don’t recall being told that.” 
        
       
      
    219 It was put to him that the “methodology” which Mr Haken said was discussed at the Drug Squad offices (at the CIB) to stop Mr Landini on the freeway could not have occurred unless police had advance information that he would use it. He replied “that was a matter that I had no knowledge of”. He conceded that it was likely police had some information as to Mr Landini’s use of the freeway travelling east. He added “… but I can’t take you any further with that matter”. He, however, rejected that the receipt of such information was “completely inconsistent” with an agreement to “load up” Mr Landini on the freeway. 
     
      
    220 In cross-examination on the issue of “methodology”, Mr Haken said that he did not recall there having been any discussion at CIB headquarters of any plan to search Mr Landini’s home following his planned detention on the freeway. Nor, according to him, did he have any recollection of any search warrant having issued for such a search. 
     
      
       
      (g) Mr Haken’s Royal Commission evidence 
       
      
    221 Mr Haken said that he was approached by Royal Commission officers in September 1994. From that time on he commenced work in an undercover role for the Royal Commission. He agreed that he went on sick leave in about August 1994. He was told by a Dr Cook that he was suffering from depression and was referred to Dr Barclay, psychiatrist. He was prescribed anti-depressant medication by Dr Cook. 
     
      
    222 He said he received an indemnity from prosecution in 1995. 
     
      
    223 The transcript of Mr Haken’s evidence to the Royal Commission at p.48, line 4 to p.50, line 40 of Exhibit X was admitted without objection. The tender of the segments of transcript at p.50, line 42 to p.51, line 25 and that at p.52, line 30 to line 37 of Exhibit X was objected to. Those segments were admitted. In light of the majority judgments of the Court of Appeal in Thomas (supra), the ruling on admissibility in relation to the last two mentioned segments of transcript was contrary to the ruling of the majority in that case in relation to s.69(3)(a) of the Evidence Act 1995. 
     
      
    224 The segment of transcript (Exhibit X) not objected to concerned Mr Haken’s evidence as to what he said were Mr Ross’ statements to him and his claimed response, including the preparation of the heroin. 
     
      
    225 The abovementioned transcript of Mr Haken’s evidence to the Royal Commission, had it been the subject of objection, would have been admissible on the credibility of Mr Haken, a matter of central importance. The fact that he disclosed to the Royal Commission in 1995 that he, and others (on his version of events), participated in a criminal enterprise raised the following issues:-  
     
      
       
      • Why, amongst the several issues disclosed by Haken to the Royal Commission, the Landini matter was amongst them? 
       
       
      • Why would Haken implicate himself in criminal conduct if he was not in fact involved? 
       
       
      • If no motive can be established for Haken to have lied to the Royal Commission, then his credibility must be assessed accordingly. 
       
      
    226 On 21 August 1995, he was called to give evidence by counsel assisting the Royal Commission and during the course of his evidence he was asked for his best recollection of events as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Let’s deal with the Landini matter – it’s probably a good one. This is a matter which occurred early on, as you can recall, to the best of your recollection, in your time at the Drug Squad? 
         
        A. Yes, it was. 
          
        
       
       
        
        Q. How did you come to be involved in it? 
         
        A. At that stage, I was working, as I said, with Detective Senior Constable Glen Ross and Steve Chidgey. Glen Ross actually approached me and asked me if I wanted to be involved in the arrest of Landini and certainly offered me the opportunity of not being involved if it didn’t want to. He explained to me that Landini was going to be locked up by planting drugs on him and that that would be done in conjunct  
        [sic] 
         with the team of Les Knox, which was Les Knox, Tony Gardiner and, I think, Mike Leary at that stage. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I think Les Knox was at the time a Detective Sergeant … 
         
        A. Yes, he was. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. … of Police, who went on to be a senior officer of police at Penrith before resigning? 
         
        A. He went to Parramatta, I think. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Sorry, Parramatta? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was he a member of the Drug Squad at the CIB at this time? 
         
        A. Yes, he was. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What was your response to Mr Ross when you were asked whether you wanted to take part in the arrest of Mr Landini? 
         
        Q. I told him that I wanted to take part in the arrest. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was Mr Landini a notorious, fairly long-term target of police involved in drug investigation? 
         
        A. I’m not sure that he was a long-term target, but he certainly was a notorious drug supplier at that stage. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So you worked with another team, that is a team with Detective Sergeant Knox, is that right? 
         
        A. Yes, that’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you do, what was the operation? 
         
        A. The operation was, was that a quantity of heroin, which had been located prior to me arriving at the Drug Squad, as I understood it, was diluted to form a greater quantity, and that function was performed by myself. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where did you get the heroin from to do that? 
         
        A. That was given to me by Glen Ross and Les Knox and it was done in the Drug Squad office. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Were you told where the heroin had come from? 
         
        A. I was told that the heroin had been found on a roof top of a block of flats in the eastern suburbs and that it had been handed in by a resident at the premises. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Were you told that by the same persons who gave you the heroin? 
         
        A. That’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So, in the Drug Squad office, you then prepared the heroin to be used in the arrest of Mr Landini? 
         
        A. That’s correct. It was cut, for want of a better term, placed into plastic bags in the form of being ready for sale, and with both teams – that’s Glen Ross’ team, including myself, and Les Knox’s team – we went to the Leonay Golf Club, where Les Knox at that time was President, I think. We waited there until Landini left his home, which is not far distant from that club, and then followed him on the expressway leading to Sydney. He was pulled over, and at that stage he was driving a Mercedes sedan. The vehicle was searched and the drugs were placed into the boot of the car, I believe into a running shoe, and he was subsequently charged with possession and supply of the substance. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. He came to plead guilty to that matter when he was at court? 
         
        A. I understand that he pleaded guilty to that matter. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
      
    227 The transcript of his cross-examination before the Royal Commission was not the subject of objection. During the course of it, Mr Haken said that he was unable to recall how many bags of heroin were prepared. It was then put to him as to whether he was able to say it was less or more than 10 bags, to which he replied:- 
     
      
       
        
        “My recollection is it was in the vicinity of 10, perhaps less than 10, but not a great deal more. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Anyway, there were the 10 bags you say were secreted in the running shoe in the boot of Landini’s vehicle, is that correct? 
         
        A. Not necessarily 10 bags, but the bags which were prepared were certainly placed into the shoe. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you had, do you say, some of these bags of heroin on yourself. 
         
        A. No, I didn’t say that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you indeed, have any of the bags of heroin yourself? 
         
        A. At the time they were placed into the vehicle? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes. 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You didn’t conduct the search of the vehicle, you say? 
         
        A. No, I was present when the search was conducted. I didn’t locate the drugs. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You were present, were you not, thereafter when Landini was returned to his home address? 
         
        A. Yes, I was. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You don’t assert that there’s any other corrupt activity in respect of the arrest of Landini other than the planting of the heroin in the boot of the Mercedes, do you? 
         
        A. No, I haven’t made that assertion. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The position is this, is it not, that you were present when Landini’s other motor vehicle at his home address was searched on his return to his home after his arrest in the Mercedes, weren’t you? 
         
        A. I was certainly present at the house, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You were aware then that heroin was also found after a search of his other motor vehicle, a Ford Landau, is that correct? 
         
        A. No, I wasn’t aware that heroin was located in the Ford Landau, by recollection. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You were aware of the fact that his premises were then searched? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You were aware of the fact that his motor vehicle was then searched, that’s the Ford Landau, the residential premises after the Mercedes incident? 
         
        A. I have no recall of the Landau being searched. 
        
       
       
        
        …” 
        
       
       
      (h) Assessing Mr Haken’s credibility 
       
      
    228 In cross-examination on his police service prior to joining the Drug Squad, Mr Haken admitted to having engaged in corrupt practices, to stealing money, “verballing” people, and he accepted that he had given false evidence. He said he disclosed these matters to the Royal Commission in 1994/1995. He accepted that in a trial of persons by the name of Fish and Swan it was “quite likely” that he had admitted to committing perjury and agreed that he had in fact done so.  
     
      
    229 He was cross-examined about an application he made for a medical discharge from the police service. He said that, although he worked in an undercover capacity for the Royal Commission, the work was different from “police work”. He said he considered that he was no longer able to “run a general detectives’ office, being able to guide junior staff in the way that they should be guided to take control of a normal operative detectives’ office” and to make judgments. He said he was on medication at the time of performing the undercover work. He considered that taking medication would have rendered him a danger in performing police work. 
     
      
    230 Mr Haken’s credibility was sought to be challenged upon the basis that, a successful application for a discharge would result in financial benefits to him, the inference being that, if he was able to perform work for the Royal Commission, this was inconsistent with him suffering from a disability as claimed in the application for a medical discharge. It was put to him that the application was, accordingly, improperly made. 
     
      
    231 The evidence does not permit a finding that by participating in undercover work Mr Haken thereby demonstrated a capacity that was inconsistent with the disability relied upon in support of his application for a discharge from police service. Whilst the undercover operations were, no doubt, stressful, I accept Mr Haken’s evidence that the conditions attaching to that work differed sufficiently from the full-time work required within the discipline of the Police Service. The evidence does not, in my opinion, support a conclusion that the basis for the discharge application was misrepresented or dishonestly propounded. The evidence given by Mr Haken as to his need for medical treatment by a general practitioner and specialist was not established in these proceedings to have been in any way false or inaccurate. 
     
      
    232 In evaluating his evidence, it is plainly necessary to have appropriate regard to his admissions as to his past dishonesty and, in particular, having, inter alia, given false evidence in other proceedings many years ago. It is also necessary in evaluating Mr Haken’s evidence in these proceedings to have careful regard to the circumstances attending his police service over many years, in particular, to his engagement in corrupt conduct. 
     
      
    233 An attempt was made in cross-examination to discredit him by suggesting that his co-operation with the Royal Commission was motivated by personal benefit, namely, the benefit of an indemnity from prosecution. However, the grant of an indemnity would not, in my mind, in itself rationally lead to the conclusion that he is to be considered an unreliable or dishonest witness so far as his account of events concerning Mr Landini is concerned. 
     
      
    234 There is no evidence or suggestion that law enforcement authorities (other than officers involved in the plaintiff’s arrest) or the Royal Commission investigators were aware of the events as related by Mr Haken until he voluntarily disclosed them. In other words, but for Mr Haken’s disclosure in 1995, there was no basis for concluding that he was at risk of prosecution over the plaintiff’s arrest. It has not been suggested that the indemnity was offered to him on the basis that police or the Commission had already suspected or had information about the Landini matter. 
     
      
    235 It was further suggested that his evidence may have been affected or motivated by ill-will, having been dismissed from the Drug Squad by Inspector Williams and by the termination of his service with the Joint Taskforce (“JTF”). Mr Haken maintained that he was not “bitter” and had, what he considered to be, a “good time” at the Drug Squad where he had made many friends. 
     
      
    236 He admitted that at the time he became involved with the Royal Commission, he felt that he was the victim of the “hierarchy” of the Police Service. It was put to him that his attitude/feelings against the police hierarchy “fuelled the evidence that you gave to the Royal Commission about that which happened on 15 January 1980”. He responded “No, not at all”. He subsequently repeated his denial of the proposition. There is no evidence of any falling out with Mr Ross or Mr Knox or the existence of any ill-will towards them. 
     
      
    237 I do not consider that it has been established by way of rational inference or otherwise that he falsified his account to the Royal Commission concerning the events of 15 January 1980 by reason of the way he felt about “the hierarchy”. His superior officers, Knox and Ross, were not shown to have formed part of “the hierarchy” to which the witness referred. There was no suggestion put to him that there was any personal ill-will or disaffection between him and Ross and Knox. Neither Mr Ross or Mr Knox or any other of the other former officers gave evidence that suggested there was any personal animosity between Mr Haken and any one of them. 
     
      
    238 It was further put to Mr Haken that, by 1988, he had a drinking problem and had “nervous symptoms”.  He admitted to drinking heavily but denied that he was an alcoholic. He said he had a “similar problem with alcohol that most detective had in those days …”. He agreed that the recollection of events of 1980 were clouded by the passage of time (a matter volunteered by him in evidence in chief). He denied, however, that the time factor, alcohol and family issues had clouded his mind. 
     
      
    239 I do not consider that the evidence established that Mr Haken’s claimed recollection of relevant events concerning the plaintiff’s arrest in 1980 was affected by any claimed impairment specifically associated with his drinking or “nervous symptoms” in the period that intervened between 1980 and 1995 or thereafter. 
     
      
    240 In re-examination, he said that he had not referred to the presence of Mr Landini’s de facto wife, Ms Joy Moore, in the Mercedes car either in evidence before the Royal Commission or in his evidence in chief in the present proceedings as he had no recollection of her, adding “It wasn’t the most important part of what I recalled about the incident”. 
     
      
    241 As to his police statement, Exhibit 8, Mr Haken said in re-examination that there was no reference to the “methodology” discussed in evidence as “that additional information was never going to be included in a statement. The limited amount of information contained within the statement is correct. But it is not the entire truth in that there was a deletion of the complete evidence”. 
     
      
    242 In assessing Mr Haken’s evidence, I take into account the following matters:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The plaintiff had given instructions to counsel who represented him at the committal hearing which took place approximately eight months after his arrest that evidence relied upon by the Crown had been fabricated. Mr Conomos of counsel, who appeared on his behalf, conducted the committal upon the basis that the plaintiff had been  
      “loaded” 
       with the drugs allegedly  
      “found” 
       in the Mercedes and Ford Landau vehicles. 
       
       
      (2) Fifteen years after the plaintiff’s arrest (in 1995), having been a member of the arresting team, Haken provided an account to the Wood Royal Commission which was to similar effect. It is to be borne in mind that the repercussions on him, if he provided misleading information to the Royal Commission, were extremely grave for him. Any indemnity in respect of his serious conduct over past years would be placed in jeopardy should he be caught out misleading the Royal Commission about the Landini matter. 
       
       
      (3) Haken’s disclosure to the Royal Commission in 1995 is not to be regarded as an unguarded out-of-court comment or statement. He had been interviewed by Royal Commission investigators about the matter, verified his account by statutory declaration and gave sworn evidence to the Royal Commission about it. 
       
       
      (4) No motive or reason has been established in evidence in these proceedings as to why Haken would have invented the specific account given by him of a planned  
      “load-up” 
       as related to the Royal Commission and in these proceedings. That account on the evidence was not prompted by any knowledge investigators may have acquired about the Landini matter and involved him in making admissions against his own interest. 
       
       
      (i) Assessing the evidence 
       
      
    243 In making factual findings concerning alleged criminal conduct (fabricating evidence and giving false evidence based on the same) occurring so many years ago (1980), it is essential for the evidence to be assessed in accordance with relevant principle. In that respect, the following matters are noted:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The absence of corroboration of a grave allegation does not, in itself, necessarily affect the quality of the evidence given:  
      Amalgamated Television Services Pty Limited v Marsden 
       [2002] NSWCA 419 at [47]. However, it is a matter to be borne in mind. 
       
       
      (2) Particular evidence in itself may be inherently credible or incredible. The work of corroborative evidence is to support the evidence of a particular witness. A witness’ evidence may require support before it is accepted because of some feature of the evidence itself. This is so, for example, in relation to events that occurred many years ago (as in the present case) or the witness may have proved so unsatisfactory that the trial judge may determine that the witness’ evidence would not be accepted unless supported by other evidence:  
      Marsden 
       (supra) at [47]. The  
      “antiquity” 
       of grave allegations is, accordingly, a factor relevant to the consideration to be given to the evidence. 
       
       
      (3) The need for a cautious approach to the acceptance of uncorroborated evidence in the criminal sphere is not based upon the  
      “kind of evidence but on the circumstances of the case” 
      :  
      Lane v The Queen 
       (1996) 66 FCR 144. The same applies to allegations of criminality in civil proceedings. 
       
       
      (4) In particular, it is necessary in civil cases involving grave allegations to scrutinise the evidence with care:  
      Murray v The Queen 
       (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 at 19. Whilst that observation was made in the context of a criminal case, it is a general principle of prudence to be applied in civil proceedings where allegations of criminal conduct are alleged. 
       
       
      (5) There may be good reason for a judge to approach the evidence of a witness with a degree of caution, perhaps considerable caution, bearing in mind evidence about his or her credibility and creditworthiness:  
      Cureton v Blackshaw Services Pty Limited 
       [2002] NSWCA 187 at Sheller JA. 
       
       
      (6) However, as Sheller JA there also observed that it is not appropriate to assess a witness’ evidence on the basis of a pre-determined formula for, as His Honour stated,  
      “even proven liars may give truthful evidence which is inconsistent with the evidence of other apparently more credible witnesses. There is a danger that such evidence may be wrongly rejected because of the application of a pre-determined formula”

    244 In the consideration of Mr Haken’s evidence, I propose to have close regard to the matters referred to in the preceding paragraph. They are also to be brought into account in evaluating the plaintiff’s evidence. 
     
      
    245 I will return to the application of principles pertaining to the making of findings concerning criminal conduct in civil proceedings below. 
     
      
    246 As recorded above, Mr Haken stated in evidence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Ross told me he had a quantity of heroin and that Mr Landini was going to be loaded up and charged.” 
        
       
      
    247 Haken said there was nothing said “at that early stage” as to how that was to be done. He did not specify a particular or approximate date when this approach was allegedly made. The phrase “early stage” does suggest a time before 15 January 1980, being an initial stage or at the beginning of an unspecified period of time. I have considered the lack of specificity in this respect in assessing the reliability or accuracy of Haken’s evidence. 
     
      
    248 Mr Haken did, however, say that “it” (presumably a reference to the plan to “lock up Landini”), “was carried on fairly quickly and the matter was put into progress”. 
     
      
    249 He said that Ross said that “his team” would be involved in “the operation” (being Chidgey, Haken and Ross) along with “Les Knox’s team” (Tony Gardiner and Michael Leary). 
     
      
    250 There was implicit in Mr Haken’s account more than one conversation, for he said the “initial conversation” when Ross first approached him was “at an external place that I can’t recall”. Mr Haken said that “further conversations took place within the Drug Squad office”. He did not elaborate on how many “conversations” there were, where precisely they took place, who was present or who was party to each of them or what was said in each or any of the “conversations” or the time frame over which they took place relative to 15 January 1980. 
     
      
    251 He was asked whether “at that stage or at a later stage he was shown anything in relation to what Mr Ross had told you was going to happen to Mr Landini?”. In answer, Mr Haken said he was, but not precisely when, other than saying it was “later”, which implies some point in time after the first “approach”, when he said he was shown a “plastic bag containing white powder”.  
     
      
    252 He said he was “given the task of cutting the heroin, that is, diluting it into a larger quantity and placing it into small plastic bags to give the effect of being bagged heroin”. He said the reason for “diluting” it was “to increase the bulk of the heroin”. He said he was told by Mr Ross and Mr Knox to dilute the powder into five gram bags.  
     
      
    253 Mr Haken said other officers were present when he placed the heroin in the bags. These included, he said, Mr Ross and Mr Knox, but he did not or could not identify any other person or persons who were said to have been present. He said he “actually mixed the compound and I believe I did the measuring but I believe I had help from the other two at that time”, that is, Knox and Ross. He said he had access to scales to measure five gram quantities. He said the packaging took place in the “Drug Squad office”. 
     
      
    254 Whilst he said he was given equipment by Ross and Knox to make up the bags of heroin – scales, a bowl, a spoon, a “cutting agent”, in cross-examination he stated he had no recollection of who had actually placed the items on the table in the office.  
     
      
    255 He agreed that packaging the heroin into five gram bags as he said occurred in the course of the “Landini operation” would be consistent with the heroin being for distribution to those who might repackage the drug for street sale. 
     
      
    256 He agreed that if the level of seriousness of the offence depended upon the amount of heroin and not the bulk with a cutting agent, there would have been no point in diluting the drug. 
     
      
    257 Mr Haken said that, as he understood it, the “weight of the drug is relevant to determine the penalty which may be imposed”. See Regina v Stanbouli (2003) 141 A Crim R 355 (Hulme J) in relation to matters of heroin usage, quantities, price and purity.  
     
      
    258 Asked why each bag was to have five grams in it, he said “… I understood that it would make the bag appear to be a large scale single sale item …”. A five gram bag, together with a number of other such bags would, he said, “be cumulative and when found together would increase the quantity of drug considerably”. 
     
      
    259 After the re-bagging operation, Mr Haken said that the bags of heroin were “locked away somewhere in the Drug Squad office and I don’t believe I had possession of them again after that time”.  
     
      
    260 Mr Haken said that the operation was intended to make it appear that the plaintiff was going somewhere to supply a “quantity of heroin that would be found in his car”. He said his recall was that “the drugs were to be found in the boot of the car driven by Mr Landini”. He could not recollect who would find the drugs in the boot. 
     
      
    261 When he was then taken to the events of 15 January 1980, his recollection of who said what prior to that date was confined to Mr Ross with only a couple of references having been made by him to Mr Knox in the planning or the “initial” stage. His recollection was given in a general form rather than in terms of an account of specific statements made in direct speech. Mr Haken’s evidence did not establish that Gardiner, Chidgey and Leary were present or involved in any particular discussion, although he gave evidence that the “methodology” had been discussed with the officers who were to carry out the operation. 
     
      
    262 After the packaging of the heroin, the next occasion he said he saw the bags was when “I saw it located in the running shoe located in the boot of the Mercedes car driven by Mr Landini”. He did not recall which officer claimed to have located the heroin. When he said he saw “it” in the running shoe, he was clearly making a reference to the bags which he said were similar to those he packaged. He said when he examined the bags “they certainly appeared to be the same packages that I had prepared”. He did not recall how many packages were found. 
     
      
    263 He was asked about how police witness statements were subsequently produced but he said he could not recall how the statements that were used in the committal proceedings were drawn up. He later added “I can’t be more precise than I’ve been today in this particular instant, in that we’re talking about a matter 25 years ago, and exactly what took place is clouded in my mind”. 
     
      
    264 It is apparent from the cross-examination that Mr Haken’s recollection of events, unsurprisingly, was essentially limited to the matters disclosed to the Royal Commission on 21 August 1995 (Exhibit X). He said he had refreshed his recollection from that transcript before giving evidence in the present proceedings. Mr Haken, on a number of occasions, frankly referred to a complete absence of recollection on a number of matters. He could not, for example, recall when he was told the “operation” would be carried out, the content of the conversations between Mr Landini and police on the expressway, could not recall the Ford Landau being searched at all or drugs being found in it. When he gave evidence before the Royal Commission, he also said in cross-examination he did not recall the Ford Landau being searched 
     
      
    265 He was asked where he was standing when the boot of the Mercedes was searched and he said “Again, Mr Maconachie, I have no independent recollection of where I was at that particular time …”. 
     
      
    266 At this point, I record that I closely observed Mr Haken during the course of his evidence. The extent to which demeanour is of value in assessing the truthfulness of a witness has, of course, been the subject of discussion in academic and other literature. It is sufficient to state that, in at least some cases, it will be of limited value.  
     
      
    267 In these proceedings, he gave evidence by video link from a remote location. That too is to be taken into account for it can impact on the ability to assess a witness in those circumstances as against one who is present in the court room. That said, there was nothing that I noted that made it difficult to see or hear Mr Haken on the occasions he gave evidence. 
     
      
    268 The assessment I made of him was a favourable one. On several occasions, he emphasised the limitations on the extent of his recollection and did so in a manner that clearly conveyed that he was not prepared to go further than his recollection permitted. In that respect and generally, he conveyed an impression of objectivity and appeared to give evidence in a reasonably measured and reasonable fashion and without any signs of embellishment or partiality to the plaintiff or any form of animus towards his former colleagues. 
     
      
    269 It was put to Mr Haken in cross-examination that intelligence had been received by police that Mr Landini was going to transport drugs to Sydney on 15 January 1980. He said he did not recall being told of any such information. When it was suggested to him that it was on the basis of such information that it was anticipated that Landini would use the expressway, he repeated that he had no knowledge of such intelligence but was prepared to concede that it was possible. 
     
      
    270 In the statement of Mr Ross, there is reference to information having been received on the morning of 15 January 1980 of an intended drug supply involving the plaintiff. It is, of course, necessary to consider whether there is a reasonable possibility that such an account was false and formed part of a plan to fabricate evidence. On the other hand, a “tip-off”, whilst it may be seen as a fortuitous event, is not a fanciful possibility, police sometimes receiving valuable information from informers. 
     
      
       
      (j) Evidence called by the State of New South Wales 
       
      
    271 The evidence of Ross, Leary, Gardiner and Chidgey was based on the statements each prepared in 1980. The cross-examination dealt with the following matters:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The planning and lead up events to the arrest. 
       
       
      (2) The persons present and their roles and participation. 
       
       
      (3) The events involving the detention of the plaintiff’s car on the freeway and the search of the boot of the Mercedes and the claimed finding of six bags of heroin. 
       
       
      (4) The events at the plaintiff’s home including the search of the premises, the persons there present and the search of the Ford Landau and the claimed finding of four bags of heroin in the boot of the Ford vehicle. 
       
       
      (5) The statements attributed to the plaintiff including statements in the nature of admissions. 
       
       
      (6) The compiling of notes (Exhibit W) of events by police. 
       
       
      (7) The question as to whether a search warrant had been issued. 
       
       
      (8) The source of information that precipitated the operation leading to the plaintiff’s arrest. 
       
       
      (9) The events surrounding the committal proceedings and the plaintiff’s later change in his plea. 
       
       
      (k) Mr Gardiner 
       
      
    272 The first defendant called Mr Gardiner who originally joined the Police Force in 1969. At the time of giving evidence, he had changed occupation and was a lorry owner/driver operating a concrete truck at Boral. 
     
      
    273 In 1979, he was transferred to the Drug Squad and remained there until early 1981. He said he was transferred in February or March 1981 from the Drug Squad which he took as a “downward move”. He said Mr Leary was also transferred. Although he did not hold Mr Knox responsible for the transfer, he said when he confronted him about the transfer he said he denied knowledge of the reasons for it. He resigned from the Police Force in December 1982 when he purchased a brewery truck to take up his present occupation. 
     
      
    274 He said that, as at January 1980, he was very happy at the Drug Squad but that he did not have a clear recollection of all events occurring in January 1980. He said he recalled the plaintiff and he recalled his arrest in January 1980. 
     
      
    275 He said he only became aware of Mr Haken’s allegation about the plaintiff’s arrest in 1980 to the Royal Commission when interviewed in 2005 for the purposes of the present proceedings. 
     
      
    276 He said that prior to the arrest, he had over some weeks or possibly for a month, been involved in surveillance on numerous occasions of the plaintiff’s residence at Leonay pursuant to orders given to him. The purpose of the surveillance was to record comings and goings of vehicles and people to the plaintiff’s premises. He recalled running past the plaintiff’s premises on at least one occasion in order to make observations. 
     
      
    277 He said he could only vaguely recall the plaintiff’s arrest. He said that he only became aware that an arrest of the plaintiff would be attempted when the plaintiff’s vehicle was pulled over the freeway. He had no recollection prior to that time of any plan to arrest him. 
     
      
    278 He said that he recalled being in the police car which was parked in proximity to the plaintiff’s house. He said he believed that he was with Detective Sergeant Knox and Detective Senior Constable Leary at that time. 
     
      
    279 Mr Gardiner said that he recalled that after some time whilst maintaining surveillance he saw a cream or white coloured car leave the plaintiff’s driveway. The police car then moved off and followed the plaintiff’s vehicle. He said that these events occurred in the afternoon on the day in question. He recalled the plaintiff’s vehicle being stopped and that the passenger seat of it was occupied by a female and the driver’s seat by the plaintiff. 
     
      
    280 He said that he did not recall anything being said at this early point in time. The plaintiff, according to him, was wearing a light coloured open necked sports shirt, trousers and lightly coloured soft casual type shoes. He could not recall anything being done in terms of the interior of the car whilst it was parked on the F4 but did recall the boot of the vehicle at some stage in the upward position. 
     
      
    281 His next recollection was being at the back of the plaintiff’s house. He said he recalled being confronted by a large dog which he described and that it was “not very friendly”. 
     
      
    282 Mr Gardiner said that he recalled seeing in a carport what he described as an American style black sedan sports car and he recalled entering the house for the purposes of undertaking a search. He said he could not recall anything about a search warrant. He recalled that there were people at the house but could not recall how many. 
     
      
    283 Mr Gardiner said that there were six officers involved in the operation in January 1980, being Knox, Leary, Ross, Chidgey, Haken and himself. He said they constituted two teams. He said that Mr Ross was the leader of what he described as the second team and Mr Knox was the leader of his team. He said that he was the most junior officer on the team of which he was a member and that Mr Knox was then Detective Sergeant Third Class and Mr Ross a Senior Constable who he described as “bordering on third class sergeant”. Next in line in seniority on his team was Haken, himself and Chidgey. 
     
      
    284 He said that he had worked with Mr Knox for about seven months prior to the plaintiff’s arrest. 
     
      
    285 Mr Gardiner gave evidence of the practice followed in the Drug Squad in 1980 with respect to recording events occurring in the course of investigations. He explained that he had a notebook but not everybody invariably made their own notes. He said there was a system whereby notes were typed as to the recollection of events that had occurred at the time of arrest and the circumstances surrounding the arrest. He said there was one set of notes and that these would stay with the brief and respective officers would make their statements from the notes. 
     
      
    286 He was shown a copy of the notes (p.26 in Exhibit W) entitled “Notes re Landini” and bearing dated “15.1.80 – 11.40 pm”. 
     
      
    287 Mr Gardiner said that the notes would be made from the recollection of events of those involved and that somebody would collate all of that into one document. 
     
      
    288 In cross-examination, Mr Gardiner was questioned on a number of matters including:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The practice in relation to notebooks and the production of statements for use in proceedings. 
       
       
      (2) Mr Gardiner’s recollection of events concerning the surveillance of the plaintiff’s home and the events leading to his arrest. 
       
       
      (3) The search of the Ford Landau and the plaintiff’s home. 
       
       
      (4) The production of facts sheets for use on bail applications. 
       
       
      (5) The circumstances surrounding the plaintiff’s car being stopped on the freeway and the events leading to the claimed discovery of drugs in the boot of the plaintiff’s car. 
       
       
      (6) The question of the  
      “loading” 
       of the plaintiff. 
       
      
    289 In cross-examination, he was asked (t.2316):- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. … is it your recollection that the reason that two groups of police were going to Landini’s home was because of information received by Detective Senior Constable Ross? 
         
        A. That’s correct.” 
        
       
      
    290 Mr Gardiner said that he had never dealt with the plaintiff prior to his arrest on 15 January 1980. He agreed when it was put to him that the only information he was aware of had come through other police. 
     
      
    291 He said he had no recollection of the plaintiff saying, whilst standing by the freeway, that he had seen officers in a car parked near his home and did not recall him saying “I reckon you’re going to try and load me up here. That’s why you pulled me up here”. 
     
      
    292 In relation to the plaintiff’s case that there was, in effect, a conspiracy involving the six police officers to “load” the plaintiff, the cross-examination of Mr Gardiner was brief and in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. In the way you have told us. Could I suggest to you earlier in the day or the day before there were discussions between you and Mr Haken and the 3 or 4 officers in relation to the loading of Mr Landini?  
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Prior to going to Penrith?  
         
        A. I said no.” 
        
       
      
    293 Mr Gardiner denied in cross-examination that police had a number of bags of heroin in their possession prior to the plaintiff’s arrest and that they intended to use them to “load” the plaintiff. 
     
      
    294 The plaintiff’s recollection of events was that, after he had been pulled over on the F4, he said that he thought it was Mr Gardiner who had opened the boot of his Mercedes vehicle and that after he did that Mr Gardiner said “Look what we’ve got here”. That account, according to Mr Ross and Mr Chidgey is not correct. In Mr Ross’ statement of 16 January 1980 (Exhibit 30), he said that he was he and Detective Chidgey who carried out the search of the boot and that it was he, Ross, who found six plastic bags containing white powder in the toe of a running shoe. Mr Chidgey’s statement of the same date (Exhibit 31) gave the same account. 
     
      
    295 In cross-examination it was not expressly put to Mr Gardiner that it was he and not Mr Ross who took the plastic bags from the running shoe. It was, however, in cross-examination the following matters were raised:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What happened then was that one of you pulled out a running shoe and said words to the effect, ‘look what I’ve got’, do you recall that? 
         
        A. I don’t recall it, but I’ve read it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Tell us again what you recollect about the drugs being produced? 
         
        A. I didn’t say anything about the drugs being produced. What I said was in my evidence earlier at some stage, I had the impression that the boot of the Mercedes, white or cream, being opened. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you recall, don’t you, that shortly thereafter, drugs were produced? 
         
        A. I don’t recall that.” 
        
       
      
    296 In his statement (Exhibit 41), Mr Gardiner had recorded that after arriving at the plaintiff’s home, he opened the boot of the Ford Landau and that Mr Chidgey commenced searching inside the car whilst he searched the boot area. He said he recorded that in a well at the side of the boot he found four plastic bags containing white powder and handed them to Detective Ross who was standing behind him. Detective Ross, according to Mr Chidgey’s statement, said to the plaintiff “this looks the same as the other” to which the plaintiff said “I’m not saying anything about it”. 
     
      
    297 Mr Gardiner was cross-examined on police procedure. He did not know whether or not the plastic bags in question were capable of retaining fingerprints but accepted that, given the potential seriousness of the offence by reason of the quantity of heroin “found”, police would start the procedure of fingerprinting materials seized and that an experienced officer would not handle such materials. 
     
      
    298 It was also put to Mr Gardiner that he was not making a genuine attempt to recall events leading to and following the arrest of the plaintiff. He totally rejected that proposition. 
     
      
    299 Mr Gardiner made it clear that although his statement recorded the fact that he had located drugs in the boot of the Ford Landau, he, at the time of giving evidence, had no recollection of those events, adding:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The difference between what you remember now and what’s in your statement is the difficulty I am in.” 
        
       
      
    300 Mr Gardiner agreed in cross-examination that the events on the F4 and at the plaintiff’s home and any admissions made by him could have been entered in an official notebook at the scene, adding “… should someone have produced a notebook I guess they could have recorded it. I would assume that would have been at the direction of one of the bosses”. He repeated that recollections were later recorded in the notes referred to above and that statements were then prepared by reference to the notes. 
     
      
       
      (l) Mr Leary 
       
      
    301 Mr Michael Leary joined the Drug Squad in 1980. As at that time, he had been in the Police Service for some 11 to 12 years. He said, in all, he spent approximately 20 years in the Police Service and before he joined the Drug Squad, he was with the Armed Hold Up Squad. 
     
      
    302 As at January 1980 he had only been with the Drug Squad for some days. He was from that time working with Detective Sergeant Knox and Detective Gardiner. 
     
      
    303 He had left the Police Service many years ago and, at the time of giving evidence, he was the general manager of a rugby league club. 
     
      
    304 Mr Leary said that he recalled the plaintiff’s arrest. 
     
      
    305 On the day of the plaintiff’s arrest, he had been at Parramatta Court and was picked up by car by Detective Sergeant Knox and Gardiner and travelled to Leonay. He said that the purpose of picking him up was “to do observation on the premises of Landini”. He repeated that, as he understood it, the only purpose of them travelling to Leonay was to carry out observations on the premises. He indicated on Exhibit 26B the position taken up for the purpose of making observations. 
     
      
    306 He saw the plaintiff’s vehicle leave and drive along the expressway and at some point a police car pulled the plaintiff’s vehicle over to a stop. He said this occurred in the late afternoon of 15 January 1980. 
     
      
    307 He said he got out of the car and saw a search of the plaintiff’s vehicle being undertaken. He could not recall who searched it but recalled that the boot of the car was searched. He said that the front seat and the rear of the vehicle were also searched. 
     
      
    308 He recalled seeing a police officer (he could not recall who it was) had bags of white powder. He said he did not hear anything said at the scene at the expressway. 
     
      
    309 Thereafter, the police drove to the plaintiff’s home. He said that he saw a female in the passenger seat of the plaintiff’s car and that she had remained in the motor vehicle whilst it was stationary on the freeway. 
     
      
    310 At the plaintiff’s home, he saw a vehicle parked in the garage and saw police search it and find plastic bags of white powder. He said that police then gained entry to the premises and he participated in a search of them. He said that he had been told to search the bedrooms or anywhere where he thought it was necessary to search. He said that he did not find anything. He also said that he could not be certain as to whether a search warrant had issued and he did not see one. Some time later, Mr Knox, Mr Gardiner and himself returned to the CIB. Mr Leary said that he did not find anything having searched the bedrooms in the house. 
     
      
    311 When asked, Mr Leary said that he was not certain as to whether a search warrant had issued as at this time. He said that he did not see a search warrant. 
     
      
    312 In evidence in chief, he was shown his statement dated 28 June 1983 (Exhibit W). He said that he could not recall making the statement. He said that his “practice” in making statements was to refer to his diary which he wrote up each day. The detective’s diary was sometimes called “a duty book”. He said that he had also had access to the police brief held at the Drug Squad when making a statement. It had all other police officers statements on it as well as the charge sheet, the facts sheet and the criminal information report. 
     
      
    313 He identified “notes re Landini” at pp.26 and 27 of Exhibit W as being the type of document to which reference would be made when preparing statements. 
     
      
    314 Mr Leary was shown Exhibit 27 which is a copy of a Crime Information Report dated 15 January 1980 and referring to Mr Leary by name. The document indicated the plaintiff was arrested at 6.00 pm on 15 January 1980 and recorded the names of Messrs Ross, Knox, Leary, Gardiner, Chidgey and Haken from the Drug Squad as being the persons who effected the arrest. The report records as “information” the following:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        INFORMATION 
         shortly prior to 6.00 pm on 15 January, 1980 the offender was observed driving his Mercedes Benz motor vehicle on the F4 Freeway, Penrith. His vehicle was stopped by above members of the Drug Squad and upon making a search of the boot area of the car, 6 bags of heroin were located. As a result, the offender was then taken to his residence at 48 Parklands Avenue, Emu Plains where upon making a search of another vehicle in the garage a further four bags of heroin were located. The offender was then conveyed to the Drug Squad Office, and further interviewed and charged with the abovementioned matters. 
        
       
       
        
        Quantity of heroin ceased 111.97 grams. Quantity of Hash. 24.85 grams.” 
        
       
      
    315 Mr Leary said that he typed the last-mentioned document from information that he had been given by police involved in the arrest. 
     
      
    316 In cross-examination, Mr Leary said that he resigned from the Police Force in 1985 and he then took up a business opportunity in the transport industry. 
     
      
    317 Mr Leary agreed that if a suspect was being interviewed at the scene of the arrest, he would soon after make notes of anything that was said by him or her and that the record in his book would both form an important record of events and an attempt would be made to have the suspect sign the record as to its veracity. This, he agreed, would operate in fairness to the defendant but would also provide safeguards to police. He said that the notes in the book could be completed upon return to the CIB and then provided to the suspect to read through. 
     
      
    318 Mr Leary said that Mr Landini was interviewed at the CIB by Mr Knox. 
     
      
    319 When asked as to whether he understood the trip to Leonay involved merely a “surveillance operation” or something more, he said that it was “similar to what I had done previously as a surveillance operation”. When asked as to why the routine surveillance operation would require two cars and six police he stated that he did not know. He agreed that the Drug Squad had access to “observation police” who were specially trained. 
     
      
    320 He agreed that wherever possible in drug investigations, police endeavoured to obtain corroboration of anything relevant found in the course of investigations. He agreed that this would include objects from which fingerprint evidence might be obtained. He further agreed that a plastic bag, a pane of glass or something with a smooth surface was capable of carrying a print. He said, however, that he was not certain whether prints could be obtained from plastic bags. 
     
      
    321 In relation to his statement made in 1983, there was no reference in it to having seen the Ford vehicle searched at the plaintiff’s home and drugs produced from it. He was unable to explain why there had been no such reference in his statement. 
     
      
    322 Mr Leary was questioned as to why police would intervene to stop Mr Landini in his vehicle rather than follow him with a view to determining the intended recipient of any supply of drugs. He agreed that one object of police work was to “catch as many people as you can supplying drugs”. He did, however, later qualify his evidence by saying that there had been occasions when suspects had been followed but had been lost. He also agreed that the number of bags of heroin found indicated a major supply operation. 
     
      
    323 When it was put to him in cross-examination that he had been given a briefing by either Mr Knox or Mr Ross in relation to the matter, he replied “no I didn’t”. He said, as he had said earlier, that “my only thoughts were that we were going to Leonay to do observations”. 
     
      
    324 Mr Leary confirmed that he did not see a search warrant in relation to the search of the plaintiff’s premises. He said that if a warrant had been in existence, there would be some reference in the records to that effect and that there would be expected to be a reference to the fact that a search warrant had been executed if that had been done. He agreed that reference could be expected to be found in the narrative contained in the relevant criminal intelligence report. He agreed that there was no reference in the relevant criminal investigation report to such a matter. 
     
      
    325 It was put to him:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The position was that the raid on Mr Landini’s home at Leonay was a planned raid by yourself and the other five police, wasn’t it? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And not only was it planned, it was also part of the plan to fabricate evidence by planting drugs on Mr Landini? 
         
        A. No.” 
        
       
       
      (m) Mr Ross 
       
      
    326 Mr Glen Ross had served with the New South Wales Police Service from 1965 until he retired on 31 December 2001. At the time of his retirement, he was a Detective Inspector of Police. 
     
      
    327 He stated that he had, during his career, inter alia, worked at the Northern Beaches for a while, Manly, Collaroy and Dee Why, and was transferred to the Drug Squad at the CIB in late 1973 or early 1974. He undertook a detective’s course in 1973. He remained working there until 1980. In all, he worked as a member of the Drug Squad for about seven years. He said that, so far as he recalled, he left in late 1980 or early 1981 and went to Central Detectives as a Detective Sergeant. In 1985, he returned to the CIB. 
     
      
    328 In 1995, he was promoted to the position of Detective Inspector attached to Crime Agencies and remained in that position until 2001. Towards the end of his career, he undertook liaison work with Corrective Services for a period of time. 
     
      
    329 He said that in 1980 he was a Detective Senior Constable in the Drug Squad. There were three members in a team. In January 1980, the team comprised himself, Detective Senior Constable Chidgey and Haken. 
     
      
    330 In early January 1980, he said he knew Mr Landini but he had not met him. He said he was well-known as a drug dealer and drug runner and had a criminal record. He said that there was a fair amount of “intelligence” on him. 
     
      
    331 Mr Ross said that he had refreshed his memory from a statement prepared by him and from a copy of the depositions of his evidence given in committal proceedings. He said that he recalled that on the morning of 15 January 1980, he took a phone call in the Drug Squad office from a person who wished to speak to Sergeant Knox. Sergeant Knox was not available at that time and the person concerned asked to speak to him, Mr Ross. 
     
      
    332 He said that he believed he remembered who the person (a male) who phoned was. He said he knew the person. When asked what he told him, he said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “As far as I can recall, he told me that a drug transaction was to take place that afternoon. I think there was a particular time mentioned that I can’t remember what it was, that Mr Landini was the person supplying the drugs and I don’t believe that there was a location mentioned or known of where it was about to take place.” 
        
       
      
    333 He said that prior to the telephone call he said he had no knowledge of any event such as had been referred to in the telephone call. 
     
      
    334 He said that as far as he could remember, that when Sergeant Knox became available he discussed the matter with him. He said that although his memory was vague “… it was arranged that we – Sergeant Knox asked for my group to give him some assistance to take observations of Mr Landini’s then premises and with a view to, if he left there at a particular time of the day to stopping the vehicle and searching it”. 
     
      
    335 In cross-examination, Mr Ross was asked:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you glean from that conversation that ordinarily the man who you spoke to on the phone was an informant of Sgt Knox’s? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But was prepared to give you the same information? 
         
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    336 Mr Ross said in cross-examination that he imparted what he had been told by the informant to Sergeant Knox and the day on which the informant rang. 
     
      
    337 Mr Ross was also cross-examined on evidence that Sergeant Knox had given about the matter in the committal. The transcript of the committal proceedings held on 20 August 1980 was admitted as evidence in the plaintiff’s case and marked as Exhibit AU. Mr Knox gave evidence in cross-examination that he had received information on the morning of 15 January 1980. He said the information had been received by another police officer.  
     
      
    338 Mr Ross said that he thought that he had originally met up with Mr Knox and his team in the car park at the Leonay Golf Club. He said that they were in radio communication with one another. He said that the only independent recollection he had of being anywhere else was when Mr Knox signalled for the Mercedes car, driven by the plaintiff on the F4, to pull over. He then gave the following account:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I can recall Sergeant Knox signalling for the Mercedes car to pull over. I can recall that it was driven by the plaintiff. I can recall there was a female passenger in the car. I can recall standing at the open boot of the Mercedes with another detective, who I think was Detective Chidgey. I can remember locating white powder in a training shoe in the boot of the vehicle. I can remember being at the premises then occupied by the plaintiff and being in either a carport or a garage of some kind and seeing Detective Gardiner locate some white powder in the boot of another vehicle. I can remember that at those premises there was at least one other male person. 
        
       
       
        
        I can remember there was a committal proceedings held, I think it was then the Central Court of Petty Sessions or might have been the Local Court … and during the course of cross-examination at the committal proceedings there was an allegation put that the drugs had been planted, that was denied and is still denied. And I can remember that a group of us, I couldn’t tell you the date, went to the District Court prepared for a trial and the plaintiff pleaded guilty. That’s about the extent of what I can remember.” 
         (transcript 12 March 2007, p.2482 to 2483) 
        
       
      
    339 Mr Ross gave evidence in the committal proceedings, the transcript of which is Exhibit AU in the present proceedings. Mr Ross, in those proceedings, said that he placed the six bags of heroin found in the running shoe in the boot of the Mercedes in his right hand side pocket of the jeans that he was wearing and that they remained there until he took the plaintiff to Central Police Station to charge him and then handed them to the station sergeant. The lack of precautions to preserve the integrity of the bags for fingerprinting was relied upon by the plaintiff in these proceedings as but one fact said to support the proposition that this was an operation that was not conducted with the precautions that would be expected with a legitimate police operation. 
     
      
    340 Mr Ross gave evidence as to his practice in note keeping. He said that he was not in the habit of making contemporaneous notes “so far as conversation was concerned because I didn’t have the ability to write shorthand or anything else. So usually I made notes as soon as practicable, as soon as possible after any conversation took place or any event to place. And on some occasions that would be in a notebook, if that was the most convenient place to make it or, as I said before, if a typewriter was available I might make it on a typewriter” (at p.2484). 
     
      
    341 He said in evidence that he recalled an allegation being made during the committal proceedings that the drugs had been planted, which he said was denied and “is still denied”. 
     
      
    342 Mr Maconachie on behalf of the State put to Mr Ross evidence given by Mr Haken (transcript p.634, line 38) in which he alleged that Mr Ross had said that the plaintiff was going to be loaded up and charged. When asked as to whether he said that to Mr Haken, he replied “No. That’s nonsense”. 
     
      
    343 Mr Ross also denied that he had given Mr Haken a plastic bag containing white powder at the Drug Squad prior to the arrest. He denied saying to Mr Haken that a bag of heroin had been located on a roof of a building in the Eastern Suburbs and had been handed in by a civilian. 
     
      
    344 He denied telling Mr Haken or hearing anyone tell Mr Haken to dilute white powder and place it into small plastic bags. He specifically denied telling Mr Haken to produce five gram bags nor did he hear any such instruction given to Mr Haken. He further said that he did not see Mr Haken in the offices of the Drug Squad before the arrest of Mr Landini on 15 January 1980 preparing bags of white powder. 
     
      
    345 Mr Ross confirmed that Mr Knox at the time was his superior and had been in overall charge of both teams, although he, Mr Ross, was the leader of one team on the day of the plaintiff’s arrest. He said that he gleaned from the conversation with the person on the phone who had asked to speak to Mr Knox that that person was an informer of Mr Knox. He said, however, that the person had been prepared to give him, Mr Ross, the “information”. 
     
      
    346 In cross-examination, Mr Ross agreed that the sale at street level was often in small amounts placed in foils or some similar packaging. The plastic bags said to have been found in the plaintiff’s boot were of a quantity that suggested that it was more likely intended for an intermediate seller or supplier. He agreed that if police were able to follow Mr Landini to the recipient, then the intermediate supplier could be identified. This, of course, is not what happened, the plaintiff having been stopped on the freeway. 
     
      
    347 Mr Ross said that he did not himself make any surveillance observations on the plaintiff from the police car and that if any officer undertaking surveillance that day had noted Mr Landini open the boot of his car and place anything in it he would have expected that such an observation would have been recorded in the notes in Exhibit W, pp.26 to 27. He agreed that there had been no note made of such an event occurring.  
     
      
    348 He agreed that if no observation had been made of the plaintiff placing anything in the boot of his car, he would not be able to assume at the time the Mercedes was stopped on the freeway that there were drugs in the boot of the car. He agreed that at the time of pulling the plaintiff’s car to a stop, he did not know whether there were drugs in the car. It was put to him:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Well Mr Ross, if you couldn’t assume that why would you pull his car over before it travelled to Sydney? 
         
        A. Well I think the reason it was pulled over was that we had no ability to follow the vehicle for any distance. There was no – as far as I can recall – there was no surveillance teams available, it was short notice, the plaintiff had a reputation as being very difficult to follow and ultimately, the decision how the operation was carried out would have been made by Mr Knox.” 
        
       
      
    349 Mr Ross denied that he and or police had placed the heroin in the plaintiff’s car. 
     
      
       
      (n) Mr Knox 
       
      
    350 Mr Knox was not called in the present proceedings to give evidence. The first defendant tendered medical evidence which was not challenged. Mr Knox, by reason of a psychological disability, was not in a position to give evidence. It is noted that he had, at an early stage of the proceedings, attended Court and was, for a time, present in the hearing room before being requested to wait outside. 
     
      
    351 The medical evidence was not challenged by the plaintiff and, accordingly, I proceed upon the basis that the failure to call Mr Knox was explained as wholly related to his medical condition. 
     
      
    352 Mr Knox did give evidence at the committal hearing on 20 August 1980. The depositions in relation to his evidence were tendered in the present proceedings (Exhibit AU). On that occasion, he gave evidence that when the plaintiff was stopped on the freeway, he said to him “I am Detective Sergeant Knox, we are from the Drug Squad, we have received information this car is carrying heroin, and I intend to search it”. Mr Knox said that he received the information through another police officer and he believed that police officer had received information from another person, not being a police officer. He said that other person, he believed, was an informant of Mr Ross. 
     
      
    353 Mr Knox said in the committal proceedings that he had been aware that Mr Landini had resided at the Leonay address as he had seen him there previously “over a number of months” by which he clarified he meant of a 12 month period before then. He knew that that plaintiff had a criminal record. 
     
      
    354 Mr Knox’s evidence was that he had never previously met the plaintiff. Mr Knox additionally said that he did not see the bags of heroin removed from the boot but saw them shortly thereafter. Mr Conomos of counsel put to him in cross-examination at the committal hearing that there were only two explanations for the presence of the bags of heroin in the boot. The first was that police planted the bags there and pulled them out or the second was that Mr Landini had them in the boot of his car. Mr Knox agreed. He said that over a period of months, the plaintiff and others had been the subject of inquiries. In the course of cross-examination, Mr Conomos put to Mr Knox:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. I put it to you that you police had made up your minds that on this particular day he was going to be arrested and he was going to be brought into the CIB. What do you say about that? 
         
        A. That is not true … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I put it to you officer that you had in your possession or under your control the heroin which is exhibited here under MFI A and B when you left the CIB on 15 January 1980 to go towards the defendant’s premises at Emu Plains, what do you say about that? 
         
        A. No, I think it is ridiculous.” 
        
       
      
    355 At the hearing on the first day, Mr Conomos called for the search warrant said by Mr Knox to have been taken out for the purposes of searching the plaintiff’s premises. Mr Ross, in the course of his evidence, said that he had inquiries made to locate the search warrant. He said that, to his knowledge, no warrant had been found. He said that he was not sure whether a warrant had been taken out on 15 January 1980. He said inquiries had been made at the Central Court of Petty Sessions to see if a duplicate of the information was present but as far as he was aware, the inquiries were fruitless. He said he did not know whether any warrant was sworn at the Central Court of Petty Sessions, although he said it was normal for search warrants to be sought from there. 
     
      
       
      (o) Mr Chidgey 
       
      
    356 Mr Chidgey, at the date of giving evidence in the present proceedings, held the position of Superintendent of Police. He has been the Regional Operations Manager attached to the South West Regional Crime Squad, Bankstown. 
     
      
    357 He stated that his present position involves various local area commands.  
     
      
    358 He joined the Police Force in February 1968 at the age of 16 years. He was initially posted to Redfern on general duties for about three years and then commenced as a plain clothes officer in relation to criminal investigation duties. He went to 21st Division and in about 1979 was designated as a detective. He said that he worked for a short time, about six months, at the Drug Squad whilst at 21st Division. 
     
      
    359 He said that he had been with the Drug Squad approximately 18 months before the plaintiff’s arrest. 
     
      
    360 After leaving the Drug Squad he was in charge of the detectives’ office at Campsie then holding the rank of Senior Sergeant. He was there for about two years. 
     
      
    361 He was then posted as Duty Officer at Newtown holding the rank of Inspector and was there for approximately two years. He then went to Campsie as the Crime Manager of Campsie as Chief Inspector. He held that position for approximately six years. 
     
      
    362 He then went to the Central Metropolitan Regional Office as Operations Manager for a short period holding the rank of Superintendent before being transferred to the position of Operations Manager held at the time of giving evidence. 
     
      
    363 Mr Chidgey gave an account of events leading to the arrest of the plaintiff. He said he had been told, either by Knox or Ross, that police had an operation in the Emu Plains area. He was told the target’s name and that they would travel to Emu Plains where the briefing would take place and observations undertaken. He said that he was told that the plaintiff would be travelling towards Sydney and that “the information” was that he would have a quantity of heroin with him at the time. He went out to Leonay with Knox, Leary, Gardiner, Haken and Ross. Observations were conducted by other police but not by himself. He said that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “As a result of information we received the vehicle was stopped containing Mr Landini … a search was conducted of the vehicle, a quantity of white powder believed to be heroin was located in that vehicle in the boot”. He was taken back to a house at Emu Plains, a search warrant was executed there, a further quantity of heroin was located in another vehicle, in the garage, a search was also conducted at the house and himself, I think …” 
        
       
      
    364 The evidence referred to in the preceding paragraph is more detailed than that contained in his statement dated 16 January 1980 (part of Exhibit W). He said that he had seen his statement made in 1980. There is no reference in it to being told that the plaintiff would be travelling towards Sydney and that the information received indicated that the plaintiff would have heroin with him. He did refer in the statement of Mr Ross that police had received information to that effect. 
     
      
    365 He stated that parts of the statement were pointed out to him in conference but he did not believe that that had assisted in refreshing his recollection. He said he had not seen any other documents made by him at the time apart from his statement of 16 January 1980. 
     
      
    366 In relation to the plaintiff’s Mercedes vehicle, he said “I was in the vicinity of the boot, or certainly the back of the vehicle. I recall white powder being found, who found it or if in fact I found it, I can’t recall”. 
     
      
    367 Although he mentioned the search warrant in the course of his evidence, he said that he did not remember anything about a warrant. He said, however:- 
     
      
       
        
        “My recollection is we had a search warrant, it’s 27 years have passed and I just can’t remember if I saw it or not. At that time we could execute up to three or four search warrants a day. I just can’t remember.” 
        
       
      
    368 Mr Chidgey said that the officer in charge of the operation was Mr Ross and that, in relation to the six officers involved in the operation, he was “right at the bottom”. 
     
      
    369 In cross-examination, he said his recollection was that Mr Ross had been given the task of looking at the activities of the plaintiff and from that the particular operation evolved “… from information given to, I believe, Knox at the time and possibly Ross”. He added “Landini, as far as the New South Wales Police were concerned at that particular time, was very, very well known and certainly there was a lot of information in relation to his involvement in organised crime”. 
     
      
    370 In relation to information that had been received by police that he understood led to the operation involving the plaintiff, he said “… at that particular time, being the most junior person on the team, it would have been a need to know situation and I would have been told at the latest possible time”. 
     
      
    371 Mr Chidgey refuted the suggestion that his statement was other than as a record of his own observations:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Was it your position to blindly record in your statement precisely what another officer told you to say or gave you to type up? 
         
        A. In answer to that question, I can say I wouldn’t do that. I’ve never done it and I didn’t do it on this occasion. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I suggest to you that what you did, in fact, was to blindly type in your statement precisely what Detective Ross had given you to do, that’s correct isn’t it? 
         
        A. Sir, I didn’t do that. I’ve never done that. I type my own statement, sign my own statement. What I put in that statement is my recollection of what I saw and what I did and what I heard.” 
        
       
      
    372 He acknowledged that he may have used Mr Ross’ statement in compiling his own but that “… if it wasn’t a true reflection of what I did or what I heard, I obviously wouldn’t have put that in my statement”. His statement, when compared to Mr Ross’ statement, reveals that much of it is word for word the same as Mr Ross’ statement. Mr Ross being the more senior officer, it is reasonable to assume that Mr Ross made his statement first and it was used to help Mr Chidgey prepare his own statement. 
     
      
    373 Mr Chidgey rejected when put to him that the plaintiff had been “loaded up”:-

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hulme J. 
     
      
    2 HULME J: In this matter I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of Hidden J and am indebted to his Honour for the account of the facts and the circumstances of the Applicant’s offending.  
     
      
    3 However, I am unable to agree with what his Honour proposes as to the disposition of the appeal. In my view it should be dismissed. 
     
      
    4 I agree that the sentencing judge may have overlooked the fact that the accumulation of sentences resulted in a non-parole period that exceeded the 75% ratio referred to in s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and which was reflected in the individual sentences imposed. However, s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act requires this Court to dismiss an appeal unless persuaded that some other less severe sentence is warranted and should have been passed. I am not so satisfied. Indeed I am persuaded to the contrary. 
     
      
    5 Facts referred to by Hidden J – that the Applicant had possession of 53.93 grams of methylamphetamine, 90 grams of cannabis, a set of scales several resealable bags, a stolen DVD player, digital camera and fishing reel, a stolen commodore sedan, and $17,900 in cash - lead inevitably to the conclusion that the Applicant was a serious operator in the business of drug dealing. His criminal record indicates that he has little regard for the law and the fact that he was on a bond at the time of the subject offences demonstrates that he has no regard for court orders or his own undertaking to be of good behaviour. 
     
      
    6 McLoughlin DCJ observed that the supply of methylamphetamine fuels the commission of crime and antisocial behaviour in the community and is well recognised for the social and psychological harm that it does. His Honour could well have expressed himself by reference to the destruction the drug inflicts on the lives of many users and those on whose lives users impact. 
     
      
    7 Against the statutory maximum of 15 years imprisonment for the Applicant’s supply offence, the sentencing judge’s starting point of 3 years and 4 months for an offender who pleaded not guilty was by no means high. Drug dealing for profit is conscious deliberate criminality where it is difficult to believe that there is not some weighing up of the risks and benefits and advantages and disadvantages. It behoves the courts to ensure that the disadvantages are substantial. As Wood J remarked in Schaal (unreported, NSWSC, 8 September 1989), “just as those stakes (in the drug trade) are high, so, however, must be the risks if caught”.  
     
      
    8 Nor does the addition of merely one year to this on account of the offences on the Form 1 suggest undue weight was given to the considerations of personal deterrence and retribution in the sentencing for the offence charged - the limited use to which, according to the decision of this Court in Attorney-General’s Application under s37 of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 at 156, the offences on the Form 1 can be put. Indeed, I suspect that many in the community would think that, having regard to the number and seriousness of those offences, the weight given to personal deterrence and retribution was small.  
     
      
    9 As I said, I am satisfied that no lesser sentence should have been imposed. I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.10 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Gary Noel Stevens, pleaded guilty in the District Court to two counts on an indictment:  
     
      
       
        
        (1) Supplying methylamphetamine, an offence under s25(1) of the  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act  
        1985 which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years imprisonment; 
         
        (2) Possessing a prohibited firearm without a licence or permit, an offence under s7(1) of the  
        Firearms Act 
         1996, carrying a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 3 years. 
        
       
       
      He asked the sentencing Judge, when sentencing him for the first count, to take into account five offences on a Form 1: a further offence of supplying amphetamine, two offences of goods in custody, receiving a stolen motor vehicle and possessing a quantity of cannabis.  
       
      
    11 On the second count he was sentenced to imprisonment for 1 year and 8 months, comprising a non-parole period of 15 months and a balance of term of 5 months, commencing on 23 December 2005. On the first count, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years and 8 months, comprising a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months and a balance of term of 11 months, commencing on 23 December 2006. I shall explain later how those somewhat unusual figures were arrived at. The overall sentence, then, was imprisonment for 4 years and 8 months with an effective non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months, dating from 23 December 2005. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against those sentences. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    12 At the relevant time the applicant was living on a rural property at Possum Brush with his partner, Charesse Hyde. On 13 April 2004 police executed a search warrant at the property. Ms Hyde was present but the applicant was not. In the freezer compartment of the refrigerator they found a re-sealable plastic bag containing a substance which, on later analysis, proved to be 2.13g of methylamphetamine. This gave rise to the first charge on the Form 1, described as supplying amphetamine. Ms Hyde indicated to police some items which she believed to have been stolen, including a DVD player, a digital camera and a fishing reel. Those specified items were the subject of the second charge on the Form 1, goods in custody. 
     
      
    13 Police then went to a property in the same area occupied by Rick and Wendy Lang, where they found a Holden commodore sedan which the applicant had left there. It had been stolen from Girraween towards the end of 2003. This led to the fourth charge on the Form 1, receiving. 
     
      
    14 On the following day, 14 April, police went to the premises of the applicant’s son at Forster, where he showed them a plastic shopping bag in a bedside drawer which was found to contain cash totalling $17,900. Also in the drawer were some other items, together with personal papers in the applicant’s name. That money was the subject of the third charge on the Form 1, also goods in custody. 
     
      
    15 On 16 April Ms Hyde spoke to the applicant by phone and told him that she needed some “ice"". He told her to locate a backpack in a trailer on the property. Inside it she found a sandwich bag containing powder which, on analysis, was found to be 51.8g of methylamphetamine. It was this which gave rise to the first count in the indictment.  
     
      
    16 On the next day, 17 April, the applicant phoned Ms Hyde and asked her to locate a plastic bag in the garden, which she was to pass on to Rick Lang. When she found the bag, concealed behind a choko vine, she saw that it contained a rifle. That evening, she contacted police at Forster and told them what she had found. Police took possession of the weapon, which was found to be a .22 self-loading rifle in working order. This was the firearm the subject of the second count in the indictment. 
     
      
    17 Finally, on 22 April police executed another search warrant at the applicant’s property. On this occasion Ms Hyde handed them a backpack containing a shopping bag with a quantity of cannabis, a re-sealable bag of methylamphetamine, a small set of scales and several other re-sealable bags. The applicant’s possession of the cannabis, some 90g, was the fifth charge on the Form 1. 
     
      
       
      Subjective case 
       
      
    18 The applicant was 51 years old at the time of the offences and is now 56. He has a reasonably lengthy criminal record, comprised mainly of offences of dishonesty between 1969 and 1990. No further offences are recorded until 2001, but between that year and 2004 he was convicted of a number of driving offences and an assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In November 2003 he received a 12-month suspended sentence for driving whilst disqualified, and he was subject to the bond associated with that sentence at the time of the present offences. In June 2007 that bond was revoked and he was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 6 months, which he has served concurrently with the sentences the subject of this application. 
     
      
    19 He is the father of two young children, who at the time he was sentenced were living with Ms Hyde in Victoria. He gave evidence that he suffered from acute gout, exacerbated by the prison diet. He described the offences as the biggest mistake of his life. He said that, upon his release, he wanted to resume his relationship with Ms Hyde and the children in Victoria and find employment. He said that he would not re-offend, but the sentencing judge was sceptical about his evidence because of his early history of dishonesty offences.  
     
      
    20 The applicant’s pleas of guilty were late, but his Honour saw them “as having public utility and as some evidence of possible contrition”. He considered that, but for the pleas of guilty, the count of supplying methylamphetamine, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, called for a sentence of 4 years and 4 months and the count of possessing a prohibited firearm a sentence of 2 years. Because of the pleas of guilty, he reduced those sentences to 3 years and 8 months and 1 year and 8 months respectively. 
     
      
       
      The application 
       
      
    21 Counsel for the applicant, Ms Francis, pursued the application on two grounds. Firstly, she submitted that his Honour fell into error in the way in which he took into account the Form 1 matters when sentencing for the first count. Secondly, she argued that the proportion of the effective non-parole period to the aggregate sentence is unduly high.  
     
      
      Form 1 matters 
       
      
    22 It appears that, in assessing the gravity of the offence of supplying methylamphetamine, his Honour had regard to the third charge on the Form 1, the offence of goods in custody involving $17,900 cash. His Honour said in his remarks: 
     
      
       
        
        The facts indicate a series of supply over a period of time, and the facts supporting other charges are all significant indicia of drug activity by the offender. 
        
       
       
        
        …As to the possession of the methylamphetamine…the $17,900 indicates that such an offence is at least in the middle of any scale of the criminality constructed for such an offence. 
        
       
      
    23 Later in his remarks, his Honour explained how he arrived at the undiscounted sentence of 4 years and 4 months for that first count, taking into account the Form 1 matters. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        Conviction on trial would, in the view of this court, result in a sentence for supplying methylamphetamine of three years and four months imprisonment. Taking into account the matters on the form 1, I would increase that sentence to four years and four months. 
        
       
      
    24 Ms Francis accepted that it was open to his Honour to have regard to the Form 1 matters, particularly the possession of a large amount of money likely to be the proceeds of drug sales, in assessing the objective gravity of the offence of supplying methylamphetamine. She also accepted that it was open to his Honour to quantify the amount by which the sentence for that count had been increased because of the Form 1 matters. In the joint judgment in Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [41]-[43], it was held that that approach is permissible. It is still not the practice to do so, consistently with the view earlier expressed by Spigelman CJ in Attorney General’s Application under s37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518, 56 NSWLR 146 at [44]: 
     
      
       
        
        The manner and degree to which the Form 1 offences can impinge upon elements relevant to sentencing for the principal offence will depend on a range of other factors pertinent to those elements and the weight to be given to them in the overall sentencing task. For that reason it would rarely be appropriate for a sentencing judge to attempt to quantify the effect on the sentence of taking into account the Form 1 offences. 
        
       
      
    25 Ms Francis’ complaint is that, in assessing the gravity of the first count, his Honour has effectively indulged in double counting. Not only did he have regard to the offence involving the money on the Form 1, he also increased the sentence otherwise appropriate by 12 months to take account of the Form 1 matters. While it may have been open to his Honour to have done one or other of those things, she argued, to do both was to fall into error. 
     
      
    26 In my view, this argument is not supported by a careful reading of his Honour’s remarks. True it is that in the first of the passages quoted above his Honour appears to be saying that all the offences, that is, the two charges on the indictment and the Form 1 matters, together indicate “drug activity” by the applicant. However, from the second quoted passage it is clear enough that his Honour had regard only to the goods in custody involving the money in assessing the objective gravity of the offence of supplying methylamphetamine. When it came to determining the sentence for that offence it was necessary to have regard to all of the matters on the Form 1, comprising not only other drug offences but also the goods in custody relating to the DVD player and other items and the receiving of the stolen motor vehicle. The totality of those offences called for a significant increase of the sentence appropriate for the first count standing alone, and it cannot be said that an increase of 12 months was outside the bounds of the proper exercise of discretion.  
     
      
    27 This ground is not made out.  
     
      
       
      Non-parole period 
       
      
    28 His Honour did not find special circumstances, noting that there had been no submission that he should. On each count, the non-parole period is  
     
      
      75 % of the sentence. However, as I have said, the overall sentence is 4 years and 8 months with an effective non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months. That effective non-parole period, in round figures, is 80 % of the aggregate sentence. 
       
      
    29 Such a proportion, is, of course, permissible but it is likely that it is not what his Honour intended: cf. R v Attard [2004] NSWCCA 376, per Buddin J (with whom Giles JA and Smart AJ agreed) at [21]-[22]. The result is a custodial component of 3 years and 9 months with a period of parole eligibility of only 11 months. While his Honour was not asked to find special circumstances in the light of the applicant’s subjective case, the accumulation of sentence was itself a reason to adjust the non-parole period in respect of one of the sentences to achieve an overall proportion of 75 %. The effective non-parole period would then become 3 years and 6 months. Such an adjustment, while relatively minor, cannot be said to be insignificant. 
     
      
    30 I would achieve that result by dividing the sentence on the first count, 3 years and 8 months, into a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 1 year and 2 months. Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal against the sentence on the first count. I would confirm the sentence on the second count. On the first count, I would sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months, to commence on 23 December 2006 and expire on 22 June 2009, and a balance of term of 1 year and 2 months, commencing on 23 June 2009 and expiring on 22 August 2010.

     VICTOR MAKAROV v REGINA (No. 2) 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: On 5 and 6 May 2008, the Court heard together several appeals by the Appellant, Victor Makarov, from his conviction for a number of sex offences at three different trials in the Sydney District Court: 
     
      
       
      (a) a trial before her Honour Judge Latham (as her Honour then was) and a jury between 22 November and 10 December 2004 with respect to offences against D (Trial 2); 
       
       
      (b) a trial before her Honour Judge Hock and a jury between 16 and 31 August 2005 concerning offences against A (Trial 3); 
       
       
      (c) a trial before her Honour Judge Hock and a jury between 31 August and 21 September 2005 concerning offences against B and C (Trial 4). 
       
      
    2 An earlier trial (Trial 1) had proceeded between 8 and 16 November 2004 until the jury was discharged, and no further reference need be made to it. 
     
      
    3 On 28 January 2005, her Honour Judge Latham sentenced the Appellant, for the Trial 2 offences, to an effective head sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment to date from 10 December 2004 and to expire on 9 December 2016 with a non-parole period of eight years to date from 10 December 2004 and to expire on 9 December 2012. 
     
      
    4 On 11 November 2005, her Honour Judge Hock sentenced the Appellant for offences for which he had been convicted at Trials 3 and 4. The effective sentence passed for these offences comprised a head sentence of 11 years, with a non-parole period of seven years to date from 10 December 2009 and to expire on 9 December 2016, and a balance of term of four years to expire on 9 December 2020. 
     
      
    5 Thus, the effective overall sentence for Trials 2, 3 and 4 comprised a term of imprisonment for 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years, both to date from 10 December 2004. 
     
      
    6 The appeals relate to conviction only. No application is made for leave to appeal against any of the sentences imposed, except to the extent that any of the convictions are quashed, thereby giving rise to the need to restructure any of the sentences imposed. 
     
      
       
      Appeal Against Convictions at Trial 3 
       
      
    7 This judgment concerns the appeal against conviction at Trial 3 which related exclusively to offences committed against the complainant, A. The Court will deliver separate judgments with respect to the appeals concerning Trial 2 (Makarov v R (No. 1) [2008] NSWCCA 291) and Trial 4 (Makarov v R (No. 3) [2008] NSWCCA 293). 
     
      
    8 The Appellant appeared unrepresented with respect to the hearing of his appeal arising from Trial 3. Mr Hamill SC and Mr King appeared for the Appellant with respect to certain grounds of appeal arising from Trial 4. Detailed written submissions (extending to 109 pages) were filed by the Appellant with respect to his appeal from Trial 3. In addition, the Appellant addressed the Court in support of his grounds of appeal. The Appellant had been represented by counsel at each of the trials. 
     
      
       
      The Verdicts at Trial 3

      Crimes Act 1900 
      ). 
       
      
    10 The Appellant was found not guilty on a further charge (Count 9) which alleged that he between 20 October 1999 and 1 August 2000 at Gladesville in the State of New South Wales, being a teacher of A, a boy of or above the age of 10 years and under the age of 18 years, namely 16 or 17 years, had homosexual intercourse with him (s.78N Crimes Act 1900).  
     
      
      The Crown Case 
       
      
    11 The Appellant was born in 1953. He was an internationally renowned piano teacher, teaching piano at the Special School for musically gifted children and young people in the city of Kharkov in Ukraine (“the Kharkov school”). The complainant, A, was born in November 1982. He was a student of the Appellant at the Kharkov school, having been admitted to the school’s programs in 1990 when he was seven years old. 
     
      
    12 It was A’s evidence that the first five years at the Kharkov school passed without incident. When A was 12 years old, the Appellant, who was his teacher, had a conversation with him discussing sexual matters. The Appellant told A that “What I am going to tell you has to stay between you and me”. A asked whether he could tell his mother and was told “No”. The Appellant told A that music had a lot of erotic content to it and he put his hand on A’s upper thigh. Thereafter, the Appellant sexually assaulted A on many occasions. These acts (all of which occurred in Ukraine) included masturbating A and instructing A to perform fellatio on him during individual lessons at the Kharkov school. Evidence of these acts was adduced at trial as context or relationship evidence (referred to hereafter as context evidence). 13 The Appellant and A were invited to attend the Third Australian National Piano Pedagogy Conference to be held in Sydney in July 1997. The invitation was extended by Mr Warren Thomson, who at the time was the Artistic Director of Professional Development Programs at the Australian Institute of Music (“the Institute”). Mr Thomson had met the Appellant when he attended piano competitions in Ukraine and he had seen a number of the Appellant’s students, including the complainant, A, perform at competitions. It was this initial contact in Europe between Mr Thomson and the Appellant and A that led him to extend an invitation to them to attend the conference in Sydney in July 1997.  
     
      
    14 Mr Thomson arranged for the Appellant and A to stay at the Travelodge Hotel (as it then was) at Camperdown for the duration of their stay in Australia. He gave evidence that the Appellant and A arrived in Sydney on 3 July 1997 and departed on 19 July 1997 (T110). During their stay in Sydney, it had been arranged for A to give three piano performances. The first was a solo performance at Sydney University on 7 July, the second was a performance in the company of the Sydney Youth Orchestra on 10 July, and the third was a solo performance at the Pitt Street Uniting Church on 13 July 1997 (T111). 
     
      
    15 Counts 1 to 8 on the indictment related to incidents that A said occurred whilst he and the Appellant were in Sydney attending the conference in July 1997. The complainant, A, was 14 years’ old at that time. The Appellant was 43 years old. 
     
      
    16 The events giving rise to Counts 1 - 3 on the indictment occurred before a scheduled rehearsal for the Sydney Youth Orchestra performance. It was the evidence of A that he was in his room at the Travelodge preparing himself to leave for the rehearsal. The Appellant entered the room and instructed A to have a shower, which he did. While A was in the shower, the Appellant got into the shower with him and asked him for the soap. The Appellant started soaping and washing A and said to him “Would you like to get stuck into me?” to which A said “No”. The Appellant then said, “Because I would like to get stuck into you”. The Appellant took A's hand and placed it on his (the Appellant’s) penis and told A to rub it gently (Count 1). The Appellant then placed his own hand onto A’s penis and fondled it (Count 2). The Appellant then rubbed A’s back and lower back before moving his hand down until he inserted his finger into A’s anus (Count 3). A turned away so that the Appellant’s finger would be removed and it was his evidence that this brought the incident to an end (T18). 
     
      
    17 The events giving rise to Counts 4-8 on the indictment occurred after A’s final solo performance at the Pitt Street Uniting Church on 13 July 1997. The Appellant and A returned to the Travelodge some time after dinner. They went back to one of their rooms (in evidence, A was unable to recall which one). A said that they talked generally and watched television for a period. A was tired and decided to go to bed. He got undressed and got under the bed covers. The Appellant undressed and hopped into bed with A. A said that he was facing the wall with his back to the Appellant. The Appellant hugged A from behind and then placed his hand inside A’s underwear and fondled his penis (Count 4). The Appellant removed A’s underwear as well as his own underwear. He placed A on top of him so that A was facing his legs. He instructed A to take his penis in his mouth (Count 5). He also performed fellatio on A (Count 6). The Appellant then rolled A onto his belly and inserted his finger in A’s anus (Count 7). A said the Appellant was moving his finger inside his anus and that he felt pain. After a couple of minutes, the Appellant put A on top of him again and he tried to insert his penis into A’s anus, but was unable to do so. He instructed A to put it in for him and A complied (Count 8). After a few minutes, the Appellant ejaculated inside A. It was the evidence of A that the Appellant then smiled and remarked “You’re mine”. 
     
      
    18 At the conclusion of the conference the Appellant and A returned to Ukraine. 
     
      
    19 In December 1997, the Institute in Sydney offered the Appellant a piano teaching position. The Appellant accepted and in July 1998, he migrated to Australia together with his wife, daughter and five Ukrainian music students, including A. 
     
      
    20 A initially lived with Mr Thomson who had organised scholarships for A and the other students, including the Appellant’s daughter. A legal guardianship document was drafted in relation to Mr Thomson’s care of A. The document was tendered at the Appellant’s trial (Exhibit E). The four other Ukrainian students lived with the Appellant and his wife and daughter, initially at a house in Epping that had been arranged for them by Mr Thomson and then, some months later, at a house in Gladesville. 
     
      
    21 It was the evidence of A that, about a year-and-a-half after he arrived in Australia, he left the care of Mr Thomson and went to live with the Appellant at the house in Gladesville. In cross-examination, A said that the reason he left the care of Mr Thomson was that he had an argument with Mr Thomson, and that he had spoken to the Appellant who had told him to pack his things and come to his house in Gladesville (T49). In evidence, Mr Thomson confirmed that A left his care in October 1999 (T115). 
     
      
    22 The events giving rise to Count 9 on the indictment, to which the jury returned a verdict of not guilty, were alleged to have occurred some time after A moved into the Gladesville house with the Appellant. At the time, A was alone in the house with the Appellant. The two were in the living room of the house. A said that the Appellant was sitting in a chair and called him over. He opened A’s fly and took A’s penis in his mouth (Count 9). A said that he told the Appellant “Don’t do it” and the Appellant looked up at him and said, “Don’t you want me any more?” to which A replied “No”. This was the end of the incident. In cross-examination, A agreed that he had told police that the Appellant had pulled his pants and underwear down, exposing his penis, not that the Appellant had opened his fly (T76). 
     
      
    23 A gave evidence that in the period between when he and the Appellant returned to Ukraine in July 1997 and the time of their migration to Australia in July 1998, other incidents of a sexual nature occurred, but that the frequency of those encounters was reduced. He said that the Appellant would occasionally try to kiss him or try to fondle him (T23). 
     
      
    24 A first reported these matters to the police on 18 February 2004. He made a formal statement to police on 25 March 2004. A gave evidence that his report to police in February 2004 was the first time that he had told anyone in detail of the incidents which had occurred between the Appellant and himself (T24). The Appellant was arrested on 12 May 2004. 
     
      
       
      The Appellant’s Case 
       
      
    25 The Appellant gave evidence at his trial, denying that any sexual activity had occurred with A. He denied sexually assaulting A when the pair were in Sydney in July 1997 (T147). He denied sexually assaulting A at his Gladesville home some time between 20 October 1999 and 1 August 2000 (T154). The Appellant said that A’s allegations of sexual incidents occurring at the Kharkov school in Ukraine , both before and after the July 1997 trip to Australia, were all untrue (T148). 
     
      
    26 With respect to A’s (context) evidence of sexual assaults by the Appellant during lessons at the Kharkov school, the Appellant’s case was that there was limited or no opportunity for any sexual conduct or inappropriate behaviour during lessons at the Kharkov school as there were constant visitors to his classroom and interruptions to his lessons. The same (limited opportunity) argument was raised by the Appellant in relation to Count 9 on the basis of the Appellant’s household being very busy with eight persons residing there.  
     
      
    27 Two witnesses, Ilya Zozulya and Alexey Koltakov, gave evidence that they also lived at the house, were friends with A and had never seen anything of this nature between A and the Appellant, nor had A ever mentioned anything to them. Both ceased their friendship with A upon hearing of the allegations being reported to the police.  
     
      
    28 Three other musicians, Paul Virag, Leo Novikov and Ella Fokina, gave evidence that they had seen A at different times covered by either the relationship or indictment counts, and that he had appeared happy.  
     
      
    29 Mr Zozulya, Mr Virag, Mr Koltakov and Mr Novikov also gave evidence, which was relied upon by the Appellant at trial and on appeal, suggesting that performance at an elite level as a concert pianist was incompatible with stress or personal upset. More detailed reference will be made to the evidence later in the judgment. A short summary of the evidence is given here. Mr Zozulya gave evidence that he had played the piano in competitions and performances where everything is played from memory, without sheet music. He said that he had played when he had been upset and that, when he was upset, he would play much worse than if he was happy (T193). Mr Koltakov gave evidence that it was difficult to perform well if one was upset about something and could not concentrate (T213). Mr Virag gave evidence that he had worked as a pianist, teacher and conductor. He had worked at the Institute and knew the Appellant during the period that they both worked there. He gave evidence that, if he was upset about something, it affected him as a concert pianist. He said that a public performance required a “very very big degree of concentration” and that if a person was upset or stressed, they would be lacking in concentration especially if they were playing from memory. He said that the piece played by A on 10 July 1997 when he was in Australia was an extremely demanding piece (T235). Mr Novikov, a violinist, gave evidence that he had known the Appellant since the Appellant had first arrived in Australia. As a performer, Mr Novikov felt that it was almost impossible to perform to even 30% of one’s abilities if one felt humiliated (T241). Mr Novikov said that he had met A when visiting the Appellant’s house, and also when he was teaching at the Institute. He said that he had never noticed anything strange or unusual about A and that he remembered A as a very self-confident happy person (T242).  
     
      
    30 In the Appellant’s case, a video recording of a room at the Kharkov school where the Appellant taught piano to students was tendered (Exhibit 1). This was the room where A alleged that a number of incidents of a sexual nature had taken place with the Appellant. The recording (which was an edited tape) showed that, during the course of a lesson, there were a number of interruptions by persons entering the room (T146). 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    31 The grounds of appeal are expressed in the following way: 
     
      
       
      (a)  
      Ground 1 
       - the trial miscarried and there was a miscarriage of justice as a result of the perjury of A committed against the Appellant during the trial in relation to the evidence concerning the exclusively professional (musical, psychological and psychiatric) issues. 
       
       
      (b)  
      Ground 2 
       - the trial miscarried and there was a miscarriage of justice as a result of the false testimony under oath that both A and Mr W Thomson committed against the Appellant during proceedings in relation to the date of A’s very last performance in Sydney in July 1997. 
       
       
      (c)  
      Ground 3 
       - the trial miscarried and there was a miscarriage of justice as a result of the false testimony under oath that both A and Mr W Thomson committed against the Appellant during proceedings in relation to the reasons and circumstances of A’s moving from Mr Thomson’s place to the Appellant’s place in October 1999. 
       
       
      (d)  
      Ground 4 
       - the trial miscarried and there was a miscarriage of justice as a result of the trial judge and Crown Prosecutor’s misconduct in relation to the evidence of the Appellant concerning the reasons and circumstances of A’s moving from Mr Thomson’s place to the Appellant’s place in October 1999. 
       
       
      (e)  
      Ground 5 
       - the  
      “fresh” 
       evidence as a proof of the fact that the verdicts of the jury had been reached on the grounds of the false evidence that A and Mr Thomson provided under oath during proceedings in relation to the  
      “relationship” 
       evidence and Counts 1-9. 
       
       
      (f)  
      Ground 6 
       - both the trial judge and Crown Prosecutor failed adequately to direct the jury in relation to: 
       
       
        
        (i) an examination the area of the musical performing under stress [sic]; 
         
         
        (ii) an examination of the evidence of the Defence’s witnesses, Mr Virag and Mr Novikov; 
         
         
        (iii) the Exhibit 1 [video recordings of the piano lessons interruptions in Room 34 of the Kharkov Music School in Ukraine]; 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) the legal concept of the Crown Prosecutor’s status. 
        
       
       
      (g)  
      Ground 7 
       - the trial miscarried and there was a miscarriage of justice as a result of the nature and quality of the evidence relied upon by the trial Crown Prosecutor and violation by the trial Crown Prosecutor of the legal principles of burden of proof, proof, standard of proof and presumption of innocence. 
       
       
      (h)  
      Ground 8 
       - the trial miscarried and there was a miscarriage of justice as a result of unfair conduct by the trial Crown Prosecutor in relation to the trial separation rule. 
       
       
      (i)  
      Ground 9 
       - the acquittal of the Appellant on Count 9 as a proof of the jurors’ reasonable doubt concerning A’s credibility and truthfulness. 
       
       
      (j)  
      Ground 10 
       - the trial judge erred in failing to reject the context evidence, which had been related to the jurisdiction of Ukraine and had not been investigated by Australian or Ukrainian police on the territory of Ukraine.  
       
       
      (k)  
      Ground 11 
       - the trial judge erred in failing to provide for the Appellant, as a former foreigner with English as a second language an access to an interpreter through the simultaneous headphone translation or proper conditions for simultaneous translation of interpreter - with the intervals for translation - that international law and standards required. 
       
       
      (l)  
      Ground 12 
       - the trial miscarried and there was a miscarriage of justice as a result of improper investigation, DPP and Crown Prosecutor conducted in relation to the time of the essence of the Offences 4-8, that caused a misconduct of the trial judge and Crown Prosecutor on the same issue. 
       
      
    32 The grounds of appeal are not all expressed elegantly. However, their meaning and content will become clear. There is some overlap between a number of issues raised by different grounds of appeal. It will be helpful to group a number of the grounds of appeal which have common factual elements.  
     
      
    33 In effect, the grounds raised various events during the trial and contend, in one way or another, that the verdicts of guilty were unreasonable or were unsupported by the evidence or that a miscarriage of justice has otherwise resulted: s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 1, 2, 5 and 6(i) and (ii) - An Issue at Trial Concerning the Ability of A to Play the Piano at Concert Level if he had Truly Been Sexually Assaulted 
       
      
    34 An overlapping feature of Grounds 1, 2, 5 and 6(i) and (ii) is the claim that a miscarriage of justice has occurred because of the jury’s acceptance of the evidence of A that he was sexually assaulted by the Appellant in 1997, in a period when A was performing as a concert pianist successfully, and without what are said by the Appellant to be the inevitable difficulties which would have affected A if he had been sexually assaulted as alleged. It is appropriate to trace the manner in which this issue emerged at the trial before turning to consider the grounds of appeal which relate to this question.  
     
      
    35 An issue at trial was the ability of A to play at concert level if he had truly been sexually assaulted. The Appellant contends that it is simply not possible. Reference will be made to the evidence, the closing addresses of counsel and the summing up dealing with this issue.  
     
      
    36 A was cross-examined about his rehearsal with the Sydney Youth Orchestra in July 1997. He agreed that his evidence was that he had been sexually assaulted in the hotel room prior to attending the rehearsal (Counts 1-3). He agreed that he had been upset by the assault. It was put to him by defence counsel (T60-61): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Mr  
        [A] 
         you cannot perform at the standard, the very high level standard that you are required to perform at if you are upset, correct? 
         
        A. Incorrect. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Incorrect? 
         
        A. Incorrect because rehearsal at the time of the rehearsal there could easily be put a lot of pressure from Makarov on me about my playing that would easily push out any other emotion I have.” 
        
       
      
    37 As mentioned earlier, four witnesses, who were musicians, gave evidence in the defence case. Mr Zozulya was asked in chief (T192): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Have you ever played in a performance or a competition when you’ve been upset for some reason? 
         
        A. Yes I did yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You recall some times when that happened?” 
        
       
       
      The Crown objected on the grounds of relevance and submitted that this was anecdotal evidence relevant only to Mr Zozulya’s experiences. Her Honour queried the relevance of the evidence, observing that  
      “everybody’s different surely” 
       (T193). Defence counsel submitted that the  
      “jury are entitled to have some yardstick, the jury are entitled not just to simply have Mr  
      [A]  
      saying well I was upset but I played brilliantly” 
       (T193). The trial judge eventually allowed the question. Defence counsel asked (T193.36): 
       
       
        
        “Q. So when you were upset did you notice anything different about your performance? 
         
        A. Yeah well if I was upset I would play usually much worse than I would play if I would be like all happy you know just on my good days so I would treat it like a bad day performance you know.” 
        
       
      
    38 Mr Koltakov, the son-in-law of the Appellant, was asked in chief by defence counsel (T213.1): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. We have a little bit of evidence about the difficulty of playing at such a top level a particular piece of music, but it may be different for different people. As far as you’re concerned if you are to play in a competition or an exhibition, a concert, a particular piece of music that might take 15 or 20 minute  
        [sic] 
         to play, what sort of preparation do you need to learn this music, for you? 
         
        A. Well you need to start preparation at least a few months in advance and the program must be quite ready and at least a few weeks in advance and what’s even more important is the day of performance, how you spend the last day. You have to be well rested, you cannot practice a lot you have to practice just a little bit to warm up your fingers otherwise you’ll just let all your energy go. So in other words you have to be fresh and excited to play. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What if you were upset if someone had, well, sexually assaulted you? 
        
       
       
        
        OBJECTION 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: I reject that question. 
        
       
       
        
        RUSSELL: Q. Can I ask you this. Have you ever gone to a competition yourself after being upset about something? 
         
        A. Not a competition but performances, yes, it has happened to me. Sometimes with the professor I would have to perform and we would have a little fight, I would definitely be upset about it and it would not go as good at all as it would be. Yeah it’s hard. It’s just you’re playing and you cannot concentrate and you know that you’re doing not the right thing because you’re not enjoying it, you cannot actually play the music.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. What sort of a level of concentration do you need? 
         
        A. Well I don’t know the numbers, I cannot tell you that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It’s more difficult is it because there’s no music in front of you? 
         
        A. Not only because of that. It’s like, you know, in aeroplane they have autopilot so you can use autopilot and you can go and have a rest. Well it’s still very difficult and complicated to operate such a machine. But in piano playing you don’t have autopilot, you have to be always there every moment, every minute you have to be tremendously concentrated, every moment. That’s what’s most difficult.” 
        
       
      
    39 Mr Virag gave evidence that he had worked as a pianist, teacher and conductor (T232). He had worked at the Institute and knew the Appellant. Defence counsel asked Mr Virag in chief (T233-234): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Can you give us some idea of what is required to produce a quite good performance in piano, what is required? 
         
        A. Well it’s a complex question. Firstly, you need to have proper preparation, which is based on your individual preparation, like practising the piano. You need the guidance, you need the leadership, so until you become an independent, and I would say independent pianists at the age of maybe, I don’t know, 25, 30. Some people even get guidance later on. So you need to work with a teacher. In early stages of my career my teachers were only - always a very important part of it, because --  
        
       
       
        
        Q. Very important? 
         
        A. Very important part of the preparation because they play the guidance role, so I was getting the explanation of music itself, the technical guidance, how to press the keys the right way, because - and then the musical understanding. To understand music is a little bit more complex than to press the right keys in the right time. So there is a lot of psychological preparation.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can I stop you there. At any stage when you were being prepared in your younger years by your teacher or teachers of piano, did anyone ever suggest to you that you had to experience some act of sex to appreciate the great composers and what their music was all about? 
         
        A. Not to my recollection. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What do you think about that notion that you have to experience sex to understand a piece of music? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: I object, it’s not relevant. 
        
       
       
        
        RUSSELL: This is what the Crown put to the witnesses, your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: To whom? 
        
       
       
        
        RUSSELL: Put to the accused and led through Mr  
        [A] 
         that the accused told him this. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: That’s what the complainant said he was told by the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        RUSSELL: Your Honour, surely we can get some sort of understanding from an independent source as to how sensible this all is. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: That’s not the issue. I reject the question. 
        
       
       
        
        RUSSELL: Q. If you are upset, there are varying degrees of upset I understand, if you’re upset about something has it affected you as a concert pianist? 
         
        A. Yes, always. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can you please explain the situation? 
         
        A. Well the performance - any public performance or even if you perform in a class in front of your mates, it - it is a - requires very very big degree of concentration. It’s not only the preparation, because you may be well prepared for that particular performance, but at the same time you have to be in a very special state of mind in order to perform on the best of your level, and obviously when you are upset or if you - if you are stressed most of that concentration or your ability actually to deal with - with your task performing, most of that part goes to deal with the stress. So obviously you are lacking quite a lot of - lot of concentration and that may adversely affect your performance. Especially when you are playing say from memory, you may have erratic memory, obviously you may have so-called black holes and all of a sudden you may forget a part of music. It’s like you probably all remember that situation in rowing on the Olympics when that young lady from the - from the rowing stopped rowing just couple of hundreds of metres before and that was the black hole, right. The situation was we don’t know. We remember all of that situation. So that was actually - that was said that was a black-out, right. So if this happens in your performance you are jeopardising your reputation, your position as a professional, so you obviously have to look after that part.” 
        
       
      
    40 Defence counsel asked Mr Virag concerning the degree of difficulty of one of the pieces played by A at the concert on 10 July 1997, the Mozart Concerto in D Minor (K466). Mr Virag observed that this was “an extremely demanding piece” (T235.21). 
     
      
    41 Mr Novikov gave evidence that he was a violinist. He had known the Appellant since the Appellant first arrived in Australia. Defence counsel asked Mr Novikov in chief (T241-242): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Okay. Can I ask you about performing, as a performer in an orchestra, classical music, if you are upset. First of all, have you ever played a performance that you recall when you’ve been upset? 
         
        A. Yes, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can you just tell us a little bit about the dynamics, tell the jury about the dynamics of this and what is required in playing this music? 
         
        A. There could be different reasons for distress. So, for example, an argument with parents, you know, and that kind of distress causes aggression and I would say with aggression may be it would be impossible to perform though still not as well as being in normal condition. Another case is humiliation. When you feel yourself humiliated, it’s another kind of distress. I feel it like a musician, like a person, not like a psychiatrist of course. I would say it’s impossible, almost impossible to perform even thirty percent of your abilities if you feel yourself humiliated. In my life I can recall just one case of such thing when I felt myself humiliated. Not as sexual abuse, of course, it’s hard to imagine. But I felt humiliation when I played after that. It was a case when my teacher, I expected to him to come for an audition when I played, for an important audition for a competition, and he didn’t come. As I found, because he had to meet his wife and take her to their house near Moscow and so on, so I was really upset because I felt myself very lonely, like, like he just failed to come to support me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. He let you down? 
         
        A. Let me down, yes. And that was awful and firstly I didn’t want to play but then I went to play and that was maybe one of my worst performances, because I felt myself like, you know, powerless. That’s the worst thing when humiliation occurs, when a persons let down.” 
        
       
      
    42 The Crown Prosecutor touched upon this issue during her closing address to the jury (T2-4, 29 August 2005): 
     
      
       
        
        “Now, another theme which the accused touched on in his evidence, but which was developed very, very - well I'd say most aggressively by defence witnesses is this, that because there was no evidence in Mr  
        [A] 
        ’s 
          
        performance as a pianist or in his outward presentation when dealing with others in a social context that that means that his allegations of being sexually abused were baseless and they were, in fact, lies. This was - this theme was pushed very hard in relation to the first three counts which you will recall Mr  
        [A] 
         said occurs as the three counts that were in the shower allegedly, they occurred before a rehearsal before the performance with the Sydney Youth Orchestra during the conference in 1997. Remember the alleged sexual assaults occurred before one of the 
         
        rehearsals. 
        
       
       
        
        Now l reminded you the other day about Mr  
        [A] 
        's evidence that he said that at the rehearsal, 'Emotion could be driven out of me by Mr Makarov’. Firstly, his allegations about these three counts, the ones before one of the rehearsals, do not relate to competition performances. He wasn't due to perform in a competition which all the witnesses have liked to refer to in the terms of his lack of success around about 1999/2000. In 1997 he was giving performances and it's understandable that he would have learnt the music and perfected his playing of it technically and then after this alleged series of events in the shower there was a rehearsal so his mind had to get into gear to work with the conductor and the orchestra. He never said that after the incident in the shower he was all upset and depressed and he couldn't cope. This is rather a red herring, something of a red herring, that the defence has put forward to try and get pseudo expert evidence from the defence witnesses. I say pseudo expert evidence because what they've been trying to establish is that because there were no outward signs of distress or upset that equals that nothing occurred. 
         
         
        And that is probably scientifically a totally invalid way to assess emotional or psychological turmoil because when you consider the opposite some people may be very expressive, some people may readily turn on emotions. That's called hysteria. Some people may express emotions and show outward signs of extreme distress when there is no basis for it. And so it would be just as wrong to say, if Mr  
        [A] 
         had gone around behaving in a very emotional fashion, that would be wrong to say ‘That is evidence of the truth of his allegations’. But we all know that humans are complex persons and that emotions are processed in different ways. And the idea of Mr  
        [A] 
         appearing at all times to be happy and showing no signs of distress was laboured by the defence witnesses, but in 
         
        the end it is meaningless. You can't rely on a neutral, a neutral, that is no signs of distress, to prove a negative, that is that his allegations are baseless. You have to go back to assessing his evidence and whether you accept that he was telling the truth. 
        
       
       
        
        Now from his close friends, Mr Koltakov and Mr Zozulya, they go further. In fact, Mr Koltakov said specifically ‘He’, that's Mr  
        [A] 
        , ‘never told me that he was not well emotionally and he looked normal. You can't perform well if you're upset therefore the allegations that he was sexually abused are false’. 
        
       
       
        
        Now, as I've said, this is an illogical analysis and I remind you about Mr Virag’s evidence that he gave on Friday. He said that rehearsals with orchestras are as important as the performances themselves and they require exactly the same level of performing quality and to a degree the rehearsal is even more important than the performance. I remind you also that Mr  
        [A] 
         has, told you that he was abused in the same way but the shower incidents referred to, he was abused in this way for many, many years. This was not a one-off event. If you accept his evidence that he had been subjected to the accused's unwanted sexual attentions for four years, this incident in the shower in the hotel room was one of a number, a large number, of such incidents. You wouldn't expect it to generate higher emotions than those which had been generated over the years. 
         
         
        Performing in a concert hall or on a sports field would depend, one would expect, on the preparation, both psychological and technical. Performers often have setbacks, they prime themselves to overcome them. And the observations of a person's emotional state depends on how well the observer knows that person and how equally, how attuned the observer is to changes or to underlying factors in the observed person's emotional state.” 
        
       
      
    43 Defence counsel addressed the jury on this issue in the following way (T15.9, 29 August 2005): 
     
      
       
        
        “Well you've heard the evidence given by the young man, Zozulya, Koltakov. You've heard the evidence of Mr Virag about performances and how difficult it is to put these things out of your mind. As Madam Crown pointed out to you in the evidence of Mr Novikov, that he said, 'Well I'm, you know, effectively pretty confused about all of this. This man would have to have the cold blood of James Bond’, he said, as the Crown reminded you about that. Well I think what he was really trying to say, and it's a matter for you, is that we've all seen James Bond movies, but I think he was trying to tell us something about the west. We've all seen James Bond movies and we've seen the precarious situations that Mr Bond's always placed in and he just doesn't even get his hair out of place, you know. Nothing happens. He just goes and wanders off and has a dry martini at the bar, and that's it. Nothing fazes him. And we all laugh at it because it's quite humorous because we know, as human beings, if those sort of things happened to us we'd probably be on a hospital trolley somewhere with a drip in our arm or something like that because these things just - it doesn't happen. 
         
         
        And that's what Mr Novikov was trying to say, ‘This is so unrealistic, you cannot be sexually assaulted one minute and then you go and play these performances’. We're not talking about someone tapping out Chopsticks. We're talking about incredible performances as described by expert observers such as the observer from the paper that I read out to you, and that was explained by Mr Virag about this man was, the reporter from the paper who's an expert, it appears, in observing this type of music, was just, it appeared, quite overwhelmed by the performance of young  
        [A]  
        who was performing at the age of about 15 years. So just bear that in mind as well.” 
        
       
      
    44 A short time later, the morning adjournment was taken. During the break, the trial judge received a note from the jury which contained nine questions, one of which was “Would the Crown have been allowed to call expert witnesses on whether a pianist could perform well whilst under stress?” (T17.14, 29 August 2005). Her Honour deferred answering any of the questions until after defence counsel completed his address. 
     
      
    45 Defence counsel went on to submit to the jury (T20.29, 29 August 2005): 
     
      
       
        
        “Now look whether you accept Mr Virag on that is a matter for yourself, but ladies and gentlemen he appeared when he gave his evidence to you to be a fairly straight forward sort of bloke, a wealth of experience in music, unbelievable experience this man has had in music. Not just in the art or skill of piano but also in conducting orchestras and things of that nature and how many performances, over 200 performances or more than he's made himself. So I think he is the sort of person who you could attach quite a deal of weight to in relation to what he had to say about performance and so forth.  
         
         
        I will not go through it, but you will have before you and you have seen exhibit 2 which is the extract from the paper of 1997 when Mr  
        [A]  
        came to Sydney and the report in the paper there, which I won't go into any detail. It is all there for you about how fine his performance was. And you will look at that ladies and gentlemen and you will give it such weight as you think, bearing in mind the considerable evidence that has been before you and the only evidence before you from these variety of witnesses that say look you just cannot perform if you are very upset.” 
        
       
      
    46 Defence counsel returned to this topic later in his closing address (T29.51, 29 August 2005): 
     
      
       
        
        “The weight of evidence supports the contention that it would be highly unlikely that his performances would not have been affected if he had been sexually assaulted as he said. And of course the only evidence before you is that from expert witnesses and what weight you give them is a matter for your  
        [sic]  
        ladies and gentlemen, but it is the only evidence before you, apart from Mr  
        [A] 
         - apart from Mr  
        [A] 
        ’s just blanket one line denial, ‘no it didn't affect me’, is all these persons saying not just from their own studies but from their own personal experience, that to play at this high level and we are - we've got some ideal  
        [sic]  
        what level Mr  
        [A] 
        's playing at, to play at this high level, if you're very upset, as Mr  
        [A] 
         said he was when he had been sexually assaulted and you would obviously think, ladies and gentlemen quite obviously, that he would be, then you would know that it is highly unlikely that he would not show - would not show in his performances. 
         
         
        And again I invite you, ladies and gentlemen, don't just rely upon the witnesses, rely upon your commonsense because the other thing that supports what I'm saying to you about the unlikely nature of his performance not being affected, is your own commonsense, your own experience in life. You bring your experience, as I say, to the Court room, it may be that you - some of you may be magicians if you've been lucky enough to get to that high standard that Mr  
        [A] 
        's at, well congratulations but perhaps you haven't, but you know we're not all piano players or musicians or violinists. We've all been playing in sports events, we've all been students sitting exams and things of that nature. Cast your mind back to a time when you may have been very upset about something. Did it affect you? Did it affect your performance or did you say 'No I can't do this', you know 'I can't do this exam' or 'I can't hit the ball like I normally can', 'I can't concentrate'. 
         
         
        And the concentration level that we're talking about for a performance such as the one that he performed in Sydney with Duncan Gifford, something for, was it 40 minutes or something like that, I think it was, I will stand corrected. But it was a lengthy performance where you had to be very much concentrating on every note, all the other notes of the other instruments in the orchestra coming in at the right time and so forth. An incredible amount of concentration and focus. And you ask yourself the question; if you'd just been sexually assaulted, would you be likely to be able to do that? Even if you'd been sexually assaulted in the 
         
        preceding week, would you be likely to be able to that or would your mind be not on the job and I would suggest to you that your mind simply could not be on the job if something like that had happened.” 
        
       
      
    47 Defence counsel returned to the topic (T33.42, 29 August 2005): 
     
      
       
        
        “And that’s, you would think, a matter of common sense ladies and gentlemen, you can’t be thinking about a sex act or having been sexually assaulted or anything of that nature when you are trying to concentrate on your music, it’s just quite impossible.” 
        
       
      
    48 At the conclusion of the defence address, her Honour discussed the jury questions with counsel, in the absence of the jury. When her Honour came to the question concerning “expert witnesses”, the following discussion ensued (T40-41, 29 August 2005): 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, I was a bit concerned with Mr Russell's treatment of this area of so-called expert evidence in his address because he went from saying that these witnesses - well, asking question  
        [sic] 
         of them during their evidence as to, ‘How can you perform if you are upset?’ to elevating them to expert witnesses about the inability of somebody to perform after being sexually assaulted, and of course that was never a question that was asked of them. They were simply asked a rather general question, ‘How would you perform - how does being upset affect your performance?’, and suddenly in his address they're now expert witnesses on the effects of sexual assault on performance. 
        
       
       
        
        This has really obviously become an issue which the jury has seized on, but I'd ask your Honour to firstly say that they're, not experts in any recognised sense about the relationship between performance and stress, because there's no such area of expertise as to how somebody can perform when they're under stress. All they can say is it would be difficult for them to perform. They don't know how somebody else reacts. There's no known area of expertise. They're not expert witnesses as to the effects of sexual assault on performance and, no, the Crown would not have been able to call expert evidence in reply. 
        
       
       
        
        Because there's another issue here. If these people are witnesses about stress and performance and major trauma, then there are other witnesses who the Crown could have called who have allegedly been sexually assaulted by the accused and who have managed to perform at very high levels; one of whom has obviously been accepted by a jury. But obviously the Crown can't call that sort of expert or pseudo-expert evidence. But I'd ask your Honour to answer this question in very, very strong terms to stop the jury speculating about it, speculating in a way that Mr Russell invited them to, which was totally improper and outside the evidence. 
         
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        RUSSELL: Your Honour, I've got no difficulty with your Honour dealing with the question along the lines of explaining to them that the witnesses that have been called that have mentioned matters relevant to this particular question are not performance psychologists or anything of that nature. They've simply been put forward as expert musicians who have given their own perspective 
         
        about performing or attempting to perform when they might be upset or very upset. That's all. They give what weight to that that they feel is appropriate.” 
        
       
      
    49 Following this discussion, the trial judge provided answers to the jury, concerning the nine questions before commencing the summing up. In relation to the question, “Would the Crown have been allowed to call expert witnesses on whether a pianist could perform well whilst under stress?"", her Honour gave an answer in the form requested by defence counsel, namely (T47.40, 29 August 2005): 
     
      
       
        
        ""Again, I will have something more to say to you about that area when I sum-up the case to you. Once again, you must decide the case on the evidence that has been placed before you and I should say to you that those witnesses who were called in the accused's case could not be classified as expert witnesses in the particular area as to whether a person could perform at peak level having been sexually assaulted. They are not expert witnesses in that particular area and, I don’t know, I doubt very much whether there would be such an expert available. They were expert musicians and you will obviously have to weigh up their evidence and give it such weight as you think fit. Again, I will come back to that in the summing-up when I'm dealing with the respective cases."" 
        
       
      
    50 In the course of summing up, her Honour referred to this issue (SU33-34): 
     
      
       
        
        “In terms of the witnesses called by the accused, they generally gave evidence in general terms about the effect of stress in their opinion on performance, whether a person would be able to perform well if suffering stress. In terms of the evidence, it is important that you bear in mind that counts 1, 2 and 3 are alleged to have taken place before a rehearsal, certainly not the Duncan Gifford performance, before a rehearsal for a performance. Counts 4 to 8 are alleged to have taken place after the last performance in Sydney.  
        
       
       
        
        As I said to you when I was dealing with your questions, there is no doubt that some of those people who were called were very talented and experienced musicians. The weight that you give their opinion evidence as to what they had to say about whether they could perform or general terms about performance is entirely a matter for you and it is important to keep in mind the timing of these allegations, when it is they are said to have taken place.” 
        
       
      
    51 Defence counsel made no complaint concerning this direction nor was any further direction sought on this topic.  
     
      
    52 It is appropriate to return to the grounds of appeal, which are set out in terms which reflect more clearly the Appellant’s complaints.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1 – There was a Miscarriage of Justice Resulting from A’s Perjury Concerning the Alleged Offences and His Ability to Perform Thereafter as a Concert Pianist 
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    53 In his written submissions, the Appellant challenges the truthfulness of A’s evidence. He submits that the occupation of concert pianist requires such qualities as a high level of attention (volume, stability, concentration, distribution and flexibility), a steady nervous system and mentality, great emotional and energetic expression, an ability to communicate with a large audience and a strong long-term memory. The Appellant submits that acts of sexual assault would inevitably cause particular psychological injuries such as difficulty concentrating, depression, feelings of helplessness, inability to fully pursue music as a profession, anxiety, guilt, fear, withdrawal and acting out together with non-participation in school and social activities.  
     
      
    54 The Appellant submits that, during the trial, the Crown did not introduce any professionally examined evidence concerning the psychological injuries A received as the consequence of sexual abuse and assault. The Appellant contends that it was the obligation of the Crown to prove that A received psychological injuries. He contends that it “was impossible objectively to prove guilt of the appellant without proving the fact of psychological injuries” and that it was also “impossible for the jury to reach reasonable verdicts without knowing the opinion of professional experts, because a subject of this issue was outside the experience of jurors” (paragraph 4.10, Appellant’s written submissions). The Appellant complains about the trial judge’s reply to the jury question concerning expert witnesses. As a result of her Honour’s directions, the Appellant submits that the jury completely ignored the evidence of the defence’s “professional experts concerning the impossibility of performing at the top level of the international competitions while being under the strain and pressure of suffering sexual abuse and assault” (paragraph 4.11, Appellant’s written submissions). 
     
      
    55 Thus, the Appellant contends that it would have been impossible for A to have a successful career as an international pianist if he had been sexually abused as alleged, and that this conclusion points to A’s evidence that he was sexually abused by the Appellant as being perjury.  
     
      
    56 The Crown points to the Appellant’s central claim under the first ground as being that A must have committed perjury when he said that he was sexually assaulted because he could not have performed at a concert level had he been sexually assaulted. The Crown observes that this was an issue ventilated at length during the trial. Both the Crown and defence counsel made submissions on the issue. By the verdicts, it may be taken that the jury ultimately found A to be credible when he said that “At the time of the rehearsal there could easily be put a lot of pressure from Makarov on me about my playing that would easily push out any other emotion I have” (T60-61). 
     
      
    57 The Crown submits that there was nothing about the anecdotal evidence of personal experiences of the four musicians called in the defence case, that impacted upon the evidence of A and demonstrated him to be a liar when he said that he was able to put the sexual abuse out of his mind at the time of playing. The Crown submits that there is no basis for finding that the jury’s verdicts were unreasonable when a close analysis of this issue at trial is undertaken. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    58 The Appellant’s submissions on this topic involve a number of misconceptions. The Crown had no obligation to adduce expert evidence which, in some way, sought to explain how A could still perform professionally as a concert pianist despite acts of sexual abuse having been perpetrated upon him by the Appellant. It is doubtful that evidence of this type would have been admissible as expert evidence.  
     
      
    59 Consideration has been given in a number of Australian cases (both before and after the Evidence Act 1995) to admissibility of expert evidence concerning aspects of behaviour of sexually abused children, including delay in complaint and the so-called childhood sexual abuse accommodation syndrome: Ingles v R (Tas Court of Criminal Appeal, 4 May 1993, BC9300044); R v C (1993) 60 SASR 467; R v F (1995) 83 A Crim R 502 (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal); R v E (1997) 96 A Crim R 489 (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal); HG v The Queen [1999] 197 CLR 414; R v S (2001) 125 A Crim R 526 (Qld Court of Appeal) and Bellemore v Tasmania (2006) 170 A Crim R 1 (Tas Court of Criminal Appeal). In some cases, evidence of this type has been admitted and in others, it has been rejected.  
     
      
    60 The position in Tasmania has been affected by s.79A Evidence Act 2001 (Tas) which concerns the admission of expert evidence of the impact of sexual abuse on children: Bellemore v Tasmania at 19-21, 39-47, 61-66. The position may change in New South Wales upon the commencement of the Evidence Amendment Act 2007 No. 46, which will amend s.79 Evidence Act 1995 (opinions based upon specialised knowledge) to give effect to Recommendation 9-1 of the collaborative report of the Australian, New South Wales and Victorian Law Reform Commissions, Uniform Evidence Law Report 112, 2005, thereby making express reference to specialised knowledge of the impact of sexual abuse on children and their development and behaviour following abuse.  
     
      
    61 The issues considered in these authorities, however, are far removed from the present case and the matters raised in these grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    62 Defence counsel cross-examined A concerning his ability to perform at piano concerts. A answered in the manner set out at [36] above. The defence did not seek to adduce expert psychiatric, psychological or medical evidence on this topic. As defence counsel readily (and correctly) accepted at trial, the evidence adduced from the four musicians involved a combination of anecdotal evidence and personal views arising from their own experiences, none of which involved an experience of sexual abuse. There is force in the Crown submission that this evidence was irrelevant (s.55 Evidence Act 1995) and thus inadmissible. The evidence having been admitted, however, the trial judge directed the jury in the manner requested by defence counsel. It remained a matter for the jury to consider the competing submissions concerning this evidence.  
     
      
    63 This is not a case where the Crown was permitted, over objection, to adduce objectionable opinion evidence. Nor is it a case where the defence was prevented from adducing admissible opinion evidence. The Appellant had the benefit of this evidence, accompanied by appropriate directions to the jury from the trial judge. It was for the jury to consider what weight to give the evidence. 
     
      
    64 We are wholly unpersuaded that any error has been demonstrated with respect to this issue at trial. It was a question for the jury to consider the evidence and arguments. It has not been demonstrated, by reference to this issue, that the verdicts of the jury were unreasonable or not supported by the evidence or that there was a miscarriage of justice. We reject the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 6(i) and (ii) - The Trial Judge and Crown Prosecutor Failed Adequately to Direct the Jury in Relation to (i) the Issue of a Musician Performing Under Stress and (ii) the Evidence of the Defence Witnesses, Mr Virag and Mr Novikov 
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    65 In Ground 6(i) and (ii), the Appellant advances arguments which effectively overlap with the first ground of appeal. His submissions refer, once again, to the failure of the Crown to call an expert witness on this topic and complaints which he makes concerning the directions of the trial judge to the jury. Complaint is made concerning the Crown’s submissions to the jury in closing on this issue. 
     
      
    66 The Crown submits that defence counsel sought no further direction (after her Honour’s direction set out at [50]), and that this is not surprising given that her Honour had directed the jury in accordance with the form proposed by defence counsel. The Crown submits that the Crown Prosecutor at trial was right to have objected to the evidence relating to Mr Zozulya’s ability to play when upset. It was not relevant and constituted anecdotal evidence of personal experience which had no general application. 
     
      
    67 In any event, the Crown submitted that the admission of the evidence of the four musicians on this topic could only have worked to the advantage of the Appellant and did not cause him any disadvantage, let alone give rise to a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    68 The Crown submits that the closing submissions of the Crown to the jury were balanced and reasonable and that no miscarriage resulted from the Crown’s address. The Crown repeats submissions made with respect to the first ground of appeal, emphasising that the anecdotal evidence of the musicians had questionable relevance but that, in any event, the evidence was admitted and had worked to the advantage of the Appellant. The Crown submits that the directions of the trial judge on this issue were balanced and reasonable. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    69 The conclusions expressed above (at [61]-[64]) apply equally to this ground and do not need to be repeated. The closing submissions of the Crown Prosecutor were balanced and were based on the evidence. The directions of the trial judge were those sought by the Appellant’s trial counsel. No reasonable criticism can be made by the Appellant with respect to those directions. No miscarriage of justice has been established.  
     
      
    70 We would reject Ground 6(i) and (ii).  
     
      
       
      Part of Ground 5 - Claim that  
      “Fresh” 
       Evidence is Proof of the Fact that the Verdicts Were Reached on the Basis of False Evidence Given by A and Mr Thomson  
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    71 The Appellant seeks to adduce fresh evidence on a point which he says is related to the argument in Ground 1, namely, that A must have committed perjury when he said that he was sexually assaulted because he could not have performed at a concert level had he been sexually assaulted. 
     
      
    72 The evidence tendered was a copy of the “Ukrainian Weekly in Australia” dated 30 July 1997 (part of which is translated at page 53 of the Appellant’s written submissions). The article contains a review of an unexpected and short recital given by A at the Ukrainian People House at Lidcombe on 16 July 1997. The author of the article noted that A played to a small number of people and that he played well.  
     
      
    73 The Crown objected to the tender of this evidence upon the basis that it was neither fresh nor significant.  
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    74 During the hearing of the appeal, the Court declined to admit this evidence as fresh evidence (T16, 6 May 2008).  
     
      
    75 We observe, in any event, that this material did not add anything of significance to the evidence that was before the jury. A had been cross-examined about an earlier performance and agreed that he played well shortly after being sexually assaulted (T63.5). An article reviewing another of A’s performances in July 1997 was tendered during the trial (T105.45). Defence counsel had read onto the record during a question the portion of the article that noted that A had played well (T62). There was also evidence from Mr Thomson who said that he had witnessed A give an outstanding performance on 7 July 1997 (T122).  
     
      
    76 If the article from the “Ukrainian Weekly in Australia” had been tendered at trial, it would have added very little to the unchallenged body of evidence that A performed well in 1997 despite having been sexually assaulted by the Appellant. Accordingly, even if this evidence had been admitted on appeal, it would not have affected the position materially. No miscarriage of justice has been established. 
     
      
    77 We reject this part of Ground 5. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 – There was a Miscarriage of Justice Resulting From False Testimony of A and Mr Thomson Concerning the Date of A’s Very Last Performance in Sydney in July 1997 
       
      
    78 The Appellant sought to rely upon the extract from the “Ukrainian Weekly in Australia” dated 30 July 1997 in support of Ground 2. As mentioned at [74] above, the Court declined to admit this as fresh evidence on the appeal. 
     
      
    79 It is appropriate to refer briefly to the arguments concerning the second ground of appeal to demonstrate that this article would not, in any event, have advanced the appeal against conviction.  
     
      
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    80 The Appellant sought to rely upon this article to challenge evidence of A and Mr Thomson at trial. The Appellant points to the fact that A did not mention a performance to the Ukrainian People House at Lidcombe on 16 July 1997 in his evidence at trial. The Appellant argues that A and Mr Thomson gave false evidence at trial with respect to the timing of A’s last performance in Sydney in July 1997.  
     
      
    81 In effect, the Appellant’s submission is that the strength of his argument that A could not have played well after being sexually assaulted was not properly before the jury, because the case proceeded upon the basis that his last Sydney performance was on 13 July 1997 at the Pitt Street Uniting Church with no reference to the performance at the Ukrainian People House at Lidcombe on 16 July 1997. 
     
      
    82 The Crown submits that this point goes nowhere. Neither A nor the Appellant gave evidence at trial concerning the performance to the Ukrainian People House at Lidcombe on 16 July 1997 although, according to the article, the Appellant was present as well. The Crown submits that it is apparent from the article that the performance was unexpected and was attended by few people. A’s evidence that his last solo recital was in the Pitt Street Uniting Church was a correct reference to his last official and scheduled performance on the trip to Australia (A, T17, T19; Thomson, T110-111).  
     
      
    83 The Crown notes that the Appellant seeks to argue that it was important for the jury to know that there was a small, unplanned performance on 16 July 1997 and that, reportedly, A played well on that occasion. The Crown submits that the trial in no way miscarried as a result of this evidence not being before the jury. The Appellant’s submission is once again premised on the idea that the lack of outward signs of distress necessarily proves that no sexual assault took place. The Crown submits that this issue was well ventilated before the jury.  
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    84 The article from the “Ukrainian Weekly in Australia” was not admitted by the Court as fresh evidence on the appeal. If it had been admitted, however, it would have provided no material assistance to the Appellant on the appeal.  
     
      
    85 The Appellant seeks to draw a very long bow in attacking the truthfulness of A and Mr Thomson with respect to the date of A’s last performance in Sydney in July 1997 by reference to this article. As the Crown correctly points out, the Appellant was present at the small, unplanned and short performance on 16 July 1997, but yet he also made no reference to it in his evidence at trial. At the hearing of this appeal, the Appellant said that he “knew that he performed at the Ukrainian House. At the time of the trial, I did not remember all the dates” (T15, 6 May 2008). Why the failure of A and Mr Thomson to remember and mention this would point to perjury on their part, but the same failure on the part of the Appellant could be put to one side has not been explained by the Appellant. This observation serves to demonstrate the weakness of the Appellant’s argument.  
     
      
    86 No miscarriage of justice has been demonstrated as a result of this evidence not being before the jury.  
     
      
    87 We reject the second ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 3, 4 and 5 – There was a Miscarriage of Justice Arising From False Testimony of A and Mr Thomson and the Conduct of the Crown Prosecutor and the Trial Judge Concerning the Reasons for A Moving from Mr Thomson’s House to the Appellant’s House in October 1999 
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    88 Grounds 3, 4 and 5 can be conveniently dealt with together as each involves a claim that the trial miscarried by reference to the circumstances of A moving from Mr Thomson’s house to the Appellant’s house in 1999.  
     
      
    89 The Appellant developed an argument in written submissions that both A and Mr Thomson gave false testimony concerning the reasons and circumstances of A moving from Mr Thomson’s place to the Appellant’s home in October 1999. The Appellant submits that he attempted to explain at trial what were said to be the real reasons that caused A to move, but he was stopped (T149-152), thereby giving rise to the fourth ground of appeal. 
     
      
    90 The Appellant sought to rely on certain material as fresh evidence. At the hearing of the appeal, the Court declined to admit this material as fresh evidence (T22-24, 6 May 2008). The Court also declined to admit a statement dated July 2007 from Dr P Calvo. Dr Calvo was referred to in the Appellant’s evidence at trial (T152), but he was not called as a witness in the defence case. 
     
      
    91 The Crown submits that A gave evidence of a number of reasons for moving from Mr Thomson’s house to live with the Appellant and other students, including that he had an argument with Mr Thomson (T49, T52, T68, T78), that he had been told to pack his bags and go by the Appellant (T49, T52, T68, T78) and because he was lonely as Mr Thomson was not often home (T63). The Crown submits that none of these reasons are inconsistent in themselves. Mr Thomson said he did not know why A wanted to leave, but later received a letter from A explaining that he needed to be with the other Ukrainian students (T115). The Appellant alleges that the evidence of both A and Mr Thomson is false and, the Crown submits, the Appellant speculates about a number of other bases for A’s move, each of which is unsupported by the evidence.  
     
      
    92 The Crown notes that the Appellant alleges misconduct on the part of the trial judge and the Crown Prosecutor for not allowing the Appellant to explain his version of the reasons for A’s move from Mr Thomson’s house (Ground 4; page 46, Appellant’s written submissions). The Crown submits this complaint is misconceived since it was defence counsel who made the decision to not try and lead the explanation which the Appellant attempted to introduce at trial (T151.40). The Crown Prosecutor took a proper objection to hearsay evidence. However, the trial judge did not have to rule upon its admission because of the course adopted by defence counsel. 
     
      
    93 The Crown submits that the Appellant seeks to introduce on appeal a number of documents, including the letter he attempted to introduce at trial which was not pressed by his counsel. The Crown submits that none of the items sought to be relied upon by the Appellant support the proposition that A or Mr Thomson deliberately lied or that there was a plot or conspiracy orchestrated against the Appellant as contended at pages 50-58 of the Appellant’s written submissions. 
     
      
    94 The Crown submits that the reasons and circumstances behind A’s move of house was a minor matter, going to a peripheral issue rather than to the substance of the counts on the indictment. The Crown submits that nothing in the material raised would demonstrate that the verdicts of the jury were unreasonable. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    95 The Court rejected the tender of documents relied upon by the Appellant as they did not constitute fresh evidence. We express the conclusion, in any event, that this material was not capable of demonstrating that a miscarriage of justice had occurred if it had been admitted, viewed on its own or together with the other evidence relied upon by the Appellant.  
     
      
    96 The Appellant was reminded, on more than one occasion, during the hearing before this Court that this is a Court of error and is not sitting as a trial court. The short answer to the Appellant’s complaint that evidence was not given at trial concerning possible reasons for A’s move of house is that defence counsel at trial determined not to seek to adduce the evidence. No decision was made by the trial judge to reject the evidence. The Appellant has not sought to challenge the decisions made, on his behalf, by trial counsel by reference to the principles in R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 and TKWJ v The Queen (2002) 212 CLR 124.  
     
      
    97 In our view, these grounds of appeal are misconceived. In any event, we accept the Crown submission that the issue raised by these grounds was peripheral at best, and had little to do with the substantial issues in the trial. The Appellant has not demonstrated, by reference to these grounds of appeal, that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.

      Grounds 6, 7 and 8 - Claims of Alleged Misconduct on the Part of the Crown Prosecutor 
       
      
    99 There is substantial overlap in the matters raised in Grounds 6, 7 and 8, each of which alleges misconduct on the part of the Crown Prosecutor. In essence, the Appellant claims that the trial miscarried due to the behaviour of the Crown Prosecutor in relation to her: 
     
      
       
      (a) criticism of defence evidence (Ground 6(iii)); 
       
       
      (b) alignment on the  
      “same side” 
       as the jury (Ground 6(iv)); 
       
       
      (c) failure to prove elements to the requisite standard (part Ground 7); 
       
       
      (d) criticism of defence witnesses (part Ground 7); 
       
       
      (e) attack on the Appellant’s character (part Ground 7); and 
       
       
      (f) use of the word  
      “harem”  
      in the Crown closing address (Ground 8). 
       
       
      Criticism of Defence Evidence (Ground (6)(iii)) 
       
      
    100 For the purposes of the trial, the Appellant created a videotape of short duration containing excerpts from 18 master tapes of whole 45-minute lessons given by the Appellant at the Kharkov school in Ukraine. The videotape was tendered by defence counsel (Exhibit 1). The purpose of the tender was to show interruptions to lessons by people coming and going and that the door to the room was not locked. This was relevant to an assessment of the context evidence of A, who said that assaults had occurred in that room at the Kharkov school in Ukraine. As the videotape contained a series of extracts from a large number of lessons, it did not depict complete lessons.  
     
      
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    101 The Appellant complains about the way in which the Crown Prosecutor referred to Exhibit 1 in her closing address to the jury. The Crown Prosecutor said (T6.1, 29 August 2005): 
     
      
       
        
        “Now in the accused’s evidence he described how he was always being interrupted in his music class in room 34. And you have two videos, one which features room 34 exclusively, and that is exhibit 1, a defence exhibit. The other is exhibit A which is the training video of which you have an excerpt and a large part of that features students playing in room 34. You will notice a difference between them, and there is a reason for that. Exhibit 1 was, as the accused said, specifically edited to show movement in and out of the doors to the room. And you might get a very distorted impression from exhibit 1 about the interruptions in room 34, but when you realise that the accused usually taught 45 minute classes it’s clear that what you have in exhibit 1 is very much less than that. And it has, the movement in and out of the room has been specifically selected to prove a point. 
        
       
       
        
        Now the point seems to be that because the accused could be interrupted at any time who could have done to Mr  
        [A]  
        what Mr  
        [A]  
        said he did on at least two occasions that Mr  
        [A] 
         has told you about, highlights from his memory of many, many such incidents where the accused either touched him on the genitals or got Mr  
        [A]  
        to touch him, the accused, on the genitals. It is obvious that within a class of 45 minutes that there will not be people walking in and out of the room every minute and it is also quite clear that when there is specific work that needs to be done or so preparation for a competition or an important event that the accused would want to limit the interruptions and 45 minutes is a considerable period of time for a teacher and a student to be alone in the room, even though people might come and go at the start or end of those lessons.” 
        
       
      
    102 The Appellant complains that the Crown Prosecutor’s address completely distorted the essence of the evidence in Exhibit 1. It had not been the aim of the Appellant to show complete 45-minute lessons. The Appellant had edited 18 master tapes and made a videotape of short duration especially for the court proceedings. The Appellant submitted that the Crown had misled the jury by suggesting that the jury “might get a very distorted impression” and by suggesting that the “movements in and out” of the room had been selectively recorded. 
     
      
    103 The Crown submits that the arguments of the Crown Prosecutor on this issue were entirely appropriate. It was consistent with evidence of A to the effect that “the video [has] been compiled especially to fish out those interruptions” and “every excerpt of every student has people coming in, that is definitely not the frequency people were coming in” (T55). The Appellant’s evidence was to a similar effect (T146, T168-169, T184).  
     
      
    104 The Crown points to the defence closing address on this issue (T29.1, 29 August 2005): 
     
      
       
        
        “Now the accused gave his evidence and I just remind you of this, he was not obliged to give any evidence. He explained how the video, Exhibit 1, came into existence and it was an extract from a larger video and so too is Exhibit A which the Crown produced. So there’s a large body of material and he’s produced two videos. One video he’s produced from that material recently to show that there were a lot of interruptions and of course, look it’s a matter of common sense ladies and gentlemen, you don’t have to be a genius to work this one out, that the interruption shown, if that is unrealistic it’s not - they’re not coming in every - it’s all been cut and edited, but it just shows that there were interruptions.” 
        
       
       
      Decision 
       
      
    105 There is no substance in Ground 6(iii). There was no issue at trial that Exhibit 1 contained edited selections for the purpose of demonstrating persons coming in and out of the room during lessons. The submissions made by the Crown Prosecutor were both open on the evidence and appropriate.  
     
      
    106 The principles which guide a prosecutor’s function when addressing a jury in a criminal trial are well known: R v Livermore (2006) 67 NSWLR 659 at 665-671; Causevic v R [2008] NSWCCA 238 at [3]-[6]. No breach of these principles has been demonstrated with respect to Ground 6(iii). We reject that ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Alignment on the  
      “Same Side” 
       as the Jury (Ground 6(iv)) 
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    107 By Ground 6(iv), the Appellant complains with respect to part of the Crown’s closing address concerning the status of a Crown Prosecutor. The Crown Prosecutor said to the jury (T1.27, 26 August 2005): 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown has brought these very serious charges against the accused on behalf of the community.” 
        
       
      
    108 The Appellant submits that this statement was erroneous, prejudicial and unfair. He submits that the Crown did not represent the community, but the police, as part of the State, against him. He submits that the jury represents the community and that, by saying that the Crown was acting on behalf of the community, the Crown Prosecutor placed the jury and the Prosecutor on the “same side” of the proceedings against him. 
     
      
    109 The Crown submits there was no error in the remarks of the Crown Prosecutor, which were consistent with the trial judge’s opening comments to the jury (T14): 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown Prosecutor presents the charges in the name of the State and on behalf of the community.” 
        
       
       
      The Crown observes that the Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book (published by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales) contains a proposed direction, by way of initial remarks to the jury, which includes the following (at [1-520]): 
       
       
        
        “Let me introduce the lawyers to you. The barrister sitting  
        […]  
        is the Crown prosecutor. In a criminal case, the Crown prosecutor presents the charge(s) in the name of the State, and on behalf of the community. By tradition, the Crown prosecutor is not referred to by personal name but as, in this case,  
        [Mr/Ms]  
        Crown.” 
        
       
       
      Decision 
       
      
    110 There is no substance in this ground of appeal. In the course of rejecting a similar ground of appeal in Skipworth v R [2006] NSWCCA 37, Mason P (Barr and Hall JJ agreeing) said at [44]-[48]: 
     
      
       
        
        “44 The appellant’s principal complaint relates to the references to the prosecutor bringing the charges ‘on behalf of the community as a whole and because he does that acts on behalf of the community’ (second passage) and to the jury itself being representative of the community (fourth passage). The separation of the two observations (they are a page apart in the transcript) makes it hard for the appellant to establish the sinister secondary implication sought to be drawn, ie that both prosecutor and jury were in some way ‘on the same side’. The lastmentioned words were never used nor, in my view, were they implied. After all, the jury were well aware that they were to become the factual arbiters of an adversary contest in which the Crown had to establish its case beyond reasonable doubt. This understanding would have been reinforced throughout the course of the trial. 
         
         
        45 Furthermore, each comment was accurate in its own context; and would have been understood in that context by the jury.  
         
         
        46 As regards the prosecution, the point being made was that the charges were not being advanced in a private capacity. A traditional monarchist might cavil at using any term other than ‘the Crown’ to denote the official role of the prosecution arm. But monarchists and republicans of all shades know that prosecutions for serious crimes in modern Australia are conducted by an arm of government. They also know that this arm must prove its case with evidence duly admitted, in accordance with the directions of the trial judge and to the criminal standard of proof. Because ‘in the eyes of the jury the prosecutor is the State… the prosecutor must refrain from doing anything which might improperly influence the jury and deny the defendant a fair trial’ ( 
        Alister v The Queen 
         (1984) 154 CLR 404 at 429-30 per Murphy J). 
         
         
        47 As regards the jury itself, it is commonplace to refer to its representative nature. Many recent amendments to the Jury Act have sought to achieve this goal more completely, as the High Court acknowledged in  
        Cheatle v The Queen 
         (1993) 177 CLR 541 at 560. Indeed, juries have been discharged if the right of challenge has been exercised in a manner clearly opposed to that aim ( 
        R v A Judge of District Courts & Shelley; Ex parte Attorney General 
         [1991] 1 Qd R 170. Cf R v Su [1997] 1 VR 1). See generally Michael Chesterman, ‘Criminal Trial Juries in Australia: From Penal Colonies to Federal Democracy’ in N Vidmar, ed, World Jury Systems, OUP 2000). The random process for selecting the panel and balloting the jurors to be called were alone sufficient to bring the point home to the instant jury.  
         
         
        48 The often encountered reference to the jury representing the community also conveys and reinforces the idea that they are not to be overawed by the (specialist) lawyers or by individuals in their own ranks. As lay people they were to apply common (ie community) sense to their particular role in the trial.” 
        
       
      
    111 The Crown Prosecutor’s comment concerning the role of a prosecutor was accurate and consistent with authority and practice. To the extent that the ground of appeal contends that the comment might have led the jury to believe that the jury and the Crown Prosecutor were “on the same side”, we reject the ground for the same reasons expressed by Mason P in Skipworth v R. In any event, we note that no complaint was made by defence counsel about the Crown Prosecutor’s use of this phrase. 
     
      
    112 We reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Failure to Prove Elements to Requisite Standard (Part Ground 7) 
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    113 Parts of Ground 7 have been touched upon earlier in this judgment. In summary, the Appellant submits in support of Ground 7, that the Crown bore an onus to prove the following matters beyond reasonable doubt: 
     
      
       
      (a) A’s ability to perform as a concert pianist whilst under stress in July 1997; 
       
       
      (b) the circumstances of A leaving Mr Thomson’s house and moving to the Appellant’s house in October 1999; and 
       
       
      (c) the date of A’s last piano performance in Sydney in 1997. 
       
      
    114 The Crown submits that this argument is misconceived. Insofar as Ground 7 contends that there was error in the statement of legal principles concerning burden and standard of proof and the presumption of innocence, the Crown submits that the trial judge correctly directed the jury that what the Crown had to prove were the elements or ingredients of the offences and not every statement or fact in issue (SU13). The Crown submits that the directions to the jury with respect to the onus and standard of proof and the continuation of the presumption of innocence were correct (SU11). 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    115 The Appellant has not demonstrated any error in the directions of the trial judge with respect to onus and standard of proof and the presumption of innocence. Insofar as the Appellant contends that it was necessary for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt the three matters referred to at [113] above, the argument is misconceived. It was for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt the elements or ingredients of the offences. The factual matters raised by the Appellant under this ground were issues raised at the trial. They were the subject of proper directions to the jury. It was for the jury, as the tribunal of fact, to decide whether it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the Appellant. 
     
      
    116 No error has been demonstrated in this respect nor has the Appellant established a miscarriage of justice. We reject that part of Ground 7 which raises these matters. 
     
      
       
      Criticism of Defence Witnesses (Part Ground 7) 
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    117 Under the umbrella of Ground 7, the Appellant submits that the Crown Prosecutor unfairly attacked defence witnesses in the Crown closing address. The Appellant points to the Crown’s reference to “pseudo expert evidence from the defence witnesses” (see [43] above). The Appellant also complains concerning the following part of the Crown closing address (T5.25, 26 August 2005): 
     
      
       
        
        “Firstly, the views of witnesses as to the truthfulness of the principal Crown witness, does not matter, because it is your judgment that matters. Obviously witnesses such as Mr Koltakov, the accused’s son-in-law and Mr Zozulya are not impartial judges. They have closed their minds, in fact they have prejudged the matter before even hearing the allegations. They have a bias towards the accused and a prejudice against Mr  
        [A] 
        . That is why they could not be on a jury to judge this matter because they are not impartial, like you are. They make judgments before they hear the evidence presented and explored. They do not allow themselves to consider that there might be some truth to Mr  
        [A] 
        ’s allegations.” 
        
       
      
    118 The Appellant submits that this submission was unfair and insulting to these defence witnesses.  
     
      
    119 The Crown submits that the trial prosecutor was not unfairly discrediting witnesses in her address to the jury. In suggesting that the witnesses, Mr Zozulya and Mr Koltakov, were not impartial, the Crown was accurately summarising the effect of the evidence of those witnesses. In respect of Mr Zozulya, the cross-examination reveals that he stopped being friends with A as soon as he reported the matter to police, that he will never believe the allegations and nothing he hears will ever cause him to change his mind about it (T194, T196, T197-198, T202-203). In respect of Mr Koltakov, the cross-examination reveals that he made up his mind about A’s allegations being untrue on the basis of A never having discussed the matter with him and said he would never allow himself to believe otherwise. The fact of Mr Koltakov’s marriage to the Appellant’s daughter was also raised in several places throughout the trial (T216, T217-218). 
     
      
    120 The Crown points to the following statement by defence counsel to the trial judge, in the absence of the jury (T88): 
     
      
       
        
        “Well to demonstrate that he has a bias or something of that nature, that’s possible your Honour. But that would be on the face of it apparent anyway by way of the Crown’s cross examination of Koltakov to indicate that he’s married to the daughter of the accused. And that would be sufficient and enough for the Crown then to address the jury in that respect and ask them to discount his evidence accordingly.” 
        
       
      
    121 The suggestion of a lack of impartiality having clearly been put to these witnesses in cross-examination, the Crown submits that there was no error in the Crown Prosecutor’s closing remarks: R v Teasdale (2004) 145 A Crim R 345. While the Crown must be fair, there is no requirement that the prosecutor cannot criticise a witness: Cornelius and Briggs v R (1988) 34 A Crim R 49.  
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    122 In our view, there is no substance in this part of Ground 7. The Crown Prosecutor cross-examined the defence witnesses in a manner which laid the foundation for a submission that each was biased in favour of the Appellant and against A. It was clearly understood by defence counsel during evidence that this was the nature of the Crown challenge which lay the foundation for the ultimate Crown submission. Closing addresses were made against this background. The trial judge touched on this issue during summing up (SU7): 
     
      
       
        
        “Whilst I am on this topic I will just touch briefly on the evidence of those witnesses called by the accused to whom the Crown prosecutor suggested that they did not believe the complainant’s evidence. What they believe is irrelevant to your consideration. The purpose of the Crown prosecutor asking that question of those witnesses called by the accused was to attempt to demonstrate that those witnesses were biased in the accused’s favour; that is, that they had not approached the matter objectively. Each of those witnesses agreed with the Crown prosecutor’s proposition that he or she would never believe the complainant, no matter what evidence was presented. They, of course, are entitled to their opinion because they are not entrusted with the responsibility that you have here in the case. But it is important that you understand that their opinion as to the accused’s guilt is not relevant to the task that you have to perform. It is only relevant to your assessment of their evidence as witnesses.” 
        
       
      
    123 There is no merit in the Appellant’s submission in support of this ground. The Crown Prosecutor laid the foundation through cross-examination for the submission ultimately made to the jury. The trial judge left the issue to the jury in an accurate fashion. No further direction was sought by defence counsel.  
     
      
    124 A Crown Prosecutor may be robust and be expected and required to conduct the prosecution conscientiously and firmly: Libke v The Queen [2007] 230 CLR 559 at 557 [35], 586 [71]. A firm and positive presentation of the Crown case is to be expected: R v Livermore at 660-671 [51]. No breach of the prosecutor’s duty has been demonstrated, nor has it been demonstrated that a miscarriage of justice occurred.  
     
      
    125 We reject this part of Ground 7. 
     
      
       
      Attack on the Appellant’s Character (Part Ground 7) 
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    126 Still under the umbrella of Ground 7, the Appellant contends that the Crown unfairly attacked his character. He pointed to a number of questions put to him in cross-examination by the Crown including questions such as “But you really exercised a great control over his mind, didn’t you?”, “You reacted with anger, when he didn’t do things you wanted?”, “And you reflected in the glory that came to [A], didn’t you?” and “Because his success ultimately reflected well on you didn’t it?” 
     
      
    127 The Crown summarises the Appellant’s complaint under this heading as being that the Crown Prosecutor attacked his character in circumstances where he was not able to raise evidence of good character in his defence, due to the risk of the Crown then being able to lead evidence from other witnesses about being sexually assaulted by the Appellant. The Crown submits that the passages relied upon by the Appellant do not demonstrate that the Crown attacked his character, or raised evidence of bad character, in the trial. Descriptions of the Appellant being “in a position of power and authority” and “a position of trust”, and of the Appellant being “a dominant figure”, were used (without objection by defence counsel) by the trial judge in her summing up (SU31). The Crown points to Mr Zozulya’s acceptance that the Appellant was “strict” (T199) and Mr Koltakov’s acceptance that the Appellant was “a very persuasive and charismatic figure” who “demanded” much of his students (T222).  
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    128 In our view, this part of Ground 7 is misconceived. The propositions put in cross-examination to the Appellant were appropriate in the context of the trial. We do not accept that the Crown was raising bad character. It is clear that one of the issues in the trial was the extent to which the Appellant exercised a degree of control over A, which may throw light upon the circumstances in which the offences charged were said to have occurred, his ability to continue to perform as a concert pianist and A’s reasons for not making earlier complaint with respect to them. 
     
      
    129 We reject this part of Ground 7. 
     
      
       
      The Use of the Word  
      “Harem” 
       (Part Ground 7 and Ground 8) 
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    130 Also under the umbrella of Ground 7, and also contained in Ground 8, is a complaint by the Appellant that the trial miscarried because of the unfair conduct of the Crown Prosecutor with respect to the trial separation rule. The Appellant’s submission arises from the use of the word “harem” by the Crown Prosecutor in her closing address (T4.34, 26 August 2005): 
     
      
       
        
        “Actually I’ve intruded into my third point that the accused was a power figure, both at the school at the Ukraine and at the Australian Institute of Music. You can see that he was a very dominant and domineering personality and from all accounts of his students, he was a strict teacher and that is obviously how he got the results with all these prize winning students in his - I don’t know what the word is, not a harem, but in his group. He obviously has an enormous skill and he applied that along with measures of strict discipline and control.” 
        
       
      
    131 The Appellant submits that the use of the word “harem” in this context was prejudicial and dangerous, suggesting that the Appellant was sexually active with other students apart from A. He points to the fact that defence counsel complained about the Crown’s use of the term (T14, 26 August 2005). The following discussion ensued after defence counsel raised the issue (T14.55, 26 August 2005): 
     
      
       
        
        “HER HONOUR: Yes, well my note was the Crown said ‘not a harem’, she was looking for a word to describe the group and specifically said, ‘not a harem’, which I agree is unfortunate, but I’m quite sure the Crown wouldn’t be going back to it. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, No. No I was trying to think of a word for a group of people united about a common theme, around a person who travelled with him. I wasn’t intending to convey that there was - it was for sexual exploitation or anything, but I - I did hesitate over it, I was struggling to find an appropriate collective noun. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Yes, it was just an - it was unfortunate that that was the one you came up with, but I don’t believe it’s going to cause any problems Mr Russell. You’ll have an opportunity over the weekend to consider it and you will have second address. I certainly don’t intend to say anything about it. 
        
       
       
        
        RUSSELL: No, I wouldn’t ask your Honour to either.” 
        
       
      
    132 The Crown submits that the use of the phrase “not a harem” should be considered in the context of the passage in which it was used. It was said, in a search for the correct word, and then immediately withdrawn. The Crown acknowledges that it was a poor choice of noun, but not one likely to jeopardise the fairness of the trial.  
     
      
    133 The Crown notes that the Appellant’s submission goes further to suggest that the jury should immediately have been discharged upon the use of the word “harem” because the principle of trial separation had been breached by suggesting that other students living with he Appellant were also involved in sexual activities with him. The Crown submits that, viewed in context, the use of the word does not carry the inference suggested by the Appellant and fell far short of necessitating a discharge of the jury. The Crown submits that it is significant that defence counsel did not ask for a discharge of the jury and agreed that the trial judge should not say anything to the jury about it.  
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    134 It is necessary to consider the Appellant’s complaint concerning the use of the word “harem” in context. It was an unfortunate choice of word, but its context (and the later explanation) support the view that it was proffered in a hesitant (and negative) fashion and then withdrawn. There was no repetition of the use of the word. Defence counsel made no application for discharge of the jury then or when the trial resumed the following week. He addressed the jury and the summing up of the trial judge followed.  
     
      
    135 In the context of the trial, the use of this word on one occasion does not give rise to a breach of the trial separation rule, or the principles underlying that rule. It has not been demonstrated that a miscarriage of justice resulted. 
     
      
    136 We reject that part of Ground 7 which raises this issue together with Ground 8. 
     
      
       
      Ground 9 - The Acquittal of the Appellant on Count 9 Demonstrates that the Convictions on Counts 1 to 8 Were Unreasonable 
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    137 The Appellant submits that the jury’s acquittal on Count 9 is inconsistent with convictions on Counts 1 to 8, so that those verdicts are unreasonable and ought be quashed. He submits that the jury did not believe A concerning Count 9 and that this reasonable doubt ought to have flowed on to the other eight counts. The Appellant refers to Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439.  
     
      
    138 The Crown submits that it has not been demonstrated that the verdicts on Counts 1 to 8 were unreasonable because of the acquittal with respect to Count 9. The Crown submits that the trial judge directed the jury, in accordance with R v Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82, that any doubt they had about A’s reliability on any one count must be taken into account in relation to every other count, before the jury can be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the honesty and accuracy of his evidence on all other counts sufficient to convict the Appellant (SU9-10).  
     
      
    139 The Crown submits that, in light of the very strong direction given to the jury on this issue, it is safe to assume that the points raised by the defence in relation to Count 9 raised some doubt in the jury’s collective mind sufficient to return a verdict of not guilty on that count. The main points raised by the defence with respect to the ninth count were: 
     
      
       
      (a) differences between what A said in his statement to police and in his evidence at trial (including whether the Appellant pulled down A’s pants or undid his fly (T76.10) and not telling the police about the call from the Appellant telling him to  
      “pack his bags and go” 
       from Mr Thomson’s house); 
       
       
      (b) A’s failure to tell his friends, Mr Zozulya and Mr Koltakov, with whom he was living; 
       
       
      (c) the inability of A to be particular about the time of day that the alleged assault occurred (T75.10); and  
       
       
      (d) a lack of opportunity for the offence to have occurred in light of it being a busy house with eight people living there. 
       
      
    140 The Crown submits that a further available explanation, other than inconsistent verdicts, is that the jury decided that convictions on eight out of nine counts was sufficient to reflect the total criminality of the Appellant’s conduct, and there was therefore no point in deciding whether or not the issues raised in the preceding paragraph did leave, in their minds, a reasonable doubt with respect to Count 9: R v Markuleski at 100 [76] (per Spigelman CJ) and 115 [144] (per Wood CJ at CL). 
     
      
    141 The Crown points to statements in R v Markuleski by Spigelman CJ (at 117 [153]) and Wood CJ at CL (at 130-132 [233], [236]) that the fact of differing verdicts is but one matter to be considered on review, in context, alongside all of the other circumstances of the case. Other relevant circumstances to consider include the type and strength of directions given to the jury by the trial judge. In addition to the clear R v Markuleski given on inconsistent verdicts referred to above, her Honour gave a full direction in accordance with Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 (SU31-32), a direction in accordance with Crofts v The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 427 (SU28-30) and a direction in accordance with R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 (SU24-25).  
     
      
    142 The Crown submits that, in addition to what the jury may consider to reflect the totality of the criminality, there are infinite other possible bases for an acquittal on one count and guilty verdicts on the others. In this respect, the Crown points to examples provided by Wood CJ at CL in R v Markuleski at 131 [235] that: 
     
      
       
      (a) the complainant has conceded the possibility of faulty recollection, in relation to the details of the event the subject of the charge on which the accused was acquitted; 
       
       
      (b) there was a lack of particularity as to time or place in relation to such charge;  
       
       
      (c) the accused has called positive evidence in relation to the charge or charges on which he was acquitted, but not in relation to the others. 
       
      
    143 The Crown submits that each of these examples could be found here with respect to the matters mentioned at [139], namely: 
     
      
       
      (a) the inconsistency in A’s evidence regarding the Appellant taking his pants down and the Appellant telling him to leave Mr Thomson’s house; 
       
       
      (b) A not being particular about the time of the Count 9 offence other than it occurring in daylight; and 
       
       
      (c) the evidence which was particular to this offence such as not telling his close friends and lack of opportunity due to the busy household. 
       
      
    144 The Crown submits that R v Markuleski provides strong authority for the proposition that where an appropriate direction is given (as was the case here), it may alleviate the concern which might otherwise subsequently arise, where differing verdicts are returned in relation to multi-count indictments. As Wood CJ at CL stated in R v Markuleski at 135 [258]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In such a case, the court may feel greater confidence that the jury has focused closely upon the issues of reliability and credibility of the evidence going to each charge, and has found good cause for differentiating between the individual counts.” 
        
       
       
      Decision 
       
      
    145 The Court’s approach to a ground which asserts the existence of inconsistent verdicts, giving rise to an unreasonable conviction, involves application of several principles. If there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted. In a criminal appeal, the view may be taken that the jury simply followed the judge’s instruction to consider separately the case presented by the Crown in respect of each count and to apply to each count the requirement that all of the ingredients must be proved beyond reasonable doubt: MacKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 367; MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606 at 617. The jury will be instructed (as here) that the evidence of a witness may be accepted in whole or in part: MFA v The Queen at 617. A verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that a complainant has been disbelieved, or a want of confidence in the complainant. It may simply reflect a cautious approach by the jury to the discharge of a heavy responsibility: MFA v The Queen at 617. It may be that the complainant has shown some uncertainty as to matters of detail, or has been shown to have a faulty recollection of some matters, or has been shown otherwise to be more reliable about some parts of his evidence than about others: MFA v The Queen at 617. 
     
      
    146 Ultimately, the question remains one of fact and degree as to whether the difference in verdicts is such that, as a matter of logic and reasonableness, bringing to account a range of factors including the practical approach which juries are entitled to bring to their task, the convictions should be regarded as unreasonable or incapable of being supported by the evidence: R v Markuleski at 132 [238]. 
     
      
    147 We are not persuaded that the acquittal of the jury on Count 9 ought lead this Court to conclude that the convictions on Counts 1 to 8 were unreasonable. Whether or not the failure of the jury to accept A’s version in one respect ought to have led the jury to have a reasonable doubt with respect to other matters, must depend upon the full range of relevant circumstances that go to an assessment of credibility and reliability. It was open to the jury to accept some parts of A’s evidence and not others. There is no automatic consequence flowing from an acquittal on one count with respect to other counts. It is a question of fact and degree in each case and the variation in fact and degree will differ from case to case: R v Markuleski at 93 [36]. 
     
      
    148 There were issues relied upon by the defence with respect to Count 9 which may serve to explain the different position taken by the jury concerning that count as opposed to the remaining counts (see [139], [142]-[143] above). We accept the Crown submissions in this regard. As Wood CJ at CL observed in R v Markuleski at 127 [221], in the context of a system of justice that requires proof of criminality beyond reasonable doubt, the occurrence of different verdicts is to be expected and is understandable. Acquittal does not amount to a positive finding that the act alleged did not occur or that the evidence of the complainant concerning it was rejected as a lie, or as lacking in credibility. 
     
      
    149 In this case, there was a rational basis for the jury to discriminate and return a verdict of not guilty on Count 9 whilst being satisfied to the necessary standard upon A’s evidence in support of Count 1-8. Count 9 was a separate incident, removed in time and place from the other counts. There was some uncertainty on A’s part as to matters of detail in Count 9. Like R v Markuleski, this is not a case where there was such an integral connection between the counts, or where there were other circumstances present, such as to compel the conclusion that A’s overall credibility or reliability was so diminished that the guilty verdicts should, for that reason, be overturned. 
     
      
    150 The Appellant has not demonstrated that the verdicts on Counts 1 to 8 were unreasonable or that a miscarriage of justice has otherwise occurred. We reject the ninth ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 10 – Error in Admission of Context Evidence Involving Events in Ukraine Which Had Not Been Investigated in that Jurisdiction 
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    151 The Appellant submits that the trial judge erred in not rejecting the context evidence of A concerning sexual acts committed by the Appellant upon him in Ukraine. The Appellant’s argument is that this evidence should have been excluded because the events did not happen in Australia and were not investigated by Australian or Ukrainian police.  
     
      
    152 The Appellant does not contend that the context evidence should not have been introduced at all. He accepts that it could be admitted because it was relevant to A’s failure to complain and to place events in context (page 85, Appellant’s written submissions). However, the Appellant contends that such evidence could only be introduced on the basis of legal investigation in Ukraine. As the alleged acts had not been investigated in Ukraine, it ought not to have been admitted.  
     
      
    153 The Crown submits that the Appellant’s argument in this respect is misconceived. There is no requirement that the relevant conduct must occur within the jurisdiction of New South Wales before it can be admitted as context evidence. Further, there is no requirement for the purpose of admissibility that such evidence be the subject of some official investigation before it can be admitted.  
     
      
    154 The Crown submits that the trial judge gave very clear directions to the jury about the permitted use of this evidence at the time when it was led from A (T41) and during the summing up (SU41). 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    155 The Appellant’s submissions underlying Ground 10 are misconceived. The law does not provide that sexual acts must occur within New South Wales before evidence of them is admissible as context evidence. Further, there was no requirement that A’s allegation of sexual acts by the Appellant committed against him in Ukraine must be subjected to some type of official investigation before it could be admitted at trial as context evidence. It is notable that no such arguments were advanced by defence counsel at trial.  
     
      
    156 The Appellant does not contend that the context evidence should not have been admitted for any other reason. 
     
      
    157 The trial judge gave clear directions to the jury concerning the permitted use of context evidence at the time it was led from A, and again during the summing up. No further direction was sought by defence counsel in this respect. No error has been established nor has a miscarriage of justice been demonstrated. 
     
      
    158 We reject Ground 10.  
     
      
       
      Ground 11 - The Trial Miscarried Through the Failure to Provide the Appellant with Simultaneous Headphone Translation Facilities 
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    159 The Appellant submits that the trial miscarried given the failure to provide simultaneous headphone translation, or proper conditions for simultaneous translation. Although acknowledging that an interpreter was available and assisted for the purpose of the trial (including his own evidence) the Appellant submits that he was prejudiced through the failure to utilise simultaneous headphone translation of a type he said was used in international tribunals.  
     
      
    160 He submits that the right to an interpreter means not only having access to an interpreter, but a right to fully understand the content of court proceedings and to be fully understood by all parties. He submits that only simultaneous translation, as an international standard of a fair trial, could guarantee a protection of such rights. In the absence of such an approach, he submits that a miscarriage of justice has resulted. 
     
      
    161 The Crown observes that the Appellant’s complaint in relation to interpreter services is not that he did not have access to an interpreter, but that he did not have simultaneous headphone translation, something that he asserts is required by international law. The Crown submits that there is no right to such services in this State. In fact, because of the Appellant’s competency in the English language, the Crown submits that it is unlikely that he would have been permitted to give his evidence wholly through an interpreter, had he sought to do so in accordance with s.30 Evidence Act 1995. 
     
      
    162 The Crown notes that the Appellant gave evidence in English, although he did have an interpreter present throughout the giving of his evidence to offer him assistance should he require it. The interpreter assisted briefly on only four occasions throughout the evidence of the Appellant (T147, T170, T172 and T178). On the whole, the Appellant did not need the assistance of the interpreter. 
     
      
    163 With respect to the Appellant’s reliance upon a number of passages from the transcript in support of the contention that he did not receive a fair trial due to the absence of simultaneous headphone translation, the Crown submits that the claim is not made out when the examples cited from cross-examination are examined closely. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    164 In the context of appeals from convictions at criminal trials, consideration has been given to the provision of an interpreter for an accused person and the quality of interpreting services: De La Espriella-Velasco v The Queen (2006) 197 FLR 125 (WA Court of Criminal Appeal); R v Rostom (2007) 98 SASR 528 (SA Court of Criminal Appeal). These authorities do not support the Appellant’s argument that there was an obligation to provide simultaneous headphone translation facilities to ensure a fair trial. 
     
      
    165 An examination of the complete transcript of the trial does not indicate that any unfairness arose with respect to interpreting during the trial. An interpreter was available throughout to assist the Appellant, if required, to follow the trial. Defence counsel made clear at the commencement of the Appellant’s examination in chief (T139.46): 
     
      
       
        
        “RUSSELL: Q. Now Mr Makarov, you understand that we’d like you to try your best in English to answer the questions. If there’s anything that you don’t understand from anything that I ask you or Madam Crown or her Honour, you must say straight away and with the assistance of the interpreter you may be able to answer that question? 
         
        A. Understood thank you.” 
        
       
       
      The Appellant thereafter gave evidence (T139-185) almost entirely in English, in circumstances where the interpreter was present to assist if required.  
       
      
    166 The entitlement to a fair trial under statute or common law does not extend to a requirement that simultaneous translation facilities must be provided. Defence counsel did not submit in this case that such facilities were either necessary nor desirable. No complaint was made by defence counsel during the trial concerning the nature and quality of the interpreter services available to the Appellant.  
     
      
    167 It is not entirely irrelevant to this ground that the Appellant appeared for himself at the hearing of this appeal on 5 and 6 May 2008. Detailed handwritten submissions were filed by him for the purpose of the appeal. The Appellant addressed the Court in a manner which, in our view, allowed him to do justice to his case. Although the trial of the Appellant took place in August 2005, his ability to communicate in the English language prior to and for the purposes of this appeal does not assist him on the present ground.  
     
      
    168 It has not been demonstrated that any miscarriage of justice or unfairness resulted because of the nature of the interpreter facilities available to the Appellant during the trial. We reject the eleventh ground.  
     
      
       
      Ground 12 - the Trial Miscarried as a Result of Improper Investigation and the Conduct of the Trial in Relation to Time of the Essence of Counts 4-8 Involving Misconduct of Trial Judge and Crown Prosecutor 
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    169 The Appellant submits that time was of the essence for the offences charged in Counts 4-8 in the indictment. He refers to the decision of this Court in R v Kennedy (2000) 118 A Crim R 34.  
     
      
    170 The Appellant points to the evidence of A and Mr Thomson that the very last performance of A in Sydney in July 1997 was on 13 July 1997. He repeats the submission made earlier with respect to Grounds 2 and 7 that A’s very last performance in Sydney in that month was in fact that given at the Ukrainian People House at Lidcombe on 16 July 1997. He refers to parts of the Crown closing address and the summing up, which referred to A’s last or final performance as being the solo recital at the Pitt Street Uniting Church on 13 July 1997. He submits that the trial miscarried because of this focus on A’s last performance as being one on 13 July 1997, and not 16 July 1997. He contends that these circumstances rendered time of the essence in the indictment so that a miscarriage of justice has resulted. 
     
      
    171 The Crown submits that the Appellant’s claim that time was made of the essence in relation to Counts 4-8, is misconceived. The indictment averred that those offences took place between 13 and 19 July 1997. The evidence of A was that the sexual assaults which were the basis of Counts 4-8, took place after he had performed at the Pitt Street Uniting Church in Sydney. The unchallenged evidence of Mr Thomson was that that concert took place on 13 July 1997 (T111.20).  
     
      
    172 The Crown submits that Ground 12 is, in truth, a rehash of the points advanced by the Appellant in relation to earlier grounds. The Crown submits that this ground of appeal ought be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    173 The indictment alleged that each of the offences charged in Counts 4-8 had been committed between 13 July 1997 and 19 July 1997. It was the Crown case that these offences had been committed after A had performed at the Pitt Street Uniting Church at Sydney on 13 July 1997. The Crown case on these counts remained, from beginning to end, one that involved an allegation of sexual offences by the Appellant against A after the 13 July 1997 concert. 
     
      
    174 The arguments advanced by the Appellant in support of this ground involve several misconceptions. The decision of this Court in R v Kennedy provides no assistance to him. This is not a case where the Crown sought to amend the indictment to enlarge the period in which it was alleged the crime had been committed. Nor is it a case where there is an issue that the alleged offences happened at some time outside the period charged in the indictment. 
     
      
    175 The Appellant’s argument in support of this ground is effectively the same as that considered and rejected with respect to earlier grounds. The Court did not admit as fresh evidence the article from “Ukrainian Weekly in Australia”. However, even if that evidence had been admitted, it would only have raised an issue (and a false issue) that A had in fact given a short impromptu performance to a small group on 16 July 1997, so that it may not have been strictly correct to describe the Pitt Street Uniting Church concert on 13 July 1997 as his last performance in Sydney. As mentioned earlier in this judgment (at [85]), it might be concluded that neither the Appellant nor A had a conscious recollection of the impromptu performance on 16 July 1997, although both had been present at it, but neither referred to it at trial. 
     
      
    176 To the extent that Ground 12 advances submissions previously rejected with respect to other grounds, we similarly reject the arguments here. No error has been established nor has the Appellant demonstrated that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.  
     
      
    177 In our view, there is no substance in Ground 12 and it ought be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    178 We have considered each of the grounds advanced by the Appellant in support of his appeal against conviction at Trial 3. None of the grounds has been made good. No error has been demonstrated with respect to the trial and conviction of the Appellant. It has not been demonstrated that the verdicts of guilty returned by the jury were unreasonable or were not supported by the evidence or that a miscarriage of justice has otherwise resulted: s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  
     
      
    179 The appeal against conviction is dismissed. 
     
      
    180 As the appeal against conviction is to be allowed with respect to Trial 4 (Makarov v R (No. 3)), it will be necessary to adjust the sentences imposed for offences against A. The appeal should be relisted for that purpose. 
     
      
    181 The Court proposes to sit at 2.00 pm on 19 December 2008 to consider the question of sentence for offences against A. The Court will set a timetable for written submissions on sentence in advance of that hearing.

    THE COURT 
     
      
       
      Introduction 
       
      
    1 The appellant is a piano teacher from the Ukraine. He came to Australia in July 1998 to take up a position at the Australian Institute of Music. He had previously been head of the piano department at the Kharkov Secondary Special Music Boarding School in the Ukraine. Five of his students immigrated to Australia with him to continue their studies.  
     
      
    2 In around August 1999, the appellant took on a student in Australia, D, who was then 10 years old. D had piano lessons about four times a week and the two families became quite close. 3 At the end of January 2004, D told his mother that the appellant had been sexually assaulting him over the past 18 months. D’s parents confronted the appellant at his home. The appellant denied the allegations. He then contacted three of the students who had come with him to Australia from the Ukraine and arranged for them to come to his home where he informed them of D’s allegations. Some days later, those three students attended Hornsby Police Station where each made allegations that the appellant had sexually assaulted him. The appellant was charged with offences against all four men.  
     
      
    4 An indictment was presented containing counts alleging offences against all four complainants. Latham DCJ directed the separate trial of the counts involving D.  
     
      
    5 On 22 November 2004 the appellant was arraigned before Latham DCJ on an indictment that charged him with 9 sexual offences against D, count 9 being in the alternative to count 8. On 10 December 2004 he was convicted of counts 1 to 7 and count 9. He was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment to date from 10 December 2004 with an effective non-parole period of 8 years for those offences. The non-parole period will expire on 9 December 2012. He has appealed against his conviction for those offences. This judgment deals with that appeal. No appeal is brought against the sentences.  
     
      
    6 On 31 August 2005, following a trial before Hock DCJ and a jury, the appellant was convicted of eight counts involving offences against one of the former students from the Ukraine, A. He was sentenced for those offences on 11 November 2005 to an aggregate sentence of 8 years’ imprisonment to date from 10 December 2012 with an effective non-parole period of four years, which will expire on 9 December 2016. His appeal against his conviction for those offences is dealt with in Makarov v R (No. 2) [2008] NSWCCA 292. 
     
      
    7 On 6 September 2005 the appellant was arraigned before Hock DCJ on an indictment that charged him with 10 sexual offences: counts 1 to 4 involved another former student from the Ukraine, B, and counts 5 to 10 involved a different student, C. On 21 September 2005 he was convicted of each count. He was sentenced for those offences to an aggregate term of nine years’ imprisonment to date from 10 December 2009 with an effective non-parole period of six years to expire on 9 December 2015. His appeal against his conviction for those offences is dealt with in Makarov v R (No. 3) [2008] NSWCCA 293. 
     
      
      The evidence 
       
      
    8 The appellant had a studio at his home at Pymble. D had lessons there on Mondays. On Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays he had lessons at the Institute. D said he also sometimes had lessons on a Friday at his home at Neutral Bay. The appellant said he only ever taught at Pymble on Fridays. Most of the time, D’s father drove him to the lessons. Initially D’s father made a point of remaining with his son during the lessons but that changed as they got to know the Makarov family better. Some time during 2002, at the request of D, D’s father started attending lessons less frequently. D said that when his parents started staying away from lessons and before the appellant began sexually assaulting him, the appellant would sometimes give him chocolate and fruit and commend D on his playing more frequently. 
     
      
    9 Count 1 in the indictment alleged an aggravated act of indecency towards a person under the age of 16 years (namely 13 years) contrary to s 61O(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The circumstance of aggravation in that count, and in all counts on the indictment, was that D was under the appellant’s authority at the time of the offence. The offence was alleged to have occurred between 10 April 2002 and 1 August 2002 at the appellant’s home studio at Pymble.10 In June or July of 2002 D began to prepare the program for a piano competition in Kiev the following year. Part of the program was a piece called the Transcendental Etude by Liszt. When D was learning that piece, the appellant told him that it was about sex and that when the complainant was playing the piece, he should express the act of sex. During one of those lessons, while D was doing an exercise to improve his technical performance of the piece, the appellant exposed his genitals and masturbated while sitting in a chair a few metres away from the piano. When D saw what the appellant was doing he turned his back to the chair. He said he had never seen anyone do that before. The appellant asked D for a tissue box that was behind him and D threw it in the direction of the appellant without looking at him. A short time after that D thought the appellant ejaculated. The appellant then took the tissues to the bathroom.11 Counts 2 and 3 alleged offences committed at the home of D at Neutral Bay. Count 2 alleged an act of aggravated indecent assault on a person under 16 years (namely 13 years) between 30 June 2002 and 1 January 2003 contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act. In late 2002 the appellant was at D’s home in Neutral Bay on a Friday night for a lesson. D was in his study, which was opposite the bathroom. The appellant was in the bathroom. D saw the appellant begin to masturbate. The appellant beckoned D to come to him but he refused. The appellant then came out of the bathroom and grabbed D by the arm and took him into the bathroom where the appellant masturbated himself. The appellant then asked D to masturbate the appellant. D refused and the appellant took D’s hand and put it onto the appellant’s penis forcing D to masturbate him. The appellant was sitting on the bathtub and ejaculated onto the floor of the bathroom.12 Count 3 alleged an act of aggravated indecent assault on a person under the age of 16 years (namely 13 or 14 years) between 1 January 2003 and 1 July 2003 contrary to 61M(1) of the Crimes Act. That was another occasion when the appellant forced D to masturbate him in the bathroom when D was having a lesson at D’s home on a Friday night. 13 The remaining offences were all alleged to have been committed at the appellant’s home at Pymble. Counts 4 to 6 alleged three acts of aggravated indecent assault of a person under the age of 16 years (namely 13 or 14 years) between 1 January 2003 and 31 August 2003 contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act. Count 4 was based on an incident in the studio when D was playing Beethoven’s Sonata No.7. The appellant got up from his chair and walked around the piano stool, sitting down behind D. The appellant put his hand into D’s underpants and started to masturbate him. The appellant told D to keep playing because the appellant’s wife was in the house and if D stopped playing she might think something was strange. D kept playing. When he finished the piece he moved away from the appellant and stood up. The appellant told him that he should not be so moral and that this was for his own good. The appellant said he was giving everything to D and that D should reciprocate.14 Count 5 was based on an incident at the appellant’s home when the appellant and D were in the kitchen on the upstairs floor. D was washing a cup at the sink and the appellant came up behind him with his pants down and forced D to masturbate him until he ejaculated.15 Count 6 was based on an incident when D entered the studio and the appellant told him to close the door and the curtain. After D did so, the appellant grabbed him with both hands at the back of his neck and pulled him forward to kiss him on the lips. The appellant told D to open his mouth but he refused. After the lesson started the appellant told D that he should give more and that D was not free enough with the appellant; that this was all for D’s own good and the development of his musical career.16 Count 7 alleged an aggravated act of indecency towards a person under the age of 16 years (namely 14 years) between 1 August 2003 and 30 September 2003 contrary to s 61O(1) of the Crimes Act. That charge was based on another incident at the appellant’s home. D was playing a piece by Beethoven before a recital due to be given at the Institute. The appellant took D from the studio and upstairs to the study. There was a computer in the study from which the appellant and D had previously downloaded musical performances or educational files from the internet. On this occasion the appellant showed D a gay pornographic video clip downloaded from the Internet. While D was watching the video clip he could hear the appellant masturbating behind him.17 Count 8 alleged an act of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent of a person under the age of 16 years (namely 14 years) knowing that the person did not consent to the sexual intercourse, contrary to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act. Count 9 alleged, in the alternative, an act of aggravated sexual intercourse with a person of the age of 14 years contrary to s 66C(4) of the Crimes Act. That incident was also alleged to have occurred between 1 August 2003 and 30 September 2003. 18 After the gay pornographic video clip referred to in count 7 finished, the appellant closed the program and told D to get up. The appellant grabbed him and took him out of the study and across the corridor into the guest bedroom where he threw him on the bed and pulled his trousers down to his ankles. The appellant then lifted D’s legs and penetrated D’s anus with his penis. D said that continued for about six or seven minutes until the appellant ejaculated inside his anus. The appellant asked D if it was painful and D said that it was. The appellant said, “That’s good” and told D to go and wash himself. D said that he did not consent to the appellant doing that and told him that he didn’t want to. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty on count 8 but guilty on count 9.  
     
      
      Ground 1- alleged perjury of the complainant  
       
      
    19 The appellant represented himself in the appeal. The first ground of appeal was: 
     
      
       
        
        “The trial miscarried and there was a miscarriage of justice as a result of perjury committed by D against the appellant during the proceedings in relation to the evidence concerning (i) the exclusively professional (musical, psychological, psychiatric) issues; (ii) the counts 8,9; (iii) the time frame of the counts 1 to 3; (iv) the chapter from the autobiography and letter to the appellant’s fiftieth birthday; (v) the time factor for counts 1, 4 to 9; (vi) the porno showing and CD’s placement issues – counts 4 to 8; (vii) oral sex issue.” 
        
       
      
    20 The appellant’s submissions in support of ground 1 were divided into two parts. The first, in broad summary, amounted to a contention that D’s allegations against the appellant must be false because, if they were true, D would have suffered psychological injuries and could not have developed a successful career as a concert pianist. The appellant submitted that the Crown had an obligation to call expert evidence as to whether D had suffered any such injuries and whether he could perform at concert level if he had. In the absence of such evidence, so it was contended, the jury could not reasonably have reached its verdicts.  
     
      
    21 The second part of the appellant’s submissions in support of ground 1 was a collection of factual matters said to point unequivocally to the falsity of D’s allegations. 
     
      
    22 There was substantial overlap between ground 1 and grounds 7, 9 and 10. Where appropriate, those grounds are addressed together.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1(i) - absence of expert evidence 
       
      
    23 The appellant submitted that it was a proven fact that D, whilst studying with the appellant, developed a successful career as a concert pianist. He submitted that the occupation of concert pianist requires a person to function at an intellectual and emotional level that is incompatible with the psychological injuries that inevitably flow from sexual abuse and assault. These matters, so it was contended, are beyond the experience of the ordinary juror. The appellant submitted that the Crown ought to have called expert evidence in the trial after professional examination of the complainant (AWS 4.4.1-4.4.16).  
     
      
    24 It was contended that, in the absence of any expert evidence as to psychological injuries suffered by D, the Crown had failed to discharge its burden of proof because such injuries are the inevitable consequence of sexual abuse and assault. The appellant submitted “it was impossible objectively to prove guilt of the appellant without proving the fact of psychological injuries” (AWS 4.4.8). 
     
      
    25 Secondly, it was suggested that the Crown also bore an onus of proving that it is possible to perform successfully at the level of international competitions whilst being under the consequences of sexual abuse and assault. A discrete aspect of the second proposition was the complaint that the Crown prosecutor, having failed to adduce expert evidence on the issue, made a submission to the jury that was beyond her expertise when she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well, you’d understand as adults that people can suppress feelings of great hurt and trauma for a while and outwardly behave normally and pretend that there is nothing troubling them”… (Transcript, 3/12/04 p14 at L44-47). 
        
       
      
    26 The same complaint was made in respect of the absence of expert evidence to support submissions made to the jury by the Crown prosecutor as to the possibility of D continuing to play Beethoven’s Sonata No.7 while being masturbated, as alleged in respect of count 4 (T3.12.04 page 6, L11-14) and her reference to evidence given by D in respect of count 8 that the appellant was strong enough to manhandle D because “committed piano players” develop muscles. 
     
      
    27 A similar ground of appeal was argued by the appellant in each of his other appeals: Makarov v R (No. 2) at [53]-[64]; Makarov v R (No.3) at [87]-[94]. The issue arose in a different context in those appeals because the appellant had at trial called a number of accomplished musical performers as witnesses to give evidence as to what is required of a performer in order to produce a good performance on the piano. No such evidence was adduced in the trial concerning D.  
     
      
    28 The first observation to be made is that the appellant’s submission assumes the absolute truth of the proposition that any psychological injury flowing from sexual abuse precludes the possibility of performing as a successful concert pianist. There is no basis for this Court to accept that proposition as an established premise for the argument. 
     
      
    29 In any event, the submission is misconceived. There could be no obligation on the Crown to adduce expert evidence of the kind identified by the appellant. The propositions contended for by the appellant were not elements of the offence. Even assuming there is a relevant area of musical or psychological expertise, it is doubtful whether such evidence would have been admissible if adduced by the Crown, since it would only have been relevant to the assessment of the existence of the facts in issue because it related to D’s credibility: s 55(2), s 102 of the Evidence Act 1995. 30 There is no force in the complaints as to the submissions put to the jury by the Crown prosecutor. Those submissions went no further than to appeal to the jury on common sense grounds to give favourable consideration to evidence that had been admitted in the trial. They did not trespass into the forbidden territory of offering an expert opinion.  
     
      
    Ground 1 - factual issues 
     
      
    31 The balance of ground 1 raises issues of fact. The appellant alleges a series of inconsistencies and alleged anomalies in the complainant’s evidence with a view to demonstrating its falsity. The Crown’s submissions proceeded on the basis that the import of the complaint was that the jury’s verdicts are unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence: s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
      Ground 1(ii) and Ground 9 - alleged inconsistent verdicts in respect of Counts 8 and 9 
       
      
    32 The appellant’s submissions in support of this part of ground 1 (AWS 4.5.2-4.5.12 at pages 42-46) were duplicated verbatim in the submissions in support of ground 9 (AWS 12.1-12.11 at pages 176-179).  
     
      
    33 The appellant submitted that the Crown’s case was that all charges were based on force. The contention was that the verdict of not guilty in respect of count 8 (which charged sexual intercourse without consent) demonstrates that the jury was not satisfied with the truthfulness of D, and that his truthfulness could not be different in respect of count 9. The implicit conclusion was that the jury must have had a reasonable doubt about count 9. 
     
      
    34 Separately, the appellant identified a number of inconsistencies between D’s evidence in the trial and previous statements, which he said proved D’s perjury in respect of count 9. Nothing in those submissions leads the Court to conclude that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of count 9.35 We are not satisfied that there is any inconsistency between the jury’s verdicts in respect of counts 8 and 9. They were charged as alternative counts. The difference between the elements of the two charges was the requirement in respect of count 8 to prove that the sexual intercourse took place without the consent of D and that the appellant knew that D did not consent. The two verdicts may readily be reconciled by reference to those elements. The jury could have arrived at the different verdicts, either on the basis that they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of lack of consent on the part of D, or on the basis that they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant must have known that D did not consent.  
     
      
    36 As noted in the submissions for the Crown, the evidence as to lack of consent, and the appellant’s knowledge that D was not consenting, was not strong. In D’s first account of the incident, he did not mention lack of consent. The Crown prosecutor returned to the issue, specifically asking him whether he consented to the appellant penetrating his anus. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “No. No, no. I told him I didn’t want to, you know, once – yeah” (T48.17). 
        
       
      
    37 In cross-examination, D was asked whether he was struggling as he was being manhandled from the office into the guest bedroom. He responded that he was, but described it as “sort of a token resistance in a way” (T204.34). At the conclusion of D’s evidence, before excusing the jury for the day, the trial Judge explained that the cross-examination as to whether D struggled related to the issue of consent, which was relevant to count 8. Her Honour observed that no other count on the indictment required the Crown to prove any element of lack of consent (T256.24-40). The Judge gave careful directions in her summing up as to the elements of the two charges and noted that it would be open to the jury to convict on the alternative count if the Crown had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that D was not consenting (SU 30-31). We are not persuaded that the different verdicts on counts 8 and 9 were unreasonable, or that they cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. Ground 9 is dismissed.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1(iii) and part of Ground 10 - the time frame for counts 1 to 3  
       
      
    38 The appellant submitted that evidence in the trial directly contradicted the dates of the offences alleged in counts 1 to 3 in the indictment (AWS 4.6-4.7.1). This submission was expanded in ground 10 where it was contended that these were offences where time was “of the essence”: cf R v Kennedy (2000) 118 A Crim R 34; [2000] NSWCCA 487 (AWS 13.1-13.3.3). Kennedy was a peculiar case. The complainant’s evidence confined the time of the offence to a specific period that was objectively ascertainable (the duration of the live broadcast of the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana).  
     
      
    39 That was not the position in the present case. Count 1 alleged that the offence occurred between 10 April 2002 and 1 August 2002. There was no feature of any of the offences that made time essential. The range of dates specified in the indictment was not a material averment, since it did not form an essential part of the offence: Dossi (1918) 13 Cr App R 158; R v VHP (unreported) Court of Criminal Appeal, 7 July 1997; R v Stringer [2000] NSWCCA 293; 116 A Crim R 198. 
     
      
    40 In any event, the matters relied on did not demonstrate that the offences could not have occurred within the dates alleged. The appellant submitted that D’s father gave evidence that the period when he gradually stopped staying through the whole lesson and waited outside the studio was from August to September 2002 (after the date range in the indictment). That is not an accurate summary of the evidence. D’s father was not specific as to those dates, describing the period in question as “stretchable”, and possibly starting around May (T272.47). 41 The appellant noted D’s evidence that he asked his parents not to come to the piano lessons because without them the quality of lessons was allegedly much better, suggesting the molestation started after he made that request. D’s evidence (T33.33) was that he began to prepare the program for the Kiev competition in, he thought, June/July of 2002. The sexual explanation of the Transcendental Etude began “during this time” (T33.38) and carried on “for a few lessons” (T34.1) after which the masturbation incident occurred. That evidence did not contradict the time frame in the indictment, nor the father’s evidence as to when he stopped attending the lessons.  
     
      
    42 A further submission was based on the evidence that D wrote an autobiography which included a chapter praising the appellant. The appellant’s case was that D’s praise for the appellant in the autobiography was inconsistent with the allegations of sexual molestation. D’s evidence was that he handed in the autobiography at the end of second term, which was on 28 June 2002. However, he said that he had written the autobiography well before the sexual molestation began (T195.5). There is no contradiction established.  
     
      
    43 The final complaint was that the complainant wrote a letter to the appellant for his fiftieth birthday with similar content. That letter was dated 13 September 2003 – there was no doubt that it was written after the sexual assaults began. However, it does not follow that the existence of the letter “contradicts” the time frame of the first (or any) offence. The content of the letter was one of the matters the jury was invited to take into account when assessing the likelihood that the offences occurred as alleged by D. It was open to the jury to accept D’s evidence, notwithstanding the admiration for the appellant he professed in the letter.  
     
      
    44 Counts 2 and 3 each alleged an incident at D’s home at Neutral Bay on a Friday night. There was a factual dispute in the trial as to whether the appellant ever gave lessons at D’s home on Friday nights within the periods alleged. 
     
      
    45 In his written submissions, the appellant listed a series of alleged anomalies or weaknesses in the evidence on that issue (4.6.1-4.6.2). As in respect of count 1, the submissions were repeated in support of ground 10 (AWS 13.3). Those matters do demonstrate some inconsistencies in the evidence. 46 The appellant gave evidence in the trial that he always taught at his home at Pymble on Friday night (T436.10; T437.18; T451.40). His wife gave evidence to like effect (T554.26). As submitted by the Crown, there was clearly a dispute of fact on that issue. The jury must be taken to have resolved that dispute in favour of the complainant. Further, as noted by the Crown, the mere existence of discrepancies or inconsistencies in the evidence is not a sufficient basis for holding that the jury’s verdicts were unsafe or unsatisfactory. The discrepancies must be such as to persuade this Court that there is “a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted”: R v McKnoulty (1995) 77 A Crim R 333 at 339 per Hunt CJ at CL. 
     
      
    47 The discrepancies identified by the appellant in his submissions do not have that character. It was plainly open to the jury to accept the credibility of the complainant notwithstanding those matters.  
     
      
    48 At the hearing of the appeal, the Court granted leave to the appellant to adduce fresh evidence in support of his grounds of appeal relating to counts 2 and 3. The evidence was from a former student of the appellant, Ms Linda Lin. She said that she had lessons with the appellant on Friday evenings in 2002 at his Pymble home studio. Her lesson time was between 8 and 9pm. Under cross-examination before this Court, she acknowledged that she could not say she had spent every Friday evening during 2002 in a lesson with the appellant. She said that on occasions her lessons were changed to a Thursday or a Wednesday.  
     
      
    49 The appellant submitted (in support of ground 8) that his Counsel was incompetent not to have called Ms Lin as a witness in the trial. In our view, since her evidence could never unequivocally establish that the offences in counts 2 and 3 did not occur, there was no incompetence and no miscarriage of justice was produced by the absence of her evidence in the trial. We reject that submission. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1(iv) and part of ground 10 - the autobiography and the letter to the appellant for his fiftieth birthday 
       
      
    50 The appellant’s written submissions did not separately address ground 1(iv). Issues concerning the autobiography and the letter to the appellant were raised in respect of ground 1(iii) and ground 10 (discussed above) and also in support of ground 5 (alleged bias of the trial judge) and ground 8 (alleged incompetence of Counsel) (discussed below). 
     
      
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
      Ground 1(v) and part of Ground 10 - the time frame for counts 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 & 9 
       
      
    51 Apart from counts 2 and 3, all of the offences were alleged to have occurred at the appellant’s home at Pymble. The gist of the appellant’s submission in respect of those counts was that he had no opportunity to commit those offences. He relied on the evidence as to the duration of the lessons, D’s evidence that the sexual misconduct occurred towards the end of the lessons and the constant presence of other people such as students waiting for lessons, Mr Szakos who always arrived early, D’s father and the appellant’s wife (AWS 4.7, repeated in support of ground 10 at AWS 13.4). 
     
      
    52 The existence of a risk of detection was squarely raised as an issue for the jury’s consideration. It was relevant to their assessment of the complainant’s credibility, but not logically inconsistent with the truthfulness of his evidence. Detection is a risk of every offence. It was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offences were committed as alleged, notwithstanding the apparent risks. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1(vi) and part of Ground 10 - pornography  
       
      
    53 The appellant submitted that the evidence in relation to the allegation that he showed pornography to D and as to the description of his wardrobe where CD’s containing pornography were stored clearly established that D was lying (AWS 4.8-4.8.7 at pages 50-54). The submission concerning the pornography issue was expanded in support of ground 10 where it was contended that the evidence of the police expert incontrovertibly established the unreliability of D’s evidence as to the times he said he was shown pornography (AWS 13.5-13.7 at pages 193-195).  
     
      
    54 The appellant pointed to a series of pieces of evidence which, he submitted, established that D must have been lying about having been shown pornography. The appellant’s separate complaint that the trial Judge misled the jury on that issue is dealt with under Ground 2(iii) (AWS 5.3). 
     
      
    55 The evidence of pornography arose in respect of counts 7, 8 and 9. The complainant described a gay pornographic video which the appellant had put on for him to watch on the computer screen. He said that was not the only occasion on which the appellant showed him gay pornography at Pymble: 
     
      
       
        
        “There were many occasions where he would do this. At first he would just bring me up to the stage of showing me the music stuff and then at one point, I can’t quite recall when that happened, he started to show me the pornographic videos and this would happen almost, it became almost every time I was there on Mondays” (T44.23-29). 
        
       
      
    56 He was asked to estimate how many times he was shown the gay videos and he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Maybe, I don’t know, forty times something like that. I couldn’t give you an exact number but there was a lot.” (T44.33-34).  
        
       
       
      He could not remember the title of any video other than one that was called “The Russian boys’ picnic” (T45.7).  
       
      
    57 Contrary to the appellant’s submissions, the complainant did not say that, from the very beginning of 2003 on forty Mondays, he was shown pornography. He did not suggest that it began right from the beginning of the year and the number forty was an estimate.  
     
      
    58 The Crown called evidence from a police computer forensics expert, Senior Constable Ng. He had examined the hard drives of the appellant’s computer and retrieved the names of files that had been deleted. He said a large percentage of the movie files had “gay titles” and that all of those had been deleted (T414.30). A schedule of the information retrieved in respect of files with so-called gay titles was admitted without objection and became exhibit F (T414.54).59 Of the files whose names were listed in exhibit F, all but two appeared on the hard drive of the appellant’s computer only from 2 August 2003 to 10 September 2003. There were two additional files named that appeared to have been downloaded and deleted on the same day, namely 10 November 2003. The proposition appeared to be that this evidence demonstrated the untruthfulness of D’s evidence that he was shown pornographic video clips from the beginning of 2003. 
     
      
    60 The appellant’s submission misconceives the effect of the evidence of both the complainant and Senior Constable Ng. He did not purport to have identified the names of all the files that were ever downloaded onto the appellant’s computer. His evidence did not preclude the possibility that other pornographic material had been downloaded and deleted within different time frames and not retrieved by him.  
     
      
    61 The appellant’s submission in respect of the placement of the CD’s in the wardrobe was without substance. D had indicated to police on a diagram the particular place in the wardrobe where he alleged pornographic CD’s were kept by the appellant. There was evidence in the trial that the place D described was in fact a place for hanging clothes, and did not have the shelves and drawers described by him. That apparent anomaly did not establish that D was lying.   
     
      
       
      Ground 1(vii) - the oral sex issue  
       
      
    62 There was no count on the indictment that alleged an act of oral intercourse and D gave no account of any such act in his statement to police or in his evidence-in-chief. D had, however, complained to his mother that the appellant had attempted to force him to perform oral sex but that he had managed to prevent that from happening. That issue was raised by the appellant’s Counsel in the cross-examination of D (T183.30). D’s mother gave evidence in the trial of the content of the complaint (T320.52). In addition, a document written by D at his mother’s suggestion before they went to police included an account of the attempted oral sex. There was a dispute in the trial as to whether the words used by D in that statement meant that oral sex took place, or was only attempted.63 The appellant submitted that D’s evidence on that issue proves his perjury (AWS 4.9). The appellant noted that D did not make any complaint to police of oral intercourse or attempted oral intercourse. He submitted that, if oral intercourse had occurred, D would never have forgotten that act. Accordingly, so it was said, when D said the reason he did not mention it to police or the Crown prosecutor was that he had forgotten it, he must have meant that he had forgotten that he had included that (false) allegation in his written statement prepared at the request of his mother.  
     
      
    64 Counsel for the appellant at the trial addressed the jury as to the apparent inconsistency. He said (T29.28 6/12/04): 
     
      
       
        
        “it’s a prior inconsistent statement which goes to the heart, you might think, of that boy’s reliability and honesty. It goes to the heart of it.”  
        
       
      
    65 The learned trial Judge told the jury that it was a matter for them to construe that passage in D’s statement and to consider whether they regarded the statement and the evidence given in court as being inconsistent (SU 55).  
     
      
    66 The task of assessing what to make of the fact that D did not tell police, as he had told his mother, that his piano teacher had performed fellatio on him (or had attempted to) was well within their province. The proposition that perjury is established by the omission of that account in the statement to police and in the evidence in chief at the trial must be rejected.  
     
      
       
       
       
       
       
      Ground 1 - additional submissions  
       
      
    67 The appellant’s written submissions addressed an additional issue not formally identified as part of ground 1 (AWS 4.10-4.12) based on the evidence of Dr Edwards, who had undertaken a medical examination of D. Dr Edwards gave evidence that D had told her that the sexual abuse by the appellant included “mutual masturbation” (T337.34) whereas there was no reference to mutual masturbation in D’s statement to police or in his evidence in the trial. 
     
      
    68 In addition, Dr Edwards said that D complained that the act of sodomy, which was the basis for count 9, had caused pain lasting about half an hour whereas the evidence given in Court was that the pain lasted for about five to ten minutes. The appellant submitted that those inconsistencies demonstrated that the evidence was fabricated. He submitted that a motive for making up such allegations was to be found in the contents of D’s letter to the appellant on the occasion of his fiftieth birthday, which unequivocally proved that D loved and admired his teacher. The appellant said that on 1 February 2004, D’s mother informed him about something which destroyed the image he had of his teacher, with the result that “his deepest love turned into a cruel hate”.  
     
      
    69 The appellant did not identify what it was that D’s mother was said to have told D on 1 February 2004, but said it was such as to arouse a very strong jealousy in D. The evidence of the mother was that she had asked D whether he was aware of any adult doing anything inappropriate towards D or anyone else. She did not say that she told him anything.  
     
      
    70 The appellant submitted that the accusations made by D on that occasion later collapsed. He sought to support that contention by reference to the oral sex issue, the pornography issue and the allegedly inconsistent verdicts.  
     
      
    71 As to D’s parents, the appellant identified a different motive. He submitted that the parents had blackmailed him. The basis for that allegation was that D’s father said to the appellant, when he first confronted him with the allegations, “You have two weeks to get out of the country or I go to the police”. The appellant suggested that, since he himself disclosed the allegations to his other students the following morning, D’s parents had been forced to make the complaints. The thrust of his complaint is that these matters were never raised in the trial, owing to the incompetence of his legal representatives and his own incapacity to understand the proceedings due to the absence of simultaneous translation (raised as a separate ground of appeal in ground 4).  
     
      
    72 There is no force in that submission. It may be accepted that there were inconsistencies between versions given by D on different occasions. The test is whether such inconsistencies produced the result that the verdicts were unreasonable. In our view, they did not. D was tested vigorously as to the inconsistencies. It was open to the jury to accept his explanations.  
     
      
    73 As to the suggestion that the trial was unfair because of the lost opportunity to raise the supposed issues of motive, we are unable to see how any injustice or unfairness arises. The threat made by D’s father to go to the police unless the appellant left the country does not point unequivocally to the falsity of D’s allegations. On the contrary, it is perfectly consistent with a belief in the truth of the allegations. In any event, the issue for the jury was not whether D’s parents believed his allegations were true, but whether the jury accepted beyond reasonable doubt that they were true.  
     
      
    74 Ground 1 is dismissed. 
     
      
      Ground 2 - alleged inadequacies in the trial Judge’s directions  
       
      
    75 The second ground of appeal was: 
     
      
       
        
        “The trial judge failed adequately to direct the jury in relation to (i) the legal concept of the Crown prosecutor status; (ii) the legal concept of “beyond reasonable doubt”; (iii) the evidence concerning the time frame of the deleted computer files; (iv) the evidence of Mr Szakos and Mrs George; (v) the evidence concerning oral sex; (vi) the written records of the piano lessons.” 
        
       
       
      Ground 2 (i) - opening remarks as to the role of the Crown prosecutor  
       
      
    76 Ground 2(i) was based on the learned trial Judge’s opening remarks to the jury, which the appellant submitted were erroneous, prejudiced and unfair (AWS 5.1 at pages 66-67). 
     
      
    77 The remarks of the trial Judge complained of by the appellant are: 
     
      
       
        
        “You are here to represent the community and it is your assessment of the evidence that matters, no body else’s” (T17.16-18) 
        
       
       
        
        and 
        
       
       
        
        “This is a very important matter, not only to the Crown, but to the community, to the accused. As I said the Crown prosecutor represents the community in this matter. Mr Turnbull who appears for the accused, it’s his job to test the evidence brought by the Crown …” (T17.58-T18.4) 
        
       
      
    78 This ground of appeal is the same as ground 6 (iv) raised in the appellant’s appeal against his conviction for the counts involving offences against A (Makarov v R (No. 2)). For the reasons identified in paragraphs [110]-[112] of that decision, this ground is rejected.   
     
      
      Ground 2 (ii) - the re-direction as to the term “beyond reasonable doubt” 
       
      
    79 Ground 2(ii) complained of the trial Judge’s response to a question from the jury (AWS 5.2). The appellant submitted that the jury asked a question about the phrase beyond reasonable doubt after “a few days” of deliberation. That is not correct. The jury retired to consider their verdict at 2.25pm on Tuesday 7 December 2004 (SU 69) (the transcript is dated 8.12.04 but that appears to be wrong – it is a continuation after the luncheon adjournment of the transcript of 7.12.04). They indicated that they wanted to go home and were allowed to leave at 3.55pm. On Wednesday 8 December 2004, one of the jurors was absent due to illness. The remaining jurors were sent home and asked to return the next day. The jury continued its deliberations on 9 December 2004. At 12.21pm the following day, the jury was returned to Court, having asked for a simple elaboration of the term “beyond reasonable doubt”. By that stage, they had been deliberating for less than two days. 
     
      
    80 The trial Judge indicated, in the absence of the jury, that she proposed to direct them in accordance with the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Southammavong; R v Sihavong  [2003] NSWCCA 312. No objection to that course was raised by Counsel for the appellant.  
     
      
    81 The jury was returned to Court and her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Thankyou, ladies and gentleman, I have your note which I have marked for identification. As I understand it you want a simple elaboration of the term, beyond reasonable doubt, is that the position? Beyond reasonable doubt has no independent or objective definition. It is for each of you as members of the jury individually to set the standard of what is reasonable in terms of a doubt in the particular circumstances of the trial. That’s the only instruction I can give you, ladies and gentlemen, it is a matter for you. It’s your subjective assessment of what is a reasonable doubt in the circumstances of the trial. Now would you like to go with the Sheriff’s officer and resume your deliberations.” 
        
       
      
    82 The jury retired again at 12.22pm and returned with their verdicts at 2.15pm. 
     
      
    83 The trial Judge’s redirection was entirely consistent with Southammavong at [28] – [31] per Spigelman CJ, O’Keefe and Greg James JJ agreeing. The appellant submitted that the re-direction given by the trial Judge was erroneous in its assertion that “beyond reasonable doubt” has no independent and objective definition; and in the use of the words “subjective assessment.” He submitted that the jury should have been directed in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “beyond reasonable doubt is a standard of proof as an objective measure for determining whether or not a fact or issue has been proved.” 
        
       
      
    84 That is not the law. As noted in Southammavong at [28], the proposition that the test is a subjective one that applies to each individual juror is well established. The plain correctness of that proposition is nicely captured in the following words of the Privy Council in Walters v The Queen [1969] 2 AC 26 at 30 (cited with approval in Southammavong at [30]): 
     
      
       
        
        “… in the context of “doubt”, which cannot be other than personal to the doubter, it is meaningless to talk of doubt as “objective” and otiose to describe it as “subjective”. It is the duty of each individual juror to make up his own mind as to whether the evidence that the defendant committed the offence with which he is charged is so strong so as to convince him personally of the defendant’s guilt.”  
        
       
      
    85 This submission must be rejected. 
     
      
      Ground 2 (iii) - alleged inadequacy of the direction as to the time frame of the deleted computer files  
       
      
    86 The appellant submitted that there was an error of fact in the following aspect of the trial Judge’s summing-up to the jury (SU 18): 
     
      
       
        
        “Now exhibit F is before you and exhibit F is the schedule of the file names and the various dates. Exhibit F indicates that the files were downloaded between May and early November 2003. The majority of them were downloaded in August and September of 2003 and the files that appear on exhibit F were deleted either on the 9 
        th 
         or 10 
        th 
         September 2003 or on 10 
        th 
         November 2003.” 
        
       
      
    87 The appellant’s submissions on this ground appear to raise two complaints (AWS 5.3 at pages 70, 71, 80 and 81). First, the appellant suggested that the trial Judge should have told the jury that the evidence of the computer expert proved that D gave false evidence. As explained in the consideration of ground 1(vi) above, that submission was based on a misconception as to the effect of the evidence given by the expert, Senior Constable Ng. There was no inconsistency between that evidence and D’s evidence that he was shown pornographic video clips regularly during 2003. The complaint as to the trial Judge’s failure to refer to the evidence of Senior Constable Ng and “the facts of inconsistency and obvious lies of D’s evidence” (AWS 5.3.5) is accordingly without substance.  
     
      
    88 The second aspect of this ground is difficult to understand. The appellant submitted “the information which the trial Judge addressed to the jury [files were downloaded between May and early November of 2003] was erroneous because had never been introduced to the Court.”  
     
      
    89 The thrust of the complaint appears to be that the files themselves were not introduced into evidence. Senior Constable Ng was able to retrieve only the names of the files downloaded. The schedule of some of the information retrieved was admitted without objection (T414.54). The Judge gave careful directions in respect of the inferences that could be drawn from the information as to those file names. The Judge said that in relation to count 7, in addition to the complainant’s evidence, the Crown also relied on “the fact that there were file names indicative of gay pornography which were retrieved from the hard-drive of the computer in the accused’s home in order to support or confirm that what [D] related in that part of his evidence is the truth” (SU 18). It was in that context that the Judge reminded the jury about exhibit F. The Judge then gave careful directions as to the drawing of inferences, which included a direction that it was a matter for them whether they drew the inference contended for by the Crown, and whether that inference tended to confirm the evidence of D. Her Honour’s directions on that issue were both accurate and fair. 
     
      
     
     
      
       
       
       
      Count 2 (iv) - the evidence of Mr Szakos and Mrs George  
       
      
    90 The appellant submitted (AWS 5.4-5.4.3) that the trial Judge made a factual error in the following passage of the summing-up: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … [Mr Szakos] would sometimes be about 10 to 15 minutes early, sometimes he would be late, depending on the traffic” (SU 51). 
        
       
      
    91 The Crown acknowledges that those remarks entailed a factual error. The evidence of Mr Szakos was that he usually arrived quite early, sometimes 20 minutes early. He did not suggest that he ever arrived late.  
     
      
    92 The issue is whether the misdirection might have affected the verdict, that is, whether if it had not been made, the jury might have acquitted the appellant: Simic v R (1980) 144 CLR 319 at 332. 
     
      
    93 The evidence of Mr Szakos went to the issue of the opportunity for the appellant to have committed the offences at Pymble without detection. However, assuming the evidence was accepted, it did not eliminate all opportunities for the appellant to commit the offences. In the first instance, Mr Szakos said that, when they arrived early, they would hang around outside the house for about 15 minutes before going up a little bit early to watch the end of the lesson of D (T603.19-24). Further, there were periods when they attended only fortnightly. The evidence was unclear as to the parameters of those periods but it was open to the jury to accept that it covered periods in both the first half and the second half of 2002 (T601.43-48; T606.32-54).  
     
      
    94 The Crown submitted that, since Counsel for the appellant at trial did not request the Judge to correct the error, rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules 1952 (NSW) applies such that leave to appeal on this point is required. Although the appellant did not challenge that assertion, we note that this ground challenges a factual statement made during the Judge’s summary of the evidence led in the appellant’s case. Without deciding whether rule 4 applies to such a statement, it is prudent to address this ground on its merits. The error was a minor factual error, which did not produce a miscarriage of justice. The context in which it was said was a careful summary of all the matters pointed to by the appellant in support of his submission that it would defy common sense if he were to be engaging in the sort of conduct alleged against him on such a regular basis without being disturbed or seen by someone at some stage (SU 53). The fact that Counsel for the appellant, who was alive to the issues in the trial and immersed in its atmosphere, did not seek a correction suggests that the error was not significant.  
     
      
    95 The second complaint under ground 2 (iv) was in respect of the evidence of Mrs George (AWS 5.4.4-5.4.5). The appellant complained that the trial Judge incorrectly addressed the jury when she said (SU 46.13): 
     
      
       
        
        “ … in fact Mrs George conceded that she did not know what the allegations were.” 
        
       
      
    96 The appellant submitted that Mrs George gave no such evidence and that the Judge’s remarks may have discredited her as a witness, creating a miscarriage of justice. A review of the evidence of Mrs George discloses that the Judge’s remark was entirely accurate. Mrs George said that she knew the allegations were of a sexual nature and conceded that was all she knew (T633.33-40).  
     
      
       
      Ground 2 (v) - alleged misrepresentation of the evidence concerning oral sex  
       
      
    97 The appellant (at AWS 5.5-5.5.3) complained that the trial Judge misrepresented the “oral sex issue” when she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown does not have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused failed to insert his penis into the mouth of the complainant on some occasions when [D] said that that was attempted by the accused.” 
        
       
      
    98 This submission proceeded on a misapprehension as to the point her Honour was addressing in that part of the summing-up. The Judge was explaining to the jury that the Crown must prove the ingredients of the offences beyond reasonable doubt. She directed them, correctly, that that does not mean the Crown has to prove every factual matter in the course of the trial that may be in dispute. A number of examples followed, including the passage set out above. There is no substance in the complaint that those remarks misrepresented the appellant’s case. 
     
      
    99 The appellant also complains of a later part of the summing-up dealing with the oral sex issue. The passage in question came after the Judge had finished saying what she intended to say by way of summing-up. Her Honour told the jury that she needed to discuss with Counsel whether any further directions should be given. She asked the jury to take the luncheon adjournment and not to commence their deliberations. Counsel for the appellant asked the Judge to remind the jury of the totality of the complainant’s statement typed out at his mother’s suggestion before he went to police. 
     
      
    100 In that context her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “You will recall that the complainant [D] was cross-examined on that statement and that it was put to him that there were parts of that statement which were not reflected in the interviews that he had with the police later on and you will recall that I referred earlier to what [D] had said in that earlier typewritten statement about what was a reference to an act of fellatio or oral intercourse. I did not have it in front of me but I do now. I will read you the full text of that statement as it was put to [D] in cross-examination. What he wrote in that statement was, 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “He wanted to” it should be “put”, the word “put” is not there but it should be, “He wanted to put his penis in my mouth. He was pushing my head down. I refused and somehow got away. He left that bit for a while but tried again later on several occasions all with the same result. He did however do it to me. While this was happening to me I would concentrate and think something else, hoping that it would help me to endure it and lessen the effects.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        I just wanted to make sure that I had read that to you, in terms of how it was put to [D] that the reference to “he did however do it to me”, according to the accused’s submission, was a reference to an act of fellatio actually occurring as opposed to attempted by the accused. So I will not repeat what I said about the way in which the accused relies upon that inconsistency if you find it to be an inconsistency.”  
        
       
      
    101 The appellant complains, in effect, that the Judge had missed the point. He submitted that the oral sex issue was not about whether the act of fellatio actually occurred as opposed to being merely an attempt. It was about the fact that D had given detailed information in relation to an allegation of oral sex which he subsequently abandoned, indicating that he must have made it up. 
     
      
    102 There is no force in this complaint. The Judge had earlier reminded the jury that the appellant relied on inconsistencies between the out of Court statements and the evidence in Court on the oral sex issue as going to D’s reliability. The Judge may have placed a different emphasis on that issue but ultimately the assessment of the inconsistencies was a matter for the jury.  
     
      
      Ground 2 (vi) - the written records of the piano lessons  
       
      
    103 Ground 2 (vi) is difficult to understand. The appellant complains (AWS 5.6) of the following portions of the summing-up: 
     
      
       
        
        “The fact of the matter is that he has no written records available to him as to the scheduled teaching times because all of those records, if they existed, have been overwritten” (SU 54) 
        
       
       
        
        and (SU 55): 
        
       
       
        
        “ … he cannot produce any written records of the times that [D] actually attended, and in those circumstances all he can do is simply deny that these things ever occurred” 
        
       
       
        
       
       
        
        And (SU 67): 
        
       
       
        
        “ … he is not in a position to put forward concrete evidence of when these lesson times actually took place.” 
        
       
      
    104 The appellant’s complaint in respect of those remarks appears to be that they suggested the appellant bore an onus of proof. That complaint is without substance when one has regard to the quotes selected by the appellant in the context in which they appear. The first remarks (SU 54) were preceded by the following statements: 
     
      
       
        
        “The accused ladies and gentlemen, as I said before, does not bear any onus of proof. I am not suggesting that he is required to prove anything in the way of when these lessons occurred or when they did not occur.” 
        
       
      
    105 The second remark (SU 55) was preceded by the statement that there was no doubt the appellant had a busy schedule and that from time to time students cancelled or changed their lesson times, or the appellant had other commitments which meant he had to change lesson times. Her Honour was thus proffering a sensible explanation for the appellant’s inability to produce written records of the times the complainant actually attended lessons.  
     
      
    106 At the conclusion of those remarks, the Judge added: 
     
      
       
        
        “And in those circumstances all he can do is simply deny that these things ever occurred.” 
        
       
      
    107 That remark is the subject of separate complaint. The appellant submits it was incorrect, prejudiced and unfair, because it ignored all the other arguments the appellant had as to inconsistencies in the evidence, issues as to the time frame, the evidence of the police computer expert and so on. When the Judge’s remarks are read in their proper context, that is a surprising submission. The Judge gave a careful, balanced summary of the appellant’s case and specifically reminded the jury of inconsistencies that had been raised during the hearing. There is no substance to this complaint. 
     
      
    108 Ground 2 is dismissed.  
     
      
       
      Ground 3 - wrongful admission of evidence of admissions 
       
      
    109 Ground 3 is: 
     
      
       
        
        “The trial miscarried and there was a miscarriage of justice as a result of the prejudiced decision the trial Judge made in relation to the evidence of the Ukrainian students (A, B and C) concerning the appellant’s “admissions” and the evidence concerning the deleted computer files.”  
        
       
      
    110 The appellant’s submissions in support of this ground were set out at AWS 6.1-6.2.4 and repeated under ground 7 at 10.2.6-10.2.9.  
     
      
    111 The trial Judge ruled on the admissibility of the admissions after taking the evidence on the voir dire. Her Honour published written reasons on 29 November 2004. She identified the following evidence as being capable of constituting an admission. 
     
      
    112 As to a conversation between the appellant and B, the appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “This is my nature, you know … I understand this by brain but there’s nothing I can do.” 
        
       
      
    113 As to a conversation with C, the appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I understand with my brain that it is wrong what I have done to [D] but I cannot control my genes, it is in my nature to be like that. … It’s hard to understand this … maybe I should commit suicide, maybe I should drive off the cliff and end this.” 
        
       
      
    114 In a conversation with A, the appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I nearly stopped … I understand how terrible and how awful this – this all is. I do understand it with my mind … but it’s – this is only on my genetical level, … maybe I should drive off a cliff somewhere and just commit some sort of suicide.” 
        
       
      
    115 Counsel for the appellant at the trial conceded that the evidence may have substantial probative value but invited the Judge to exclude the evidence in exercise of her discretions under s 90 and s 135 of the Evidence Act 1995 and, alternatively, in accordance with the mandatory exclusion rule under s 137 of the Act.  
     
      
    116 In relation to s 90, the submission at trial was that it would be unfair to use the admissions, given that they had been made in the context of a conversation with three men who also claimed to have been sexually abused by the appellant. It was not otherwise suggested that the circumstances of the meetings, which had been called at the request of the appellant, rendered the admissions unreliable.  
     
      
    117 Before this Court, the appellant raised two additional matters as to the circumstances in which the admissions were made. First, he said that he had been intimidated when he was confronted with the allegations by D’s father. Secondly, he said that he had indicated that he would not be interviewed by police and that the admissions to A, B and C were accordingly made in the “course of an interview conducted despite indication”. Those complaints did not form part of the basis on which the evidence was objected to at trial. They are not circumstances relevant to the admissions made to the three Ukrainian students. It is not necessary to consider those matters.118 The third complaint as to the circumstances in which the admissions were made was that A had conceded in cross-examination that the appellant said to him: 
     
      
       
        
        “With [D], you know, it’s not true” (T370.56-57). 
        
       
       
      The appellant submitted that this evidence would have caused the jury to speculate as to whether the admissions related to offences against another person. That risk had been identified for consideration by the trial Judge (T163.37). In her reasons for decision, the Judge considered the fact that A acknowledged that, at one point, the appellant denied D’s allegations. Her Honour said: 
       
       
        
        “[that] does not deprive the identified admissions of their probative value. How those seemingly contradictory statements by the accused are to be resolved is a question of fact for the jury. This exercise on the voir dire is not concerned with the truth or untruth of the admissions (s 189(3) Evidence Act).” 
        
       
      
    119 Separately, her Honour considered the problem that some of the admissions were made in response to statements by B, C and A in which they assumed the truth of D’s allegations because of their own experience of the appellant’s conduct. In respect of that issue, the Judge concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “However, the behaviour under discussion included the accused’s behaviour towards D. Any response by the accused which implicitly or explicitly acknowledged that he had behaved towards D in the same way that he had behaved towards B, A and C is available to the prosecution to be used to the detriment of the accused.” 
        
       
      
    120 The appellant’s submission in the appeal raises a different point. His complaint is not that he explicitly acknowledged behaving towards D in the same way that he had behaved towards the others, but that he denied the allegations of D whilst implicitly acknowledging behaving in that way towards others. However, as the Judge noted, A’s account included seemingly contradictory statements. The first part of the conversation implicitly acknowledged that D’s allegations were true. The trial Judge correctly held that the resolution of the apparent inconsistent statements was a matter for the jury. In our view, the Judge’s decision not to exercise her discretion under s 90 to exclude the evidence discloses no error. 
     
      
    121 The appellant’s second submission in respect of the admissions (AWS 6.1.5B, pages 85-87) is difficult to understand. He states that the submission is based on the concept of “admissions by conduct”. The proposition appears to be that the alleged admissions were inconsistent with other conduct of the appellant, such as the fact that he denied the allegations, the fact that he did not leave Australia as D’s father had demanded and the fact that he informed his employer and the Ukrainian students of the accusations. None of those factors bears on the admissibility of the admissions. This submission must be rejected. 
     
      
    122 The appellant’s third submission in respect of the admissibility of the admissions was said to be based on the concept of the “evidence of bias or a motive for being untruthful” (AWS 6.1.5C at pages 87-89). The thrust of the submission was that, since it was a premise of the decision to order a separate trial of the counts involving the offences against D that there existed the possibility of concoction among the complainants, the same reasoning should have been applied as a basis for excluding the admissions. The appellant submitted that the Ukrainian students, who have since made claims for victim’s compensation, have a financial motive to be untruthful.  
     
      
    123 Although the submission had not been put in quite that way at trial, the Judge expressly considered whether the risk of fabrication was productive of unfair prejudice. Her Honour concluded that there was nothing in law to prevent Counsel for the appellant from cross-examining each of the Ukrainian students as to their motive for fabricating the admissions. The Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Rulings on the admissibility of evidence cannot be made to accommodate any number of defence theories which the trial Judge does not know and can never foresee. In short, the method and scope of cross-examination is a forensic decision for Counsel.” 
        
       
      
    124 The risk that the evidence, or Counsel’s cross-examination in respect of the evidence, would reveal that the appellant had engaged in sexual misconduct other than the offences charged did not render the evidence inadmissible: Markby v R (1978) 140 CLR 108 at 116 per Gibbs ACJ; Smale v R [2007] NSWCCA 328 at [33] per Howie J, Mason P and James J agreeing. In the present case, the evidence was not led for the purpose of proving tendency. Indeed, it is highly doubtful whether it would have been understood by the jury as referring to misconduct towards any person other than D. In our view, no error is disclosed and this part of ground 3 must be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 and part of Ground 8 - the deleted computer files  
       
      
    125 The second ruling challenged under ground 3 was the admission of exhibit F, which was the schedule of the names of the files deleted from the appellant’s computer (AWS 6.2). This submission rested on three contentions. First, the appellant complained that it was wrong to admit the list of names when the complainant himself had not identified the name of any video clip he watched. That is a matter going to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. 
     
      
    126 Secondly, the appellant submitted that the evidence was hearsay. That submission was related to the third complaint which was that, since the hard drive had been destroyed by the time of the trial, the appellant was not able to test the evidence of the police expert who produced the list.  
     
      
    127 The hearsay objection was not taken at the trial and in fact exhibit F was admitted without objection (T414.54), albeit after some debate. D’s evidence was that, after the appellant had shown him some music files on the computer, the appellant then accessed a program and downloaded or opened a file that he had downloaded from the Internet of a gay pornographic video (T40.25). D said the program was called “Kozaa or Kozaa Light”. 
     
      
    128 Senior Constable Ng gave evidence that one of the hard drives on the appellant’s computer had the Kazaa program, which is a “peer to peer” file-sharing program. It had been saved to the hard drive in September 2002. The Kazaa folder on the hard drive contained a number of movie files with “gay titles” but all of those files had been deleted. In order to retrieve information concerning those files it was necessary to use specialised software. Using that software, Senior Constable Ng had produced a list of the names of files that had been downloaded from the internet using the Kazaa program, the dates on which they were downloaded and the dates on which they were deleted.  
     
      
    129 Senior Constable Ng’s evidence established that the hard drive of the appellant’s computer stored information in such a way that it could not be used by the Court without the use of the specialised software. Assuming that information was relevant and admissible, documents produced using the software could have been admitted in accordance with s 48(1)(d) of the Evidence Act. However, the full schedule also referred to child pornography of a heterosexual nature (T6.44), which the trial Judge thought would be far too prejudicial (T6.49). Accordingly, the Crown prepared a reduced schedule of the names only of those deleted files which carried titles suggestive of gay pornography. That was the schedule that was admitted without objection (T414.54).  
     
      
    130 Examples of the names included in the list are “Jeffs secret porn stash – gay blow job”, “Military (cadinot) - gay porno”, “Italian hottie home naked, GAY, GAY, GAY PORNO”, “Gay rough gangbang” and “Gay porn – jocks – sex muscle teacher fucks student”. 
     
      
    131 The contents of the schedule were plainly relevant because they could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact alleged by D that he had been shown a gay pornographic video clip downloaded to the appellant’s computer from the Internet using the Kazaa program. As to whether they were admissible, an objection was flagged by Counsel for the appellant. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Your Honour I do have a difficulty with the probative value that can arise from files which can’t themselves be resuscitated. Now I know that it might be said, well look common sense would say that those labels would apply to gay files” (T120.11). 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    132 That objection, in substance, contended that the titles of the video clips did not prove their content. It also appeared to acknowledge a possible argument that the titles were admissible for that purpose under s 70 of the Evidence Act, which provides that the hearsay rule does not apply to tags, labels or writing placed on an object in certain circumstances. One of the requirements of s 70 is that the label, tag or writing was attached in the course of business. There was no discussion as to whether files available through the Kazaa program are labelled in the course of business.  
     
      
    133 The Judge’s response to the issue raised by Counsel suggested a preliminary view that the file names would be admissible, so long as the evidence was confined to those which were indicative of gay pornography. However, her Honour did not rule on the question at that stage, but indicated that she would make time for argument if Counsel pressed the objection (T120-121). The objection was not pressed and, a week later, exhibit F was admitted without objection (T414.54). In those circumstances, the Judge was not wrong to admit the evidence.  
     
      
    134 The appellant submitted, in the alternative, that his Counsel’s failure to press the objection was incompetent and produced a miscarriage of justice (ground 8, AWS 11.15-11.15.3). It should be noted that when it was foreshadowed by the Crown in the absence of the jury, that exhibit F was to be tendered “by consent”, Counsel for the appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have already made my objections, I have been ruled against so I prefer just to stay silent when the matter is presented before the jury” (T403.1).  
        
       
      
    135 That statement was incorrect. The Judge had not ruled on the objection but, rather, had indicated she would make time for argument if it were pressed. It is not possible to discern whether Counsel was labouring under a misapprehension about that, or simply acknowledging (albeit in loose terms) his reconciliation to the Judge’s preliminary view. The critical question for the purpose of ground 8 is whether the appellant has satisfied the onus of establishing that the failure to renew the objection was negligent or incompetent and has resulted in a miscarriage of justice: Ignjatic v R [1993] 68 A Crim R 333. In our view, he has not.  
     
      
    136 First, it is by no means clear that the failure to renew the objection was due to any negligence or incompetence. Even if the court were to decide otherwise, we are not satisfied that Counsel’s decision was productive of any miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    137 The expert’s evidence that files had been downloaded using the Kazaa program was admissible as independent evidence to corroborate the evidence of D. The view might reasonably have been taken, in that context, that the names of the files were admissible for a non-hearsay purpose because it was open to the jury to conclude that it was the appellant who had downloaded the videos, in which event the steps he must have undertaken to identify and download files with such names was further independent support for D’s evidence. Counsel may have seen it as expedient to consent to the admission of exhibit F to avoid focussing attention on that issue. He may, in the circumstances, have formed the view that the hearsay rule did not apply to the contents of the list (s 60 of the Evidence Act) and seen little benefit in seeking a direction under s 165 of the Act limiting the use to be made of the evidence.  
     
      
    138 In addition, Senior Constable Ng had made himself available to confer with the appellant’s Counsel before being cross-examined by him (T419.20). Counsel was accordingly well placed to exercise his forensic judgment as to whether to confine the evidence to those files bearing “gay titles”. By accepting that course, Counsel achieved a forensic advantage, which he put to good effect in cross-examination, in that the list in evidence contained a considerably smaller number of files and a very narrow range of dates during which files were downloaded. The implicit premise of that course, which had a benefit for both the Crown and the defence, was that the names of the files were indicative of their content.  
     
      
    139 Further, as to the prejudicial effect of the evidence, D’s account was that he had been shown gay pornography on many occasions. He gave a description of the content of some of the material he was shown in respect of count 7 (T44.1) and remembered that one file was called “The Russian Boys Picnic”. The inclusion in the evidence of the file names hardly took the matter any further.  
     
      
       
        
          
        
       
      
    140 We are not satisfied that the admission into evidence of the file names produced a miscarriage of justice. Ground 3 is dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 - Failure to provide headphone translation facilities 
       
      
    141 The fourth ground of appeal is (AWS 7.1-7.5): 
     
      
       
        
        “The trial Judge erred in failing to provide for the appellant as a former foreigner with English as a second language an access to an interpreter through the simultaneous headphone translation or proper conditions for simultaneous translation of interpreter – with the intervals for translation – that international law and standards required.”  
        
       
      
    142 The same ground of appeal was argued in respect of the two other trials: Makarov v R (No. 2); Makarov v R (No. 3).  
     
      
    143 In the present trial, the interpreter spoke on only one occasion throughout the evidence of the appellant (T442.36). Further, as noted in the Crown’s submissions, a witness called in the appellant’s case said of him: 
     
      
       
        
        “He’s extremely articulate and so he can convey his imagery very effectively albeit in a foreign language …” (T633.21).  
        
       
       
      The examples cited by the appellant of supposed confusion do not indicate otherwise.  
       
      
    144 For the reasons given at [164]-[168] of the Court’s judgment in Makarov (No. 2) and at [117] Makarov (No. 3), we reject this ground. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5 - alleged bias of the trial Judge 
       
      
    145 The fifth ground of appeal is: 
     
      
       
        
        “The trial miscarried and there was a miscarriage of justice as a result of the trial Judge bias against the appellant.” 
        
       
      
    146 The appellant’s submissions addressed four areas of alleged bias: 
     
      
       
      (a) prejudiced behaviour towards the appellant’s Counsel; 
       
       
      (b) prejudiced decisions;  
       
       
      (c) legal errors; 
       
       
      (d) the trial Judge’s use of “a special technology of psychology programming the jury against the appellant.” 
       
       
       
      Ground 5 - prejudice towards Counsel 
       
        
       
      
    147 In respect of the alleged prejudice towards the appellant’s Counsel, the appellant referred to two occasions when the trial Judge interrupted cross-examination of the complainant (AWS 8.1-8.3). The first occurred during cross-examination as to an apparent inconsistency between the content of D’s autobiography and the proposition that he was being sexually molested at that time. The following exchange occurred (T195.1-195.37): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And would you recognise that potentially it’s inconsistent in terms of the emotion expressed, as being an inconsistent expression of emotion between a person who’s being molested and the person who’s molesting them? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No because it was written well before. That was Chapter 4, there were more than 4 chapters, I don’t think I finished that chapter probably I don’t know beginning of term 2 or something like that, I wasn’t being molested at that point so my – it’s perfectly consistent with my feeling towards Victor Makarov at that time. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. However, if your parents stopped coming regularly to your lessons in August–September -- 
        
       
       
        
        A. No, no, I said they came earlier, you said August– September. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I know but I’m putting a proposition to you. If they stopped coming in August–September then the situation would be, wouldn’t it, that it was well before that point? 
        
       
       
        
        H H: Sorry, what was well before that point? 
        
       
       
        
        Turnbull: The writing of this particular statement.  
        
       
       
        
        HH: But how has he related the writing of the statement or the writing of the autobiography to the time when his parents ceased to come regularly to-- 
        
       
       
        
        Turnbull: Because that’s when he says the molestation started, because they were out of the way and he got the fantastic lesson and so forth. 
        
       
       
        
        HH: But I don’t understand him to have associated with that event the writing of the biography, he associates it with the end of term 2. Anyway-- 
        
       
       
        
        Turnbull: I’ll move on your Honour.”  
        
       
      
    148 There can be no complaint about the Judge’s interruption. The question before the interruption was confusing. It was not unfair for the trial Judge to seek to identify, by reference to the complainant’s evidence, the point sought to be made.  
     
      
    149 The second interruption came during cross-examination of the complainant about the letter he wrote to the appellant for the appellant’s fiftieth birthday. The following exchange occurred (T249.23-249.29): 
     
      
       
        
        “Turnbull: Did you love him when you wrote that letter? 
        
       
       
        
        HH: What’s that got to do with this Mr Turnbull? Really what’s it got to do with this whether he loves him now or not? 
        
       
       
        
        Turnbull: It’s in the letter. 
        
       
       
        
        HH: I’m having trouble with the relevance of whether or not he loves your client. 
        
       
       
        
        Turnbull: If your Honour pleases I’ll withdraw that question.” 
        
       
      
    150 As submitted by the Crown, the question was of doubtful relevance and in any event it was withdrawn. 
     
      
    151 The appellant also sought to sustain the allegation of bias on the part of the trial Judge by reference to remarks made during the trial by his Counsel, in the absence of the jury. Counsel had complained that the Judge was giving “short shrift” to his complaints during cross-examination and referred to the Judge’s demeanour in relation to his most recent objection (T537.32). The Judge asked Counsel to identify what demeanour he was referring to. He said that the Judge was becoming “exasperated and impatient”. The substance of the Judge’s response was that she was becoming exasperated and impatient because the objections were without foundation. An examination of the transcript of the cross-examination does not disclose any foundation for the accusation of bias. Counsel’s objections were not dealt with unfairly. It should be acknowledged that the likely appearance of the transcript was itself part of Counsel’s complaint to the Judge. He had submitted that the transcript would not disclose the dynamics of the trial. He complained that the tone of the Judge’s voice and her demeanour may convey a different flavour (T538.49). 
     
      
    152 Counsel confirmed that he was not seeking a discharge of the jury (T537.38). However difficult it may be for an appellate Court to discern the mood of a trial from its transcript, the fact that Counsel distanced himself from the proposition that the Judge should discharge the jury is a compelling indication that there was no miscarriage of justice. This part of ground 5 should be rejected. 
     
      
      Ground 5 - prejudiced decisions 
       
      
    153 The appellant’s written submissions (AWS 8.4) referred to three matters. The first was a complaint about the Judge’s warning to the jury, at the outset of the trial, to disregard anything they might have heard through the newspapers (or otherwise) when the accused was first charged by police. The complaint appeared to be that her Honour’s remarks would in fact have directed the jury to the Internet, where there was publicity about the allegations made by the other complainants. There is no substance in that complaint. Her Honour was specifically directing the jury not to have regard to any such material. A failure to give such a warning might equally be a cause for complaint. 
     
      
    154 The other two matters repeated the appellant’s complaints in respect of two of the Judge’s rulings on evidence which are dealt with under ground 3 above. 
     
      
    155 In his oral submissions, the appellant also complained that the Judge failed to instruct the jury (as Hock DCJ had in the later trials) that if she did not remind them of any particular piece of evidence, they should not draw any conclusion from that. The Judge told the jury that she did not propose to repeat all of the evidence (SU 3) and gave proper directions as to the role of the jury to decide what evidence to accept (SU 2). She also told them that they should consider the totality of the evidence and not only the evidence to which she had referred (SU 6). There is no substance to this complaint. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5 - legal errors  
       
      
    156 The submissions under the third limb of ground 5 (AWS 8.5) repeated the submissions made under ground 2 (AWS 5.1-5.6) discussed above. No bias is disclosed by those matters. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5 - use of psychological programming 
       
      
    157 The fourth limb of ground 5 alleged that the Judge used a special technology of psychological programming to turn the jury against the appellant. The appellant submitted that the Judge used key signal words and phrases to undermine him, and deliberately erased information positive for his case (AWS 8.6-8.8). He sought to sustain the submission with a list of references by the trial Judge to the complainant as a “witness of truth”. Separately, the appellant identified a number of occasions on which the Judge referred to “convicting” the accused, and similar references. The examples given were in fact the directions required by law to be given. As submitted by the Crown, the Judge, quite properly, emphasised to the jury the need to find the complainant to be honest and truthful before they could return a guilty verdict.  
     
      
    158 Separately, the appellant submitted (AWS 8.7) that the Judge used language calculated to arouse parental feelings towards the complainant by referring to him by his christian name whilst referring to the appellant as the accused. He complained that the Judge never referred to him by his title “Professor” or “Professor Makarov”. There is no substance in that submission. The term “accused” is a neutral, accurate description of the status of a person being tried for an offence.  
     
      
    159 Finally, the appellant complained that the Judge omitted in her summing-up to refer to “all proven facts of D’s lies”. The matters pointed to by the appellant to demonstrate the supposed perjury of D are discussed above in respect of ground 1. For the reasons there set out, we are not satisfied that any of the matters relied on by the appellant demonstrated that D lied. It follows that there is no substance in the complaint that the Judge failed to refer to those supposed lies in her summing-up. 
     
      
    160 Ground 5 is dismissed. 
     
      
      Ground 6 - character  
       
      
    161 The sixth ground of appeal is: 
     
      
       
        
        “The trial miscarried and there was a miscarriage of justice as a result of impossibility of introducing the appellant’s “character”. 
        
       
      
    162 This ground was based on an indication given by the trial Judge at the outset of the trial and repeated on the third day that, if the appellant raised character, that would potentially bring into play the evidence of the three Ukrainian students (T11; T133.16). The substance of the appellant’s submissions (AWS 9.1-9.7) was that, as a result of that indication, he was precluded from adducing a great deal of evidence (summarised in his submissions at pages 117-124) that would have demonstrated his good character. 
     
      
    163 This submission proceeds on a misconception. Evidence of the appellant’s good character was not excluded by any decision of the trial Judge. The appellant’s Counsel stated that he would be endeavouring not to put character into play (T133.25). It would have been open to the appellant to adduce evidence of his good character but, as the trial Judge correctly warned, that course carried the risk that some of the evidence of the Ukrainian students would have become admissible. The appellant’s Counsel was wise to avoid that risk. 
     
      
    164 Ground 6 is dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Ground 7 - quality of the evidence 
       
      
    165 The seventh ground of appeal was: 
     
      
       
        
        “The trial miscarried and there was a miscarriage of justice as a result of the nature and quality of the evidence relied upon by the trial Crown prosecutor and violation by the trial Crown prosecutor the (sic) legal principles of burden of proof, proof, standard of proof and presumption of innocence.” 
        
       
      
    166 In support of this ground, the appellant repeated all of the complaints made under ground 1 as to inconsistencies and alleged anomalies in the evidence at the trial (AWS 10.1.1-10.3.1 at pages 132-147 and 10.4.4 at pages 148-149). His purpose in doing so appears to have been to establish the foundation for his submission that the Crown failed to adduce any evidence or objective measure to establish the existence of the facts in issue in the trial (AWS 10.4-10.4.3 and 10.5). The appellant submitted that, rather than discharging her “persuasive” burden, the Crown had taken the “incantious” (presumably intended to mean “incantatory”) approach of frequently repeating the allegations to produce a magical effect. He submitted that, as a result, the Crown prosecutor had created an illegal situation where “the accusations against the appellant without any proof had been turned into the supporting evidence, which allegedly established existence of the facts” (AWS 10.5 at page 150).  
     
      
    167 That submission is completely misconceived. The evidence of the complainant D was admissible to prove the elements of the offences alleged in the indictment. The insinuation that the Crown’s frequent repetition of D’s allegations may be likened to a form of sorcery is absurd and must be firmly dismissed. 
     
      
    168 The appellant also submitted that the Crown prosecutor misled the jury in a number of respects during her closing address (AWS 10.6-10.7). An examination of the transcript of the Crown’s address against the evidence she was referring to demonstrates that those submissions are without foundation.  
     
      
    169 Separately, the appellant submitted that the Crown prosecutor was guilty of misconduct in respect of remarks made during her opening address (AWS 10.8 at page 157). The complaint was that the Crown prosecutor referred to the fact that the appellant came to Australia with his wife and daughter and “five talented young pianists, some of whom will be witnesses in this case”.  
     
      
    170 The appellant submitted that the prosecutor’s remark was incorrect because it was made on 22 November 2004, before the trial Judge had made her ruling that the evidence of admissions made to the three Ukrainian students would be admitted. That submission is misconceived. The remarks were plainly made in anticipation of the Judge’s ruling. In the event that the Judge had ruled against the Crown, an issue might have arisen as to whether the reference in opening to evidence which was not in due course admitted gave rise to any prejudice. However, that situation did not arise.  
     
      
    171 Secondly, the appellant submitted that it was highly prejudicial to identify the students as Crown witnesses because the jury could wonder about information beyond the allegations involving D. There is no substance in that submission. The students were Crown witnesses. It was entirely appropriate for the Crown prosecutor to identify the evidence she anticipated calling. The suggestion that the jury would have speculated about other matters is itself speculative.  
     
      
    172 Ground 7 is dismissed.  
     
      
       
      Ground 8 - alleged incompetence of counsel  
       
      
    173 The eighth ground of appeal was:  
     
      
       
        
        “The trial miscarried and there was a miscarriage of justice as a result of the appellant’s legal representatives incompetence in failing to uncover and lead the evidence that may affected (sic) the result”. 
        
       
      
    174 There is some overlap between ground 8 and the first part of ground 1. The appellant submitted (AWS 11.1-11.4) that his legal representatives at the trial failed to uncover expert evidence in relation to the impossibility of developing a successful career as a concert pianist whilst suffering from the psychological injuries that inevitably flow from sexual abuse. He submitted alternatively that his Counsel should have made submissions to the trial Judge to invite the Crown to lead such evidence. That submission assumes the acceptance of ground 1(i), which we have rejected. It should also be rejected, for the same reasons. 
     
      
    175 The appellant also submitted (AWS 11.5-11.10) that his Counsel failed to lead “the crucial evidence” in relation to the autobiography and the letter written to the appellant for his fiftieth birthday. This submission was based on the passage of cross-examination set out at [149] above in support of the appellant’s complaint that the Judge was biased (ground 5). The appellant submits that the same exchange also demonstrates the incompetence of his Counsel. The substance of the submission was that the Judge’s interruption was based on the irrelevance of the issue whether the complainant loved the appellant at the time of the trial, whereas Counsel’s question had been directed to whether the complainant loved the appellant at the time he wrote the letter. 
     
      
    176 One of the matters relied on by the appellant to establish why this evidence was crucial was his contention that the letter must have been written after the act of sodomy charged in count 9. As discussed above, that contention is based on a misapprehension as to the evidence of Senior Constable Ng. It was open on the evidence to find that the sodomy offence was committed after D wrote the letter (even if that took it outside the time frame alleged in the indictment). Even if the position were otherwise, the content of the letter did not conclusively establish anything. The likelihood that D would write such a letter if he had been indecently or sexually assaulted was one of the many factors to be taken into account by the jury in their assessment of the issues in the trial.  
     
      
    177 Further, the complainant had given an explanation as to why he wrote the letter (T248.21-248.33). It is doubtful whether it would have advanced the appellant’s defence to press the topic. The decision to withdraw the question was a forensic judgment that does not display incompetence.  
     
      
    178 The appellant also submitted that the failure to object to the admission of exhibit F, the list of names of files deleted from the hard drive of the appellant’s computer, amounted to incompetence that produced a miscarriage of justice (AWS 11. 15 at page 169). That submission is addressed in the discussion of the admissibility of that evidence under count 3 above.  
     
      
    179 The remaining submissions in support of count 8 (AWS 11.11-11.14 and 11.16) repeated matters agitated in support of other grounds and alleged that the appellant’s Counsel and legal representatives were incompetent in failing to raise those matters at trial. It is not necessary to address those submissions, since they assumed the acceptance of other grounds which we have rejected as being without substance.  
     
      
    180 Ground 8 is dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 9 and 10  
       
      
    181 The ninth ground of appeal was: 
     
      
       
        
        “The acquittal on Count 8 as proof of the jury’s reasonable doubt concerning D’s credibility and truthfulness”. 
        
       
       
      Our reasons for dismissing that ground are set out in the discussion of ground 1(ii) above. 
       
      
    182 At the hearing of the appeal, the Court granted leave to the appellant to rely on a tenth ground of appeal that was addressed in his written submissions, but not included in the notice of appeal. It was: 
     
      
       
        
        “The trial miscarried and there was a miscarriage of justice as a result of the Crown prosecutor and trial Judge’s misconduct in relation to the time of the essence of the offences No. No. 1-7 and 9.” 
        
       
       
      The submissions in support of that ground duplicate the matters raised in support of grounds 1(iii), (v) and (vi) above and, as to the autobiography and the fiftieth birthday letter, parts of grounds 5 and 8. They are addressed in the discussion of those grounds above. For the reasons there set out, ground 10 is dismissed. 
       
      
    183 The appeal against conviction is dismissed.

    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was convicted of the murder of Warren Dickson on 13 February 2005. He appeals that conviction. There are three grounds of appeal, two relating to the admission of evidence. The other ground raises one aspect of the trial judge’s summing up for consideration. 
     
      
       
      Relevant matters 
       
      
    2 The authorities became aware that Mr Dickson had died after police and fire brigade officers came to the house where he lived at 90 Commerce Street, Taree in response to an emergency call. In the main bedroom of the house they found the burned remains of Mr Dickson. His throat had been cut twice and a post mortem examination confirmed that his trachea and carotid artery had been severed. Several days later on 18 February 2005 the appellant robbed the Wauchope branch of the ANZ Bank and made away with approximately $23,000. 
     
      
    3 The Crown case was that the appellant, jealous that his former partner Nicole Deluca had rejected him in favour of the deceased, went to the deceased’s house late at night and broke in through a kitchen window. There was evidence that during the previous week the appellant had been following Ms Deluca and had found out where the deceased lived. On the Friday night before the offence, which occurred on a Sunday, the appellant had followed Ms Deluca and the deceased home from the cinema. On the Saturday he again returned to the house, saw Ms Deluca’s car and looked through the window into the bedroom. 
     
      
    4 The evidence was that the appellant had gone to the deceased’s house wearing gloves and a balaclava. Although the appellant said he was wearing thongs it was the Crown case that he was wearing sneakers. The Crown alleged that he was carrying an iron bar or crowbar, although the appellant claimed that he was carrying a piece of “reo.” He “shimmied” up the pipe outside the rear kitchen window, broke the glass and climbed in. It was the Crown case that he intended to cause serious injury to the deceased. The appellant said that he had entered via the kitchen window because the deceased had not answered his door on a previous occasion. 
     
      
    5 The deceased was apparently awakened by the noise and confronted the appellant in the kitchen. Significant pools of blood were found in the kitchen and it is apparent that the deceased was killed at this location. A post-mortem was carried out which indicated that the deceased suffered two fatal wounds to his neck: one a slash wound and the other a stab wound. Death would have followed quickly as a result of either wound. The weapon used to make the wounds was never found. 
     
      
    6 After the deceased had died the appellant dragged him through the house to the main bedroom. The appellant, using an accelerant, set the house alight and fled the scene. The seat of the fire was identified as the main bedroom.  
     
      
    7 The appellant met Ms Deluca later on the morning of 14 February. He feigned ignorance of the events. When spoken to by the police he denied any involvement in the crime and claimed, contrary to the evidence of his daughter, Kimberley, that he was home all night. He denied knowing the deceased’s name or where he lived. He said to the police “Lucky I didn’t know the guy or I’d be the prime suspect.” On 16 February 2005 the police inspected the appellant’s house and car. During the course of the search, Det Buining apparently detected blood on some portion of the appellant’s car. He called over another police officer and informed him of his discovery. The evidence indicates that the appellant’s demeanour, which had previously been calm, suddenly changed. 
     
      
    8 Soon after the appellant went and retrieved his children from school intending to take them to their mother’s home in Ipswich, Queensland. On his way to Queensland he visited a friend, Elizabeth Mitchell, who at the time had friends over for a barbecue. One of the friends was Jeremy Moy. 
     
      
    9 When the appellant was alone with Ms Mitchell he told her of the killing. Ms Mitchell said that in a “smug” fashion with “no remorse for what he had done” he told her that he had slit the deceased’s throat. He said they had struggled; that the deceased had a metal pole and that “Warren [the deceased] was getting it over him when they were scuffling.” The appellant then showed her a bum bag from which he removed a black hand gun stating that he was going to use it for armed robberies; and that he was going to rob a bank to get money, “about a hundred grand” - so that he could hide away. He also told her that when he had left her place he was going to take his children for a drive to their mother’s house in Queensland and tell them what he had done. 
     
      
    10 It was the Crown case that whilst the appellant was at Ms Mitchell’s house he removed number plates from a Nissan Skyline motor vehicle and put them onto his own car. 
     
      
    11 The appellant arrived in Ipswich the following morning and had a conversation with his former wife, Ms Matthews. He told her “I did it, I killed him.” She asked him if there was any other way he could have handled it and he replied “No. I’m sick of being walked on and shitted on. The things I’m going to have to do to survive.” He also told his former wife that the police had found blood on his car and indicated that this would mean “he was stuffed” or words to that effect. He told her “the bastard deserved it.” She said that the appellant left her house because he believed that he had seen a detective parked out the front. He returned to New South Wales. 
     
      
    12 The appellant’s daughter, Kimberley who was then aged 12 years, was interviewed by the police on ERISP on 18 February 2005. The interview was played to the jury. Kimberley said that during the trip to Ipswich her father told her that he had killed the deceased “because he took his girlfriend away from him” and “she was cheating on him.” She said that he told her that when he was struggling with the deceased, the deceased “was trying to get the crowbar off him.” She stated on the ERISP “and Dad was out, coming, just coming through the window or something and then he hit, he, Dad hit the, Wazza over the head with the crowbar, crowbar and split his head. And then he was, like, in shock or something. And then he pinned him to the ground … I think, then I think that’s when he killed him. But he didn’t say what with.” 
     
      
    13 On 18 February the appellant robbed the bank at Wauchope. He said that he used a replica pistol. The teller who was removing money from teller boxes said to him:  
     
      
       
        
        “Isn’t there any other way? Are you sure you want to go through with this?” 
        
       
      
    14 The appellant replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “Once they find out what I did last week, that’s it. I need the money.” 
        
       
      
    15 Prior to the bank robbery the appellant abandoned his car in the State Forest at Wauchope. After the robbery he bought a cheap car which broke down. He telephoned Ms Kelly Barkwill for help and she came and picked him up and took him back to her house. After they had arrived they went into a room together and the appellant spread out a significant amount of cash and three black handguns on the bed. 
     
      
    16 The appellant told Ms Barkwill of the killing of the deceased. He said that when the deceased had realised who he was a struggle ensued and he had hit the deceased a few times with a steel bar. He said that he then grabbed the knife from the knife block and pinned the deceased down and cut his throat. He told her of the Wauchope bank robbery and said that he intended to rob a further two banks and needed $60,000 to lay low for a while. She said that she last saw the appellant on 19 February 2005 attempting to break into a car yard. 
     
      
    17 The appellant later borrowed his mother’s car. He had not spoken to her but left a note apologising for taking the vehicle in which he said inter alia “All I know is, that the thought of spending the rest of my life in prison does not appeal to me.” He travelled to Sydney, later went to Bathurst and then to Singleton. 
     
      
    18 On 20 February 2005 the appellant sent an email to Ms Deluca. He gave a version of the events which included a statement that the deceased had come at him with a knife. He also sent an email to his father in which he said that the deceased “came at me with a knife. It became a life and death struggle.” 
     
      
    19 The Crown emphasised at the trial that it was not until 20 February that the appellant’s account of the relevant events included the fact that the deceased had a knife. At his trial the appellant claimed that when he had called into Ms Mitchell’s house he had told Mr Jeremy Moy about the struggle and that the deceased had pulled a knife on him. Mr Moy denied that this conversation had occurred.  
     
      
    20 On 22 February 2005 the appellant approached a solicitor at Wingham. On 23 February he was picked up from Singleton by Mr McQueeney who was a friend of the solicitor. On their way to the solicitor’s office the appellant requested that they make a detour to the go-kart track in Wingham. Mr McQueeney left the appellant there with another person but before he drove off observed the appellant take his backpack and a plastic bag into a canteen which he had entered using a key. Police later discovered in the canteen, secreted behind a fridge, the backpack and a black case. In the case was a replica pistol which the teller at the ANZ Bank in Wauchope identified as the gun held by the person who had robbed the bank.  
     
      
    21 The backpack contained $11,700 in cash together with other items belonging to the appellant. The appellant said that he hid these items because he did not want the police, when he turned himself in, to take unnecessary action with other people around. 
     
      
       
      The defence case 
       
      
    22 The appellant gave evidence at his trial. He claimed that a steel bar which he used to break the window at the deceased’s premises happened to be lying on the top of a garden chair. When he climbed in the window he said the light turned on and the deceased came at him with a knife. The appellant then described a violent struggle. This evidence was not supported by the state of the premises when inspected by the police. The appellant said that in the course of the struggle the deceased lost his grip on his knife and the appellant lost his grip on his bar. The appellant said he was punched many times and received a powerful blow to his head. He said the deceased stood over him striking him numerous times over the head and back as he lay on the floor. The appellant said he grabbed the knife which was on the floor, and swung it at the deceased defensively as he came at the appellant with the steel bar. He said that after setting the house alight he left with the knife and steel bar in a plastic bag which he disposed of at a dump site.  
     
      
    23 The appellant denied telling his daughter, Kimberley, that he had hit the deceased over the head with an iron bar. When cross-examined he agreed that he had not told his children that he had killed a man in order to save his own life. 
     
      
    24 In relation to the bank robbery he claimed: 
     
      
       
        
        “I was thinking about how I can use the replica and put meself in a position of the police coming along and shooting me and I decided – this was in the afternoon, that because I’d seen the banks and that in me walking, and decided maybe a bank robbery would give me enough – be enough reason for the police to come along and shoot me. I’d noticed where the Police Station was and picked the closest bank to the Police Station, it appeared to be the ANZ Bank. So I decided that would be the best option.” 
        
       
      
    25 The appellant said that after he saw how shaken the bank teller was during the robbery he decided she would not handle seeing a shoot out. He said that as a consequence he decided not to put her through more stress and simply took the money and left. As the Crown pointed out there was no explanation given as to how he could have engaged in a “shoot out” with a replica gun. 
     
      
    26 The appellant was questioned at the police station following his arrest. This occurred on 23 February 2005 when two brownish coloured marks on each side of the appellant’s spinal column were detected. The solicitor who took the photographs of the appellant said that she also saw red grazes on the appellant’s knees. Evidence was given by Ms Deluca that she had not noticed any injuries or any indications of soreness to the appellant when they met on 14 February 2005 and gave each other a hug. The police did not observe any injury to the appellant when they searched his house and car on 16 February 2005. On both these occasions the appellant had worn a short sleeved shirt and “cargo shorts.” In his evidence the appellant said that Ms Barkwill had commented on bruises she had observed on his back on the night of 18 February when they had slept together. Ms Barkwill denied this. 
     
      
    27 The appellant accepted that he had killed Mr Dickson. He said that he acted in self-defence. The issue of provocation was also left with the jury. In relation to the latter issue I have discussed the factual basis for the submission in [40]-[42] below. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    28 There are three grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground One: the trial miscarried because of the admission into evidence of the circumstances of the armed robbery committed by the appellant. 
       
      
    29 The appellant submitted to this Court that the evidence of the armed robbery, although having some probative value, was weak and the evidence, being unfairly prejudicial to the appellant, should have been rejected. In the alternative it was submitted that “surgery” could have been carried out on the evidence and the conversation with the bank teller tendered without evidence that it occurred during a robbery. 
     
      
    30 Before the trial commenced the appellant had unsuccessfully sought to have his trial for the armed robbery count separated from his trial for the murder. That application was rejected but no appeal was filed. When the matter was agitated during the trial, counsel for the appellant indicated that the appellant admitted as a fact that (a) he attended the residence of the deceased on the day of his death; (b) he entered the deceased’s residence; (c) there was a verbal and physical confrontation with the deceased; and (d) he inflicted the fatal wounds during the course of a struggle. The appellant also admitted that he had robbed the bank.  
     
      
    31 The trial judge considered an objection to the evidence which he identified as being evidence of the robbery together with statements about it either before or after the event. His Honour identified the fact that the principal issue in the trial was likely to be self-defence. His Honour determined that the appellant’s statements to other persons as to the nature of, and reasons for his actions were intertwined with his statements regarding his intention to obtain money unlawfully and to flee. His Honour was further of the view that evidence of the proposed robbery and flight was capable of demonstrating consciousness of guilt, although whether it had this quality was a matter for the jury. His Honour referred to the remarks of Simpson J in R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 where her Honour considered the issues relevant to lies which were said to reflect consciousness of guilt (at [21] and following). 
     
      
    32 His Honour concluded that parts of the statements made by the appellant to Ms Mitchell, Ms Barkwill and to Ms Mathews relating to his intention to rob a bank or the fact that he had committed a bank robbery to provide funds for his contemplated disappearance were relevant as possible evidence of consciousness of guilt. The robbery and contemplated flight might be found by the jury to reflect an awareness on his part that his actions in killing the deceased did not flow from a belief that he had been acting in defence of his person. Similarly his Honour ruled that the evidence of the removal of the children to Queensland and his return to New South Wales and the carrying out of the robbery at Wauchope were capable of reflecting a consciousness of guilt. 
     
      
    33 Having concluded that the evidence was relevant, his Honour proceeded to determine whether it should be excluded pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995. His Honour concluded that the probative value of the evidence of the robbery was high and concluded that the expanded version of the appellant’s statement to Ms Preston in the bank was capable of being regarded by the jury as a significant admission. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Secondly, as the Crown submitted, the facts of the Wauchope robbery tend to give credibility and reliability to the evidence of both Ms Mitchell and Ms Barkwill. Thirdly, as I have already said, the evidence is capable of demonstrating consciousness of guilt in the sense I have described, particularly having regard to the issues that arise in the present matter. This is so notwithstanding the fact that ultimately the accused handed himself in to the police. 
        
       
       
        
        As to prejudice, there is little doubt that the jury will be likely to take a dim view of the accused’s character when they become aware of his involvement in the armed robbery. Certainly it will be unlikely to endear the accused to the jury. In that obvious sense, the material is prejudicial to the accused. But will the material be used by the jury in a way that is or might be unfair to the accused? 
        
       
       
        
        The authorities make it clear that there is no general principle that when the explanation for flight involves revealing other offences, the evidence should be rejected. (See  
        R v Cook  
        per Simpson J at para 47). That, of course, is not, in any event, the situation here. The Crown case is that the contemplated flight embraced, as an essential feature, the robbery that was, shortly after the killing, actually carried out. There appear to me to be two safeguards that substantially reduce, if not entirely eliminate, the risk of the robbery evidence being used unfairly. 
        
       
       
        
        The first relates to the directions to be given to the jury. I addressed this matter at length in my previous decision given on 22 June 2006. There is no need for me to repeat those earlier remarks other than to say I adhere to them. Indeed, the Crown has prepared a draft direction, it appears in the transcript of the argument, and I would expect, with the additional assistance that I can anticipate from Mr Stewart, that a satisfactory direction can be formulated to make it absolutely clear to the jury how they may all, more importantly, may not use the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        Secondly, the general direction relating to the accused’s post killing conduct, including the robbery itself, as evidencing a possible consciousness of guilt will alert the jury to the possibility that he may have undertaken that course of conduct by reason of consciousness of guilt, not of the offence of murder but of other offences or of other discreditable conduct (see  
        Cook  
        again at para 47). So too will a direction relating to the remark passed in the bank during the robbery point to the possibility that it may not be an admission of murder but one relating to his generally discreditable conduct that is distinct from the offence charged. 
        
       
       
        
        For these reasons, it is my present view and hence my present ruling that the robbery evidence may be admitted.” 
        
       
      
    34 The appellant challenged his Honour’s conclusion and submitted that the probative value of the evidence of the robbery was not high. It was submitted that his Honour erred in finding that the admissions about the death of the deceased and their juxtaposition with the robbery “inextricably intertwine[d] the two sets of material.” It was further submitted that the evidence was not capable of demonstrating consciousness of guilt “of murder as opposed to manslaughter on the basis of excessive self-defence and provocation”. Finally it was submitted that the directions could not eliminate any unfair prejudice. 
     
      
    35 The appellant accepted that a decision of a trial judge made pursuant to s 137 may only be reviewed by consideration of the principles stated in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499: see Vickers v R [2006] NSWCCA 60; (2006) 160 A Crim R 195 at [76]; R v SJRC [2007] NSWCCA 142 at [34]; Can v R [2007] NSWCCA 176 at [43]. In Gonzales v R [2007] NSWCCA 321; (2007) 178 A Crim R 232 Giles JA observed at [55] that the provision is akin to a discretion in that it calls for an evaluative judgment; see also Smale v R [2007] NSWCCA 328 per Howie J. 
     
      
    36 In my judgment the challenged evidence was properly admitted. The admissions which the appellant made in the course of the robbery were capable of being understood by the jury as reflecting a consciousness in the appellant that he had wrongfully killed the deceased. 
     
      
    37 The appellant’s reaction to the killing, including the commission of the armed robbery, was an indication of his state of mind and how he viewed his actions. He told his mother in the note to her “All I know is, that the thought of spending the rest of my life in prison does not appeal to me.” It was open to the jury to conclude that his flight, and the measures he took to stay on the run from the police, including raising money by robbing the bank, indicated a consciousness on his part that he had not acted in self-defence. 
     
      
    38 The appellant said that his reason for committing the armed robbery of the bank was to “lay low” for a while to evade capture for killing the deceased. He did not suggest that he committed the robbery for some unrelated reason. 
     
      
    39 The appellant was not in the dilemma referred to in R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 of being unable to say anything about the evidence or being required to disclose unrelated criminal activity. The defence had available the submission to the jury, as was submitted to this Court, that the appellant’s actions were motivated by panic and borne of a feeling of moral (not legal) responsibility or the prospect of unjust arrest.  
     
      
    40 Counsel for the appellant submitted that the evidence of flight was not capable of demonstrating consciousness of guilt of murder as opposed to manslaughter on the basis of excessive self-defence or provocation. Although both self-defence and provocation were left to the jury it is difficult, on the facts as revealed by the evidence, to determine how provocation could have arisen for serious consideration. The words said to constitute the provocation were allegedly uttered by the deceased whilst the appellant was in fear of his life as he was being attacked with an iron bar. Moments later it is said that he lashed out with the knife in self-defence.  
     
      
    41 The relevant extract from the transcript is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: At that time, did you fear for your safety? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: When you say yes, you did fear for your safety, what at that time were you thinking could happen to you? 
         
        A: I thought I was going to die. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Did you do anything when that was happening. You said that you put your arms up? 
         
        A: As I put my arms over my head, I cried out to him to stop, ‘Stop hitting me. I’ve got kids.’ 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Did he respond at all to that? 
         
        A: He say, ‘Fuck you. I’m going to beat you to a fucking pulp. I’m going to fuck your kids up the arse like I fucked your missus’.” 
        
       
      
    42 The appellant then described his burst of rage and energy and kicking himself free. He said that he headed towards the lighted door, grabbed the knife from the floor and stood up. He then said: “I saw him coming at me with the bar raised, and in a split second I’ve returned swing to the left and the knife hit him in the neck on the side of the neck.” He was later asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: Firstly, why did you pick up the knife? 
         
        A: I don’t know, I wasn’t even thinking. I think I was more reacting than thinking. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Reacting to what? 
         
        A: Him attacking me, the rage I felt, the fear. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Fear of what? 
         
        A: Fear of dying.” 
        
       
      
    43 Any effect upon the appellant of the alleged provocation could not be separated from his actions said to have been done in self-defence. The appellant only described himself lashing out with the knife once and it is difficult to see, on his account, how excessive force entered into the equation. If his account was accepted he had lawfully acted in self-defence. At the very least from his account of the relevant events he would have believed that his actions were lawful. It must be remembered that the appellant claimed that he was initially confronted by the deceased who was carrying the knife. In these circumstances the appellant’s reaction to the killing including his actions in fleeing the police and committing the armed robbery were capable of indicating how he truly viewed his actions. 
     
      
    44 There are further considerations. In my opinion it was open to the jury to conclude that the appellant’s statement to the bank teller constituted an admission that he had murdered the deceased. He told the teller: “Once they find out what I did last week, that’s it. I need the money.” Even if the statement was open to being construed as an innocent interpretation, it was capable of being understood as an admission that he had killed the deceased without justification. There were other admissions interwoven with the robbery. These included the conversation he had with Ms Barkwill and the counting out of the money and revealing the gun. To my mind the circumstances associated with the robbery were inextricably bound up with the conduct of the appellant following the killing and were admissible. 
     
      
    45 The appellant emphasised that the prejudicial effect of the evidence was high and submitted that for this reason it should have been rejected (s 137 Evidence Act 1995). I do not accept that submission even though the evidence revealed another criminal offence: see Markby v The Queen (1978) 140 CLR 108 at 116; Smale v R [2007] NSWCCA 328 at [33]. The same position prevails in relation to offences committed during flight: R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 at [47]; Quinlan v R [2006] NSWCCA 284; (2006) 164 A Crim R 106 at [18]. The detail of the robbery was not an issue. There was no difficulty for the jury in separating the fact of the robbery from the killing and there was, in my view, no prospect of the jury using the evidence in an impermissible way. As the respondent pointed out, it was possible for the appellant to have turned his admission of the robbery to his advantage. Having made that admission and given himself up to the police, he was in a position to indicate that he was a person telling the truth including giving a truthful account of the circumstances in which he killed the deceased. 
     
      
    46 I reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 - the trial miscarried because the learned trial judge did not give the jury adequate directions about what use could be made of the armed robbery evidence. 
       
      
    47 His Honour addressed the issue of the armed robbery on a number of occasions. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now once again may I remind you the Crown has submitted that you should infer that the actions of the accused, relating to his proposal for flight and his actions in fleeing from Taree to Queensland and from Queensland back to Taree; his actions in robbing the bank, then leaving Taree and going to Sydney and out to Kelso before he made up his mind to hand himself in, that all those matters, and the other matters that I have mentioned, were occasioned by consciousness on the part of the accused of his guilt, that is guilt of the offence of unlawfully killing the deceased. In the context of this trial, the Crown asserts that these circumstances are evidence from which, together with all the other evidence in the case, you can infer that the accused realised that he had not acted in self-defence in killing the deceased and that he had not acted under provocation. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        If, however, you are satisfied that each circumstance was in deliberate contemplation of, or preparation for flight or an incident of the actual flight itself: then you must also be satisfied that the circumstance, firstly, was carried out by the accused because of his knowledge of the offence he had committed of murder, and secondly, occurred because the accused realised that to remain in Taree would inevitably lead to his arrest and prosecution. And thirdly, occurred because the accused knew and realised his own guilt, in the sense that he knew he had unlawfully killed the deceased, that is that he killed him otherwise than in self-defence and under provocation. 
        
       
       
        
        I emphasise that you must be satisfied that what was in his mind when he undertook these acts, when each of these circumstances occurred, was his guilt of the offence of murder, that is of the unlawful killing of the deceased and not of some other crime or wrong doing or some other bad or discreditable conduct. In particular you must be satisfied that the circumstances in each situation I have identified point unequivocally to consciousness of guilt of the offence of murder and not to some other offence or discreditable conduct such as breaking into the deceased’s house, fighting with him, struggling with him, assaulting him, or such as being morally responsible for his death or burning the house down with body of the deceased inside it. 
        
       
       
        
        Once again it is necessary for me to remind you that people do not always act rationally and that conduct of this sort may sometimes be explained in other ways. There may be reasons for the accused’s plans for fleeing Taree, if you find that is what he did or contemplated doing, apart from his realisation of guilt of the offence of murder. It may, for example, have been his fear of being unjustly accused of murder, his fear of being unjustly prosecuted for the offences I have identified, or out of concern for his family. If you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that any one of the actions of the accused I have identified occurred for any of those reasons, you cannot use them in the way urged by the Crown. If you are satisfied, however, of the three matters to which I have referred, then you are entitled to use that finding in relation to each circumstance in aid of the other evidence of the Crown case as pointing towards the guilt of the accused. Once again, standing by itself, the evidence could not prove guilt.” 
        
       
      
    48 Earlier in the trial his Honour directed the jury in the following terms, which were repeated to the jury in the summing up: 
     
      
       
        
        “It would be totally wrong and quite impermissible for you to reason that, because the accused had committed a bank robbery shortly after the death of the deceased, that therefore he must be guilty of the murder of Mr Dickson, the deceased. Your own commonsense and logic will tell you of the fallacy of that reasoning. You can well imagine that a person might commit one crime but be completely opposed to the commission of a different crime. It is illogical and it would be quite unfair for you to reason that simply because the accused in this case committed a bank robbery, a matter that he has not denied, that therefore he would also murder a fellow human being.” 
        
       
      
    49 The appellant submitted that his Honour erred by referring to “unlawful killing” rather than, on each relevant occasion, referring to the flight and bank robbery as “consciousness of guilt of the crime of murder.” There is no substance in this submission. In the summing up his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Thirdly, the lie was told because the accused knew that the truth of the matter about which he lied, for example, that he knew the place where the deceased lived, would implicate him in the unlawful killing of the deceased, or to put it another way, because of a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth. By this I mean, on the issues raised in this trial, a realisation that he had not acted in self-defence or under provocation when he killed the deceased.” 
        
       
      
    50 In this passage his Honour made plain that when he spoke of unlawful killing he was speaking about a killing which was not motivated by self-defence or under provocation. To similar effect are the opening words of the first passage extracted from the summing up in [47] above. His Honour spoke in similar terms in later paragraphs. 
     
      
    51 Defence counsel did not complain at the trial about these directions and rule 4 applies. I would decline leave to raise this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 – the trial miscarried because of the admission into evidence of the possession of hunting knives by the appellant. 
       
      
    52 David Steer, the appellant’s brother gave evidence that when visiting the appellant on one occasion in about May 2004, the appellant showed him three “camping type, hunting type knives … normal, off-the-shelf type that they sell in the sporting goods.” Objection was taken to this evidence. By the time the evidence was introduced the appellant’s daughter, Kimberley, had already given evidence. In her ERISP she said that she had actually carried one of the appellant’s knives “last week or something, not long after he broke up with Nicky.” She said her father had two or three little knives and also a bigger one, described by her as “like the ones in the Army shop” which was inside something which was consistent by her description as being a sheath. She also told police that when she was with the appellant on their way to Queensland he told her that he had disposed of the weapons, including his knives. 
     
      
    53 When the police searched Mr Dickson’s house following his death they did not find the knife used to stab him. There were knives in the cutlery drawer and in the sink in the kitchen but these were excluded from being the weapon. The weapon was not otherwise located. 
     
      
    54 It was submitted that evidence of the multiple knives owned by the accused would have influenced the jury adversely to the appellant because they may have concluded that, by reason of the possession of the knives, he had a propensity to commit crimes using them.  
     
      
    55 When ruling that the evidence was admissible the trial judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… there is no evidence that one of these three hunting knives was used in the killing and that will no doubt be pointed out to the jury by counsel in submissions. For my part again I don’t see that the jury would be likely to assume wrongly that it must have been one of the hunting knives that necessarily brought about the death of the deceased. The issue is simply whether the accused had in his possession knives and whether they may have been available to him for his use.” 
        
       
      
    56 The respondent submitted that his Honour was correct to admit evidence of the knives. It was submitted that it was relevant to show that the appellant had access to knives, particularly knives which might have caused the relevant wounds, which were described by Dr Lyons as being occasioned by a “sharp instrument such as a surgical knife, a piece of glass or a general knife”. Furthermore, it was submitted that the evidence about the existence of knives from David Steer supported the evidence which had already been given by Kimberley Steer. The fact that she gave accurate evidence about the knives was submitted as supporting the conclusion that she was reliable about what the appellant told her about how the deceased met his death. 
     
      
    57 I do not accept the Crown’s submission. In my judgment the evidence of multiple hunting knives had the potential to occasion prejudice to the accused. In the absence of evidence that any one of the knives was actually used in the killing, the jury may have been inappropriately influenced to conclude that merely because the appellant possessed knives he had a propensity to use them to kill another person.  
     
      
    58 However, a perusal of the transcript indicates that although the evidence was admitted and the appellant was asked by the prosecutor whether he had taken a knife, which was one of those seen by his brother to the deceased’s house, the matter was not pursued. The Crown Prosecutor confined his submission to a suggestion that the appellant took a knife with him that night and the jury would be satisfied, when looking at the nature of the stab wounds, that a knife other than a typical kitchen knife had been used. In my judgment although the evidence should not have been admitted it played only a minor role in the evidentiary matrix and was not the occasion of injustice to the appellant. 
     
      
       
      The proviso 
       
      
    59 The Crown submitted that even if one of the grounds of appeal was made out this was a suitable case for the application of the proviso (s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912). In my judgment this submission should be accepted. This was a compelling Crown case. 
     
      
    60 The evidence disclosed a motive for the appellant killing the deceased. The appellant, on his own admission, went to the deceased’s house and forced entry through a window. He went there with aggressive intent. The deceased died after receiving a blow or blows to his skull and knife wounds. The knife was not found and it must be concluded was disposed of by the appellant.  
     
      
    61 After committing the offence the appellant lied in denying his involvement. He subsequently admitted the killing. He then travelled to Queensland where he left his children with their mother and returned to New South Wales with the intention of robbing a bank so that he could “lay low” for a time. He expressed his fear to the bank teller that if he was found he would be incarcerated for his actions. There is nothing in his actions to suggest that he believed that he was justified in killing. All of his actions after the offence were consistent with a belief that he had entered the deceased’s premises with the intention of killing or inflicting serious injury on him. 
     
      
    62 In my judgment the admission of evidence that the appellant owned hunting knives was in the ultimate of limited if any significance in the trial. In my judgment no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    63 The appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    64 SIMPSON J: I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Judge at Common Law. With respect to grounds 1 and 2, I do not entirely agree with his Honour’s reasoning process. I agree with the Chief Judge’s reasoning in relation to ground 3. I can express my reasons briefly. It is not necessary to restate the facts. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 1 & 2: admission of evidence of the circumstances of the bank robbery, and directions in relation thereto 
       
      
    65 There were two essential features of the evidence concerning the bank robbery. One was the statement said to have been made by the appellant to the bank teller, Ms Preston. That was unequivocally an incriminating statement, signifying an acceptance by the appellant that he had, the previous week, engaged in conduct that left him vulnerable to consequences of some, serious, kind, and in need of money to allow him a way out. That this evidence was, in some form, admissible and properly admitted was not in question. What was in question was the extent to which the context in which the appellant made those remarks was admitted. 
     
      
    66 The other feature of the evidence was the evidence of the bank robbery itself. That was what has been treated as conduct evidencing a consciousness of guilt. It was evidence capable of exposing to the jury the desperate situation in which the appellant perceived himself to be, and his need for money, in large amounts and quickly, in order to escape the consequences of what he knew he had done. It was properly characterised as evidence admissible within the principles stated in Edwards v The Queen [1993] HCA 63; 178 CLR 193. 
     
      
    67 This was not the only material in the trial urged as evidencing a consciousness of guilt on the part of the appellant. There was, for example, the evidence of his flight to Queensland, and of his note to his mother. 
     
      
    68 The traditional directions given to juries where conduct evidencing consciousness of guilt is relied upon by the Crown includes a strong caution that the jury must, before acting on that evidence, be satisfied that the guilt of which the accused is said to be conscious is of the offence charged, and not some other offence or other discreditable conduct. Ordinarily, that does not occasion too much difficulty. However, where, as here, it is accepted by an accused that he is responsible for the death of the victim, but the issue is whether he is guilty of murder or the lesser crime of manslaughter, in my mind a real difficulty arises, calling for carefully tailored directions.  
     
      
    69 It is not sufficient, in my view, to tell the jury that they must be satisfied that the accused is conscious of his guilt of the crime of murder as distinct from manslaughter; that imputes to an accused person an appreciation of the circumstances that differentiate murder from manslaughter, and of circumstances that provide a partial defence (either by reason of provocation, or self defence) to a charge of murder. 
     
      
    70 I expressed my views on this question in R v Sievers [2004] NSWCCA 463; I adhere to those views. In saying that, I acknowledge that my judgment was a dissenting one, and that an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia was refused: Sievers v The Queen [2005] HCA Trans 663, 2 September 2005. 
     
      
    71 For those reasons, I respectfully disagree with that part of the reasoning of the Chief Judge that takes into account that a conclusion was open to the jury that the appellant was conscious that he had not acted in self defence ([37]) and that, if the appellant’s own account were accepted, then he had acted lawfully in self defence and would have believed that his actions were lawful ([43]). 
     
      
    72 Self defence and provocation are legal concepts. Unless the evidence otherwise establishes, an accused person should not, ordinarily, be presumed to know what they mean or what circumstances make them available. 
     
      
    73 The directions given by the trial judge made the same assumption. In my opinion, those directions were inadequate to meet the requirements of Edwards, and were not moulded to fit the circumstances of the case. 
     
      
    74 Notwithstanding this, I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. The evidence against the appellant was extremely strong; there was evidence of repeated and consistent acknowledgements or admissions by the appellant, so much so as to constitute a pattern; and not one instance of his adding or incorporating anything, even the slightest hint, that Mr Dickson had conducted himself in the way the appellant later claimed (through his lawyer) amounted to provocation or gave rise to self defence. 
     
      
    75 I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
    76 McCALLUM J: I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Judge at Common Law and with his Honour’s reasoning in respect of ground 3. In respect of grounds 1 and 2, I agree with the reasoning of Simpson J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: This is an appeal against the appellant’s conviction for a number of sexual offences alleged to have occurred in June-July 1994 and January 1995, all involving the same complainant. One offence was committing an act of indecency towards the complainant, then under the age of 16 years, in the circumstance of aggravation that she was under the appellant’s authority (Crimes Act 1900, s 61O(1), since amended). The other offences were offences of having sexual intercourse with the complainant, then over the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years, in the same circumstance of aggravation (Crimes Act, s 66C(2)). At the time the complainant was aged 14 or 15.  
     
      
    2 The appellant does not apply for leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    3 The appellant was the leader of a religious community known as the Order of St Charbel. Members of the community lived in houses and caravans on a property near Nowra in New South Wales. The appellant was known as The Little Pebble. He claimed to communicate with and receive messages from the Virgin Mary. He prophesied the end of the world and a new era of paradise on earth for the community, and his teachings included that 12 queens would be chosen by the Virgin Mary to bear his children and 72 princesses would be chosen able to marry others but to bear his children if they wished. All would become the appellant’s wives and the child-bearing would provide the foundation for repopulation in the new era.  
     
      
    4 The complainant’s family moved to the community in 1991, when the complainant was aged 11 or 12. Her eldest sister B, to whom reference will later be made, had joined the community some months earlier. 
     
      
    5 The complainant remained a member of the community until 2002. It was not disputed that there came about a sexual relationship between her and the appellant, and in October 1999 she bore the appellant’s child. On the Crown case, the sexual relationship began in 1994 when the complainant was aged 14 years and had been chosen as a queen. The appellant was then aged about 45 years. The appellant did not give evidence, but from the cross examination of Crown witnesses and evidence called in the defence case it was his position that the sexual relationship began after the complainant had attained the age of 16 years.  
     
      
    6 There were three grounds of appeal, each directed to miscarriage of the trial rather than inadequacy of the Crown case.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The trial miscarried because counsel for the appellant failed to take any step to answer serious allegations of impropriety made against him in evidence by an important prosecution witness, Pamela Ross 
      . 
       
      
    7 Apart from evidence of the particular occasions of the act of indecency or the sexual intercourse the subject of the offences with which the appellant was charged, the complainant gave evidence of letters from the appellant and written replies through the appellant to questions addressed by her to Virgin Mary, in 1993 and the first half of 1994, suggesting and encouraging that she become a queen and have a physical relationship with the appellant. According to the complainant and other witnesses many of these documents had been destroyed, but some were available and were put before the jury. Some pages of a private diary kept by the complainant also remained and were put before the jury, and provided significant support for the complainant’s evidence of a sexual relationship. 
     
      
    8 The complainant’s evidence included that in 1998 the appellant told her and her mother to destroy letters received from the appellant, some in 1993 and 1994, explaining what being a queen meant and what it entailed for her (for example, she said that a letter stated “that I had to have sex with William in order to fulfil my mission to be a queen”). In cross-examination it was put to the complainant that this destruction had not occurred.  
     
      
    9 Late in the Crown case a former member of the community, Ms Pamela Ross, gave evidence that in the winter of 2003 she and a fellow member, Mrs Natalie Hepi, went to what was described as the appellant’s shed on the property and went through black plastic bags “looking for letters from William and alleged messages from Our Lady to [the complainant] and anything that would link [the complainant] to William in an intimate way”, which they burned. She said that while they were burning documents the appellant arrived and said, “I’m not here, I can’t be involved in this process”, and that he “just came to see if … you were successful in doing what I asked.”  
     
      
    10 Consistently with the challenge to the complainant’s evidence of destruction of documents, although different calendar times were involved, counsel for the appellant embarked on a challenge to this evidence. Part of the initial challenge was to contrast the witness’ occupation as a parole officer in Canada, prior to her joining the community, with alleged criminality in burning evidence at the direction of a person under a criminal charge. The witness replied that at the time she believed that she was protecting the appellant “in a spiritual sense”. It was squarely put to the witness that there was no destruction of documents.  
     
      
    11 Shortly thereafter counsel began what appears to have been intended as cross-examination to suggest that the witness’ evidence should not be accepted because she had earlier offered to assist the appellant’s defence, with the benefit of her Canadian experience, notwithstanding that according to her evidence she had participated in the destruction of potentially incriminating documents. Something like this had been foreshadowed in the opening question in cross-examination suggesting that the witness was “a clever deceiver”. 
     
      
    12 There came the evidence -  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And you were prepared to enter the witness box on Kamm’s behalf weren’t you to testify on his behalf? 
         
        A. That’s true. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. At a time before or after you destroyed the documents? 
         
        A. After. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you were pretending weren’t you to his legal representatives then that you were a person of good repute and character, able to give such evidence? 
         
        A. No I wasn’t pretending at all. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You would have gone into the witness box, not having told his legal representatives about the destruction of the documents --- 
         
        A. Is that entirely true. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. – to give evidence on his behalf, correct? 
         
        A. Is that entirely true. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You tell us? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You tell us then, what’s the truth of it? 
         
        A. That his legal representatives knew. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Who are you referring to specifically? 
         
        A. You Mr Stanton.” 
        
       
      
    13 In cross-examination continuing over a further four pages, counsel questioned the witness about failure earlier to claim that he knew about the destruction of documents. Eventually he put to her that she knew that if the appellant’s legal representatives knew that documents had been destroyed, they had become involved in a possible criminal offence. The witness did not agree. In the course of this questioning the witness gave answers to the effect that the appellant’s legal representatives knew about the destruction of documents because they knew “all the things that have gone on in Mr Kamm’s case” or “everything that was going on”.  
     
      
    14 I do not reproduce more of the cross-examination, which must be read as a whole. Anticipating what is to come, on reading it as a whole it is in my view clear that the witness and counsel were at cross purposes. After she left the community the witness had given a statement to the police, which had been served on the appellant’s legal representatives, in which she said there had been the destruction of documents. Counsel had in mind dissembling on the part of the witness at the time she was supportive of the appellant, but the witness had in mind the time when to her belief the account of the destruction of the documents in her statement was known to the appellant’s legal representatives. The first “Is that entirely true” was the witness’ response to a perceived assertion that the appellant’s legal representatives were unaware that she said that there had been the destruction of documents, something which the witness did not accept because her understanding that the appellant’s legal representatives knew all the things that had gone on in the appellant’s case meant that they knew that she had given that account.  
     
      
    15 There came a point when trial judge said that “we are just getting into an argument here”, and there was discussion in the absence of the jury and the witness. It is apparent that the appellant’s counsel considered that the witness’ evidence suggested that he had acted unethically. His explanation again revealed temporal confusion, namely that “[a] positive defence would continue and I would either lead evidence knowing it to be false that countered this proposition or ignored it in circumstances where the claimed ignorance of the matter would be a fraud.” Counsel was under a misapprehension, because the witness was not asserting knowledge of destruction of documents on his part outside the account in her statement. Consistently with the correct understanding that she was speaking of his knowledge after she had made her statement to the police, he could act upon instructions from the appellant that there had not been the destruction of documents. 
     
      
    16 Eventually the trial was adjourned, counsel correctly saying that he should not act in haste but should “look at the transcript”. He said that he would take the transcript to a member of the Ethics Committee and obtain a ruling.  
     
      
    17 On the next morning counsel for the appellant said no more than, “I am satisfied that my position is resolved and I am content to move on”. He asked one further question of the witness, simply putting to her that there had not been the destruction of documents. 
     
      
    18 The question of destruction of documents was taken up in the defence case, through evidence of the complainant’s mother denying that in company with the complainant she had destroyed letters received from the appellant or from the Virgin Mary, or diary pages or other documents. I refer again to this under ground 2. 
     
      
    19 Destruction of documents was touched on fairly lightly in addresses. The Crown Prosecutor said no more than that there was evidence from Ms Ross of destruction of documents in 2002 (sic) and that the complainant’s mother was involved in destruction of documents in 1998. Counsel for the appellant suggested that it was “laughable” that the complainant’s mother had destroyed documents when other evidence showed she had sent documents of the complainant to her at her request after she had left the community, and as to Ms Ross followed the theme of a clever deceiver - 
     
      
       
        
        “Pamela Ross – do you really accept Pamela Ross’s evidence, a woman driven, you might think, by revenge, by spite, vindictive – has sat on critical information for some years, a woman – the significance of her inaction, her deception in withholding that material from the authorities, you might think in her mind, was a little more significant than it might be in the ordinary individual because of her experience in Corrective Services in Canada and her work as a social worker in that country. Destroyed documents, read them, digested their content, and then destroyed them on behalf of Mr Kamm, to protect him, who just happens to come forward now because as a one-time member of the community, what? She wants to see justice done now that previously she was prepared to pervert, by the disclosure – I withdraw that – by the concealment of her actions, if she did it, she was at the one time in her life prepared to break the law.” 
        
       
      
    20 In the summing-up the trial judge referred to “the diaries and letters destruction evidence” as an illustration of what was not an element of the offences which the Crown had to prove, and later very briefly adverted to what had been said in the respective addresses. 
     
      
    21 The appellant submitted that the passage in the cross-examination which I have set out “cast an appalling shadow over the appellant’s own barrister”, and that things got worse to the point of being “irretrievably disastrous” with the reference to involvement in a possible criminal offence. He submitted that the witness pointedly accused counsel of complicity in an endeavour by the appellant to mislead the court about the destruction of documents, that counsel’s position had become compromised, and that there should have been an application to discharge the jury or, at the least, an application for directions entirely to disregard what the witness had said. Indeed, it was submitted, the suggestion that the appellant’s counsel was complicit in covering up destruction of documents was itself evidence of consciousness of guilt on the appellant’s part which should have been rebutted by evidence from counsel himself. Yet the trial continued without any further reference to counsel’s position, and the witness’ allegations levelled at counsel were left unanswered in a manner which diminished counsel’s standing in the eyes of the jury and caused substantial unfair prejudice to the appellant.  
     
      
    22 There is no doubt that counsel initially saw the evolution of the cross-examination as imputing misconduct on his part and, although it seems to have receded a little, on the part of his instructing solicitors. There was, with respect, a rather emotional reaction, rather than consideration of what the witness was really saying. As I have said, I consider that counsel and the witness were at cross-purposes, although counsel did not so see it at the time.  
     
      
    23 Cross-purposes occur in the course of trials, and as in ordinary life juries can see when it occurs. In my opinion, the jury is unlikely to have taken from what took place possible criminality on the part of the legal representatives or that their conduct told against the appellant. That appears to have been counsel’s conclusion, after reading the transcript and with the consideration which the adjournment allowed (and perhaps taking peer advice), since counsel let the matter rest. All concerned let it rest; destruction of documents was not prominent in the addresses or the summing-up, and there was no reference to the contretemps between counsel and the witness. 
     
      
    24 The appellant’s submissions came down to the submission that counsel’s conduct of the trial, in not applying for discharge of the jury or taking some other course with a view to negating possible prejudice to the appellant, gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    25 Criminal trials are adversary proceedings, in which ordinarily the parties are held to the way in which their counsel have presented the party’s case, and counsel has a wide discretion in the conduct of the case. As Gleeson CJ said in TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; (2002) 212 CLR 124 at [16]-[17], a rational tactical decision by counsel, even if later regretted, does not make a trial unfair or produce a miscarriage of justice. In the same case Hayne J, with whom Gummow J agreed, explained at [107]-[112] (in the context of failure to call character evidence) that the question was whether there could be a reasonable explanation for counsel taking the course he or she took. See also Ali v The Queen [2005] HCA 8; (2005) 214 ALR 1 and Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; (2006) 225 ALR 161; the principles are summarised by Hunt AJA, with the agreement of Simpson and Rothman JJ in Seymour v R [2006] NSWCCA 206; (2006) 162 A Crim R 576 at [19]-[23].  
     
      
    26 As I have said, it appears that counsel decided, with the benefit of the transcript and further consideration, to let the matter rest. Without entering into counsel’s thought processes, there could readily be a reasonable explanation for his not applying for a discharge of the jury or seeking otherwise to deal with what had passed between himself and the witness. Counsel giving evidence would of course mean replacement representation, with a considerable down-side for the appellant. Specific directions could high-light the evidence of destruction of documents to the appellant’s disadvantage. It can not be assumed that discharge of the jury, with a new trial then held, would be to the appellant’s advantage. There had been a misunderstanding, on a less emotional appraisal not truly bringing the suggestion of impropriety in the conduct of the appellant’s case by his legal representatives or likelihood of prejudice to the appellant. For all this Court knows, he had discussed what might be done with the appellant and received instructions to proceed as he did – there was no evidence before the Court seeking to explain counsel’s decision.  
     
      
    27 Counsel maintained the appellant’s position that there had not been destruction of documents, which while a relevant matter was not one central to the Crown case, and that matter was given in addresses such attention as it was thought it deserved without reference to any suggestion o impropriety in the conduct of the legal representatives. In the words of Gleeson CJ in TKWJ v Regina at [8], counsel made “the kind of tactical decision routinely made by trial counsel, by which their clients are bound”, being “the kind of decision that a Court of Criminal Appeal would ordinarily have neither the duty nor the capacity to go behind”.  
     
      
    28 I would not accept this ground of appeal.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The trial miscarried because the Crown Prosecutor asked questions in cross-examination of [the complainant’s mother] that were either irrelevant or lacked substantive probative value and which were, in any event, offensive such that they caused unfair prejudice to the appellant. 
       
      
    29 The complainant’s evidence in chief included that in 1993 she spoke to her mother about what she should do, and her mother told her that God knew best and just to do what God asked her to do. The complainant said that shortly after the occasion of the first sexual encounter in June 1994, when she was aged 14, she again spoke to her mother, who told her that “she should have sex with William Kamm because its God’s will”, and that on the next occasion in July 1994 she was picked up by the appellant from her mother’s house and her mother consented to her going to the hotel alone with the appellant. She said also as to the sexual encounters in January 1995, on her evidence at the appellant’s house, that her mother knew of them and said “that I should just do it because it’s God’s will”. 
     
      
    30 The complainant’s mother was called in the defence case. She was still a member of the community. She said that the complainant was a princess in 1994, but that her union with the appellant was “[i]n a spiritual way that was all”, and that the complainant did not become a queen (which meant “a physical way, meaning sexual intercourse, if the queen wished”) until much later. She denied that when the complainant was under the age of 16 she encouraged her to have a sexual relationship with the appellant or a physical intimate relationship falling short of sexual intercourse, or told the complainant that she must sleep with the appellant; indeed, she said that after the complainant was 16 she did not encourage the complainant to have a sexual relationship with the appellant. As I have noted, she also denied that in company with the complainant she had destroyed letters received from the appellant, or communications from the Virgin Mary or diary pages or other documents.  
     
      
    31 Whether the complainant’s mother encouraged a sexual relationship with the appellant in 1993-1995 was relevant to whether there was the sexual relationship. It had further relevance, because the complaint was cross-examined at some length about delay in disclosing the sexual conduct, it being put to her that she and her subsequent de facto husband fabricated the allegations of sexual conduct in order to extort money from the appellant. The complainant said that despite early misgivings she believed in the appellant and his teachings and came to want to have his children, and her mother’s encouragement through telling her to submit to God’s will and condoning the arrangements for her to be with the appellant was part of the explanation for the delay. 
     
      
    32 The appellant accepted that the Crown Prosecutor was entitled to cross-examine the complainant’s mother “vigorously” in relation to her credibility. He submitted, however, that in two respects the cross-examination lacked relevance, or if relevant did not have substantial probative value as required by s 103(1) of the Evidence Act 1995, and for other reasons should not have been permitted.  
     
      
    33 The first respect was in the Crown Prosecutor’s opening questions - 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Mrs [name of witness] when you entered the witness box you took an oath to tell the truth didn’t you? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I noticed when you took hold of the bible you held it far away from your body arm outstretched, does that have any particular significance in your religion? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. None at all? 
         
        A. No.” 
        
       
      
    34 The appellant submitted that this was irrelevant and offensive, with no basis other than a stereotype of how the bible should be held and suggestive that the bible was being held away from the witness so that she could lie on oath. He submitted that it should have been disallowed because irrelevant, or in conformity with the mandatory operation of s 275A of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 
     
      
    35 No objection was taken by the appellant’s counsel at the time. 
     
      
    36 I do not agree that the cross-examination was impermissible in this respect. We have only the question’s description of the manner in which the witness held the bible, but if it was an unusual manner it was open to the Crown Prosecutor, in a case in which religious beliefs played a relevant and prominent part, to make the enquiry, and an answer in the affirmative may have led on - “[s]ome of the most effective cross-examinations have begun by securing a witness’ assent to a proposition of seeming irrelevance” (Wakeley v The Queen [1990] HCA 23; (1990) 93 ALR 79 at 86).  
     
      
    37 The Crown referred to R v VN [2006] VSCA 111, in which the witness was directly cross-examined to suggest that he took an affirmation rather than an oath because he was telling lies, rather than (as he said) because a Baptist never swore on the bible. A complaint of miscarriage of justice which included that this was “unfair” was rejected, and it was said that the statutory availability of an affirmation did not preclude cross-examination to suggest that the witness was not giving truthful evidence (at [104]-[106]). In the present case the cross-examination did not get to that point, but the opening enquiry was open to the Crown Prosecutor. 
     
      
    38 The enquiry was not made offensively, nor as it was left was it suggestive of lying on oath, and when the enquiry was answered in the negative the cross-examiner moved on. The transcript shows that counsel for the appellant was diligent in taking objections, and absence of objection indicates that this questioning did not strike him as offensive. 
     
      
    39 The second respect was the continuation of the cross-examination -  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You knew .that when you and your family migrated from Germany to Australia that [the complainant’s eldest sister B] was going to be Mr Kamm’s wife is that correct? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You knew Mr Kamm was already married didn’t you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yeah he --- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The bible has something to say about that doesn’t it? 
        
       
       
        
        A. He was -- 
        
       
       
        
        STANTON: Well I object to that your Honour -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Hold on, don’t answer that please. Mr Stanton? 
        
       
       
        
        STANTON: It’s a misleading question your Honour, the bible has a lot to say about marriage and various Christians your Honour, there’s --- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well hold on let’s - no Mr Stanton I don’t need a religious lesson, I just want to know what’s wrong with the Crown’s question. 
        
       
       
        
        STANTON: It’s meaningless is the first issue. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well I can understand it. Go on. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Your daughter [B] entered into a sexual relationship with Mr Kamm when he was already married didn’t she? 
        
       
       
        
        A. He was separated at this time going for a divorce. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. He was still married to her though wasn’t he? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I’ll be more specific. The bible has something to say about adultery doesn’t it? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Didn’t you think that Mr Kamm was committing adultery with your daughter [B]? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No, no.” 
        
       
      
    40 The appellant submitted that the witness’ approval of B entering into a relationship with a married but separated man was irrelevant, or if relevant lacked substantial probative value and should have been disallowed pursuant to s 103(1) of the Evidence Act or should not have been admitted pursuant to s 137 (probative value outweighed by danger of unfair prejudice). The reliance on s 137 was not greatly elaborated. It was suggested that the witness’ religious belief whereby there could appropriately be a sexual relationship between B and the appellant did not bear on her credibility, and that there was prejudice in an unfair attack on her credibility because of her religious belief. 
     
      
    41 The submissions did not recognise or meet the point of these questions. The Crown Prosecutor went on to draw attention to a letter from the appellant to the complainant’s mother in which he said that “the law of God is suspended for me and my princesses into regard to formal marriage as he has done in regards to [the appellant’s former wife] and [B]”, and elicited from the witness her beliefs that the law of God is suspended for the appellant “because he is God and he can do what he wants” and that the appellant was above the law of man as well “because he makes the law”. The ensuing cross-examination brought out the witness’ beliefs that the appellant “through his mystical seed will re-populate the earth”, that in the new nation to be built the witness’ daughters were to be queens, that being a queen involved sexual intercourse in order to generate a new population, and eventually that the witness believed that “it was God’s will that the appellant have sex with [the complainant]”.  
     
      
    42 The witness did not agree that she knew that the appellant was having sex with the complainant, at least prior to the complainant being aged 18 years, or that she ever told the complainant that it was God’s will to have sex with the appellant; she said that she told the complainant only that “Heaven prefers this but it leaves you free”. It was suggested to the witness that in a statement given to the police she had said that the complainant was 16 when she was having sex with the appellant, to which she responded to the effect that she was confused at the time. There was further cross-examination to which reference need not be made, in the course of which it was put to the witness that her beliefs were so strong that she was prepared to lie in her evidence (with which she disagreed) and - 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Your truth is William Kamm’s truth, isn’t it? 
         
        A. No, it’s God’s truth. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And God and Mr Kamm are one? 
         
        A. As a prophet, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’re prepared to lie for him? 
         
        A. No.” 
        
       
      
    43 The objection taken by counsel at the time was not obviously on the ground of relevance or lack of probative value. Seen in the cross-examination as a whole, the questions concerning the witness’ view of the sexual relationship between B and the appellant were not gratuitous disparagement of the witness’ religious beliefs, but were an introduction to establishing the witness’ adherence to the appellant’s status as God’s prophet standing above the law of man, with whom it was God’s will that the complainant should have a sexual relationship in order to generate the new population. This commitment to the appellant and his teachings went strongly to the witness’ credibility in her denial of the complainant’s evidence of her mother’s responses and attitude in 1993-1995, and also to the witness’ credibility in denying any involvement in destruction of documents. 
     
      
    44 I would not uphold this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: The trial miscarried because the Crown Prosecutor asked questions in cross-examination of Candice Hepi that were either irrelevant or which lacked substantive [sic] probative value and which were, in any event, offensive and caused unfair prejudice to the appellant. 
       
      
    45 On the complainant’s evidence, the appellant took her to the Sovereign Inn Hotel at Fig Tree on the occasions in June-July 1994, and the act of indecency and the first acts of sexual intercourse took place at that hotel. The then manager and another member of the staff at the hotel gave evidence that the appellant regularly stayed at the hotel from at least 1994. From the cross-examination, on the appellant’s case he did not stay there prior to 1996.  
     
      
    46 The hotel records for 1994 were no longer available, but the recollection of the staff members was that the appellant usually paid by credit card. The Crown case did not include any records from credit card companies showing payments by the appellant by credit card, or any evidence that there were no longer such records; it was silent on that subject. 
     
      
    47 Ms Candace Hepi was called in the appellant’s case to give evidence of enquiries she made of credit card companies resulting in letters identifying a considerable number of credit cards in the appellant’s name and credit card statements for three credit cards for 1994. The letters and statements were tendered and admitted. The statements did not show payment to the hotel. Ms Hepi had been and at the time of the trial was still a member of the community. Mrs Natalie Hepi earlier mentioned is her mother.  
     
      
    48 Early in her evidence in chief Mrs Hepi was asked - 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Do you hold any particular position within that community? 
         
        A. I assist William Kamm in his business in his office. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Apart from that do you hold any religious positions in the community? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Were you ever one of Mr Kamm’s queens? 
         
        A. I don’t understand the question. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I’ll come back to that if needs be. … “ 
        
       
      
    49 The witness said that she had been “asked to undertake a certain functional role in respect of Mr Kamm’s credit cards over a period of time”, that she had had access to the appellant’s records, and that she had “provided as best [she could] work it out, find them, all of the records in relation to credit cards that were at the premises”. She then gave evidence of the enquiries she made of, and the documents received from, the credit card companies, and to some extent of other information she had been told orally by the credit card companies. 
     
      
    50 The cross-examination began - 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Ms Hepi, are you trying to hide something from this court? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’ve told us that you were Mr Kamm’s bookkeeper, is that correct? 
         
        A. Not – I didn’t say bookkeeper, I just assisted him with his business. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You were more than just an assistant to him in his business weren’t you? 
         
        A. Can you specify please. 
         
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well you were more than just an assistant to him in his business weren’t you? 
         
        A. Can you please specify what you mean by that? 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR:  
        
       
       
        
        Q. The Crown asks whether you had any other role in the community apart from simply assisting Mr Kamm? 
         
        A. I used to baby-sit his children. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’re the mother of his child aren’t you? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’re not the mother of his child? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You are his mystical spouse, correct? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. No? 
         
        A. No.” 
        
       
      
    51 The witness was asked to look at a letter dated 10 November 1997 in the appellant’s handwriting. Objection was taken, there was argument, and the trial judge ruled that the line of cross-examination should be allowed.  
     
      
    52 When the cross-examination continued the witness’ attention was drawn to the reference in the letter to her as Queen Candice. This brought her agreement that she occupied the position as queen and that she was the appellant’s mystical spouse, that it was not true that she was simply a business assistant, and that she had lived with the appellant for a period. It was put to her that she was “prepared to lie for him”, with which she disagreed.  
     
      
    53 The appellant submitted that the trial judge erred in ruling that the cross-examination in these respects had substantial probative value, and as well (although the objection taken was not on this basis) that the questioning should not have been permitted pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act. He submitted that the Crown could have had no real expectation that there were credit card records showing payment to the hotel in 1994 which the witness had not disclosed, and that there was unfair prejudice to the appellant in doing no more than create “a very dark cloud of suspicion” which well outweighed the probative value of the questions. 
     
      
    54 The appellant’s submissions on appeal accepted that Ms Hepi had not been able to account for all the credit cards held by the appellant at the relevant time, and that she “was not able to comprehensively disprove that the appellant used credit cards at the relevant hotel at the relevant time”. However, that was not particularly clear at the time. The evidence in chief left obscure the extent to which all credit cards in the name of the appellant in 1994 and following were within the enquiries made by Ms Hepi, and there was at least one positive assertion in her evidence that, from her search of the records, the appellant had and operated only one American Express card in 1994; further, the whole exercise was dependent on Ms Hepi’s evidence that the records underlying the enquires she made were the entirety of the records in relation to credit cards at the premises. There was room for questioning the completeness of the disclosure made by Ms Hepi of all credit card records found on search.  
     
      
    55 When the appellant’s counsel objected to the witness being taken to the letter of 10 November 1997 the trial judge observed that he had to be satisfied “that this has substantial probative value”. In the ensuing discussion in the absence of the jury and the witness, the Crown Prosecutor said that he wished to ask the witness if there were other documents available to her that she had not produced. After hearing submissions, the trial judge delivered a judgment in which he said that the Crown was entitled to cross-examine the witness in order to suggest “bias”, such as to make it more likely that the absence of records of credit card payments in 1994 was because records had not been produced and less likely that the explanation was that payments had not been made. His Honour expressed his satisfaction “in terms of s 103” that the cross-examination “in relation to suggestions of the witness’ bias, has substantial probative value”.  
     
      
    56 The references to bias could conjure up s 106(a) of the Evidence Act, which is concerned with evidence adduced otherwise than from the witness; from the transcript of the argument, the Crown Prosecutor referred to s 106(a) “if I’m required to tender this document [the letter of 10 November 1997]”. However, the trial judge expressly ruled under s 103, and appears to have had in mind knowingly or recklessly making a false representation in s 103(2)(a). The language does not mean conceptual error. 
     
      
    57 The Crown Prosecutor’s intention was carried out. The following cross-examination included putting to the witness that “if you saw records back at Cambewarra that had anything in them relating to the Figtree Motel [sic] you were not going to bring them to court were you”. The witness answered, “yes”, presumably meaning that she was going to bring them to court. In my opinion, the trial judge’s ruling under s 103(1) was correct. Assuming that the cross-examination was adduction of evidence by the prosecutor I can see no necessity for his Honour to have refused to admit the evidence pursuant to s 137 had it been relied on. Questioning the completeness of the disclosure made by Ms Hepi was legitimate and met the test of substantial probative value, and there was no outweighing danger of unfairness to the appellant; it was not a case of no more than a dark cloud of suspicion, nor (and the appellant did not so submit) given the other evidence would the jury be likely unfairly to think less of the appellant simply through it being shown that Ms Hepi was one of the queens and that she had lived with him for a period. 
     
      
    58 I would not uphold this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      The result 
       
      
    59 I propose that the appeal be dismissed.

    JUDGMENT1. Generalisations are of limited value. Nonetheless there is much truth in the proposition that young males aged between fifteen and twenty-five are in more danger from themselves and other young men than at any other time in their lives. That danger is enhanced when alcohol and/or drugs are present. Research shows that the executive functions of the brain of eighteen and twenty-five year old males are still developing. Although that evidence is not formally before me, it is well known in the community. Consequently, alcohol, drugs and passion impair the judgment of young men to a greater degree than the same ingredients are likely to do with more mature males. 2. In this case, two young men, one a victim the other an offender, illustrate the reality of that generalisation. The victim, Matthew Reynolds, had left the relative security of a party to pursue a number of uninvited party intruders, he says, to inquire if any of them were responsible for hitting him with a beer bottle. The accused, initially as part of a group and then subsequently on his own, assaulted Reynolds in circumstances that I will return to. As a consequence of the assault Reynolds ended up in hospital with an horrendous wound to his back, and other injuries requiring treatment. As a consequence of his criminal conduct, the offender has ended up in prison. Neither young man is a winner. Both will carry the scars of the dangers each faced for the rest of his life. One because he was a victim, and the other because he was the perpetrator.3. Alborz Khosravi is to be held accountable for his criminal acts on 16 September 2006. He formally indicated his willingness to be held accountable on 17 January 2008 when he pleaded guilty to the following charges: (a) that he maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm with intent to do so; (b) affray; and thirdly hindering the investigation of a serious indictable offence by knowingly giving false information to the police. In respect of the third matter I was satisfied, notwithstanding his plea, there was no evidence to support it. Consequently the Crown sought leave to indict the accused in respect of the third matter by changing the nature of the charge, although relying still upon the same section. This morning Mr Khosravi pleaded guilty to requesting his co-offenders to provide false information to the police with intent thereby to hinder the investigation of the serious indictable offence of the robbery by KJ (a juvenile) committed on Matthew Reynolds.4. As sentencing judge it falls to me to determine the appropriate sentencing disposition for the criminality exhibited on this night. That sentencing disposition depends upon a number of factors. Firstly, the facts of the offence; secondly, the objective seriousness of the offence as revealed by those facts; and thirdly, the subjective features of the offender or the personal background history of the offender, because not only am I sentencing for the offence, but I am sentencing this offender for them.The facts5. I have sentenced three co-offenders involved in the affray and the charge of intending to hinder the police in their investigation. The parties to that sentence had tendered by consent the same agreed facts. Nothing else has been tendered in the Crown case or indeed in the defence case that would cause me to change the findings I made in respect of those offences. I intend to make the same findings, save for one finding, which I will omit.6. While it may have been appropriate to find in the co-offenders’ cases that this offender probably took a leadership role in the affray, in his own case, given the evidence, I cannot make that finding beyond reasonable doubt. It is a matter that the Crown would need to prove beyond reasonable doubt because it would be an aggravating feature.7. I repeat here the relevant findings of fact I made on 28 March when sentencing the co-offenders. I have also interpolated additional findings of fact relevant to this offender.8. Adam Hickey hosted a party for many of his acquaintances at 135 Pennant Hills Road, Carlingford. There was no parental supervision. One of his guests present, and as I understand it invited, was Matthew Reynolds. In the course of the night there was an invasion of fifteen to twenty unwanted males, including the three co-offenders and this offender. What was an ill-advised situation turned into a display of significant criminal conduct by them.9. Once the group of invaders had arrived at the party some time between 9.30pm and 10.30pm, Khosravi became involved in a physical fight with a member of the party. That fight evolved into a significant brawl with as many as thirty to forty people caught up in it. There were punches, kicks, bottles being smashed, chairs being thrown. During that time Reynolds was struck to the front of his head with a beer bottle causing a cut to him. Another young person, MJ, was also struck by a flying bottle. This brawl lasted for several minutes. 10. In the course of the fracas Khosravi’s girlfriend, also an uninvited guest, was struck on her head by a thrown beer bottle. There is no evidence to suggest that Matthew Reynolds or anyone associated with him played any part in the dispatch of the beer bottle that struck Khosravi’s girlfriend. Nor is there any evidence confining Khosravi’s participation in the fracas at 135 Pennant Hills Road to any response of his girlfriend being struck by that bottle. He does say, and I accept, that he resented the fact that his girlfriend had been struck. The role Khosravi played in the brawl at the premises, other than the initial physical fight, is not disclosed. In particular it is not disclosed who was responsible for Reynolds being struck to the front of his head with a beer bottle.11. Shortly after the fight at the premises each of the offenders and others left. They headed towards where their cars were parked. Meanwhile Reynolds and two others, both males, chased after the group. Reynolds, as I said, was concerned with who had hit him with the beer bottle. As he came around the corner from Pennant Hills Road into Bettington Road where some of the cars were parked, he was attacked by six or seven males. They included the four offenders who have now been before me, and two others.12. The offenders Begini and Zulfiquar were present, ready and willing to assist if required. Reynolds was punched and kicked to the ground. When on the ground he continued to receive punches and kicks over his body. That attack lasted for several minutes. The agreed facts establish it as being a savage attack. Khosravi was involved in that attack. At the conclusion of the attack, one KJ, a juvenile, removed Reynolds’ wallet from his pants pockets. That was never part of any common purpose that the other offenders had with Reynolds. Once the attack had finished, the three co-offenders walked away from the victim, now lying face down and motionless on the ground. The affray was over at that point. That affray of course is the affray to which Mr Khosravi has pleaded guilty.13. Khosravi grabbed a smashed beer bottle lying on the ground. He moved to where Reynolds was lying, lifted the man’s shirt and drew the broken beer bottle across his victim’s back, commencing at a point where the neck meets the shoulder. The bottle entered to the left of the spine about three centimetres from where the neck joins the shoulder. It was drawn down past the shoulder blade, past the ribcage to a point level with the waist. The path travelled by the penetrating broken bottle was about forty centimetres in length. It was shaped like the letter J with an extended stem. The path runs between the spine and clavicle, extending well below the clavicle, tapering towards the left waist.14. The agreed facts describe the cutting action as requiring a great deal of force. Frankly I have difficulty accepting that description. It conjures a picture of an offender straining with the bottle against the skin and flesh. The offender told police, “It wasn’t my intention for it to be anywhere near that big”. At question 126 in an interview conducted between him and the investigating police, he was asked, “Did you use a lot of force?” He replied, “I honestly didn’t think I did, but obviously I did.” With respect to those investigating the offender, such a conclusion is not obvious. It would depend upon the sharpness of the edge of the glass portion pressed against the skin and the structure and material being severed. The words of the offender, “obviously I did”, constitute a conclusion based upon his seeing the photograph of the wound. The words “obviously I did” do not reflect any evidence of his recollection of what he actually did. A conclusion as to the force required is really a matter of expert evidence based upon the sharpness of the instrument and a knowledge of the path of the wound, organs, muscle and tissue severed, and depth of penetration.15. Two photographs of the forty-centimetre wound have been tendered. One of those photographs shows the wound after suturing. The other shows the wound as it presented gaping open during treatment. In the absence of expert evidence I am unable to tell from the photograph the level of penetration of the cutting instrument or the nature of the biological material severed by the cutting edge. I am satisfied that the cutting edge penetrated all layers of the skin and some level of flesh below the skin. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the cutting edge penetrated at least one and a half to two centimetres in depth in some places. At that level, significant and persistent force must have been required to draw the shattered bottle through the victim’s back. “Significant and persistent” force differs from “great” force. I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the force used was great. As I say, more than “persistent and significant” force being used, I cannot say.16. The photograph showing the gaping wound makes clear the open wound exposed a number of deep-seated inner organs and tissue. Clearly this wound constitutes a really serious injury. I am not satisfied the wound gaped open as it was being made. My sense is the offender was genuinely surprised and confronted when he saw the photograph of the gaping wound. I am satisfied his surprise was because when he left the lips of the wound had not opened or had not opened to the extent as shown in the picture. Reynolds was lying on his stomach when the wound was made and when the offender left. It is likely the forces of gravity or of his own locomotion had not revealed when the offender left the real devastation to the victim’s body Khosravi’s criminal conduct had caused.17. Khosravi told police he did not intend the wound to be as extensive as it was. I accept the grievous bodily harm intended was grievous bodily harm inflicted with a broken beer bottle as a result of drawing it across the back of his victim at a depth to which the sharp edged shard of the bottle reached for a distance of about forty centimetres. The unintended consequence was that gravity and motion of the body would open the wound revealing the true content of the peril in which the body had been placed. To state the obvious, to create a forty-centimetre laceration of the depth penetrated with a sharp edge shard, exhibits much greater criminality than to stab a victim once to the same depth. 18. There are other wound sites on Reynolds’ back. There is also a wound behind Reynolds’ left ear. The agreed statement describes the two other wound sites as “stab” wound to the lower thoracic/lumbar area. The agreed facts do not attribute those stab wounds to anybody. Nor have I been asked by the Crown to infer they were made by this offender. The settling of agreed facts is an art form undertaken by the parties, each with its own agenda. Given those same facts were used by three other co-offenders, it would be dangerous for me to seek to conclude these latter injuries were made by the accused. Had they been, the level of criminality would have been well above the level it must be at when he accepts responsibility for the forty-centimetre wound.19. Khosravi says he was well affected by alcohol. He had consumed one-third of a bottle of Jim Beam bourbon and two longnecks of beer. At the time of his offending he weighed sixty-three kilograms. He claims he was addicted to the drug ice and had used a gram of ice the previous night and had not slept for about twenty-four hours. He had not used ice on the day of the offence. 20. On the evidence before me, the two stab wounds to the back must remain unexplained. The injury to the area of the left forehead and left ear are likely to have occurred either in the affray or as a consequence of Reynolds being hit at the party. Some people from the party came to Reynolds’ aid and ultimately an ambulance attended. He was admitted into the emergency department of Westmead Hospital where his injuries were dealt with. Investigations continued and Reynolds disclosed the loss of his wallet and $150 in cash. As a consequence the telephone intercept was placed on Khosravi’s mobile telephones. 21. The facts that I have just described describe the main charge in the indictment. The conversation on 17 October between Khosravi and the juvenile KJ was intercepted. KJ told Khosravi police were wanting to speak to him, meaning, as I understand it, KJ himself. Khosravi then advised KJ what to tell the police and advised him in these terms: 
     
      
      “Khosravi: Tell them you were at the party. 
       
       
      KJ: Yeah. 
       
       
      Khosravi: Tell them that guy started. Tell them he threw the first punch. Tell them the truth of the party, what happened at the party, but tell them the end, how we got in the car and we left, when we left afterwards we heard what had happened but we don’t know who done it.  
       
       
      KJ: All right. So I say everyone left the party. 
       
       
      Khosravi: Say we did. You left in my car, me, you, Drawl, and Dilla.” 
       
      
    For my part Drawl and Dilla remain unidentified. They are clearly nicknames. Continuing the conversation: 
     
      
      “KJ: Yeah, and Megan. 
       
       
      Khosravi: Me, you, Drawl, Dilla and Megan jumped in my car, okay? We left. Then we heard that everyone else was going to a pub but we don’t know who else, who else is there. 
       
       
      KJ: All right, no worries. And do you reckon I should call everyone up and warn them and shit? 
       
       
      Khosravi: Yeah, yeah.” 
       
      
    That is the conversation, which is reflected in the charge, which is laid in the indictment. On close analysis it will be seen that in that conversation the account that Khosravi invites KJ to give is one that effectively exonerates him from the robbery of Reynolds.22. I am satisfied that Khosravi knew that KJ had taken the wallet. During the car trip back, KJ handed the wallet taken from Reynolds to various other people in the car, including Mr Khosravi. This offender disclosed having stabbed the victim. Later another co-offender, Ameli, was given access to the wallet. The use of the word “stabbed” is not clearly established as coming from Khosravi, but rather from the agreed facts. The wound that I am looking at is far more than a stabbing.23. Each offender later met at McDonald’s Castle Hill. At this location KJ discussed how he had “jacked” the guy’s wallet. This offender described how he “stabbed the guy in the back”. When asked why, this offender said because he “wanted to fight and wanted to have a go”. I am satisfied the words “wanted to fight” and “wanted to have a go” are references to Reynolds chasing after the uninvited intruders and not to anything Reynolds did during the affray. I note here that my earlier comment about the word “stabbed” not being necessarily from Khosravi is clearly in error.24. In the absence of informed analysis of that criminal behaviour, no doubt all of the males present believed they were in mighty serious trouble arising from all three of these events. Khosravi and KJ decided to give a version of events that would, if accepted by the police, see each of them exonerated of any criminal activity. Those guilty of crime have been doing that for centuries. Police had put a tap on Khosravi’s mobile, conversations between Khosravi and KJ were taped. Others of the co-offenders agreed to be parties to their intended deception, which, as events turned out, did not hinder any investigation of Khosravi and KJ’s additional offences.25. The following afternoon a group including four co-accused were out the front of Castle Towers. Khosravi, when asked what to do when police contacted them, said “They won’t, but if they do tell them we were at the party, we didn’t see any fights and we went home.” On the agreed facts, Khosravi is the author of the false account. He was also the person who conceived the plan. It was his intention in so doing to avoid his own responsibility for the criminal conduct, the collateral intent was one of protecting KJ. There is no suggestion any of the co-offenders was unwilling to participate in the planned deception. Their own self-interests would be served by advancing the common story. There is an additional significance to this evidence apart from the indicted offence, that is, it goes to the question of the accused’s willingness at that time to accept responsibility for his criminality. It also bears on the question of his contrition at that time for the injuries he then believed he had inflicted on Reynolds. Objective Criminality 26. I turn now to the objective criminality. From the facts as he finds them to be, the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offences as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of the offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in each of the instant offences, that is, the offences before me, with the criminality of offences of a similar kind that have been dealt with by this Court in the past. It is in this way that objective criminality or seriousness of these offences can be evaluated. It would not surprise anyone that the objective criminality has a very significant impact on the overall sentencing outcome. 27. Two of these offences focus upon the circumstances of criminal assault upon Reynolds. In a free society such as ours where citizen’s rights are respected, the law regards as criminal any conduct, which interferes with a person’s right to and integrity of his person, body and health. The measure of criminality arising from the affray focuses upon the level of unlawful violence used by offenders and the scale of the affray itself. The unlawful violence must reach a level of disinhibited violence such that a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene, but not necessarily involved in the altercation, would fear for his or her personal safety. The more disinhibited and widespread the violence within the affray, the more serious the criminality and, of course, the greater the risk that others would be swept up in it. The offender must intend to use or threaten violence or be aware that his conduct may constitute or threaten violence, not just to the person he with others is administering violence to, but to other persons present of reasonable firmness not necessarily involved. 28. The scale of the affray can also be measured both by its duration, that is, whether it was of short duration or longer, and by the number of persons participating in it. An affray involving two or three people is obviously, all things being equal, less serious than an affray involving up to a dozen. 29. The plea to affray was entered upon the basis the criminality related to events occurring after all offenders had left the party but before the co-offenders had left the area of Reynolds and arrived at their vehicles. Specifically, the affray focuses upon the time at which Matthew Reynolds was attacked by the group of males, including the offender at the corner of Pennant Hills and Bettington Roads. The agreed facts put the number involved as four to seven but given that the agreed facts nominates six, I could be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that six people were involved in the affray. Its duration seems to me to be measured in minutes and probably less than two or three. Begini and Zulfiquar were ready and willing to assist in the assault upon Reynolds, they were part of the group but did not take part physically. Thus the actual assault upon Reynolds may have involved up to four persons, including the offender. There appears no dispute that the level of violence, given the circumstances in which it was administered, was a level to cause a bystander of reasonable firmness to fear for his safety. 30. In assessing the criminality, it is important to note the unlawful violence did not spread beyond its intended victim. This offence was not planned, indeed all offenders had left the party with the intention of leaving the area. The attack was impulsive and opportunistic. There were no weapons used as any part of the unlawful violence. Several of the participants were juveniles. Affrays frequently constitute numbers greater than six, all of whom are adult males. That affray with up to twelve, all constituting adults males, would seem to me, all other things being equal, to be an affray causing greater fear or more readily causing the fear in the reasonable bystander than an affray of juveniles; some may differ in that view. 31. In terms of seriousness, this affray falls towards the lower range of criminality as envisaged by the section. I have accepted that there may have been some wounding during the affray but am unable to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the nature of the wounds, or, as I say, as to the extent of the wounds caused.32. The criminality associated with hindering of police is an offence relating to the proper administration of criminal justice. It is not an offence against the courts per se but rather impeding the proper investigation of serious crime. In this case the investigation intended to be hindered was the investigation of an offence committed towards the conclusion of the affray, an offence committed by a juvenile of aggravated robbery.33. Far and away the most serious offence is the infliction of grievous bodily harm with intent to do so. The criminality of that offence must be evaluated against the background that it constitutes a continuation of aggression and assaulting of Reynolds over and above that which constituted the affray. The transition from the affray offence to the greater offence was seamless. The significance of the continuation is that the violence exhibited in the affray was insufficient to quell the offender’s malice towards Reynolds, nor was a single stabbing sufficient to extinguish his malice towards Reynolds. The criminal malice was only satisfied by the making of a forty centimetre monumental laceration that in parts must have been at least one and a half to two centimetres in depth. Although not intended to be, the injury was of such magnitude as to be life threatening. An open wound with the lips of the wound stretching nearly forty centimetres exposed numerous organs and tissues to real risk of further damage and injury. The wound required emergency and hospital treatment. As to the sequela of the wound there is little evidence before me. It presents in one of the photographs as having been sutured, little else is known. However, I am satisfied there must have been post-traumatic sequela and further treatment including removal of sutures. In all likelihood there would have been psychological impact, including anger, resentment and brooding. There appears to be substantial disfiguring to the back. Is offence within the mid range of seriousness34. Assessment of the objective seriousness of the s 33 offence, that is, the wound with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent is an offence that may attract a standard non-parole period of seven years if the offence is one falling within the mid range of seriousness and having no mitigating features captured in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Little is revealed about Matthew Reynolds in the agreed facts. He is somewhere between eighteen and twenty-one years. His photograph suggests he is closer to twenty-one than eighteen. He appears to be a well-developed young man. He arrived at the crime scene with two other males. At that point he was not a vulnerable victim. However, he was punched and kicked to the ground and whilst on the ground he was further punched and kicked for several minutes. What happened to the other two males is unclear. When the co-offenders left he was lying on the ground. He had not apparently resisted when robbed of his wallet. The agreed facts state that the offender, having armed himself with a smashed beer bottle, then moved to where the victim was lying and he lifted the victim’s shirt before attacking him with the broken bottle. The agreed facts state that the offender then dragged the bottle, the broken bottle, down the victim’s back. There is nothing in the path of the wound made by the broken bottle consistent with any movement such as a defensive movement by Reynolds.35. I am satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt Reynolds was either unconscious, dazed or groggy from the earlier assault and perhaps affected by alcohol when attacked by this offender. That is to say, when attacked by this offender, the victim was at his most vulnerable and unable to resist or escape his attacker. While the level of violence exhibited towards Reynolds may not qualify as extreme, it was of a very high order. I have described it as taking longer than a stab wound but the violence was not prolonged beyond the time taken to make the actual wound. That wound constitutes a serious mutilation of Reynolds’ body but again the mutilation was not prolonged, nor more extensive than the forty centimetre gouging wound. 36. I have referred to the continuation of criminal malice demonstrated by the offender. The Crown submitted a conclusion was open that the initial hurt to the victim in the affray was not enough for the offender so he “went on with it” after the others had left. That submission appears well-founded. The use of the broken beer bottle as a cutting instrument aggravates the level of criminality, only one has to consider the dimensions of the wound to understand the real danger to a victim increased once the offender armed himself with the broken beer bottle. There is no suggestion the offender went to the party armed or that he deliberately broke the bottle to make a weapon. 37. An attempt to inflict a grievous bodily harm is an element of this offence and cannot constitute an aggravating feature. The accused’s acts were intentional, that is to say, he intended to cause the grievous bodily harm by drawing the broken beer bottle through the path it took across the victim’s back. The consequential injuries sustained by the victim is the actual consequence of his act which, for reasons I earlier gave, was not entirely intended by the offender. Nonetheless, the actual consequence of an offence is a matter that may aggravate criminality, R v Buttsworth [1983] 1 NSWLR 658. In this case the infliction of grievous bodily harm is an element of the offence. This injury is certainly above the entry point into the range of grievous bodily harm. It was life-threatening, serious, requiring treatment and some level of hospitalisation. It produced permanent and substantial scarring. However there is no evidence suggesting other permanent impairment or handicapping. The time at which the measure of grievous bodily harm is to be made is the time at which the offence was committed. At that time this wound fell within the mid range of seriousness of injuries that would constitute grievous bodily harm. 38. The accused claims in evidence and in discussions with police, Probation and Parole and the psychologist his motivation to do what and his decisions to pursue that motivation came in circumstances where he was very drunk. In his letter to me he wrote that at the time he was paranoid as a consequence of drug use and he would be more unstable on nights he did not use drugs. The night of the offence was such a night. The accused’s evidence is that his consumption of alcohol and his unstable state, because of his use of drugs the day before, affected his judgment at the time of his offending. I accept that his judgment was affected, that he was less inhibited than he otherwise might have been in circumstances where his abuse of ice predisposed him to aggression. 39. Of course, as I said to the offender when he gave evidence, his past experience with drugs and alcohol had given him an insight into their effect upon his judgment. The offender’s case is that he was angry because his girlfriend had been struck by a flying bottle. As I earlier remarked, there is nothing in the evidence suggesting Reynolds was responsible for this incident. I do not regard this incident as amounting to any form of provocation in his attack upon Reynolds. The relevance of his girlfriend being struck is that it was an incident, which amounted to another factor in predisposing him to aggression. 40. The offender’s claimed motivation was earlier referred to but the agreed facts have the offender meeting with others at Castle Hill. The reason he then gave for “stabbing” Reynolds in the back was “because he caused the fight [at the party] and wanted to have a go [at the corner of Bettington and Pennant Hills Road]”. There is no attempt by the defence to prove either proposition emerging from his stated reason for his malice in the agreed facts. That is to say, there is no attempt by the defence to prove that Reynolds caused the fight at the party, nor to prove that Reynolds wanted to have a go at the corner. Certainly by the time the bottle was picked up Reynolds was not having a go. Thus there is no basis for the court to make any finding that the offender had any factual basis to believe either of the propositions he told to the others at Castle Hill. Even if one or both were true, neither of them nor the combination of them could begin to justify any response at all from this offender, let alone the response he gave. 41. This was not a planned event, indeed, Khosravi and others had left the party, as I earlier said, with a view to leaving the area. They were pursued by Reynolds and the others. I have already found the affray was opportunistic. This offence is equally opportunistic. This offender’s decision to attack Reynolds as he lay on the ground could only have been made as his co-offenders were departing the scene after he had noticed the broken beer bottle.42. On 20 April 2005 the offender was given five s 9 good behaviour bonds. Each was conditioned that he would be of good behaviour for a period of two years. The breach of those bonds fifteen months after each was given constitutes a feature of aggravation of the objective criminality. The basis of that aggravation is that the additional crime was done in defiance of court order requiring the offender to be of good behaviour for a determined period. One of the offences for which a bond was given was an affray. While there may be a particular poignancy in such a situation, even though the facts of the earlier case may have some similarity with the existing case, the basis of the aggravation is the breach of the bond. The level of aggravation is the greater because a bond was given for similar offending. The aggravation has its source in the defiance of the court’s earlier order. Repetition of offending conduct and haunting similarity of offending conduct are marks to be taken into account when assessing rehabilitation prospects. 43. Taking all of these factors into account, I place the grievous bodily harm offence within the mid range of seriousness for offences of this kind. Further, given the dimensions of the wound, the ferocity of the attack and the ongoing malice that drove it, I would place this offence within the upper segment of that mid range. Subjective Matters44. I turn now to the subjective factors. I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence but I am also sentencing this offender for it. Each offender coming before the Court varies from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to an offender may offer to the court some explanation, or insight into the commission of these offences by this offender, or some reason why a more or less sentencing outcome is appropriate.45. Alborz Khosravi is a single man aged twenty-two who arrived in Australia twelve years ago. His family, members of the Baha’i religion, initially fled Iran to Pakistan to escape persecution. From there they migrated to Australia, settling in Parramatta. There are two sisters. Khosravi regards himself as close to his mother, but in the past there have been tensions between him and his father. Indeed at eighteen he left home for a year and at the time of these offences he had returned home. 46. His father is a problem gambler, although that situation is currently in remission. However in the past when the father lost at gambling, he would on occasions take out his anger and frustration on his wife and on the offender. Since the offender’s incarceration, the family have been supportive of him. Both sisters are adults. Each gave evidence in support of the offender, saying that they have noticed changes since his incarceration, particularly in his willingness to communicate to other family members. By contrast, at the time of the offending, the accused’s focus was outside the family, and such communication as occurred was sullen and frequently angry.Education Skills and Employment47. The offender entered the New South Wales schools system at the age of ten. He had difficulty settling. Language presented as a major barrier for him. He claims to have been picked on by other children during his school years. He completed year eleven and then left school. He has worked on and off as a painter. Whilst in custody he has completed courses in computers, literacy, communication skills and hepatitis C and HIV awareness. Seven certificates of attainment in respect of courses were tendered.48. His uncle, Sam Bagheri, gave evidence that the offender has worked casually for him during 2004/2005. There is an offer of employment from Bagheri to Mr Khosravi. Khosravi’s main interest is in real estate, but he plans initially upon release to work for his uncle. The evidence leaves me with the impression that even through his period of drug addiction, Khosravi was able to continue working, funding his drug purchases from his wages.Health49. Alborz Khosravi presents in court as a neatly groomed twenty two year old. He wrote that when he entered prison he weighed sixty-three kilos. Currently his weight is seventy-seven kilos. He told Mr W John Taylor, psychologist retained by the defence, that his physical health had been quite good. There is nothing in his presentation that suggests any physical health problem that should impede his rehabilitation.Mental Health Issues50. Mr Taylor reports that the offender has low self esteem, has difficulty expressing his feelings to others and is inclined to keep others at an emotional distance, rather than risk disapproval or rejection. He has real problems with anger and anger management. Mr Taylor’s opinion is that much of the anger is directed towards himself. On this occasion, his anger appears directed towards the hapless victim. He thinks his anger, that is, his anger generally, may have originated because of his father’s abusiveness. While understanding the origins and causes of his anger is useful, it is important he owns the problem. If he is not prepared to own the problem, to own the anger, he will be unable to deal with it. He links his anger to abuse of drugs and alcohol. Again, that is a form of transference. Most people using drugs and alcohol, even to the extent he did, do not behave in anger with the intensity when they become as disinhibited as he displayed on this night. There has been some counselling sought in prison, principally in relation to drugs and alcohol. There has been no specific treatment focused on anger or anger management.Drug and Alcohol Abuse51. Khosravi told Probation and Parole he commenced drinking alcohol when aged seventeen or eighteen. He also began ecstasy use at the same time. By nineteen he was using ice, smoking a gram at a time. There is also a history of cannabis use but the offender claims this is minimal. I have earlier referred to his weight loss at the time of incarceration. The offence I am dealing with occurred when he was twenty; that is, after about two years of drug and alcohol abuse. 52. In his letter to me he speaks of “how dangerous my life had become and the mental state I had got myself into”. In the highly structured prison environment, he claims to have abstained from drugs completely. Indeed, he says he has also stopped smoking cigarettes.53. It is a feature of youth and particularly among males that many engage in risk taking behaviour. The initial use of alcohol and drugs is often associated with risk taking. Some of the executive functions of the brain, including judgment, are in young males still in the process of developing. The offender’s risk taking was also a feature of his conduct after he had consumed drugs and alcohol (see Taylor’s report). His unauthorised arrival at the party is an example of this. Character and Criminal History54. Khosravi is a young twenty year old man. He appeared to have a good work ethic. His family is strongly supportive of him. His sisters speak of him being a loving and caring person until his late teen years. They have noted in more recent times some return to these values by him. Having been shown pictures of the massive injury he inflicted upon Reynolds, he was man enough to accept that “if he did the crime he should pay the time”. Since that time he has been courageous, mature and socially responsible by continuing to accept full accountability for his conduct without flinching.55. Since September 2004 he has been in trouble with the law. Many of his encounters with authorities are in respect of driving matters. There are other matters that have seen him before the courts, including offensive language, possess car breaking implements, larceny, the affray earlier referred to, failing to appear. As best I can tell, he has been before the Local Court on eight discrete occasions in respect of new charges since 2004. But for these matters before me, all his criminal offending has been dealt with in the Local Court.Attitude to the Offence56. I have already noted the offender’s acceptance of responsibility for the offence since the date of his arrest. He told Probation and Parole he felt ashamed and like a coward. He told Mr Taylor that he regretted his offending behaviour, that he was disgusted with himself. He acknowledged the offence “was my own action, it was all my choices”. He told police in his interview, “I realise how much pain I caused someone...how many problems they went through after...”57. In evidence the offender said, “I feel sorry for Mr Reynolds. I feel sorry for his family. I feel sorry for my family, all the pain I have put them through.” There is abundant evidence of genuine and insightful contrition. That contrition is reinforced by the early plea of guilty before the Local Court, including I note a plea of guilty to an offence that couldn’t be made out by the Crown. Taking both contrition and early plea into account, I am giving a twenty- five per cent discount for the sentence I otherwise would have given. 58. Discounts of that nature are allowed because the administration of criminal justice is served by guilty persons acknowledging their guilt. These guilty pleas must be recognised as a significant contribution by this offender to advancing the administration of criminal justice in this case - first and foremost because the interests of the administration of criminal justice are served through public acknowledgment by offenders of guilt. Pleas of guilty by offenders sustain the community’s confidence in the administration of criminal justice by maintaining the confidence of the community in the investigation of crime by police, and the community’s expectation that those guilty of crime will be held accountable for it.59. The administration of criminal justice is also served because court time, witnesses time, legal expenses and the like are freed so that they can be devoted to other cases. These pleas reduce considerably the likelihood of any contest, should there be an appeal, on the issue of guilt. These are all important utilitarian factors insofar as the administration of criminal justice is concerned.Rehabilitation Prospects60. There are a number of positive rehabilitation indicators: 
     
      
      Positive progress made whilst in custody on a number of fronts - alcohol and drug conduct and employment skills 
      The offender has strong family support 
      The offender is developing positive post-release plans that include returning to family and obtaining employment 
      Good physical health 
      Sincere and appropriate contrition and insight into offending 
      
    There are negative factors that should not be overlooked: 
     
      
      An absence of significant anger management counselling in the face of real anger management issues 
      No recent history in the community of managing without drugs or alcohol. 
      
    The current structure setting for testing his capacity to remain drug and alcohol free is grossly artificial 
     
      
      Measures of low self esteem as late as June 2008 with above average predisposition to abuse and dependence upon alcohol and illegal drugs 
      Some antisocial characteristics present as late as June 2008, including impulsivity and risk taking behaviour 
      A past history of a willingness to “go on with it” associated with physical violence. 
      
    61. The offender presented as a person shocked by the extent of his criminal conduct and determined to avoid trouble in future. On balance I am optimistic but cautiously so. However, his chances will depend upon the resources available to him upon release. In the early stages of his parole he should be monitored closely, including random urine tests in respect of drugs and alcohol. He will need ongoing support through counselling in anger management and drug and alcohol issues. He may need the assistance of a personal support program through an employment agency to assist him in training and job opportunities, directed towards real estate.Setting the Sentence62. This is an offence in which general deterrence has a role to play. This offender falls into a substantial group of young adult males, who in the course of abuse of alcohol and drugs commit crimes of great unbridled personal violence. In modern Australian society there is a very extensive raft of criminal laws passed by both the Federal and State parliaments. The chief purpose of the criminal law put in place by parliaments is to deter those who are tempted to breach the provisions of the criminal law. Parliament does that by prescribing maximum penalties for those engaged in conduct prohibited by the criminal law. 63. The maximum penalties for the offence that I am dealing with, for example, the infliction of grievous bodily harm with intent, carries twenty-five years as a maximum, and a standard non-parole period of seven years. The affray carries a maximum of ten years. The hinder police investigation carries a maximum of seven years. Consequently, when a person is sentenced for a breach of the criminal law, he is exposed to possibly the maximum penalty provided by the statute breached. Sentencing for breaches of the criminal law requires the sentencing judge to keep in mind those general deterrence aims of the criminal law for the community at large by keeping in mind those maximum penalties available and their deterrent purpose.64. There is also a specific deterrence aimed at individuals like minded to the offender who but for such deterrence would be willing to commit crimes similar to those for which this offender is being sentenced. Finally, there is a component of deterrence to be considered personal to the offender with a view to deterring him from reoffending. I am satisfied in this case that the offender’s need for personal deterrence is well met by both his arrest, his charging, time before the courts, including the Local Court, as well as this, the denunciation of his conduct by a judge of this Court, and the ultimate time he has already spent, and will spend, in custody.Is the standard non-parole period to apply?65. There is now a jurisprudence built upon The Queen v Way(2004) 60 NSWLR 168 that touches the interpretation of s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. That interpretation is predicated upon the proposition that s 54B is not intended to apply to cases where there has been a guilty plea. Matters permitting a longer or shorter parole period than the standard non-parole period are to be found in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Matters which may bring a sentence below the standard non-parole period may be found in s 21A(3) and in s 21A(1)(c) and those other matters permitted or required to be taken into account by the Court under any Act or rule of law.66. In addition to the plea of guilty, I have noted the offender’s contrition and acceptance of responsibility (s 21A(3)(i)) and the offence was not planned or part of any organised criminal activity. These are strong reasons why the standard non-parole period will not apply. Nonetheless, while I accept this offence, that is, the GBH offence, will attract (as said “will not attract”) a standard non-parole period, I nonetheless regard the standard non-parole period as a benchmark or reference point. It is of course a non-parole period that applies to the mid range of offences after trial. It will have the effect of driving upwards sentences and non-parole periods, even though the standard non-parole period does not apply.67. As with manslaughter cases, the range of criminality and circumstances of its occurring span a wide and varied spectrum in s 33 cases. JIRS statistics at best can only give a global overview. Since the introduction of the standard non-parole period, 115 cases have been tabulated. Ninety-two per cent of offenders in those cases were imprisoned with a non-parole period ranging from twelve months to eight years. That group received head sentences of two and a half years to twelve years. The sentence range for 141 offenders prior to the introduction of the standard non-parole period saw ninety-three percent of offenders sent to imprisonment with non-parole periods ranging from six months to twelve years. In this group the “head” sentence ranged from eighteen months to six years.68. These sentencing ranges demonstrate the wide range of objective criminality and subjective matters covered by offenders who commit s 33 offences. Without a detailed breakdown in the circumstances of offending, such as use of weapon, use of boot, in company, gravity of injury, the JIRS figures are otherwise of little value.Parity69. The adult co-offenders sentenced by me for their part in the affray were each fined $750. Their subjective circumstances were not dissimilar to but perhaps a little more favourable than this offender’s. Their objective criminality, that is, their involvement in the affray, was as being bystanders ready and willing to become involved physically should the need arise. The other co-offender who was involved is currently on s 11 bail, for the purposes of assessing his rehabilitation prospects. Khosravi’s criminality in the s 33 offence rules out any similar course of action for him. In my view, given the severity of the grievous bodily harm offence, and his participating role of violence towards Reynolds during the affray, the issue of parity does not arise.Totality70. Clearly, the totality of this offender’s criminality puts him in another league from his co-offenders. While some proportionality is required when sentencing for the affray, his total criminality requires a more drastic response. In setting the sentences for Mr Khosravi it will be necessary to reflect the total criminality in the sentences. I intend to do that by accumulating a portion of the sentence for the affray. There will also be some accumulation for the hinder police.Special Circumstances’71. I intend to find special circumstances. The Crown does not oppose such a finding. The defence seeks it. I note in Hearne 124 A.crim.R. 451 at [24] an acceptance of the principle that the weight to be given to the element of youth should not vary depending upon the seriousness of an offence. A finding of special circumstances allows a sentencing judge to fix an overall sentence that appropriately reflects the gravity of the offending conduct, and at the same time give due weight to the rehabilitation in the community and the youth of an offender. Thus, two drivers of my finding of special circumstances are the youth of the offender and his need to be in the community, rather than in the artificial and smothering structure of a gaol to advance his rehabilitation. I also take into account that this is his first time in custody.Applying the Plea Discount72. But for the plea of guilty I would have sentenced this offender to imprisonment for two years in respect of his part in the affray. I reduce the sentence I would have imposed to one of eight months imprisonment. I make that a fixed term. But for the plea of guilty I would have sentenced the offender to a period of nine years imprisonment for the infliction of grievous bodily harm with intent to do so. I reduce that sentence by twenty-five per cent. That reduces the sentence to one of six years and nine months overall. In respect of the hinder police, I have set a sentence of three months.Custody73. This offender has been in custody on these matters since his arrest. These sentences will therefore be backdated to 14 November 2006.74. Mr Khosravi would you just stand up please? Alborz Khosravi, of the offence that you between 16 September 2006 and 13 November 2006 at Carlingford in the State of New South Wales did request Farhang Ameli, Joel Begini and KJ to provide false information to police with intent thereby to hinder the investigation of a serious indictable offence, namely, the robbery of KJ on 16 September, you are convicted. In respect of that offence you are sentenced to a fixed term of three months to begin on 14 November 2006 and to expire on 13 February 2007.75. In respect of the offence that at Carlingford on 16 September 2006 you used unlawful violence towards Matthew Reynolds and others by conduct that a reasonable person if present at the scene would have feared for his or her safety, you are convicted. For that offence I sentence you to a fixed term of eighteen months to date from 14 December 2006 and to expire - let me check my calculations. 76. I can make it clear to you so you are not in anguish, Mr Khosravi, that what I intended to do is set an overall sentence of seven years and four months with a minimum term of four years and four months and a balance of term of three years. But for some reason or other the dates I set don’t quite work out. I apologise for that. 77. With the affray - I have convicted you of that. It is a fixed term of eighteen months. That will date from 14 February 2007 and will expire on 13 August 2008. The s 33 - that you, at the same time and place, maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm upon Matthew Reynolds with intent thereby to do him grievous bodily harm, you are sentenced to a non-parole period of three years and nine months. That will expire on 13 November 2011.HIS HONOUR: All right then I can tell you then - let’s settle on those dates. The s 33 matter, the sentence is to commence on 14 June 2007, that is the non-parole period, and it is to expire on 13 March 2011.78. Your first eligible release date Mr Khosravi - this is what you need to go back into the cells and understand - your first eligible release date is 13 March 2011. This is a sentence where I cannot order your release to parole. You will have to persuade the Parole Board and in order to do that you will need to go there well-armed with progress made during custody. All right. Anything else?79. I formally order the sentence for the s 33 matter to commence on 14 June 2007 and the non-parole period will expire on 13 March 2011. The offender will become eligible for release on that date. The overall sentence, as I have said several times now, is one of seven years four months with a minimum term of four years and four months.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: I agree with Mathews AJ. 
     
      
    2 LATHAM J: I agree with Mathews AJ. 
     
      
    3 MATHEWS AJ: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed in the Sydney District Court on 7 March 2008. The applicant had pleaded guilty to five charges. The first two were of imposing on the Commonwealth by an untrue representation, contrary to s 29B of the Crimes Act (Cth) 1914. The remaining three charges were of dishonestly causing a loss to a Commonwealth entity contrary to s 135.1 of the Criminal Code 1995. The charges under s 29B carried a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment. Those under s 135.1 carried a maximum of five years imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 In relation to the two charges under s 29B, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of six months from 7 March 2008. A fixed term of three months, also commencing on 7 March 2008, was imposed in relation to the first of the three charges under s 135.1. In relation to the two remaining charges under that section, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months commencing on 7 September 2008, with an order that she be released on recognisance after nine months. Accordingly, the effective sentence in relation to all offences was a total imprisonment of two years with a release on recognisance after 15 months. 
     
      
    5 The background of the offences is as follows: in 1998 the applicant, who was then separated from her husband, applied for single parenting payments in relation to her son who was born on 22 September 1995. Between 14 March 2000 and 7 January 2007 these social security payments were deposited into the account of the applicant’s son at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The applicant was a signatory to that account. Between March 2000 and January 2007 the applicant was employed, initially part-time, but later on a full-time basis, with Image Technology Centre Pty Ltd. Her income from that employment was paid into a Commonwealth Bank account in her own name. During that period of nearly seven years the applicant earned over $228,000 from her employment, which she failed to declare to the Commonwealth. As a result, $75,075 was overpaid to the applicant by way of Parenting Payment Single. 
     
      
    6 The five charges relate to this single course of conduct. The different offences arise because of changes in the legislation. The dates of the s 29B offences are 14 March 2000 to 12 September 2000 and 10 October 2000 to 22 May 2001. The dates of the Criminal Code offences are 23 May 2001 to 5 June 2001, 3 July 2001 to 28 December 2004, and 25 January 2005 to 7 January 2007. 
     
      
    7 The offences came to light when officers from Centrelink cross-matched information with the Australian Tax Office.  
     
      
    8 On 16 July 2008 an application for leave to appeal was filed on behalf of the applicant. The grounds of appeal were as follows: 
     
      
    1. Her Honour erred by failing to mitigate the applicant’s sentences in a significant way to reflect the fact that she was, at relevant times, suffering from depression and a dissociative behavioural state. 
     
      
    2. Her Honour erred by failing to mitigate the applicant’s sentences because of the hardship that would be caused by her separation from her son. 
     
      
    3. Her Honour erred by failing to take into account the applicant’s remorse, her rehabilitation and the fact that she is unlikely to re-offend. 
     
      
    4. The two sentences of 18 months and their associated recognisance release orders of 9 months’ duration are both manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    5. The total effective sentence is manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    9 Before discussing these grounds it is appropriate to say something about the applicant’s background and the circumstances in which the offences were committed. 
     
      
    10 The applicant is now 32 years old, having been born on 24 February 1976. She has no prior convictions of any nature. Her family background was supportive and her childhood essentially uneventful, at least until she met the man who was to become her husband. This apparently happened in her second year of high school. In due course they became engaged, and on the insistence of her fiancé’s mother, the applicant left school. They were married less than a year later when the applicant was 18 years old. The applicant’s mother-in-law was a controlling, difficult woman who was clearly hostile towards the applicant and over-intrusive in the marriage relationship. In September 1995 the applicant’s son Joseph (Joey) was born. It appears that the applicant suffered from post-partum depression for which she was inadequately treated. When Joey was about three months old, her husband told her that she would have to leave the marital home because his mother wanted it that way. The applicant and her son moved in with her parents where they remained until she went into custody in relation to these matters. Her son is currently being cared for by her parents. 
     
      
    11 Two psychiatric reports of Dr Robert Hampshire were before the sentencing judge. The first, dated 7 August 2007, described the applicant as being severely depressed. He also commented that she had symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder arising from the traumatic experiences of her mother-in-law and the separation from her husband. However he was not prepared to make a firm diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. Nevertheless, he went on to opine that the dissociation which accompanies post-traumatic stress disorder might well have been involved in her offending behaviour. He expressed the belief that the applicant did not deliberately try and defraud Centrelink, but  
     
      
       
        
        “… rather went on in this behaviourally dissociative state not really focussing on the significance or criminality in the way she was behaving in that manner. And she did the best for her child, traumatised and depressed as she was and is.” 
        
       
      
    12 Dr Hampshire considered that the applicant’s prognosis was good. In his later report, dated 14 February 2008, he said that her depression had settled significantly but not completely. 
     
      
    13 Also before the sentencing judge was a reference from the applicant’s employer attesting, in highly favourable terms, to her participation in the Company’s enterprises and to her “mature attitude”. She was described as a valued employee who will play an important role in the future of the company. 
     
      
    14 After being charged with these offences, the applicant started making restitution payments of $350 per week. By the time of sentence the amount payable to the Commonwealth was reduced to $70,109.37. 
     
      
    15 The applicant herself gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. She became so distressed when starting to describe her background that it was agreed that the account contained in Dr Hampshire’s report would suffice for these purposes. The offender said that she and her son had continued to live with her parents since her separation from her husband. They cared for her son whilst she was at work. However she devoted her weekends to him and she was the central person in his life. He saw little of his father. She said that she knew that she was breaking the law in not telling Centrelink about her employment but did not realise the consequences. She was asked whether she ever considered calling Centrelink and telling them that she was employed. She said: “I wanted to but I was in such a hole I didn’t know how to get out of it. I didn’t know how to get out, I was so scared.” She also said: “I never did it to be rich. I only did it to survive.” 
     
      
    16 In cross-examination however, it became clear that significant amounts had been paid for items which went beyond mere living expenses; at clothing stores, hair salons, jewellery shops and makeup salons. In addition, the applicant purchased a new Toyota Celica vehicle. As the sentencing judge commented, the applicant’s lifestyle indicated a degree of extravagance, and her purchases went considerably beyond what was necessary for basic survival. 
     
      
    17 This takes me to her Honour’s remarks on sentence. Her Honour, having given details of the various offences, turned to the applicant’s personal history. Her Honour regarded Dr Hampshire’s report as lacking in professional objectivity and written in such sympathetic and partial terms that he had assumed the role of advocate rather than expert. Accordingly, the weight to be attached to his report was reduced. Her Honour referred to the fact that the applicant maintained separate bank accounts for the receipt of her employment income and the receipt of the social security benefits and concluded that the applicant did not commit the offences in a dissociated state or disabled by depression so as to mitigate her culpability in any significant way. 
     
      
    18 Her Honour noted the applicant’s early plea of guilty for which a discount of 25% was specified. Her Honour determined that a full-time custodial sentence was required notwithstanding the applicant’s need for psychiatric treatment and the impact upon her son of her incarceration. In this latter respect she noted that it would be hard for the mother and son to be separated, but that the child would be cared for by his grandparents. The family circumstances did not constitute exceptional hardship. Her Honour then proceeded to impose the sentences referred to earlier. 
     
      
    19 I shall discuss the grounds of appeal sequentially. 
     
      
       
      Ground one:  
      Her Honour erred by failing to mitigate the applicant’s sentences in significant way to reflect the fact that she was, at relevant times, suffering from depression and a dissociative behavioural state 
      . 
       
      
    20 The applicant submitted that it was not open for the sentencing judge to reject Dr Hampshire’s conclusions as to the circumstances in which the applicant committed these offences. Dr Hampshire’s reports were tendered without objection. The history contained in the doctor’s reports was confirmed on oath by the applicant. The Crown did not raise the issue of bias at the sentencing hearing, nor did her Honour express concerns about this issue during that hearing. 
     
      
    21 The applicant went on to submit that her Honour’s rejection of Dr Hampshire’s opinion as to the relevance of the applicant’s depression and/or dissociative state meant that there was too much emphasis placed on the need for general deterrence. Moreover, the fact that there was a causal link between the applicant’s depressive condition and the commission of these offences meant that there should have been some degree of moderation in penalty. To this extent, this ground is linked with Ground 5. 
     
      
    22 In my view, it was open for the sentencing judge to reach the conclusion that she did in relation to Dr Hampshire’s reports. Her Honour did not reject the doctor’s diagnosis. It was the causal link between the applicant’s mental condition and her offending which her Honour declined to accept. The language of the reports was well capable of supporting her Honour’s views. Moreover, as the Crown pointed out, there was other evidence which was inconsistent with the proposition that the applicant’s offending was related to her depressive condition. These include the reference from her employer which showed that the applicant was a valued employee and a good worker. Further, as her Honour observed, the applicant spent money on a lifestyle which was more extravagant than basic survival. It was not used simply to support her and her son, as she professed in her evidence in chief, but included spending on luxury items. In addition, and very significantly, the applicant was contacted twice by Centrelink in 2005 and 2006 and asked whether she wanted to be registered with a job network. On at least one of these occasions she lied, saying that she was waiting to hear about a job she had applied for. 
     
      
    23 In my opinion it was well open to the sentencing judge to take the approach she did in relation to the applicant’s mental condition. I would not uphold this ground. 
     
      
       
      Ground two:  
      Her Honour erred by failing to mitigate the applicant’s sentences because of the hardship that would be caused by her separation from her son 
      . 
       
      
    24 The applicant’s son was born in September 1995 and was twelve years old when the applicant was sentenced. 
     
      
    25 The applicant’s submissions refer to s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 which requires a sentencing court to take into account, inter alia  
     
      
       
        
        (p) the probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person’s family or dependants. 
        
       
      
    26 Her Honour referred to the hardship that both the applicant and her son would suffer from their separation. However, given that the child will be cared for by his grandparents, who have contributed to his care for most of his life, she determined that these circumstances do not constitute “exceptional hardship” so as to make this a relevant consideration. 
     
      
    27 The applicant submits that, in the light of s 16A(p), this was an erroneous approach and the separation of the applicant from her family was a matter which should have been taken into account in mitigating the length of the sentence. The applicant’s counsel, in his oral submissions, did not seek to urge that the hardship to the applicant’s son amounted to exceptional circumstances; rather that the hardship to the applicant herself, caused by the separation from her son, should have “led her Honour to be a little more understanding and mitigate the sentence by some margin”. 
     
      
    28 It has now been established that, in spite of the apparently broad terms of s 16A(p), exceptional circumstances are required before hardship to another person will reduce an otherwise appropriate sentence. In this case the applicant’s son, who is now 13, will continue to live with the people who have been his primary carers during the working week when his mother has been in employment. In my view the trial judge was correct in finding that the circumstances of this case did not constitute “exceptional hardship”. As to the submissions relating to the hardship to the applicant, this more appropriately falls under the purview of Ground 5. 
     
      
    29 I would not uphold this ground. 
     
      
       
      Ground three:  
      Her Honour erred by failing to take into account the applicant’s remorse, her rehabilitation and the fact that she is unlikely to re-offend 
      . 
       
      
    30 The applicant submits that there was nothing in her Honour’s sentencing remarks which suggested that her Honour moderated the sentences imposed upon the applicant in order to reflect the fact that the applicant was largely rehabilitated and therefore unlikely to re-offend, with the result that personal deterrence ceased to be a significant factor on sentence. This in turn should have led, the applicant submitted, to a term of imprisonment substantially lower than the one that was imposed. 
     
      
    31 I do not propose to discuss this ground at any length. Certainly, her Honour did not refer in terms to the applicant’s remorse. She did, however, refer to the fact that the applicant had already paid approximately $5,000 to Centrelink by the time she was sentenced. Her Honour referred to the general subjective matters raised by the applicant’s situation. 
     
      
    32 In all the circumstances, I can find no substance in this ground. As with the two previous grounds, it essentially raises issues relating to the length of the overall sentence, and is therefore more appropriately dealt with under Ground 5. 
     
      
       
      Grounds four and five: 
       
       
      Four:  
      The two sentences of 18 months and their associated recognisance release orders of 9 months’ duration are both manifestly excessive 
      . 
       
       
      Five:  
      The total effective sentence is manifestly excessive 
      . 
       
      
    33 These two grounds were argued together, with the main emphasis being placed on Ground 5. 
     
      
    34 The applicant submitted that the sentences of 18 months imprisonment in relation to the second and third charges under the Criminal Code was excessive in the circumstances, particularly given the “very modest” sentences imposed in relation to the three previous counts. However, there were good reasons for this disparity. The maximum sentence in relation to the s 29B offences was two years imprisonment as opposed to five years for the Criminal Code offences. The total amounts involved in the first three charges amounted to a little over $10,000 whereas the last two involved nearly $65,000. The first three charges covered periods between March 2000 and June 2001. The final two charges covered the period from July 2001 to January 2007. Accordingly the level of criminality was far greater in relation to the last two charges. 
     
      
    35 In my view the pattern of sentences was entirely appropriate. I can find no substance in Ground 4. 
     
      
    36 This takes me to Ground 5, which in many respects constituted the nub of the matters relied upon by the applicant. Essentially the argument advanced by the applicant was that the total effective sentence of two years with a non-parole period of fifteen months was towards the top of the range for this type of offending conduct, whereas the applicant’s circumstances should have placed her lower down the range. It was submitted that many offences under the legislation involved significantly greater levels of dishonesty than that which had been displayed by the applicant, such as using a false name or creating false documents in order to defraud the Commonwealth. 
     
      
    37 There is, in my view, a strong correlation between the matters discussed under Ground 1 and the appropriateness of the overall sentence imposed on the applicant. Once the sentencing judge had rejected the proposition that the applicant’s offending was caused by her mental condition, then a very serious picture emerged. I do not propose to go again through the details of the offences. However, the offending behaviour lasted for nearly seven years and involved a very significant amount of money. Much of it was spent in a manner that represented a deal of extravagance. Once any suggestion of mental illness was removed, general deterrence became a highly significant consideration, as it normally is, and needs to be, in offences of this nature. Certainly, the overall sentence was in the upper range for offences of this kind. However, in my view, the circumstances of the offending placed it in that range. 
     
      
    38 I would not uphold this ground. 
     
      
    39 In the result I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

   JUDGMENT1. This is a difficult appeal to decide. It is an appeal about a man who breached a bond. Unless I find that the breach was trivial he needs to stay in gaol. The breach occurred in the context of his relationship with his partner. It involved a broken window.2. As both Ms Nicholson, who appears for the respondent Director of Public Prosecutions and Mr Davidge, who appears for the appellant Brett John Green agree, any offence involving domestic violence cannot be treated as trivial. Indeed it is common knowledge that there has been a good deal of publicity this week in one of the major metropolitan Sydney newspapers about the problems of domestic violence and the consequences, sometimes tragic for the victims of domestic violence.3. Briefly what happened is this. Brent Green is twenty-five, he is about to turn twenty-six. On 19 December 2006 when he was still twenty-three he committed an offence of driving whilst disqualified. The following year on 15 August 2007 he was sentenced by a magistrate to perform a hundred hours of community service and disqualified from driving for two years. He completed only twenty-eight hours of that community service and was taken back to court. On 25 August 2008, a Local Court magistrate revoked his community service order and sentenced him to three months imprisonment; however the magistrate suspended that sentence under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 4. However, just over a month later the incident occurred which is said to involve a breach of the bond. I will come back in a moment to describe that incident which occurred on 28 September 2008. As a result of what happened on 28 September 2008 Mr Green was charged with an offence. The offence he was charged with was intentionally or recklessly destroying or damaging property. That is an offence under s195(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. There is no component of that offence in the Crimes Act which refers to an element of the offence being domestic violence, but administratively it is noted on the papers that the offence was domestic violence related.5. When he came to court on 15 October 2008 he pleaded guilty to that offence. The magistrate’s view of the seriousness of that offence was reflected by the fact that the magistrate sentenced him by imposing a bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to be of good behaviour for twelve months.6. Amongst the conditions of the bond was that he not assault molest or harass or otherwise interfere with Naomi Brill. Naomi Brill is described in the papers, which are exhibit A before me, as his partner, although they do not live together. They have a daughter. Ms Nicholson points out that it is likely that that condition was one which was imposed as a result of law because of the circumstance that the offence was in the context of a domestic relationship.7. However, the other thing that happened in court on 15 October 2008 was that the magistrate revoked the bond which had been imposed the previous month under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The result of that is that the sentence previously suspended comes to be executed. Hence Mr Phillips went into custody on 15 October 2008 for the three months of the sentence which was imposed on 25 August 2008. That sentence is to expire on 14 January 2009. A few days later, on 20 October 2008, he lodged a notice of appeal and that is how the matter comes before me. 8. The law is strict about bonds imposed under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. S 98(3) provides that a court must revoke the bond unless it is satisfied either that the failure to comply was trivial in nature or that there are good reasons for excusing the failure to comply with the conditions of the bond.9. This brings me to the events that happened on 28 September 2008. The only source of evidence of that is a document which is part of exhibit A and attached to the charge documents relating to the s 195 charge. The document is called “FULL FACTS”. The document recites that Mr Green and Ms Brill had been in a domestic relationship for eight years and have one child as a result of the relationship. It records that at about 4pm on Sunday 28 September 2008 Mr Green returned home to the victim’s house at the particular address. It records that he had been out overnight drinking with some friends and that when he got to the house he noticed his clothes packed into two small bags on the front porch. He knocked at the door, but Ms Brill refused to let him in. They began to argue and Mr Green started banging on the front window. 10. The document then records that the “actions of the accused has caused the victim to call police.” It goes on to point out that the police arrived a short time later and saw that the front window was smashed. They saw that Mr Phillips had a small cut that was bleeding to his right hand. Mr Green was upset, he was saying “I did it, but I will pay for it”. He was cautioned and again said “I smashed it, but I will pay for it”.11. Police spoke to Ms Brill. She did not wish to make a statement to the police. Mr Green was again cautioned. He was arrested and taken to the police station and was charged.12. Mr Davidge wisely acknowledges that there does not appear to be amongst those facts anything which would amount to a good reason to excuse his client’s failure to comply with the condition of the bond to be of good behaviour. The only possible explanation is that he had been drinking, although the facts do not include that he was drunk at the time. Drinking would not amount to a good reason for excusing the failure to comply. I do not find that there was any good reason to excuse the Mr Green’s failure to comply with the bond.13. However Mr Davidge’s alternative submission is based on s 98(3)(a) which provides that the court may decline to revoke a bond if it is satisfied “that the offender’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond was trivial in nature”.14. As Mr Davidge says, the description of the window being broken is relatively neutral in the facts. All that we know is that when the police arrived the window was smashed and Mr Green acknowledged that he was responsible. We know nothing more about the force of the impact caused to smash the window or the degree to which it was smashed. Mr Davidge acknowledges that Ms Brill called the police but argues that the facts do not include that she was scared or afraid. I think it likely that she was scared or afraid which prompted her call to the police. He points out that it is apparent from the facts that it was his client who was upset and indeed the facts say just that.15. The section itself focuses my attention on the failure to comply with the conditions of the bond and poses the question whether that failure was trivial in nature or not. I had thought that because that non-compliance amounted to an offence which resulted in an order that he not intimidate or harass Ms Brill, that would aggravate the circumstances of the offence. However, I have changed my mind. It seems to me that the Act requires me to focus on the facts of the non-compliance rather than on decisions made by other people as a consequence of those facts.The people I have in mind are the police and the magistrate. As a result of the facts, the police decided to charge Mr Green. I am not privy to the factors which they may have taken into account in deciding to charge him for what amounted to breaking a window. Nor am I aware - because I do not have the remarks on sentence - of the factors which the magistrate took into account in imposing as a condition of the bond that he not harass Ms Brill.16. It seems to me that the correct approach is to focus on the facts which amount to the alleged non-compliance with the conditions of the bond. In this case the facts are that a man returned home to his partner’s house, as is described in the facts, after being out all night, to find his belongings in a bags outside. Understandably that resulted in some friction between the man and his partner.17. That friction involved verbal arguments. So far there is nothing unusual or exceptional which would amount to a failure to comply with a good behaviour bond. The facts then record that the man started banging on the front window. We know that the window was smashed and Mr Green accepted responsibility for smashing it. We also know that the banging on the front window prompted Ms Brill to call the police. However, she did not wish to make a statement to the police about the incident. Any inference about the seriousness of the banging on the window which prompted Ms Brill to call the police must be tempered by the fact that once the police arrived she decided not to take the matter any further.18. I should say in this context that Mr Green has on his record a number of convictions for assault and one offence of stalking or intimidating. It is acknowledged that there is no evidence of who the victim or victims were of those offences. The law is clear that in order to determine that the victim in those cases was his partner I would have to be satisfied of that fact beyond reasonable doubt. Clearly I cannot be satisfied of that on the evidence which I have available.19. Judicial officers have to be very careful about concluding that any offence which occurs in a domestic relationship could be regarded as trivial. I acknowledge the force of that proposition, which was the subject of submissions by both parties. But judicial officers are also limited to acting on the evidence. I cannot reach conclusions which are adverse to an offender without being satisfied of those conclusions in a sentence proceeding beyond reasonable doubt. 20. Hence in this case, with the bare facts which I have, I am confronted with a situation where there is an unremarkable verbal argument between a couple, one of whom has stayed out overnight, resulting in a broken window, which was brought about in a manner that we know nothing about. With that evidence before me, I am of the view that the failure to comply with the conditions of the s 12 bond was trivial in nature.21. I therefore determine this appeal against sentence as follows. Under s 20(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, I determine this appeal against sentence by setting aside the sentence of the magistrate. Instead of that sentence and-- 
     
     NICHOLSON: Your Honour perhaps - sorry to interrupt, but I think it is the setting aside of the revocation of the sentence-- 
      
      
     HIS HONOUR: Yes, I am just about to-- 
      
     NICHOLSON: --other than the sentence, because the bond - if your Honour  
      
     re-sentences him today - the bond will begin again. 
      
     HIS HONOUR: I don’t think I do that. All I am doing now is making an order under section 98, now aren’t I? Rather than revoke the bond, take no action? 
      
      
     DAVIDGE: Your Honour please. 
      
      
     HIS HONOUR: But I am not sure of the nature of the appeal. It’s an appeal-- 
      
      
     NICHOLSON: It’s an appeal against the revocation, so the appeal should be allowed and revocation set aside. 
      
      
     HIS HONOUR: But the appeal is brought under the  
     Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 
      isn’t it? 
      
      
     NICHOLSON: Yes. 
      
      
     HIS HONOUR: So my powers are - it must be an appeal in the nature of appeal against sentence mustn’t it? 
      
      
     NICHOLSON: Yes, yes your Honour. 
      
      
     HIS HONOUR: Yeah, because my powers are - yep, sentence is defined as including any order suspending the execution of imprisonment. 
      
      
     NICHOLSON: That would be the appeal against the section 12. 
      
      
     HIS HONOUR: Yes you’re right, you’re right, you’re right.  
      
      
     NICHOLSON: In fact I think the-- 
      
      
     HIS HONOUR: So how does it get to me? 
      
      
     NICHOLSON: I think your Honour that’s there’s provision to appeal the revocation-- 
      
      
     HIS HONOUR: Well it is a sentence of imprisonment, isn’t it? He got a sentence of imprisonment? 
      
      
     NICHOLSON: Well he did your Honour, but that’s not what he is appealing. He’s appealing the revocation of the bond and I believe somewhere around section 98 there is now provision to ..(not transcribable).. I think, and your Honour I am going off the top of my head here, but there was some amendments in late 2006 that revocation was-- 
      
      
     HIS HONOUR: No here we are, section - sentence includes-- 
      
      
     NICHOLSON: --includes the revocation, your Honour. 
      
      
     HIS HONOUR: --any order made by Local Court revoking a good behaviour bond. 
      
      
     NICHOLSON: Yes. 
      
      
     HIS HONOUR: And any order made as a consequence of the revocation of the good behaviour bond, so it’s-- 
      
      
     NICHOLSON: Which would be the execution-- 
      
      
     HIS HONOUR: Yes, exactly. 
      
      
     NICHOLSON: --yes. 
      
      
     HIS HONOUR: So it is an appeal against sentence because sentence is so defined? 
      
      
     NICHOLSON: The revocation? 
     
     
     HIS HONOUR: Yes.  
    22. I determine this appeal against sentence by setting aside the sentence, as defined in s 3, of the magistrate. I am satisfied that Mr Green has failed to comply with the condition of the good behaviour bond but I decide to take no action in respect of the failure to comply. I make that decision under s 98(2) because I am satisfied under subs s98(3)(a), for the reasons that I have already given, that his failure to comply was trivial in nature.  
     
     Any other orders I need to make? 
      
     NICHOLSON: No, your Honour. 
      
     DAVIDGE: No thank you your Honour. 
      
     HIS HONOUR: So is there any reason why he should be held? 
      
      
     NICHOLSON: No, not that I am aware of. 
      
      
     HIS HONOUR: No. No there is no reason why he should be held in custody? 
      
      
     NICHOLSON: Not that I am aware of, no. 
      
      
     HIS HONOUR: So you are discharged, you can come out of the dock. Now you have probably got to be processed I imagine by the Corrective Services, but you will be released today. All right you have won your appeal.

   DECISIONIntroduction1 On 24 November 2008 Paul Anthony Little appeared for trial in the District Court Sydney in respect of an indictment containing one count for an offence contrary to s 112 (2) of the Crimes Act 1900. It is alleged thereby that the accused: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        On or about 2 September 2007 at Maroubra in the State of New South Wales did break and enter the dwelling house of Wallace Spicer at  
        [omitted] 
         and while in the said premises did steal certain property namely photographic and electrical equipment belonging to the said Wallace Spicer in circumstances of aggravation, namely, that at the time of the offence he knew that there was a person present in the said dwelling house. 
        ” 
        
       
      
    The Trial2 The trial was conducted before me sitting alone. The accused made his election to be tried by a judge alone on 21 November 2008. He signed a form 146 signed by his solicitor in which he represented that he sought and received advice from his counsel before making his election. The Crown countersigned the document expressing the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. I confirmed with the accused that his counsel gave advice as to the conduct of the trial by a judge alone and that it was his wish for the trial to proceed in this manner: Section 132 Criminal Procedure Act 19863 The election form is retained on the court file.General Directions4 To comply with ss 133 (2) and 133 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Act and as required by the decision of the High Court in Fleming v R [1998] 197 CLR 250 I remind myself of the following principles of law.5 As the accused has pleaded that he is not guilty and elected trial by judge alone it becomes my duty and responsibility to consider whether the accused is guilty or not guilty of the charge and to return my verdict according to the evidence. It is for me to assess the various witnesses and decide whether they are reliable.6 I note that the reliability of any witness’ evidence depends on two quite different but sometimes overlapping considerations. One is the witness’ honesty and the other is the witness’ accuracy. The honesty of a witness involves considering not only what the witness said or perhaps did not say but also the impression that the witness made upon me. I have had the benefit of submissions from the Crown and the accused’s counsel. I will consider those submissions and give to them such weight as I think they deserve. I note that in no sense are those submissions evidence in the case.7 I note that as the tribunal of fact I am expected to use my individual qualities of reasoning, my experience, my understanding of people and human affairs and my commonsense. I acknowledge that I have very important matters to decide in this case, important not only to the accused but also to the whole community. I must, as the judge of the facts, act impartially, dispassionately, and fearlessly. I must not let sympathy or emotion sway my judgment.8 As the sole judge of the facts I must not act capriciously or irrationally. I am obliged to determine all relevant issues of fact according to the evidence that has been presented during the course of the trial. The evidence in this trial includes the oral evidence of witnesses and exhibits, which in some instances include documents containing the representations made by persons who were not called to give evidence in the trial. I note that in relation to accepting the evidence of a witness I am not obliged to accept the whole of the evidence of any one witness. I may accept part and reject part of a witness’ evidence.Character9 I note that the accused did not raise his character in this trial, but implicit in the circumstances from which he came before me is the proposition that there are matters that have combined to deny him bail. Moreover, counsel for the accused tendered a document produced by the Commissioner of Police from the electronic record of the break, enter and steal charge and the steps taken in the investigation, and which includes reference to the accused as a person of interest to those investigating the offence. This became exhibit 2 in the trial.10 I have no information whatsoever before me regarding the accused’s past apart from what is contained in that document and what his present circumstances imply. I treat the issue of character as irrelevant for the purpose of determining whether the essential ingredients of the offence and the accused’s participation in the offence are established beyond reasonable doubt. Correspondingly, I completely disregard any reference to the accused’s past in exhibit 2 and his present circumstances as irrelevant to the question of his guilt.The Burden of Proof11 I now direct myself upon the onus of proof. This is a criminal trial. In these proceedings the Crown has the onus of proof to the standard beyond reasonable doubt in respect of every element of the charge and whether the accused participated in the offence. It is not for the accused to disprove those elements or to prove that he did not commit the offence, but for the Crown to prove each and every one of those facts and to prove them beyond reasonable doubt. I warn myself that suspicion is not a substitute for proof beyond reasonable doubt.12 It is and always has been a critical part of our system of justice that persons tried in this court are presumed to be innocent unless and until they are proved guilty beyond reasonable doubt. Unless the Crown succeeds in proving beyond reasonable doubt each and every one of the essential ingredients or elements of the charge, and that it was the accused that committed the offence, then the accused must be found not guilty of the charge.13 The words “beyond reasonable doubt” are ordinary every day words and that is how I understand them. If at the end of my deliberations I am not satisfied that the Crown has established any one of those essential matters beyond reasonable doubt, having taken into consideration the evidence both for the Crown and for the accused, and after also taking into consideration submissions made to me by the Crown and the accused’s counsel in their addresses, then it is my duty to bring in a verdict of not guilty because the Crown will have failed to do what the law requires it to do. It is vitally important that I clearly understand that the accused must be found not guilty if any one of the essential ingredients of the charge has not been proved to my satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt.14 It follows from this of course that if I am left unable to decide whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt in relation to any such essential ingredient or I am left unable to decide whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that it was the accused who committed the offence, and even though I may suspect that the accused may have engaged in the conduct upon which the charge is brought, the accused is entitled to the benefit of that doubt and I must find him not guilty.15 I remind myself that the Crown does not have to prove every single fact in the case beyond reasonable doubt. The onus, which rests upon the Crown, is to prove the ingredients of the charge and that it was the accused who committed the offence.Inferences16 I remind myself that I may in my role as judge of the facts draw inferences from the direct evidence. Inferences may be valid or invalid, justified or unjustified, correct or incorrect. I may only draw an inference adverse to the accused from proven facts if such inference is the only reasonable inference that can be properly drawn from the proven facts. This is a criminal trial, and as I have already noted I must be satisfied of each of the essential ingredients beyond reasonable doubt, and that the accused committed the offence, before he may be found guilty. Amongst other things this means that I should be extremely careful about drawing any inference. I should examine any possible inference to ensure that it is a justifiable inference. I should not draw any inference from the direct evidence unless it is the only rational inference in the circumstances that is an inference adverse to the accused.The Accused Did Not Give Evidence17 The accused has not given any explanation by giving evidence in response to the Crown case. There are a number of important directions of law of which I must remind myself in relation to that. An accused person may always by giving evidence make a response to the case presented by the Crown by way of an explanation for the whole or parts of the Crown’s case, but there is no obligation to do so.18 As I have already pointed out the Crown bears the onus of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the offence with which he is charged. The accused bears no onus. The accused is presumed to be innocent unless and until I have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by the Crown that the accused committed the offence with which he is charged.19 Although the accused may give and call evidence in relation to the whole or any part of the Crown’s case by way of explanation for it or by way of additional matters which the accused may wish to raise, the accused may equally elect to give no such explanation or call any evidence in that regard.20 The accused is entitled to say nothing and make the Crown prove that he committed the offence charged. I direct myself as a matter of law that the accused’s silence in court cannot be used against him as an election by him evidencing his guilt or that he believes that he is guilty. The accused’s election not to offer an explanation for the whole or any part of the Crown’s case by giving evidence constitutes no admission by the accused and no such inference must be draw from that fact. Nor may I use such an election to fill gaps in the evidence tendered by the Crown or as a factor to be added to the weight of the evidence led by the Crown in assessing whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.21 I must not speculate about what might have been said in evidence if the accused had himself given evidence. Whilst not overlooking these statements of principle the Crown submitted that in this case it was appropriate for the court to weigh for a discrete purpose the decision of the accused not to give evidence. The Crown submitted that use for the purpose ventured would not contravene the principles rehearsed above or the limitations imposed by s 20 of the Evidence Act 1995 which relevantly provides: 
     
      
      “ 
      (1) This section applies only in a criminal proceeding for an indictable offence. 
       
       
      (2) The judge or any party (other than the prosecutor) may comment on a failure of the defendant to give evidence. However, unless the comment is made by another defendant in the proceeding, the comment must not suggest that the defendant failed to give evidence because the defendant was, or believed that he or she was, guilty of the offence concerned. 
      ” 
      
    22 Subs (3), (4) and (5) have no relevance to this question. The accused stands alone in this trial.23 Accordingly, the decision not to give evidence may not be viewed as evidence of his guilt of the offence or his belief that he is guilty of the offence.24 However, the Crown submitted that the court may use the election not to give evidence in accordance with what was said in Azzopardi v The Queen (2001) 205 CLR 50 at [64] where the majority wrote (emphasis added): 
     
      
      “ 
      There may be cases involving circumstances such that the reasoning in  
      Weissensteiner 
       will justify some comment. However, that will be so only if there is a basis for concluding that, if there are additional facts which would explain or contradict the inference which the prosecution seeks to have the jury draw, and they are facts which (if they exist) would be peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused, that a comment on the accused’s failure to provide evidence of those facts may be made. The facts which it is suggested could have been, but were not, revealed by evidence from the accused must be  
      additional 
       to those already given in evidence by the witnesses who were called. The fact that the accused could have contradicted evidence already given will not suffice. Mere contradiction would not be evidence of any  
      additional 
       fact. In an accusatorial trial, an accused is not required to explain or contradict matters which are already the subject of evidence at trial. These matters must be assessed by the jury against the requisite standard of proof, without regard to the fact that the accused did not give evidence. 
      ” 
      
    25 The Crown submitted that in this case the evidence that might have been offered by the accused would be as to additional facts, namely, circumstances in which his fingerprints might have been left where found by those investigating the break, enter and steal. This evidence would be additional evidence extending beyond a mere contradiction of evidence already adduced in the Crown case. It was submitted that I should bring to account the election of the accused not to give evidence explaining the presence of his fingerprint impressions or contradicting the inferences to be drawn from the evidence presented by the Crown when considering the unsworn representations attributed to the accused by the police when he was confronted with the accusation.26 It was submitted that I should entirely disregard what he said on that occasion, and that I should find that the accused can offer no explanation for the evidence from which his guilt is the only rational inference to be drawn.27 I am not persuaded that the election not to give evidence should be used for the purposes for which the Crown contends, however I am of the opinion that I may weigh the election not to give evidence in this case when considering whether the hypotheses advanced by the accused’s counsel are to be seen as rational or reasonable inferences in this trial.28 The reasoning in Weissensteiner to which their Honours in Azzopardi v The Queen referred appears in the judgment of Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ in Weissensteiner v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 217 at [227] (emphasis added): 
     
      
      “ 
      We have quoted rather more extensively from the cases than would otherwise be necessary in order to show that it has never really been doubted that when a party to litigation fails to accept an opportunity to place before the court evidence of facts within his or her knowledge which, if they exist at all, would explain or contradict the evidence against that party, the court may more readily accept that evidence. It is not just because uncontradicted evidence is easier or safer to accept than contradicted evidence. That is almost a truism. It is because doubts about the reliability of witnesses or about the inferences to be drawn from the evidence may be more readily discounted in the absence of contradictory evidence from a party who might be expected to give or call it. 
       
       
      In particular, in a criminal trial, hypotheses consistent with innocence may cease to be rational or reasonable in the absence of evidence to support them when that evidence, if it exists at all, must be within the knowledge of the accused. 
       
       
      Of course, an accused may have reasons not to give evidence other than that the evidence would not assist his or her case. The jury must bear this in mind in determining whether the prosecution case is strengthened by the failure of the accused to give evidence. Ordinarily it is appropriate for the trial judge to warn the jury accordingly. 
       
       
      Not every case calls for explanation or contradiction in the form of evidence from the accused. There may be no facts peculiarly within the accused’s knowledge. Even if there are facts peculiarly within the accused’s knowledge the deficiencies in the prosecution case may be sufficient to account for the accused remaining silent and relying upon the burden of proof cast upon the prosecution. Much depends upon the circumstances of the particular case and a jury should not be invited to take into account the failure of the accused to give evidence unless that failure is clearly capable of assisting them in the evaluation of the evidence before them. 
      ” 
      
    29 Counsel for the accused advanced a number of propositions, which she said were consistent with innocence. Upon analysis these may be seen to be variations upon the one theme. She submitted that if true any one of these hypotheses would explain how the fingerprints of the accused might have been placed where they were found. She acknowledged that there was no evidence of any of her hypotheses direct or indirect and no material before the court from which one might infer the existence of any one of them. She submitted however, that I would accept each proposition as reasonably possible and sufficient to displace the inference of guilt for which the Crown contends. They were examples, she submitted, of conduct that might be expected of people in the circumstances she offered, of which the court would take judicial notice as the sorts of things that people do.30 She submitted that any one of the hypotheses should be accepted as reasonably possible, and that they provide an innocent explanation for the presence of the accused’s fingerprints impressions where found, which the Crown could not exclude as entirely consistent with them having been deposited there at some time other than when the break, enter and steal was committed. The propositions suggested were: 
     
      
      1. The accused could have gone to the house looking for some person and whilst there touched the door where the fingerprint impressions were found. 
      
     
     
      
      2. The accused could have visited the house with someone else known to the occupants and with a legitimate reason for attending in the course of which the accused touched the door where the fingerprint impressions were found. 
      
     
     
      
      3. The accused could have gone to the premises with another person believing that he or she lived there and whilst there the accused touched the door where the fingerprint impressions were found.  
      
     
     
      
      4. The accused could have been there for some unlawful purpose including the offence of entering enclosed lands with which he was charged in the Local Court as a back-up offence to the present offence, whether or not alone or with other young people, simply to hang around and perhaps consume alcohol, and whilst there touch the door where the fingerprint impressions were found. 
      
    31 In support of these propositions counsel pointed to the configuration of the house. It is not disputed that the front of the house faces to the north and that on the eastern side there is a driveway extending from the street to the rear of the house, that there is a gate at the side of the house that was not locked, and that the front door of the house was located on the eastern side some distance from the front of the building. She submitted that it was a reasonable assumption that any one who attended the house, but who received no answer to their knock at the front door, might go to other doors or windows where they might look inside to see if there was anyone at home, including to the back door where the fingerprint impressions were found.32 Counsel also pointed to the fact that the police found no other fingerprint impressions or biological material connecting the accused to these premises other than the impressions that were found upon the exterior surface of the glass fitted to the rear door. If the accused was so careless as to leave fingerprint impressions there, he might have been expected to leave fingerprint impressions and biological material within the premises if he was the person who entered in the commission of this offence.33 Without wanting to do injustice to these submissions, l find that in this trial and within the context of the evidence that has been placed before the court, in the absence of any material before the court upon which their existence might be supported the hypotheses ventured rest entirely upon conjecture.34 This said, it might well be acknowledged that as general propositions the hypotheses might have some merit. It might be readily accepted that someone might have any number of legitimate purposes in attending the premises without the knowledge of the occupant, and without their express consent, and might even have had some unlawful purpose other than that with which the accused was charged. However, these general propositions are not to be weighed in the abstract, but within the context of the trial and the evidence that has been adduced.35 The Crown case is a circumstantial case. The Crown led direct evidence of facts in respect of which there has been little if any challenge. These include the fact of the break, enter and steal, the evidence of damage to the premises consistent with there having been two points of attempted entry, the point of actual entry, the placement of the fingerprints on the rear door of the premises proximate to one of the points of attempted entry, the evidence of the quality of the fingerprint impressions found the morning after the break enter and steal occurred to be assessed against the exposure of the surface on which they were found to the elements and bird droppings, the evidence of the occupants of the house that the accused is not known to them, and that they have no knowledge of any legitimate reason why his fingerprint impressions might be found on their back door.36 It is true, as was submitted by counsel for the accused, that there is no direct evidence of when the fingerprint impressions were left, but it is I believe a reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence presented in the Crown case that the impressions were left there in the course of the commission of this break enter and steal. There was no evidence from the accused, although evidence was led in his case in the form of a photograph of the house exposed from the street and records from the Commissioner of Police in which there are particulars of his description including his height and weight. This is relevant to whether the accused was of a size that would allow him to enter the building through the aperture made in the roof and ceiling whereby entry was gained to the house.37 Whether I may be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the guilt of the accused is the only rational inference to draw depends upon my assessment of the evidence from the Crown, the evidence if any led from or on behalf of the accused, and the submissions of counsel, and whether there are rational or reasonable inferences available that are consistent with the accused’s innocence.38 I am persuaded that it is appropriate to bring to account the election of the accused not to give evidence when considering whether the hypotheses ventured are rational or reasonable. If there was evidence to support the proposition that the accused was on some other occasion at the premises consistent with any of the hypotheses advanced, or indeed for any other purpose beyond the wit of counsel to construct, it must be evidence that is peculiarly within his knowledge. As was said in the passage quoted from Weissensteiner, in the absence of evidence to support hypotheses consistent with innocence, when the evidence if it exists at all must be within the knowledge of the accused, those hypotheses may cease to bear the descriptions rational or reasonable.The Accused’s Right to Silence39 When the accused was arrested he declined to the opportunity to be interviewed although he did utter a brief response described by the police officers with whom he spoke. I remind myself that all of us in the community have a right to refuse to answer questions put to us by the police if we do not want to speak with them, and I must not use the fact that the accused has said that he did not want to answer questions against the accused in any way.Circumstantial Evidence40  I will now turn to the principles relevant to circumstantial evidence. Fundamental to these instructions is the direction I have given myself about the drawing of inferences. As I have said the onus of proving the accused’s guilt is upon the Crown. The Crown must establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. This means that in respect of each of the essential ingredients or elements of the charge I must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has established its case before I am entitled to bring in a verdict of guilty.41 I have also said that my function as the fact finding tribunal in this case goes beyond coming to a conclusion as to whether or not I am satisfied that a particular basic fact has been established by the evidence. My function also extends to drawing reasonable inferences or conclusions from the facts I find to be established. I have noted that the Crown relies upon circumstantial evidence, which is evidence of a basic fact or facts from which I am asked to draw a conclusion as to a further fact or facts. There is no direct evidence from someone to say that he or she saw the accused commit any of the acts that combine to make this offence and which the Crown says constituted the alleged crime.42 The Crown relies upon evidence of basic facts from which I am asked to infer or conclude that the accused is guilty of this crime. Because the onus of proof is on the Crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt as to every essential element or ingredient of the charge, including that the accused participated in the offence, any such inference or conclusion from basic facts relied upon by the Crown must of course be a conclusion reached beyond reasonable doubt, having taken into consideration not only the material presented on behalf of the Crown but also after having given careful consideration to the evidence presented by or on behalf of the accused and the submissions of counsel on behalf of the Crown and accused.43 There are two steps in this exercise. I must first of all decide whether I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the direct evidence establishes the basic facts. It is essential that I examine the evidence with care and consider whether it is reliable before taking the next step and drawing any conclusions from the facts that I regard as established by it. If in my view it is not of sufficient reliability to enable me to come to the conclusion which the Crown says I will come to after having taken into consideration and given due weight to the submissions of counsel on both sides, then I must acquit.44 If, however, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the direct evidence has established the basic facts for which the Crown contends, then I must consider what inferences I might draw from those basic facts. A case based on circumstantial evidence may be just as convincing and reliable as a case based on direct evidence, depending on the nature of circumstances relied upon when considered as a whole and not individually or in isolation, and the degree of clarity and certainty to which that evidence may lead inevitably to the conclusion that the Crown has established its case.45 Before I may draw any inference of guilt I must be satisfied as to the existence of the facts and circumstances from which I am asked to draw that conclusion and I must avoid any speculation or conjecture in arriving at any such conclusion adverse to the accused. If such conclusion is to be drawn beyond reasonable doubt it must be on the basis of a rational and logical process of thought. If I draw an inference adverse to the accused and in favour of the Crown, it must be the only inference, which in my view can be drawn beyond reasonable doubt.46 If at the end of my deliberations there is available more than one conclusion than that favourable to the Crown, then obviously the Crown has not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and my duty would be to acquit.The Evidence47 With the consent of the accused the Crown tendered a series of statements from witnesses who were not to be called and whose statements were to be read onto the record. These were from Viola Spicer and police officers named Jackson, Kemeny and Alderton.48 Viola Spicer, who lived at this address with her husband Wallace for many years, does not know the accused. The door at the rear of the house into the kitchen from the landing at the top of stairs which rise from the backyard, and which I find was a point where entry was attempted in the course of this break enter and steal, was about four years old.49 She cleaned the exterior surface of the glass fitted to that door every six weeks or two months. Birds would leave their mess on this door. She described the access down the eastern side of the house along the driveway to the rear and the position of the unlocked gate along that way. Constable Kurt Jackson attended the premises about 1 am on Thursday 2 September 2007, with Constable Morgan in response to a radio message. They took the initial report of the break enter and steal, and saw the disruption to the study from which property was stolen, and the holes in the ceiling and the roof. Constable Morgan entered the ceiling cavity and found where the tiles had been removed.50 Senior Constable John Kemeny with Constable Alderton spoke with the accused on 7 December 2007 and took a set of his fingerprints, which were returned to Maroubra police station for despatch to have them compared with those found at the scene. Senior Constable Lisa Alderton described the conversation she had with the accused on 7 December 2007, when she informed him that fingerprint impressions matching his were found at the scene. The official caution was administered and he responded, “Yeah, what’s this all about?” Implicit in this response is a denial of wrongdoing.51 In further conversation in which he was once again formally cautioned, when asked whether he would participate in an interview he said, “I can’t explain to you how my prints got there, I can’t remember. No I don’t want to participate.” I have already instructed myself upon the principles relevant to the decision of the accused not to take part in an interview with the police officers.52 Constable Christopher Kruit gave evidence of his attendance at the Spicer premises about 1:10 am on Sunday 2 September 2007 with Constable Hicks. He saw damage to the guttering near the landing consistent with some downward pressure leaving it bent downwards. The admission of this evidence was challenged, but for reasons that I shall give shortly it was admitted. He also saw dirt on the railing around the landing of the back door. This too was challenged. For reasons that will follow I rejected that evidence.53 On 21 May 2008 Constable Kruit exposed photographs depicting the rear door of the premises where the fingerprints were found and damage in the vicinity of the door handle, including the broken tip of an implement consistent with a knife left embedded in the rubber seal between the glass and the metal frame. He also described damage to the laundry window. The evidence from Mr Spicer was that the laundry is located beneath the house and is accessed from the rear at ground level. There is no access into the house from within the laundry.54 Constable Kruit described the property. He said the land slopes and where it is higher there is a water tank at the side of the house.55 Wallace Spicer was called next. He is seventy-eight years of age. He described his house and the events surrounding the offence, the commission of which he interrupted. He described the damage to the rear door and to the laundry and to the roof and ceiling. His description was consistent with the photographs of the door and the roof and ceiling exhibited in the trial. He gave evidence of the damage to the roof guttering that was brought to his attention some weeks after the break and enter by his son in law. He saw no damage to the rear door prior to the day of the offence. He did not know the accused and knew no reason why he would be at the back door of his home.56 With regard to the roof guttering he gave evidence that there had been no repair carried out to the guttering. He said that some two years before the present time the water tank was installed at the house and at that time the guttering was in good repair. He had seen no damage to the guttering at all between that point in time and when his son in law brought it to his attention a few weeks after the break and enter.57 David Wilson was the crime scene officer who attended the premises the morning after the break enter and steal and found the fingerprint impressions on the external side of the glass on the rear door. He exposed photographs of the door and the position of the fingerprints that he found. He also photographed the hole in the ceiling, and the hole in the roof where tiles had been removed.58 The position of the fingerprints, which are of the right thumb and right middle finger, is toward the top of the glass in the upper section or upper half of the door. The thumbprint, identified as W1, is adjacent to the left hand edge of the glass as one faces the door from outside. The imprint of the middle finger marked as W2 is to the right of W1 and a little above. I should note, in addition to what I have said about the evidence from Constable Kruit, he acknowledged that the top of the water tank was a potential point of access to the roof.59 Returning to the evidence of Mr Wilson. He described the examination he made of the crime scene and the photographs that he exposed, which were marked exhibit F and tendered through Constable Kruit. He described the position of the railing on the landing outside the rear door; the railing extended around the edge of the landing and connected to the rear wall near to the window into which security bars were fitted. It is common ground that the window opens into the study from which the property was stolen.60 The hole in the roof was forty-one centimetres by twenty-seven centimetres. It gave access to the roof cavity. He said the hole was too small for him to enter. He is six foot one tall and I think he weighed ninety kilograms from my recollection. He noted the bars in the study window. He said there was a distance of fifteen metres between the hole in the roof and the hole in the ceiling. He agreed that the offender who gained entry could not have been very tall or very large. There was much evidence sought in cross-examination regarding the capacity of one who might seek to access the premises through the holes that were made. None of the evidence touched upon the proposition that a person with agility regardless of their size might be able to access the premises through these apertures.61 The damage to the rubber seal on the door was described and was exhibited in photographs he exposed. He said that it had been partly pulled away. He said he applied white fingerprint powder using a soft brush and he observed that the fingerprints found were of good quality and were, in his words, very heavy. He said quality of the fingerprint left depends upon the quantity of the material deposited. He said in his opinion there was no significant deterioration of the fingerprints that he was able to harvest in this way. He placed those fingerprints onto the case management system so that the appropriate expert might compare them for the purposes of their identification.62 He noted that the screen to the laundry window was cut. He conducted a fingerprint examination of that location. He said there were three points of possible access to the roof: a neighbour’s fence, the balcony rail at the rear door, and the water tank.63 He was cross-examined about what the size a person would have to be to be able to enter the house through the roof for the holes found in the roof of the ceiling. He said a person of five foot nine inches could enter but a person of five foot eleven inches would have difficulty. Again, there was no consideration to the agility that such a person might have.64 There was an attempt to have him consider the particular entry regarding the person of interest, said to be the accused, in the document produced from the Commissioner of Police, but this was not pursued after the Crown’s objection. That document was ultimately tendered, it’s provenance having been well established by the subpoena that brought it into court. The Crown did not challenge the proposition that it was a business record and was not otherwise excluded from use by the provisions in the Evidence Act.65 He confirmed that the photograph of the house, exhibit 1, exposed from the street, represented what he saw of the house, and what he saw of the features there depicted of the house when he visited the premises.66 He was followed by Detective Sergeant Martin Swatridge, who is the fingerprint expert. He has extensive qualifications, which were acknowledged on behalf of the accused. He gave evidence of the comparison made and the identification of the latent impressions found as matching the fingerprints of the accused. He told me that glass is one of the best surfaces for holding fingerprint material, which is the deposit of fluid from the finger surfaces of someone who touches the glass. Glass is shiny and the fluid will not penetrate. He referred to environmental factors. He referred to the impact of cleaning the glass. He said that the fresher fingerprints were, the darker they would come up whether using white or black powder. I understood his evidence to mean that the take up of the powder in either case was greater if the prints were fresher. He said if the powder readily adheres to the print it is an indication that it is fresher. If a lot of powder is absorbed it is an indication of freshness.67 He was shown a folder of photographs which became exhibit J. These were close up photographs of the fingerprint impressions harvested by Mr Wilson. The sergeant said there was no evidence of decay or breakdown that he could see in what was depicted in those photographs. He agreed in cross-examination that there were case studies with regard to the time during which fingerprint impressions might remain where placed, but he said that care must be taken when considering those case studies, particularly when they were performed at different places or different environmental conditions applied. Environmental conditions will vary from place to place and from country to country.68 The cross-examination did not extend to any questions, as I recall, with regard to the quality of the print that might be left after an extended period of time.69 That was the last witness called by the Crown, and argument was then heard upon the admissibility of the evidence relevant to the damage to the guttering.Decisions Upon Admissibility of Evidence70 In the course of the trial I was called upon to rule upon the admissibility of evidence, and I indicated that in addition to my immediate remarks I would provide more fulsome reasons when delivering my judgment and the verdict. This enabled the trial to continue with minimum disruption.71 The first challenge was to evidence from Constable Kruit regarding the presence of dirt on the railing on the landing outside of the kitchen door, which he believed to be from shoes coming into contact with the railing surfaces.72 He was unable to say precisely where this was or the extent of the dirt of the soil. There were no photographs exposed of this material. There was no evidence from any other person regarding the presence of the dirt, including from Mr and Mrs Spicer, as to whether or not it was the product of some other activity.73 Although such evidence if more precise and detailed might have been used to support the proposition that the offender or offenders had stood on the railing to gain access to the roof, from which tiles were removed for entry to the roof cavity, in the form presented in my assessment it had no probative value and I took the view that it should be excluded as not meeting the minimum requirements of s 55 of the Evidence Act.74 There was also a challenge to evidence from Constable Kruit regarding the damage to the roof guttering in the vicinity of the rear door. It was said that it did not meet the test of s 55 of the Evidence Act, but even if it did, it engaged the operation of s 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act requiring that it be excluded.75 The constable said that when he attended the premises shortly after the offence he noticed that the guttering at this point appeared as if someone had pulled or stepped on it. Photographs exposed that day were inconclusive, but before concluding his evidence he returned to the house and exposed further photographs showing the damage of which he spoke.76 I pause to note that Mr Spicer had given evidence that there had been no repair to the guttering after he saw the damage, when it was pointed out by his son in law.77 It is in my assessment damage that is consistent with what might have been occasioned by someone ascending onto or descending from the roof at that point, which is proximate to the rear door where the fingerprints were found, and where there was evidence of an unsuccessful attempted entry. Moreover this point was proximate to the window to the study upon which security bars were installed. The hole in the ceiling over the study was about fifteen metres from the hole in the roof. Mr Spicer said, as I have noted, that the damage was brought to his attention some weeks after the break in and that he had not had it repaired since that time. He said that the guttering was intact and undamaged when he had a rainwater tank installed about two years ago, that is from the time of this trial, and he did not notice that there was any damage to it after that time until it was brought to his attention by his son in law.78 There was no question that the entry was made by way of the roof after the removal of the roof tiles and the hole in the ceiling. It is reasonable to infer that the offenders were intending to enter the study, which, from the photographs, appears to be the only room protected with security bars. This room is adjacent to the kitchen into which opened the door where the fingerprints were found, and which exhibited marks and a broken tip consistent with an attempted break in at that point.79 If the damage to the guttering was occasioned at the time of the of the offence in the pursuit of that enterprise, an available inference in my view, evidence of its existence is relevant. It is probative of the fact that the offenders were attempting to access the study in their enterprise, which included an unsuccessful attempt upon the kitchen door, proximate to that room, and upon which the fingerprints were found.80 Counsel is correct in her submission that there is no evidence from Mr or Mrs Spicer as to when that damage might have been first occasioned, but that must be balanced against the observations of the constable that it was seen on the morning after the offence and the evidence of its proximity to the other features to which I have referred. There is in my assessment no unfair prejudice to the accused from this evidence. It is not misleading or confusing and its admission could not result in an undue waste of time. I do not believe that ss 135 or 137 of the Evidence Act are engaged. I admitted the evidence.The Essential Elements81 The essential elements, which combine to create the offence with which the accused is charged, are that he: 
     
      
      1. On or about 2 September 2007 at Maroubra 
       
      2. In circumstances of aggravation 
       
      3. Did break and enter the dwelling house at 7 Nichol Street; and  
       
      4. Did steal there from 
      
    82 There has been no question raised in the course of the trial regarding the fact that of this break enter and steal. Notwithstanding this, it remains that I must consider the evidence and decide whether it proves beyond reasonable doubt that the offence was committed at the time and place alleged. The evidence relevant to this came from Mr Wallace Spicer, who with his wife has been at all material times the owner and occupant of these premises. Mr Spicer gave evidence in the trial, and a statement provided by his wife was read onto the record of the trial by the Crown with the consent of the accused. There was no question asked of Mr Spicer to suggest that the offence did not occur as is to be inferred from his description of the event.83 He said that in the early hours of 2 September 2007, he was asleep with his wife when he heard a noise that prompted him to investigate by looking through a window in the direction of his neighbour. He saw nothing and returned to bed but was disturbed once more and went to his study from which he heard more noises. He attempted to open the door, but a lever style handle was positioned in an upward configuration, and try as he might he could not turn it down as to be able to open the door and enter the room. He concluded that there was someone on the other side of the door holding the handle fast to prevent him from entering. He abandoned this endeavour and telephoned the emergency telephone number. Shortly after the police arrived.84 The point of entry to the house was found. Two video cameras and other items were found to have been stolen. The offender or offenders made good their escape. The investigation continued into the daylight hours with the scene of crime officer attending. Mr Spicer inspected his property. The damage to the rear door was found. The door is a metal frame construction with a glass insert. There was damage in the vicinity of the lock consistent with an attempt to force it. There was a piece of metal comparable to the point of a knife or similar implement wedged between the glass and the doorframe into the rubber seal in a position such that it must have broken in an attempt to lever the glass insert at that point.85 At a time that Mr Spicer could not exactly specify, but estimated to be some weeks after the offence, he saw that the roof guttering over the rear door was damaged and that it was bent down consistent with there having been some downward force applied to it. He saw no damage to the door prior to this time, but he said that the roof guttering in the house was in good condition beforehand. However, the evidence available does not allow a finding other than that there was no occasion before when the damage to the guttering was noticed by him or brought to his attention.86 Upon the evidence of Mr Spicer and the evidence of the observation of the police officers at the scene, in respect of which there was no challenge, there is only one conclusion to be drawn, and that is that all of the elements of the charge have been established beyond reasonable doubt.87 I should however comment with regard to the circumstance of aggravation upon which the Crown relies, namely the presence of Mr and Mrs Spicer in the house at the time. The definition of circumstances of aggravation is found in s 105A of the Crimes Act. It provides as a circumstance of aggravation that the alleged offender knows that there is a person or that there are persons in the place where the offence is alleged to have been committed. Section 105A (2A) provides that for the purposes of this circumstance of aggravation, if there was a person or there were persons in the place in relation to which the offence is alleged to have been committed, the defendant is presumed to have known that fact unless the defendant satisfies the court that he or she had reasonable grounds for believing that there was no-one in the place. There has been no evidence at led upon this question and accordingly the presumption is engaged.88 The issue in the trial is whether the Crown has proven beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the break enter and steal.89 The evidence connecting the accused to this premises is the fingerprint evidence. The fingerprint impressions were found on the glass rear door proximate to the damage to which I have already referred. There is no challenge to the fact that the fingerprint impressions were found or that they matched the fingerprints of the accused. All of that evidence in any event establishes those facts beyond reasonable doubt.90 It is said on behalf of the accused however that the fact that the impressions were found there on the day immediately following the break and enter is neither here nor there in the absence of other evidence to show precisely or even approximately when those impressions were left. In my respectful view the submissions advanced have given insufficient weight to the inferences that are to be drawn from the circumstances that were identified by the Crown. These were that the Spicers’ have occupied this house for fifty years; the rear door was somewhere up to four years of age; the door was cleaned by Mrs Spicer on the outside every six weeks to two months; it was the rear door at the top of the landing where the fingerprints were found.91 The Crown pointed to the placement and orientation of the fingerprints on the door. Neither of the Spicers know the accused. Neither of the Spicers can say why his fingerprints would be on the back door.92 The Crown submitted that there were no circumstances consistent with innocence to be inferred from the material that has been presented in this trial. The Crown submitted that it is fanciful to think that the accused just happened to go to this house. The Crown pointed to the proposition that there were two points of attempted entry and one point of actual entry. The fingerprints were found proximate to one of those attempted points of entry. The fingerprints were found shortly after the commission of the offence.93 The quality of the fingerprint impressions was said to be good and exhibited characteristics from which one would conclude that they were freshly placed. There was evidence of environmental factors that would impact upon the quality of fingerprints if left exposed in that location for extended time. There was no evidence of any deterioration or decay apparent according to the expert.94 The fingerprints were also proximate to the damage to the guttering which itself was consistent with an attempted access or indeed access to and from the roof from the landing at the back door.95 The Crown submitted that the description of the accused as a person of interest in exhibit 2 was of itself to be given little weight when assessing whether he would be a person capable of entering the house through those apertures. The relevant entry is on page 6 of that document toward the bottom at about point 8. This portion I am about to quote is immediately above the section dealing with hair, eye and facial hair. The relevant passage is: “Build/Height/Weight: MEDIUM 175 TO 180 cms 70 to 80 kgs.” There is a significant range in that description. The Crown also asked that I take note of the presentation of the accused here in court in the course of this trial to make an assessment.96 There are difficulties with these propositions and indeed difficulty with the proposition that is being urged by counsel for the accused. I am not an expert in biomechanics. I have no more than the actual dimensions of the roof aperture and the ceiling aperture. I have an imprecise description of the offender’s height and weight. I have no evidence of his agility. l have no evidence of his height, weight or level of agility at the time of the break enter and steal. Moreover, although one could not find beyond reasonable doubt that this offence was committed in company with another person, which is itself a circumstance of aggravation, it is not possible to say that the offence was committed by the accused alone, and whether or not he had at that time the capacity to enter the house through those apertures does not answer the question whether or not he was accompanied by someone who might have that capacity.97 I tend to put to one side what has been offered and what has been said regarding the size and weight of the accused.Findings and Verdict98 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the break enter and steal occurred at the time alleged in the charge contained in the indictment. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence establishes that there were two attempts to gain entry to these premises, one by way of the laundry but from which access was not available to the inside of the house, the other by way of the rear door where some implement consistent with a knife was used in an attempt to lever the glass panel, and after which the point of that implement was left embedded in the rubber seal.99 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the break enter and steal was committed by way of the roof and the ceiling and I am satisfied that it is a reasonable inference to draw that in the course of the execution of this crime the offender or offenders accessed or departed from the roof at a point proximate to where the damage to the roof guttering was found. It is not possible to say precisely in which sequence each of these events occurred other than it must be the case that the actual penetration of the building was the last in time, when the offender or offenders were detected by Mr Spicer.100 I am satisfied that the evidence allows as the only rational inference in the circumstances that the fingerprint in each instance was left in the course of the prosecution of this enterprise. The hypotheses that have been advanced on behalf of the accused in the absence of evidence, which if it did exist would be peculiarly within his knowledge, does not displace the inference that is available from the evidence in the Crown case, and they diminish to the point of being of no value. The hypotheses that have been presented are not to be seen as rational reasonable inferences.101 I am persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of this charge, and accordingly, upon the charge that Paul Anthony Little on or about 2 September 2007 at Maroubra in the State of New South Wales did break and enter the dwelling house of Wallace Spicer at 7 Nichol Avenue and while in the said premises did steal certain property, namely photographic and electrical equipment belonging to the said Wallace Spicer in circumstances of aggravation, namely that at the time of the offence he knew that there was a person present in the said dwelling house, I find the accused guilty.

    3 FULLERTON J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed by Ainslie-Wallace J in the District Court on 2 November 2007.  
     
      
    4 On 5 October 2007 the applicant pleaded guilty to an indictment containing six counts of assault with an act of indecency with a child under 16 years contrary to s 61E(1)(A) of the Crimes Act 1900, for which a maximum penalty of 6 years is provided, one count of sexual intercourse with a child above the age of 10 and under the age of 16 at a time when the child was under his authority contrary to s 66C(2), for which a maximum penalty of 10 years is provided and one count of sexual intercourse with a child under 10 contrary to s 66A where a maximum of 20 years is provided. The victims of the assaults were two sisters referred to in the proceedings as SK and LK.  
     
      
    5 SK was the victim of the indecent assaults charged in counts 1 to 4 on the indictment and of the charge of sexual assault charged in count 5. The indecent assaults charged in counts 1, 2 and 3 were committed between April and July 1986 when SK was aged 8. The indecent assault charged in count 4 and the sexual assault charged in count 5 were committed between January 1988 and December 1989 when she was aged between 10 and 11 years. LK was the victim of the indecent assaults charged in counts 6 and 7 and of the sexual assault in count 8. This course of conduct was committed between April and December 1986 when she was aged between 5 and 6 years. 6 After applying a discount of 15 per cent for the pleas of guilty the individual sentences imposed by her Honour were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1 
         
         
        Non-parole period of 12 months to commence on 5 October 2007 and conclude on 4 October 2008 with an additional term of 8 months to conclude on 4 June 2009. 
         
         
        Count 2 
         
         
        Non-parole period of 1 year and 2 months to commence on 5 October 2007 and conclude on 4 December 2008 with an additional term of 11 months to conclude on 4 November 2009. 
         
         
        Count 3 
         
         
        Non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months to commence on 5 October 2007 and conclude on 4 April 2009 with an additional term of 1 year to conclude on 4 April 2010. 
         
         
        Count 4 
         
         
        Non-parole period of 1 year to commence on 5 October 2008 and conclude on 4 October 2009 with an additional term of 8 months to conclude on 4 June 2010. 
         
         
        Count 5 
         
         
        Non-parole period of 2 years and 4 months to commence on 5 May 2009 and conclude on 4 September 2011 with an additional term of 6 months to conclude on 4 March 2012. 
         
         
        Count 6 
         
         
        Non-parole period of 1 year to commence on 5 December 2009 and conclude on 4 December 2010 with an additional term of 1 year and 1 month to conclude on 4 January 2012. 
         
         
        Count 7 
         
         
        Non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months to commence on 5 July 2010 and conclude on 4 January 2012 with an additional term of 1 year to conclude on 4 January 2013. 
         
         
        Count 8 
         
         
        Non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 5 October 2011 and conclude on 4 October 2014 with an additional term of 3 years and 6 months to conclude on 4 April 2018. 
        
       
      
    7 The order for partial accumulation resulted in an overall sentence of imprisonment of 10 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 7 years to commence on 5 October 2007. A finding of special circumstances under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 was reflected in the structure of the individual sentences. One of the questions that arises on the appeal is whether her Honour’s finding of special circumstances was adequately reflected in the ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of the term as component parts of the overall sentence.  
     
      
    8 The evidence tendered on sentence comprised an agreed statement of facts, a report from Ms Mayell, psychologist, and a letter from a general practitioner concerning the ill health of the applicant’s mother. SK read a victim impact statement in open court. A victim impact statement from LK was tendered. The applicant did not give evidence nor was there any evidence called on his behalf. Accordingly, her Honour’s findings of fact as they concerned the context in which the offending occurred, the circumstances particular to each count and the applicant’s subjective circumstances were drawn entirely from the facts as agreed (inclusive of the account given to police by the applicant on his arrest) and Dr Mayell’s report which was prepared after a three hour interview with the applicant and a telephone interview with the applicant’s wife and mother.  
     
      
    9 Her Honour was satisfied that the offending was a planned and deliberate course of continuing criminal conduct. The applicant, who was aged in his late 20’s at the relevant time, lived in the same residential unit block as the children and their father who worked late hours as a courier. He was separated from the children’s mother. Her Honour was satisfied that the applicant took the calculated step of assuming the responsibility of attending to the children after school in order to prey upon them and that he organised his holidays to coincide with school holidays.  
     
      
    10 The facts in relation to each count were recited by her Honour as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Counts 1, 2 and 3 
        : Between the April and July school holidays in 1986, the applicant slid his hand under SK’s netball bloomers and touched her on the genital area outside her underpants whilst she was sitting on the sofa beside him. He then placed his hand on her back and put his other hand back inside her bloomers and then inside her underpants touching her on the outer labia. SK held her legs together in an obvious effort to resist the assault. The applicant said, “This will be a lot easier, you’ll enjoy it more if you relax”. As a continuation of the same incident, the applicant moved his hand up to the top of SK’s bloomers and put his hand down into her underpants touching her on and around the vagina. The applicant said something like, “You are very dry”. He then removed his finger and moistened it with saliva before putting it back down into her underpants. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Count 4 
        : In 1988 or 1989, on a weekday afternoon, SK and LK were naked and lying face down on the couch on either side of the applicant with their feet towards him. The applicant rubbed SK’s genital area. 
         
         
        Count 5 
        : In 1988 or 1989, whilst kneeling in front of SK and placing his hands either side of her so as to restrain her, the applicant digitally penetrated her vagina by multiple thrusts of his finger causing her pain. 
         
          
         
        Counts 6 and 7 
        : Between 1 April and 31 December 1986, LK and the applicant were watching television. She saw what she thinks were people having sex. She asked the applicant what they were doing and he offered to show her. He put his hand on her leg, moved it to her groin and massaged her groin area. A few weeks later the applicant put his hand down the front of LK’s underwear and fondled her vagina whilst she was sitting next to him on the sofa. 
         
         
        Count 8 
        : Between 1 April and 31 December 1986 the applicant digitally penetrated LK causing her to bleed. 
        
       
      
    11 Over the course of the three years that the children were assaulted by the applicant he told them that they should not tell their father of what he described as “their secret”. Neither of the children told their father of the assaults. Although LK complained to a school friend when she was in year five, nothing came of the complaint at that time. When SK was 26 she provided Victorian Police with information about the applicant’s mistreatment of her and her sister after which Queensland Police interviewed LK.  
     
      
    12 In May 2004 the applicant voluntarily attended Burwood Police Station and participated in an electronically recorded interview in which he made certain admissions concerning the indecent assaults of both SK and LK, but denied any sexual assault. In May 2006 he was arrested and charged with a range of offences including those on the indictment.13 Although her Honour found that the offences were objectively serious, involving as they did repeated assaults on two young girls who were in her Honour’s view effectively at the applicant’s mercy, she found that none of the offences were of a type which would be regarded as falling in the upper range of objective seriousness. Her Honour regarded the applicant’s position of authority relative to the children as an aggravating feature of the offending.  
     
      
    14 Her Honour accepted that since the offences were committed many years earlier she was obliged to consider the sentencing pattern for offences of same kind in 1989 to the extent that a sentencing pattern was discernible. However, given the limited number of available cases counsel referred to she was unable to determine any material difference between the sentencing regime that obtained at that time and currently. She was however persuaded that the delay in the matter being prosecuted, and the associated change in sentencing law, justified a finding of special circumstances under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. These findings and their application to the sentences that were imposed are the subject of challenge on the appeal. 15 In so far as the applicant’s subjective circumstances were concerned her Honour noted that the applicant was one of four children raised in country New South Wales and that he shared a close family relationship with his parents and siblings. He left school at the end of year ten and commenced an apprenticeship in carpentry which he did not complete. In 1979 he obtained work in Sydney as a cleaner with Telstra from which he took a redundancy in 1997. He has worked only casually since that time. He was married briefly in 1994 and commenced a relationship with his current partner in 1999. They have a son who was aged seven at the date of sentence. Her Honour accepted that the family unit was stable and that the applicant is a loving and attentive father and husband. 
     
      
    16 The applicant reported to the psychologist that he endured some bullying at school and that he was anxious and depressed much of the time. He also claimed that he was sexually assaulted when he was 13 and that this exacerbated the problems he was experiencing at school. He reported that he came to the realisation as a young adult that he might be a danger to children because of his attraction to young girls and in the 1980’s sought psychiatric assistance. Although there was no independent record of the fact that assistance of that kind was sought, or that he was treated with medication to inhibit his sexual desire, the Crown did not put these matters in dispute.  
     
      
    17 The applicant told the psychologist that when he stopped taking the medication inappropriate feelings for young girls resurfaced and that he tried to arrange another appointment with the psychiatrist. He claimed that the offences for which he was sentenced occurred whilst he was waiting for an appointment. He said that when he next saw the doctor he was given medication that assisted him to overcome his inappropriate feelings. He went on to claim that he had ceased taking the medication altogether some time ago because he no longer felt any inappropriate attraction to young girls and had not felt the need for continued treatment. That said, he also informed the psychologist that he took precautions not to be in a situation where young girls were present and that he would absent himself if he found himself in compromising situations.  
     
      
    18 Her Honour was not satisfied that the evidence established when the applicant first sought treatment for his attraction to young girls or the course of any treatment that he has obtained since that time. Her Honour did observe, however, that it seemed unlikely that the offences were committed whilst he was waiting for an appointment with a psychiatrist given that they were committed over a period of three years. In addition, while acknowledging that there was no evidence of any reported sexual impropriety with young girls since 1989, the material tendered on sentence did not enable her Honour to conclude with any certainty that the applicant was not attracted to young girls or that he dealt with his feelings by absenting himself from their company. Her Honour noted that in the opinion of the psychologist the applicant presented with a number of cognitive distortions typical of child sex offenders. For example, his contention that many young girls he has encountered have developed a “crush on him” was indicative, in her view, of a cognitive distortion of that kind and that this sustained belief indicated a need for intensive intervention and comprehensive treatment beyond the prescription of anti-libidinal drugs. The psychologist also expressed the view that the applicant’s belief that he does not need help, or need to make changes in his life or attitudes, was typical of child sex offenders such that compulsory treatment is often required because the offender lacks the insight to see that treatment is called for. 19 In light of all the evidence, her Honour was not satisfied that the offences were committed during any break in treatment or at a time when the applicant was actively seeking assistance for his predilections. In addition, and despite the fact that there has been no reported offending since 1989, her Honour concluded that there was no evidence that he has been rehabilitated. This finding is the subject of the second ground of appeal.20 Aside from the remorse which is said to repose in the plea of guilty, her Honour found that there was no evidence that the applicant felt any remorse or contrition for the harm caused to SK and LK, both of whom have struggled with issues of self-esteem and anxiety over many years with varying degrees of success. She noted that the corrosive effect of the applicant’s criminal conduct continues to affect both women and may well continue for many years.  
     
      
    21 Her Honour quoted from the psychologist’s report in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender acknowledges that touching the girls was inappropriate and states that his conduct was the reason why he sought out psychiatric treatment. The offender denies many of the allegations and states that he is disgusted that those allegations could be made”. 
        
       
      
    22 Although her Honour acknowledged that the applicant’s denials and expression of disgust were referable to allegations which were not the subject of any count on the indictment, and that he was only to be sentenced for the offences to which he had pleaded guilty, she considered that the charges to which the pleas of guilty were entered were nonetheless representative of a course of conduct which continued over a period of years and that they were not isolated lapses which might otherwise have called for leniency. This finding is the subject of the first ground of appeal. 23 The applicant relies upon a number of additional grounds of appeal although, as counsel’s written submissions make clear, grounds 3, 4, 6 and 7 are interlinked. In addition, ground 4, which attacks the severity of the individual sentences imposed in respect of the counts of indecent assault is subsumed by ground 7 which complains that each of the individual sentences and the total effective sentence is manifestly excessive. 24 In grounds 3 and 6 specific error is identified. Ground 3 complains that her Honour should have sentenced the applicant on the basis that the sentencing regime that existed when the offending occurred resulted in generally lower sentences than currently, and that the sentences she imposed failed to reflect that fact. Further, that since the delay in prosecution and the changes in the law in the intervening period justified a finding of special circumstances, the sentences imposed did not reflect that finding. In ground 6 the partial accumulation of some of the sentences, and what is said to be her Honour’s failure to give appropriate effect to the principle of totality, is also said to constitute error. 25 The balance of the grounds of appeal challenge her Honour’s finding that there was no evidence that the applicant was rehabilitated and her failure to give any weight to the fact that the applicant was sexually assaulted as a child.  
     
      
    Ground 1: Her Honour erred: (a) in concluding that the offences were clearly representative of a course of conduct which continued over a course of years; and (b) in concluding that “it is also clear that these offences were not isolated lapses which might have called for some leniency”. 
     
      
    26 This ground was not addressed in the applicant’s written submissions. In oral argument it was submitted that by referring to the offences as representative of a course of conduct her Honour exceeded what was the settled position of the parties as reflected in the indictment and the agreed statement of facts. This, it was submitted, exacerbated the objective gravity of the offending generally and infected the sentencing discretion as a result.  
     
      
    27 The Crown presented its case on sentence on the basis that the only conduct attracting criminal sanction was contained in the eight counts on the indictment which reflected a course of conduct extending over a period of three years. I am satisfied that her Honour’s finding that the counts were representative of a course of conduct was in order to emphasise the distinction between the leniency that might be extended for an isolated instance of misconduct as distinct from repeated and discrete misconduct. Her Honour expressly recognised that it was fundamental to the sentencing process that the applicant only be sentenced for the matters to which he had pleaded guilty (R v JCW [2000] NSWCCA 209; 112 A Crim R 466). There is nothing in any of the individual sentences suggestive of the fact that her Honour sentenced the applicant for any uncharged conduct. 
     
      
    Ground 2: Her Honour erred in holding there was no evidence that the applicant has been rehabilitated 
     
      
    28 The primary submission advanced by the applicant was that the evidence bearing upon the question of rehabilitation compelled a finding in his favour and that he was wrongly deprived of that finding in mitigation of sentence. In seeking to persuade her Honour that he had rehabilitated, the applicant relied upon the fact that after appreciating the risk that he would, or might, misconduct himself with young girls he voluntarily sought psychiatric intervention in the 1980’s and had thereafter successfully resisted any temptation to misconduct himself by ensuring he was not exposed to young girls. In addition, counsel sought to emphasise that he had not in fact re-offended and that he was in a long-term and stable relationship.  
     
      
    29 The report of the psychologist tendered on the applicant’s behalf on sentence was to the contrary effect so far as actual rehabilitation was concerned. In Ms Mayell’s view, both the applicant’s profile and his attitude as revealed in the clinical context indicated persisting features of paedophilic orientation of sufficient significance to warrant the applicant being offered intensive and comprehensive treatment. It was submitted on the applicant’s behalf that the phycologist’s opinion was not inconsistent with a finding that the applicant was rehabilitated since, despite residual characteristics of the kind identified by her, he had not re-offended. 30 The weight of the direct evidence, and the inferences that her Honour was invited to draw from the direct evidence, were matters for her discretion as part of the sentencing exercise. Her Honour dealt with all the evidence bearing upon the question of rehabilitation in some detail. In the result she was unpersuaded that rehabilitation was established. This was a conclusion open to her. The fact that a lengthy period has elapsed without further offences being committed may allow for a finding that an offender has either rehabilitated or has good prospects of doing so (Bradbury v R [2008] NSWCCA 93). I venture the view that in many cases evidence of that kind may provide powerful evidence in an offender’s favour, it does not, however, mandate it. In this case, her Honour clearly gave greater weight to the psychologist’s opinion. Ground 3: Her Honour erred: (a) in not making a positive finding that the sentencing regime at the time of the offences resulted in generally lower sentences than presently imposed; and (b) in proceeding to sentence on the basis “I propose to find special circumstances in this case which reflect that the appellant is being sentenced after a delay in prosecution which has given rise to a change in the law in relation to the determination of the non-parole period” which was not reflected, in fact, in the sentence imposed31 It was common ground on sentence and on the appeal that there is no statistical data available in respect of any of the offences such as might indicate any pattern of sentencing between 1986 and 1989. The applicant relied instead on non-statistical data in the form of four cases to which her Honour was referred in the course of the sentencing proceedings. Despite the size of the sample and the fact that the cases differed greatly from each other, it was submitted this material ought to have satisfied her Honour that between 1986 and 1989 sentences were generally lower than the sentences imposed currently for similar conduct and that the sentences her Honour imposed failed to reflect that fact.  
     
      
    32 The cases to which reference was made do not in my view reveal the pattern contended for by the applicant.  
     
      
    33 Clare v R [1984] 2 NSWLR 522 was an appeal against the severity of a head sentence of 15 years with a 5 year non-parole period imposed in respect of one count of carnal knowledge under s 73 of the Crimes Act (since repealed) and one count contrary to s 61D(1) of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 14 years without consent. Not only did the applicant plead guilty to different offences attracting different maximum penalties, the facts of the two cases are utterly dissimilar. The applicant sought nevertheless to draw some comfort from following passage in the judgment of the Court: 
     
      
       
        
        “A non-parole period of the order of five years is usually reserved for that class of criminal who cannot safely be released into the community except after having served a lengthy period of time. This is hardly the case with a man charged with the crime of incest where there is little likelihood that the appellant will have the opportunity to commit this class of offence again…”  
        
       
      
    34 However apposite that may have been to the case the Court was considering, I do not regard it as a statement of general application.35 It is also important to note that the sentence the subject of review in Clare was passed in accordance with the Parole of Prisoners Act 1966 where the ratio of head sentence to non-parole period were not prescribed as is the case under the current sentencing legislation. That Act was repealed by the Probation and Parole Act 1983 which commenced on 27 February 1984. No statutory ratio between head sentence and non-parole period was provided for under that Act. Each of the offences that the applicant pleaded guilty to occurred after that date. The Probation and Parole Act was repealed by the Sentencing Act 1989 which commenced on 25 September of that year. It was later repealed and replaced by the present Act. The Sentencing Act introduced a statutory proportion between head sentence and non-parole period for the first time subject to a finding of special circumstances. The applicant’s offences straddle both the Probation and Parole Act and the Sentencing Act, in that counts 4 and 5 allege an indecent assault against SK which occurred between the 2 January 1988 and 31 December 1989 and a sexual assault committed against her between the same dates. Whether or not the offences constituted by counts 4 and 5 were subject to the Sentencing Act or the Probation and Parole Act is, however, entirely a matter of conjecture. In any event, her Honour found special circumstances established in the applicant’s case and varied the statutory ratio for each of the individual offences to a range between 50 and 60 per cent. Even if the Probation and Parole Act was the sentencing legislation in operation, the ratio between head sentence and non-parole period fixed by her Honour was commensurate with what Howie J noted in AJB v R [2007] NSWCCA 51; 169 A Crim R 32 at [39] to be the fixing of a non-parole period between a half and a third of the term of the sentence under the Probation and Parole Act.  
     
      
    36 The other cases to which the applicant referred her Honour, and to which reference was made on the appeal, are for other reasons in my view wholly distinguishable.  
     
      
    37 In Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447, the High Court granted special leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on an appellant who was convicted of what was then the relatively new offence of sexual penetration without consent under s 324D of the Criminal Code of Western Australia. The complainant was an adult woman who had been invited by the appellant’s wife to have sexual intercourse with her husband. She participated in consensual sexual intercourse with the appellant on multiple occasions prior to the occasion giving rise to the offence. On that occasion she withdrew her consent to intercourse after it had commenced consensually. On conviction a sentence of 4 years imprisonment was imposed. The High Court intervened on the basis of what was said to be a demonstrated and gross violation of the principles which ought to guide a sentencing discretion where in the particular circumstances of that case the complainant had consented, or was honestly or reasonably believed by the appellant to have consented to the act of penetration by which intercourse was commenced but where consent was withdrawn in the course of that sexual act.  
     
      
    38 In R v Jordan [1983] NSWCCA 254, sentences were also imposed under the Parole of Prisoners Act on three counts of indecent assault on a female under 16 pursuant to s 76 of the Crimes Act (now repealed). That offence carried a statutory maximum of 6 years and is in like term to the six counts on the subject indictment charging an indecent assault contrary to s 61E(1)(A) of the Crimes Act. An aggregate of 8 years imprisonment was imposed with a non-parole period of 4 years. The Court was of the view that a sentence of 8 years against a statutory maximum of 6 years for each offence was excessive despite the Court confirming that partial accumulation across the body of offending was appropriate. In so far as the non-parole period was concerned, the Court considered that the applicant’s extremely favourable rehabilitative prospects, in particular the success the applicant had demonstrated in dealing with an alcohol addiction, justified a 2 year non-parole period.  
     
      
    39 The case of R v Lyne [1982] NSWCCA 84 also involved an adult victim. The Crown appealed against the inadequacy of a 3 year good behaviour bond imposed on an offender who picked up a hitchhiker, overpowered her and sexually assaulted her. The appeal was allowed and the offender was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 months. Not only was the sentence imposed following a successful Crown appeal, the case is wholly distinguishable and gives no indication at all as to any relevant sentencing pattern in respect of the offences for which this applicant pleaded guilty.  
     
      
    40 Against the number of cases and their marked dissimilarity both from each other and the applicant’s case, it is hardly surprising that her Honour was unable to discern any reliable sentencing pattern that was current at the time of the applicant’s offending in respect of the offences which were under consideration.  
     
      
    41 By analogy with Featherstone v R [2008] NSWCCA 71 the applicant sought to argue that a modest sample of cases of what was submitted were broadly similar sexual offences to those in the present case ought to have attracted a similar outcome. In Featherstone the Court was satisfied that despite the review of a small sample of cases there was a sufficient similarity between the offences to which those cases referred and the case under consideration to support the proposition that there has been a significant upward trend in the length of sentences for offences of that particular character in recent years. It was an impression that Bell JA held accorded with her recollection of the pattern of sentences for sexual offences before the introduction of the Sentencing Act. On the basis of both impression and recollection, her Honour considered that error had been demonstrated in the sentences imposed at first instance.  
     
      
    42 Featherstone is not authority for the proposition that whenever a small number of cases are presented a sentencing judge should be able to discern a sentencing pattern. To the contrary. It is simply a statement by the Court that on that particular occasion, and having regard to the information placed before it, a pattern could be discerned. As I have sought to make clear I do not regard it as open to the sentencing judge in the present case to have discerned a pattern from the very limited number and wholly dissimilar range of cases placed before her.  
     
      
    43 In the absence of statistical and non-statistical data her Honour was obliged to adopt the approach which was settled in R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; 54 NSWLR 368. Her Honour was provided with MJR together with a case note of AJB v R [2007] NSWCCA 51; 169 A Crim R 32 which both confirmed the correctness of that approach and developed it.  
     
      
    44 In both AJB and MJR particular attention was directed to the proper approach to the specification of the non-parole period in cases where the offences were committed prior to the introduction of the Sentencing Act. As Howie J observed in AJB, a non-parole period under the Probation and Parole Act was usually somewhere between a third and a half of the length of the sentence, which might itself be a practice that is sufficient to constitute special circumstances justifying departure from the statutory ratio fixed under the present regime. As his Honour said at [37], this Court “should endeavour to apply the practice that existed in 1982 in specifying a non-parole period because that practice would favour the applicant”.45 Her Honour expressly referred to the authorities and, in so doing, was satisfied that the delay in prosecution and the change in sentencing law warranted a finding of special circumstances. The applicant did not submit that her Honour failed to identify the appropriate sentencing principles but rather that she played lip service to them and imposed sentences that more accurately reflect current sentencing practices. 
     
      
    46 I do not regard that submission as borne out by the sentences that were imposed on the individual counts. I am satisfied however that the overall sentence failed to reflect the finding of special circumstances in the applicant’s favour largely, it would seem, as a consequence of the order for partial accumulation designed to reflect the separate offending in counts 1 to 5 as they involve SK, and the quite distinct and more serious offending constituted by counts 6, 7 and 8 where LK was the victim. I am satisfied that the intervention of this Court is called for to correct the error (see Featherstone at [66]). Ground 5: Her Honour erred in failing to give consideration to the fact that the appellant had been sexually assaulted as a child  
     
      
    47 The applicant conceded on the appeal that there was no direct evidence that the single incident of abuse he suffered as a child had in any way contributed to his offending as an adult. Although the psychologist’s report made reference to a body of research suggesting that a percentage of sex offenders have themselves been sexually assaulted during childhood, and that this in turn has contributed to the development of aberrant sexual behaviour in adult life, she did not consider that the incident reported to her by the applicant had contributed in any way to his offending. In the absence of any causal connection of that kind (or the issue having any bearing upon the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation) I am not satisfied that the incident was relevant to the sentencing discretion (see R v Cunningham [2006] NSWCCA 176 at [67]). Grounds 4 and 7: Were the sentences on any of the individual counts manifestly excessive 48 Having resolved to the view that aside from her Honour’s failure to reflect the finding of special circumstances in the overall sentence the individual sentences were not otherwise infected by patent error, the only question that survives for consideration is whether the individual sentences were manifestly excessive.49 In sentencing for the offences of indecent assault committed against SK between April and July 1986 the applicant submitted her Honour failed to give appropriate weight to the applicant’s previous good character. Although her Honour did not refer expressly to the fact that the applicant had not offended against the criminal law prior to 1986 the recitation of his subjective circumstances made that plain. While an offender’s previous good character must be taken into account on sentence its weight as a matter in mitigation of sentence will vary depending on the circumstances of the offending (Ryan v R [2001] HCA 21; 206 CLR 267 per McHugh J at 275). In the context of offending constituted by a course of repeated sexual offending against young children a claim for good character does not entitle an offender to the leniency that might otherwise be available (see R v PGM [2008] NSWCCA 172 at [43] and [44]). Having regard to the sentences imposed in respect of counts 1, 2 and 3, and the fact that within the same general timeframe LK was also indecently assaulted, I am not satisfied that her Honour failed to give the applicant’s previous good character such weight as it deserved.  
     
      
    50 The applicant submitted that each of the sentences was excessive, given her Honour’s finding that the objective seriousness of the indecent assaults on the two sisters placed the assaults at the lowest end of criminal behaviour comprehended by the section. In particular it was submitted that sentences of increasing severity for counts 1, 2 and 3, when they were effectively a continuation of the one incident, was not warranted. It would appear that although her Honour regarded each of the three offences as at the lower end of the spectrum, she imposed different sentences so as to reflect the different character of the particular assault, including the degree of physical contact involved and the extent to which it involved any genital touching (see GAT v R [2007] NSWCCA 208 at [22]). Viewed in this way, the sentence of 20 months with a non-parole period of 12 months where the child was touched outside her underwear (count 1), and a sentence of 2 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 18 months where she was touched repeatedly on and around her vagina (count 3), does not reveal error. The fact that her Honour ordered that the three sentences be served concurrently, reflected the fact that they were a continuation of the one episode, albeit involving touching that was progressively more invasive. After allowing for the discount for the pleas of guilty and that the offences were historic, the Crown accepted that against a maximum of 6 years the sentences were at the high end of an available range but submitted that the range was not exceeded. The applicant has not persuaded me otherwise. 
     
      
    51 Although ground 7 challenges each of the individual sentences as being excessive no submission was advanced in support of the proposition that the sentence of 3 years and 10 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 4 months imposed for the counts of sexual intercourse when SK was aged 10 or 11, and a sentence of 6 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years for the count of sexual intercourse when LK was aged 5 or 6 exceeded her Honour’s legitimate sentencing discretion.  
     
      
    Ground Six: Her Honour erred in ordering partial accumulation of some of the sentences52 It was submitted however that the orders for partial accumulation offended against the principle of totality and that an excessive overall sentence has resulted.53 The question of whether and to what extent sentences for multiple offences should be accululated was addressed by Howie J in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 where at [27] his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.” 
        
       
      
    54 I have already referred to the partial accumulation of counts 1, 2 and 3. I note that count 4, committed against SK some years after that offending, was accumulated by 12 months such that the four offences of indecent assault attracted an effective non-parole period of 2 years. The count of sexual intercourse constituted by count 5 (committed within the same time-frame as count 4) was then partially accumulated on that effective non-parole period such that the total effective non-parole period for the offences committed against SK was 3 years and 11 months.  
     
      
    55 In so far as LK was concerned her Honour ordered a partial accumulation of each of counts 6, 7 and 8 which resulted in a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months. I do not regard that term as being excessive having regard to the age of the child, the different maximum sentence that was involved in the charge of sexual intercourse as it involved her and the circumstances in which the offending occurred. The non-parole periods imposed in respect of counts 6 and 7 were then structured in such a way that they were ordered to be served concurrently with the sentences for counts 1 to 5 leaving the non-parole period imposed for count 8 to commence at the expiration of that period.  
     
      
    56 Structured in this way I am satisfied her Honour paid appropriate regard to the principle of totality while conforming strictly to the approach required in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610. In R v KM [2004] NSWCCA 65 at [55] Miles JA observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “…. whilst the totality principle is familiar enough and applied commonly enough in favour of an offender in order to avoid an excessive or crushing punishment, it is not to be disregarded for the converse purpose of assessing whether the overall effect of the sentences is sufficient having regard to the usual principles of deterrence, rehabilitation and denunciation. The task of the court is to ensure that the overall sentence is neither too harsh nor too lenient. Just as totality is applied to avoid a crushing sentence it is not to be disregarded for the converse purpose of assessing whether the overall effect of the sentences is sufficient …” see also  
        Vaovasa v R 
         [2007] NSWCCA 253 at [18]. 
        
       
      
    57 In circumstances where the offences constituted discrete offending involving two young children and extending over a period of years I do not regard the fact of partial accumulation or its extent as manifesting error warranting intervention. However, in order to ensure that the non-parole period fairly reflects the operation of the sentencing legislation at the relevant time as her Honour intended by the finding of special circumstances, I propose to alter the sentence imposed in respect of count 8 so as to arrive at an effective non-parole period of 5 years.  
     
      
    Orders 
     
      
    58 The orders I propose are as follow: 
     
      
      1. Leave to appeal is granted. 
       
       
      2. The sentence imposed for count 8 is quashed and in substitution the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 1 year to commence on 5 October 2011 and to conclude on 4 October 2012 with an additional term of 5 years and 6 months.  
       
       
      3. The sentences imposed in respect of counts 1 to 7 are confirmed.

   JUDGMENT1. I am sentencing Timothy John Scott. I am sentencing Mr Scott for the crime of aggravated break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence. The serious indictable offence was an assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The offence is against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. It carries a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment. In addition, Parliament has attached to this crime a standard non-parole period of five years. 
    2. The sentencing of Mr Scott involves weighing up the seriousness of what he did against some personal factors in his life. It is important for me to start with the seriousness of what he did and the appropriate place to start is with a description of what happened. 
    3. Mr Scott on Sunday 2 March 2008, at twenty to ten at night, broke into a business called World of Tyres here in Griffith. He went there in order to steal some tyres. Once he was inside he got a torch to help him look around. Unknown to him, his breaking in had activated an alarm and Scott Connor, a security guard, turned up. He inspected inside the business and came across Mr Scott. Mr Connor told Mr Scott not to move, but Mr Scott moved towards Mr Connor and pushed him in the chest and grabbed the torch out of his hand. Mr Connor fell to the ground. Whilst he was on the ground Mr Scott swung the torch at his head and hit him. Mr Scott tried to hit him again but Mr Connor wrestled the torch from him. 
    4. Mr Scott ran out of the warehouse but surprisingly came back to collect his mobile phone. I say “surprisingly”, but understandably so as well, because it in the end provided significant evidence linking him with the crime. 
    5. He was arrested about a week later and co-operated in making a full admission. He said that he did not intend to assault Mr Connor and expressed his remorse and shame. He told the police that at the time of committing the offence he had not been taking the medication he usually takes. 
    6. There are three things which particularly aggravate this offence. The first is that a weapon was used. 
    7. The second, which I regard also as serious, is that the victim of the assault was a person doing his job as a security guard. Businesses such as this need to employ security guards and security guards, as a result of their job, are in a vulnerable position. This security guard confronted an intruder and found himself on the floor being struck by a torch. 
    8. The third aggravating feature is not so much of the crime itself, but is described by s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is an aggravating matter, that is that Mr Scott has a criminal record for similar offences. Two of them were committed when he was a child and I place less weight on that and another more recently when he received a suspended sentence under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
    9. I also take into account in assessing how serious this crime was the fact that Mr Scott obviously panicked when he was confronted by the security guard. He did not go into a residence knowing that there were people inside, he broke into a business and found himself confronted by a security guard. The assault was as a result of panic.  
    10. Nothing in the end was taken, and there is no evidence of any psychological damage or injury occasioned to the security guard, but there is evidence of Mr Connor suffering a deep laceration to his head with mild concussion as a result of the assault. 
    11. When Mr Scott committed this crime, he was or had been suffering for some time from a diagnosed psychiatric condition, namely a bipolar disorder. He also suffered from depression and had at least on one previous occasion attempted to take his own life. 
    12. Around the time of the offence he had moved from Broken Hill to Griffith. The move caused a good degree of disruption in his life. He got out of his routine in taking medication and so for a month or so before the offence he had not been taking the medication which he normally takes for his psychiatric condition. 
    13. As Ms Nicholson, who appeared for the prosecution, pointed out, the impact of Mr Scott’s mental health condition in this case points in two ways. On the one hand it carries with it less of an emphasis on the matter of general deterrence. It is well established that a person with a mental health condition is not a good example to others in demonstrating a deterrent sentencing pattern. On the other hand, however, he was responsible for taking his own medication. He failed to take the medication and perhaps as a result, or partly as a result, of that failure he found himself in the situation where he committed these crimes and panicked in the circumstance that he did. He therefore represents, as Ms Nicholson said, a greater danger to the community. I take both those aspects of his mental health condition into account. 
    14. Ms Nicholson conceded that this particular offence was below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this type. I agree with her. Mr Davidge, who appears for Mr Scott, embraced that submission. The reason that I agree is that it was an offence not involving a residence and it was committed in circumstances which were not anticipated by Mr Scott and when he was panicking.15. Mr Scott pleaded guilty at what it is agreed was the earliest available opportunity. 
    16. There are a number of factors personal to Mr Scott which need also to be referred to. One of them is his mental health condition, which I have already made reference to. 
    17. A second is fairly significant. Mr Scott’s wife has a very serious medical condition, namely motor neurone disease. It is clear from what Mr Davidge has said that her condition is going to deteriorate further and will tragically eventually result in her death. Obviously when that will occur cannot be predicted. One thing of significance is that Mr Scott has been his wife’s carer for some time and indeed has been receiving the carer’s pension for some two years. 
    18. Mr Scott has a history of drug abuse, commencing with the use of cannabis at the age of fourteen and using heroin from the age of twenty-four. He spent some years in the Australian Infantry Force, but during that period of time became addicted to amphetamines, which led to his eventual discharge. 
    19. His prospects for rehabilitation must be guarded. The reason for that is that since committing this offence he has committed other offences. Indeed he is presently in custody under sentence as a result of offences committed after the offence that I am sentencing him for. He was sentenced on 5 November 2008 by the Local Court at Griffith to a range of penalties, which mean that he is in custody at least until 14 June 2009. 
    20. He did not give evidence, but there is some evidence of his remorse in the record of interview which I have read and in one of the pre-sentence reports which records Mr Scott as presenting as remorseful and ashamed of his actions. 
    21. Mr Davidge submits that it is a case where there are special circumstances which would permit me to alter the normal ratio between a non-parole period and a parole period. Ms Nicholson acknowledges that and I propose to alter that ratio. The special circumstances, in my opinion, are the need for Mr Scott to engage in the intensive therapy recommended in the pre-sentence reports that will require some time, as well as some supervision. 
    22. Sentencing Mr Scott is not an easy exercise at all. His offending behaviour has increased significantly from the kinds of offences that he has committed in the past, which have all been dealt with either in the Children’s Court or the Local Court. He has now committed an offence which carries with it a standard non-parole period of five years and is regarded by Parliament as very serious. It has the aggravating features attached to it which I have described and the sentence needs to reflect the protection which the community needs from these sorts of crimes, and these sorts of criminals. 
    23. On the other hand, I take into account Mr Scott’s personal circumstances with his wife’s condition. The Court of Criminal Appeal in this State has made it clear that hardship caused to persons other than the accused can be taken into account only when the hardship is highly or truly exceptional. As Mr Davidge pointed out, his client’s wife will sadly deteriorate in the near future and may need to go into a hospice facility. The couple cannot afford private home care. If she goes into a hospice she will need to go to Wagga. She has adult children who live in Griffith, so that there would be some dislocation involved. I propose to reflect this circumstance in the sentence which I impose, but it will be reflected only in directing that part of the sentence be concurrent with the present sentence which Mr Scott is serving. This is not a case where I cannot impose a full time custodial sentence. It is Mr Scott’s actions in committing this crime which have resulted in the hardship which his wife will have to bear, rather than my sentence. 
    24. The overall sentence which I propose to impose is four years. I propose to fix a non-parole period of two years and I propose to date that non-parole period from 1 January next year. That means, in effect, that Mr Scott will have to serve another eighteen months after the end of his current sentence. 
    25. I appreciate that that may have tragic consequences so far as his partnership with his wife is concerned, however, in my opinion any sentence less than that would not be sufficient to reflect the need to protect the community from the sorts of crime committed by Mr Scott. He has broken into a business which is entitled to be protected from these crimes, and has in the course of that assaulted a security officer who was doing no more than his job in trying to protect those premises from the breaking in. For doing his job he ended up in hospital with a deep laceration to his head. Mr Scott has a record at least for break and enter crimes and used a weapon, although spontaneously, in assaulting the security guard. This is a crime which must come with a period in full time custody. 
    26. Would you stand up please Mr Scott. For the offence of aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence, I fix a non-parole period of two years to commence on 1 January 2009 and to conclude on 31 December 2010. The balance of the term will be two years, from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2012. 
     
     
     HIS HONOUR: Now the first thing I ask you Mr Pincott and Mr Davidge is to check my sums, 01/01/09 to 31/12/10 and then 01/01/11 to 31/12/12. PINCOTT: I’m happy with them your Honour. 
      
     DAVIDGE: Thank you your Honour. 
      
     HIS HONOUR: The second thing is, I do not order parole because it is more than three years, am I right? But I might make recommendations to the Parole Authority, is that right? 
      
    27. When considering Mr Scott for parole, I recommend that the Parole Authority consider fixing as conditions those recommended in the pre-sentence reports dated 27 October 2008 and 14 November 2008, and also take into account the conclusions and recommendations of the Justice Health Report dated 16 September 2008. 
     
      
     HIS HONOUR: Is that all the formal matters that I need to - I will explain this to Mr Scott, as the statute requires me to do in a moment. There is a 166 I am reminded by my associate. What do I do with that? My note of what Ms Nicholson said is s 166 certificate dismissed. 
      
     PINCOTT: Yes thank you your Honour, I’m happy with that order. 
      
     HIS HONOUR: What is on the section - do we know what - I might have it, actually I’ve got it, my associate’s given it to me. 
      
      
     PINCOTT: I’ve got it in front of me too. I’ll ask for that formal order your Honour. In relation to the back-up offence, at sequence 2 of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm, I’d ask that you dismiss that matter. 
      
      
     HIS HONOUR: Thank you Mr Crown. I dismiss the back-up offence of sequence 2, assault occasioning actual bodily harm. 
      
    28. Mr Scott, you have got four years, for the reasons that I explained. You are in serious trouble: two years minimum. I have started that from 1 January so six months of that two years you are serving the same time - pretty well the same time - as your present sentence. After your present sentence you have got about eighteen months left so that you will become eligible to be considered for parole on New Years Eve 2010, 31 December 2010 is when you are eligible. That is when the Parole Authority will consider whether to release you or not and if they release you at that time you have then got two more years on parole and you have heard what I said about them, that it is up to them to fix parole, not me, but I have suggested they take into account what is in the pre-sentence report so that you can have an opportunity to sort out your mental health problem and your drug problem and this will be your opportunity when that comes up to do that. Do you understand all of that?OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: On 5 November 2007 this Court gave its principal judgment in this appeal: [2007] NSWCCA 307. It then made an order that that judgment and the judgment appealed from were not to be published for six months, and also gave leave to the parties to make submissions concerning that order.  
     
      
    2 The parties subsequently reached agreement that the judgment could be published with certain passages omitted, and that agreement was given effect to by consent orders made on 6 March 2008, which were to remain in force until 1 October 2008, or if by that date an application had been made for the non-publication order to continue, until resolution of that application.  
     
      
    3 The Attorney-General did apply for continuation of the non-publication order before 1 October 2008, seeking that it be made permanent. That application was opposed by Nationwide News.  
     
      
    4 The basis of the application is that the omitted passages contained information which came from confidential affidavits read on the non-publication application, and that publication of those passages would be against the public interest for reasons appearing from a further confidential affidavit.  
     
      
    5 It was submitted by Mr Maltz for Nationwide News that there was in fact no public interest or no significant public interest against the publication of the presently omitted passages, and particularly those parts of the passages which disclosed information that had also been disclosed in affidavits read openly.  
     
      
    6 In my opinion, there is a substantial public interest in courts being fully apprised of information relevant to claims of public interest immunity, and the open justice principle applies less strongly to confidential information provided for the purpose of determining such claims. Although there is force in the contentions of Nationwide News, in my opinion there is sufficient public interest in the non-publication of the presently omitted material to justify extending the existing regime for a further two years, with liberty to the Attorney-General to seek a further extension within that time. In my opinion, this applies even to the category of material that Mr Maltz submitted had been disclosed openly: there is greater detail in passages in the judgment, and the context could give it greater impact.  
     
      
    7 The parties have agreed that there be no order as to costs.  
     
      
    8 Accordingly, I propose the following orders:  
     
      
      (1) There shall be no publication of the following portions of the judgment of this Court in this matter ( 
      Attorney-General for NSW v Nationwide News Ply Limited & Anor

        (f) the 36th to 48th and 67th to 74th words (inclusive) of paragraph 44.

   JUDGMENT1. On 28 November 2008, the accused was arraigned on two counts. He pleaded guilty to the offence that, on 9 October 2007 he cultivated a commercial quantity of cannabis (56 plants). He pleaded not guilty to the offence that, on the same date he supplied cannabis leaf. The Crown alleges a ""deemed supply"", i.e. that the accused was in possession of 354.7g of cannabis leaf, a quantity in excess of 300 g, the ""trafficable quantity"" for cannabis leaf.2. In relation to the ""deemed supply"" count, on 27 November 2008 the accused elected to be tried by a judge alone and DPP consented. I was satisfied that, before making the election, the accused had sought and received advice from his barrister.Overview3. On 9 October 2007, police executed a search warrant at a house rented by the accused. 4. The accused showed police to a concealed room under the house that was entered via the garage. In the room, 20 substantial cannabis plants were being cultivated utilising special lighting and a drip system. In an adjoining area, there were fertilisers and pH balancing chemicals. Next to the cultivation room was an area containing ropes from which cannabis could be hung to dry. Beneath the ropes, was a plastic tarpaulin. There were cannabis remnants on the tarpaulin. Upstairs in the house, the accused showed police a cupboard in which 36 cannabis seedlings were being cultivated under lights. The 20 large plants and 36 seedings are the subject of the cultivation count. 5. In a tin within a kitchen cupboard, police found 19 g of cannabis and two ""bongs"". Inside a small freezer in the laundry, they found a ziplock bag containing 335.7g of frozen cannabis leaf. These two quantities of cannabis leaf are the subject of the ""deemed supply"" count.6. I set out the principles of law that I apply and the findings of fact that I make for the purpose of arriving at a verdict on the count of ""deemed supply"".Elements to be Proved by the Crown7. There was no dispute as to the elements of the offence that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt. They are that:(a) the accused was in possession of the substance in the tin and laundry freezer;(b) the substance was the prohibited drug cannabis leaf; and(c) the cannabis leaf weighed more than 300 g, the ""trafficable quantity"" for cannabis leaf.8. A person has possession of a substance if, at the relevant time, he or she intentionally has exclusive dominion or control over the substance, or has the ability to control it to the exclusion of others. The accused occupied the main bedroom of the house and there appeared to be no other permanent occupant (paras 50 and 51of Senior Constable Willard's statement). In evidence, the accused said that he grew cannabis leaf in the cupboard and under the house for personal use as he was a heavy cannabis user. He said that he stored a substantial quantity in the freezer in order to preserve it. Those facts satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt that the accused possessed all the cannabis located within and under his house in the sense that he intentionally exercised exclusive control over the cannabis.9. The analyst's certificate of Ms Debevec satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt that the substances located in the tin and the laundry freezer were cannabis leaf and that the combined weight of cannabis leaf was 354.7g (19g and 335.7g).Whether the Cannabis was for Personal Use10. The accused sought to satisfy the Court on the balance of probabilities that the cannabis leaf located in the kitchen and laundry was in his possession for a purpose otherwise than for supply, i.e. for personal use.11. As to the cannabis located in the tin, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that it was for personal use. It was a relatively small quantity. It was in a readily accessible location next to two ""bongs"".12. However, as to the cannabis located in the laundry freezer, I am not so satisfied.13. First, all the cannabis located at the premises must be taken into account. The accused was in possession of seedlings. It was his practice to identify the more productive female seedlings and cultivate them to full maturity under the house. Female seedlings were selected as they produced ""head"", the premium (more intoxicating) part of the plant. The cultivation system under the house had the capacity to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Next to the cultivation room, there was a drying area. The accused had travelled to Canberra to acquire appropriate equipment and had expended $1400 on the lighting alone. The accused conceded that the cannabis leaf in the laundry freezer derived from an earlier crop cultivated under the house. In other words, various areas of the house had been set up at considerable effort and expense to take a cannabis crop from seedling to high quality final product. The accused's assertion that that he cultivated only one crop a year lacks credibility.14. Second, in a hall stand police located $20,000 in a heat sealed plastic bag and $20,950 in $1000 bundles. The possession of a large quantity of cash is consistent with illegal activity. The accused asserted that part of the money derived from a large sum that his daughter paid to him in September 2001 for the purchase of a patent (Exhibit 1). I do not accept that the accused kept any cash proceeds of that transaction in his home for six years. The accused said that, while he was working as a baker up to November 2006 (when he sold his patisserie), he took cash drawings in $1000 lots and kept the cash at home. I do not accept that the accused kept large sums of legitimately acquired cash at home for almost 12 months. The risk of theft and financial imprudence of keeping large amounts of cash rather than investing it are obvious.15. Third, the accused's bank account into which the proceeds of sale of his patisserie business were ultimately deposited (contrary to the suggested propensity to keep legitimately acquired funds as cash) shows that, in the three-month period from 19 June to 19 September, the only withdrawals were monthly payments for pay TV and Internet access. There were no withdrawals from the account for other living expenses and no evidence of withdrawals from any other account. The accused was unemployed between November 2006 and October 2007. This circumstance is consistent with the accused earning income from an illegitimate source.16. Fourth, the accused maintained that he smoked 2-2.5 oz (56 - 60 g) of cannabis per week, in effect accounting for all the cannabis at his premises. He said that he smoked about 15 joints and a couple of ""bongs"" a day. Taking into account that the accused produced premium quality cannabis, the asserted consumption is prodigious, and I do not accept that it occurred.17. The accused argued that no indicia of supply were found at the house. I do not agree. Police located digital scales, re-sealable plastic bags and a heat sealer in the dining room cabinet (rather than the kitchen).18. Finally, the accused relied on the fact that the cannabis located in the laundry freezer was in one bag (rather than divided up for easy sale) and was frozen (hence not readily divided for sale). The manner in which the cannabis was held is neutral. It is not inconsistent with an intention to supply. There may have been an intention to supply at a later date or to make a bulk supply. 19. I am far from satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the cannabis located in the laundry freezer was for personal use. Verdict 20. I find the accused is guilty of count 2, ""deemed supply"".

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The five plaintiffs, Ian Campbell, Garry Campbell, Vivian Campbell, Brett Rotumah and Steven Rotumah, were prosecuted in the Local Court at Bega for a number of charges arising from events at Bermagui on the night of 7 October 2006 and the early hours of the following morning. Most of the charges were dismissed, but all five were convicted of affray and Brett Rotumah was also convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. All of them were placed on good behaviour bonds. 
     
      
    2 They have appealed to this Court against their convictions, pursuant to ss52 and 53 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. Section 52 provides for an appeal as of right on a ground that involves a question of law alone. Section 53 provides for an appeal by leave on a ground involving a question of fact or a question of mixed law and fact. The defendant, the Director of Public Prosecutions, did not prosecute the matter in the Local Court, but has taken over the conduct of the proceedings in this Court under s10 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986. 
     
      
    3 The grounds of appeal which were pursued at the hearing are to be found in a further amended summons filed on 31 January 2008. For the most part, they relate to the magistrate’s admission into evidence of transcripts of electronically recorded interviews by police with four of the plaintiffs. (The amended summons also seeks a declaration that those documents were inadmissible but, in the event, that relief would be of no utility and was not pressed.) The other grounds challenge the magistrate’s reasoning in finding the plaintiffs guilty of the charges to which I have referred and assert that the convictions are unsupportable. Whether the various grounds fall within ss52 and 53 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act is a matter to which I shall return. However, as to any grounds governed by s53, there was no issue that leave to appeal should be granted.4 There are seven grounds of appeal. The first five are concerned with the admission of the police interviews, while the last two are directed to the soundness of the convictions. It will be necessary to examine some of the evidence when dealing with those last two grounds. However, it is convenient to consider first the grounds relating to the admission of the police interviews. For that purpose, a bare outline of the facts is sufficient. 
     
      
    5 The plaintiffs are all Aboriginals. It was the prosecution case that, on the night of 7 October 2006, they had been drinking in a park next to the Bermagui bridge. They saw some racist graffiti written on the bridge and became upset. This was said to have led to violent incidents involving the plaintiffs and two white men, Aaron King and David Campbell (who, I take it, is no relation to the three plaintiffs of the same name). These incidents led to the charges the subject of this appeal. The affray of which all the plaintiffs were convicted related to the incident with David Campbell. The victim of the assault of which Brett Rotumah was found guilty was Aaron King. Other charges arising from these incidents were dismissed. 
     
      
    6 There was a third incident of violence in the small hours of the following morning, 8 October, when David Campbell, Aaron King and a group of other men went to the street in Bermagui where the plaintiffs lived, apparently bent on revenge. Further charges against the plaintiffs arising from this incident were also dismissed (although I was informed from the bar table that it led to both David Campbell and Aaron King being convicted of affray). 
     
      
       
      The interviews 
       
      
    7 The grounds relating to the admission of the police interviews are relied upon by all the plaintiffs except Vivian Campbell, who declined to be interviewed. The other four plaintiffs took part in electronically recorded interviews, in which each of them made relevant admissions. It is not necessary to set out these grounds of appeal. It is sufficient to say that their principal focus is the way in which the magistrate dealt with an issue under s138 of the Evidence Act. Other matters were argued, including his Honour’s approach to the question whether it would have been unfair to those plaintiffs, within the meaning of s90 of the Evidence Act, to admit the evidence. In the event, I find it unnecessary to decide those other matters 
     
      
    8 The transcripts of the interviews were admitted after an inquiry on the voire dire. The evidence disclosed that the interviewing officer, Snr Cst Barry, had arranged for the plaintiffs to attend the Bermagui police station. Ian Campbell, Steve Rotumah and Brett Rotumah attended some time after 6pm on the Sunday, 8 October 2006. Garry Campbell presented himself at about the same time on the Monday, 9 October. Upon their arrival, they were arrested and Snr Cst Barry referred them to the custody manager on duty for the purpose of procedures under Part 9 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (“LEPRA”). On the Sunday the custody manager was Sgt Flood, and on the Monday Snr Cst Crouden. 
     
      
    9 Section 109 of LEPRA explains that the objects of Part 9 are to authorise the detention of a person under arrest for the purposes of investigation and to provide for the rights of that person. It is not necessary to examine the other provisions of that Part in any detail. The rights of the detained person are set out in Division 3, and include such things as the obligation of the custody manager to administer the conventional caution and to allow the person to communicate with a lawyer. 
     
      
    10 Of more importance for present purposes are certain clauses of the Regulation made under the Act. Clause 24 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Regulation 2005 provides that certain persons should be categorised as “vulnerable”. Among those categories are “Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders”. Clause 27 entitles a vulnerable person to have a “support person” present during any investigative procedure in which he or she is to participate. Special provision for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders can be found in cl 33, and it is this provision which lies at the heart of the appeal. Clause 33(1) is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
        33(1) If a detained person is an Aboriginal person or Torres Strait Islander, then, unless the custody manager for the person is aware that the person has arranged for a legal practitioner to be present during questioning of the person, the custody manager must:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) immediately inform the person that a representative of the Aboriginal Legal Service (NSW/ACT) Limited will be notified:  
           
            
            (i) that the person is being detained in respect of an offence, and  
             
            (ii) of the place at which the person is being detained, and  
            
           
          (b) notify such a representative accordingly.  
          
         
        
       
      
    11 The custody manager dealing with each of the plaintiffs read to him a document entitled “Caution and Summary of Part 9 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (LEPRA)”, and gave him a copy of that document. Among other things, the document informed them of their right to silence and their right to seek legal advice. It also informed them of their right, as Aboriginals, to have a support person with them. However, it said nothing about the obligation of the custody manager under cl33.  
     
      
    12 The evidence was that all three police officers knew that the plaintiffs were Aboriginals. The officers were familiar with the LEPRA requirements, including cl33. The Aboriginal Legal Service in the relevant area was the South Eastern Aboriginal Legal Service, to which I shall refer as the “ALS”. It had been the practice of the custody managers to notify the ALS by fax if an Aboriginal person came into their custody, but his Honour found that none was sent on these occasions. In any event, to do so would have been a futile exercise. As the plaintiffs had attended the police station outside ordinary business hours, it was most unlikely that there would have been anyone at the ALS office. This also the police knew. 
     
      
    13 In the event, none of these plaintiffs had a lawyer present when interviewed or had access to a lawyer immediately before being interviewed. (Garry Campbell had his father with him as a support person during his interview, but nothing turns on this for present purposes.) His Honour found that cl33 had not been complied with, so that the plaintiffs were interviewed at a time when their custody was tainted by illegality. Accordingly, a question arose whether evidence of the interviews should be rejected pursuant to s138(1) of the Evidence Act 1995, on the basis that it had been obtained in contravention of an Australian law. That being so, it could not be admitted unless his Honour was satisfied that the desirability of doing so outweighed the undesirability of admitting it, given the way in which it had been obtained. In practical terms, then, it was for the prosecution to show that the evidence should be admitted notwithstanding the illegality attending it.  
     
      
    14 It was this balancing exercise which his Honour undertook, having regard to the relevant factors set out in s138(3). Putting aside cl33, he noted that the police had “sought to comply with the guidelines” given to them by the relevant legislation. In addition to the information conveyed to them about their rights, both orally and in writing, by the custody managers, his Honour noted that each of the plaintiffs had been cautioned at the outset of his interview. Thus, he found, it could not be said that the police ”deliberately went out of their way to cut corners and provide no assistance” to the plaintiffs concerning their rights “and the responsibilities the police had towards them”. 
     
      
    15 As to the breach of cl33, apart from finding that no fax had been sent to the ALS prior to any of the interviews, his Honour referred to the fact that that course would have been futile in the circumstances. Further, he found that sending faxes after hours had been “a general procedure” of the police, despite their knowledge that there would almost certainly be no response because a practice had developed that there was no ALS representative at the office after hours. 
     
      
    16 In the result, these four plaintiffs were interviewed without the ALS being notified of their being at the police station, and at a time when, realistically, no such notification was possible. His Honour referred to cl33 as a “mandatory provision” and conveyed a clear understanding of its purpose and significance. Nevertheless, he exercised his discretion to admit the evidence because he found that the LEPRA requirements had been met in other respects and because “there was no guarantee” that, if the interviews had been postponed to the following day, an ALS representative would have been available to attend the police station and speak to the plaintiffs. In my view, that last matter raises an important issue which did not receive the attention it deserved in evidence or in submissions on the voire dire. 
     
      
    17 The plaintiffs were represented in the Local Court by Mr King of counsel. He also appeared in this Court, assisted by Ms Behrendt as his junior. In cross-examination of one of the custody managers, Sgt Flood, he raised the possibility of adjourning the interviews to the following day during business hours. Sgt Flood said that he “could have told the arresting officer to cease the interview,” but added that “he’s the arresting officer.” The sergeant had a point. The interviewing officer, Snr Cst Barry had given evidence on the voire dire before Sgt Flood. The matter was not raised with him and, of course, it should have been. 
     
      
    18 To do so was as much the responsibility of the prosecutor as it was of Mr King. As I have said, for the purpose of the issue under s138 of the Evidence Act, it was the prosecution which bore the burden of satisfying the magistrate that the evidence should be admitted. From the fact that Snr Cst Barry had asked the plaintiffs to attend the police station voluntarily, and they had done so, it is reasonable to infer that he did not fear that any of them would attempt to evade arrest. Why they had to be arrested and interviewed on the evening they attended is not apparent. Whether or not there was good reason why those procedures could not have waited until the following day, and whether or not an ALS representative would have been available to assist them during ordinary business hours, were matters which were not explored in the evidence.  
     
      
    19 I should record that later in the proceedings, after his Honour had ruled on a submission that there was no case to answer, Mr King tendered a letter from a solicitor at the ALS which confirmed that no fax had been received from the police concerning the detention of any of these plaintiffs. It also asserted that a representative of the ALS would have attended a police station “during working hours” if requested to do so by any of them. It added that, if the ALS had been notified outside working hours of a request for a representative to attend during an interview, it would have asked the police to arrange for the interview during working hours and a representative would then have attended. At that stage of the proceedings, of course, the voire dire had been completed and his Honour had given his ruling. I do not think it appropriate for me to have regard to this evidence for present purposes. That said, it is reasonable to infer that any notification to the ALS made during business hours would have been received and that the attendance of a representative at the police station within a reasonable time could have been arranged.  
     
      
    20 The fact remains that the plaintiffs were interviewed at a time when cl33 had not been complied with and when, to the knowledge of the police, there could not have been effective compliance. No explanation was forthcoming on the evidence on the voire dire for the interviews being conducted at the time they were, rather than at another time when the requirements of cl33 could have been met. As the evidence stood, the failure to comply with the clause was deliberate, a relevant matter by virtue of s138(3)(e) of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    21 His Honour’s judgment on the voire dire does not deal with this issue, a fact which can fairly be attributed to the way in which the proceeding had been conducted. I am mindful that it is not appropriate to subject to detailed analysis the ex tempore reasons of a magistrate in a busy local court: Acuthan v Coates (1986) 6 NSWLR 472, per Kirby P at 478-9.  However, a crucial matter in the balancing exercise to be undertaken under s138 is the gravity of the contravention of the law which brought the section into play: subs 3(d). An important matter bearing upon the gravity of the contravention in the present case was not taken into account by his Honour. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the exercise of his discretion miscarried. 
     
      
    22 I should observe, in passing, that the obligation under cl33 is twofold: not only to notify the ALS that an Aboriginal person is in detention, but also to inform that person that the ALS will be notified. That additional requirement is itself an important safeguard, ensuring that the suspect is aware of the availability of legal assistance through that organisation. As I have earlier noted, the document summarising the LEPRA procedures which was furnished to the plaintiffs is silent about the requirements of cl33. This is not an issue which appears to have been raised at all on the voire dire in the present case and, of course, it is in no sense determinative of this appeal. 
     
      
       
      Remedy 
       
      
    23 It follows that the convictions of these four plaintiffs must be set aside. The recorded interviews were a significant part of the evidence against them. Indeed, in the absence of evidence of their interviews Ian Campbell, Garry Campbell and Steven Rotumah could not have been convicted. The question is whether their cases should be remitted to the Local Court for redetermination. Putting aside for a moment the other grounds of appeal raising the sufficiency of the evidence against them, that would be the normal course. It would be for his Honour to reconsider the admissibility of the interviews in the light of this judgment. 
     
      
    24 However, in the course of the hearing I raised with counsel the question whether, as a matter of discretion, the convictions could be set aside without remitter to the Local Court because of the penalties which have been imposed. As I have said, at the conclusion of the proceedings on 26 June 2007 all the plaintiffs were placed on good behaviour bonds. In Brett Rotumah’s case, the bond was for 2 years. For the other plaintiffs, the bond was only 9 months. On the face of it, Brett Rotumah has served more than half of his bond and the other plaintiffs’ bonds have expired. If that be so, a question arises whether the interests of justice would require that the cases of these plaintiffs be remitted for redetermination. 
     
      
    25 I am indebted to counsel for written submissions on this matter furnished after the hearing of the appeal. The starting point is s55(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        s 55(1) The Supreme Court may determine an appeal against conviction:  
         
          
          (a) by setting aside the conviction, or  
          (b) by setting aside the conviction and remitting the matter to the original Local Court for redetermination in accordance with the Supreme Court’s directions, or  
          (c) by dismissing the appeal. 
          
         
        
       
      
    26 Counsel for the defendant, Ms Adams, submitted that the plaintiffs’ bonds had not expired because, by operation of s63 of the Act, they had been stayed pending the outcome of the appeal. Alternatively, she argued that the power conferred by s55(1)(a) simply to set aside a conviction without remitter is not unfettered, and should be exercised only where it appears that the conviction cannot be supported on the evidence. 
     
      
    27 It is unnecessary to set out s63. It is sufficient to say that the effect of s63(2) is that, when an appeal is brought which does not require leave (under s52), the operation of any penalty is stayed once the appeal is lodged. However, where the appeal requires leave (under s53), the stay takes effect when leave is granted. In either event, by subs(3) the stay remains in force until the appeal is finally determined.  
     
      
    28 Here, as I have said, most of the grounds of appeal relate to the exercise of the magistrate’s discretion under ss138 and 90 of the Evidence Act. The remaining grounds assert that his Honour erred in ruling that there was a case to answer and that, on the evidence, the convictions are unsupportable. Ms Adams acknowledged that the last of those grounds involves a question of mixed fact and law. Otherwise, she argued that the grounds raise questions of law alone. She referred to the decision of Johnson J in Colosimo v Director of Public Prosecutions [2005] NSWSC 854, 64 NSWLR 654, in which his Honour referred at [41] to authority that the decision whether at the end of the prosecution case there is a prima facie case is a question of law.  
     
      
    29 For the purpose of a stay under s63, the issue is whether or not leave to appeal is required. By s52, on a question of law it is not. However, by s53(1) leave is required where the appeal involves a question of fact or of mixed law and fact, and by subs(3) it is also required where the appeal is brought against an interlocutory order. As counsel for the plaintiffs pointed out in written submissions, the decision whether there is a case to answer, while it may be a question of law, is clearly interlocutory. The other grounds of appeal concerning the exercise of the magistrate’s discretion in admitting the recorded interviews involve questions of mixed fact and law: Williams v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 278, per Gibbs CJ at 286-7 and Mason and Brennan JJ at 301-2. 
     
      
    30 Accordingly, all the grounds of appeal require leave. No stay under s63 would come into place until that leave is granted, which is yet to occur. In accordance with the usual practice, the question of leave and the merit of the appeal have been dealt with in the same proceeding. The plaintiffs’ bonds have not been stayed, so that those of all of them except of Brett Rotumah have expired and more than half of Brett Rotumah’s has been served. 
     
      
    31 I turn, then, to Ms Adams’ alternative submission that this Court should set aside a conviction without remitting the matter to the Local Court only if it is satisfied that the conviction is not supported by the evidence. For the purpose of that argument, I shall assume that the evidence against these four plaintiffs is sufficient to sustain their convictions. As is well known, there are a variety of circumstances in which the Court of Criminal Appeal might set aside a conviction on indictment and enter a verdict of acquittal, rather than order a new trial, even though the evidence appears to be capable of supporting a finding of guilt. Is such a discretion available to this Court in a case such as this? 
     
      
    32 Ms Adams referred to Mitchell v Nestle Australia Ltd (1988) 36 A Crim R 119, an appeal from the decision of Hunt J (as he then was) in a stated case under Part 5 of the Justices Act 1902 (since repealed). The proceedings in this Court had been brought by the unsuccessful informant in a summary prosecution. Hunt J had decided the question of law in favour of the prosecution but, for discretionary reasons, declined to remit the matter to the magistrate and terminated the proceedings. On appeal, it was held that his Honour had erred in taking that course. 
     
      
    33 The power of this Court upon a stated case was to be found in s106 of the Act, the relevant part of which provided: 
     
      
       
        
        The Court shall hear and determine the question or questions of law arising on such case; and shall -  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) reverse, affirm, or amend the determination in respect of which the case was stated; or 
           
           
          (b) remit the matter to the Justice or Justices with the opinion of the Court thereon; or 
           
           
          (c) make such other order in relation to the matter as seems fit. 
          
         
        
       
      
    34 Kirby P, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, said (at 125): 
     
      
       
        
        The authority of Parliament and of this Court require that, in normal cases, the matter should be remitted to the Local Court with the expression of opinion of the Supreme Court on the stated case. This is because of the use of the affirmative word “shall”. But it is also to be derived from the proper relationship of the Supreme Court with the Local Court in stated case procedures. However, that leaves the wide discretion conferred by the closing words. 
        
       
       
      His Honour went on to observe that the exercise of discretion might be interfered with on appeal only if error were shown. In the event, the Court found error in Hunt J’s approach in the light of the legislation under which the prosecution had been brought.  
       
      
    35 The passage quoted from Kirby P’s judgment was referred to by Studdert J in Downes v DPP [2000] NSWSC 1054. That was an appeal against summary convictions under the predecessor to the current legislation, a new Part 5 of the Justices Act, inserted in 1998. That part provided for appeals to this Court, as of right or by leave, relevantly similar to the provisions under which the present appeal is brought. The power of the Court in determining appeals was to be found in s109, which provided: 
     
      
       
        
        The Supreme Court may, after hearing an appeal, determine the appeal by dismissing the appeal or by doing any one or more of the following:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) confirming, quashing, setting aside or varying the conviction, order or sentence appealed against or any part of it,  
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) increasing or reducing the sentence appealed against,  
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (c) making such other orders as it thinks just,  
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (d) remitting the matter to the Magistrate who made the conviction or order, or imposed the sentence, to hear and determine the matter of the appeal. 
          
         
        
       
      
    36 The appeal in that case succeeded. However, Studdert J rejected a submission for the appellant that he should dismiss the charges, and determined that the matter should be remitted: see his Honour’s judgment at [31-32]. 
     
      
    37 In another case under that legislation, Greg James J adopted the same approach: Suthers v Director of Public Prosecutions [2003] NSWSC 570. His Honour referred to the discretion sometimes exercised by the Court of Criminal Appeal, but observed that the structure of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 was different from Part 5 of the Justices Act. At [28], he said that the “concept underlying” the relevant provisions of the Criminal Appeal Act “favours an order of acquittal unless a new trial is a more adequate remedy, and that concept does not inform or underlie the construction of the Justices Act 1902 provisions”. However, his Honour added that, although he was not persuaded that he should approach s109(c) of the Justices Act as if he were applying the provisions of the Criminal Appeal Act, he “might apply similarly the same policies”. By that, I take it, his Honour was referring to the jurisprudence concerning the exercise of the discretion by the Court of Criminal Appeal to be found in some familiar High Court decisions to which he referred in his judgment at [24]-[25]. 
     
      
    38 Ms Adams also cited two decisions of Johnson J under the current legislation, both of them appeals by the Director of Public Prosecutions under s56 against the dismissal of charges in summary proceedings. By s59(2), this Court may determine such an appeal:  
     
      
       
        
        (a) by setting aside the order and making such other order as it thinks just, or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) by dismissing the appeal. 
        
       
      
    39 In Lake Macquarie City Council v Morris [2005] NSWSC 387, 63 NSWLR 263, his Honour found error of law by the magistrate and determined that the matter should be remitted to the Local Court. He said at [65] that such an approach “is consistent with the proper relationship between the Supreme Court and the Local Court in statutory appeals with respect to criminal matters”, citing Mitchell v Nestle Australia and Downes. However, it does not appear that in that case his Honour was asked to take any other course.  
     
      
    40 In Director of Public Prosecutions v Belani  [2005] NSWSC 1013, 64 NSWLR 319, having again allowed the appeal, his Honour rejected a submission that the matters at hand “should be brought to an end in this Court”. He took the view that the proper approach was to remit the matters to the Local Court, citing the same passage from Lake Macquarie City Council v Morris: see the judgment at [66]-[68].  
     
      
    41 It is to be noted that Mitchell v Nestle Australia related to a stated case under the Justices Act prior to its amendment. Notwithstanding the plenary terms of s106 of the Act considered in that case, the stated case procedure, founded upon this Court’s supervisory jurisdiction over magistrates, was significantly different from the modern appellate procedure in the present case. Moreover, those proceedings were in the nature of an appeal by the prosecutor against the dismissal of a charge and, where such an appeal is allowed, one would expect it to be unusual for a residual discretion to be exercised against remitting the matter to the Local Court. The two decisions of Johnson J to which I have referred, of course, were also successful prosecution appeals. 
     
      
    42 Most importantly, the quoted passage from the judgment of Kirby P in Mitchell v Nestle Australia affirms the residual discretion. It does no more than remind us that the exercise of that discretion should be approached with an eye to “the proper relationship of the Supreme Court with the Local Court …”. What was said by Studdert J in Downes and Greg James J in Suthers should be understood in the same way, as should the observations of Johnson J. The actual outcome in all those cases, of course, turned upon the facts and circumstances of each of them. 
     
      
    43 The present case is concerned with events which took place in October 2006. No custodial order was made against any of the plaintiffs. Ian Campbell, Garry Campbell and Steven Rotumah have undergone the whole of the penalty imposed upon them, and Brett Rotumah has undergone a substantial portion of his. Section 55 confers upon me a discretion to set aside their convictions without remitting the matters to the Local Court and, in all the circumstances, I am satisfied that that discretion should be exercised in their favour.  
     
      
       
      Vivian Campbell 
       
      
    44 Let me turn, then, to the appeal of the remaining plaintiff, Vivian Campbell. As the argument developed, her appeal turns upon whether her conviction is supported by the evidence. As I have said, unlike the other plaintiffs, she declined to be interviewed. Accordingly, her conviction is founded upon the evidence of the complainant in the affray, David Campbell, although there is some other evidence to which I shall refer. Like the other plaintiffs, she did not give evidence. 
     
      
    45 David Campbell’s evidence was that he walked to the vicinity of the Bermagui bridge after leaving a club, at which he had had a considerable amount to drink. He was confronted by a group of five people, of whom he recognised Vivian Campbell and Brett Rotumah. They were yelling at him and he “got hit by something”. It happened quickly and he could not see who had hit him. He fell to the ground, and was punched and kicked “for a second”, whereupon he got up and ran away. 
     
      
    46 He gave evidence that he was injured, suffering bruising to his left eye, grazing around his nose, swelling to the left side of his face, and bruising to his arms and legs. He denied having suffered injuries of that kind after the incident at the bridge. It was upon this issue that his Honour had regard to other evidence in arriving at his decision. On the one hand, Mr and Mrs Campbell senior, the parents of Garry and Ian Campbell, gave evidence of seeing David Campbell in the course of the third incident in the small hours of the Sunday morning, and said that they saw no injuries to him. On the other hand, there is evidence from three witnesses that they did observe the injuries he complained of at a time before that third incident. These were his brother, Donald Campbell, Sam Wetzler and Brendon Matters. His Honour concluded that David Campbell had suffered those injuries during the incident at the bridge which he described. 
     
      
    47 Accepting that to be so, the question remains whether Vivian Campbell played a part in that incident which made her a participant in the affray charged. David Campbell may well have seen her with the group, but the crucial question is whether she joined them in inflicting violence upon him. This turned entirely upon his evidence. I appreciate the undoubted advantage enjoyed by his Honour having observed him as a witness: cf M v The Queen  (1994) 181 CLR 487. Nevertheless, two matters bearing upon his accuracy and truthfulness give me cause for concern about his evidence as the foundation for this plaintiff’s conviction. 
     
      
    48 The first is his capacity for accurate observation in the circumstances, given that he had drunk a substantial amount of alcohol and that, on his own account, the incident occurred very quickly. The second is a spirited and, I would have thought, effective attack upon his credibility in cross-examination. Put shortly, despite his reasonably clear and concise account of the incident at the bridge, he claimed to have no memory of the incident the following morning. He maintained that claim notwithstanding evidence, which his Honour accepted, that he was one of a group who went to the relevant street at that time, bent on revenge, and that he was armed with a makeshift weapon. The only explanation he could offer for his lack of memory was that he had been “bashed pretty hard and was knocked out” during the incident at the bridge. This is hardly convincing. No doubt, he had a motive to lie about the events of the Sunday morning. 
     
      
    49 I have given this ground of appeal anxious consideration, recognising the primacy of his Honour as the finder of fact and the advantage he had of seeing and hearing the witnesses. Nevertheless, for the reasons I have expressed, I am left with a sense of real unease about this conviction. In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that his Honour ought to have had a reasonable doubt about this charge. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    50 Accordingly, in each case leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed. Pursuant to s55(1)(a) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, I set aside the convictions recorded against each of the plaintiffs. I shall consult the parties about whether any consequential order should be made and, if necessary, hear argument on costs.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant pleaded guilty to four counts of supplying a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The drugs were supplied over the period 11 March 2005 to 30 June 2005. The first count involved the supply of 3,4 methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA) in an amount of 1,680 grams being an amount not less than a large commercial quantity. The maximum penalty for this count was life imprisonment and/or a fine of $550,000. There is a standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    2 Count 2 involved an amount of 381.3 grams of amphetamine being an amount not less than the commercial quantity. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 20 years and/or a fine of $350,000. The third count was a deemed supply of 3, 4 MDMA concerned with an amount of 225 grams. The fourth count, again deemed supply but of amphetamine involved the amount of 301.29 grams. The relevant standard non-parole period for each of counts 2, 3 and 4 was 10 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    3 There were 3 further charges which were taken into account on a Form 1 in relation to count 1 which included one charge of having goods in custody, one charge of deemed supply of 100 ecstasy tablets and another of deemed supply of 68.35 grams of methylamphetamine. 
     
      
    4 The applicant was sentenced in respect of counts 2, 3 and 4 to concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment of 7 years and 6 months. With respect to count 1, taking into account the matters on a Form 1 the sentencing judge imposed a non-parole period of 10 years with a total term of imprisonment of 17 years. The sentencing judge provided that the sentences for counts 2, 3 and 4 were wholly subsumed within the sentence in respect of count 1. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against his sentence. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    5 The Crown has provided an appropriate summary of the relevant facts. 
     
      
       
        
        “The applicant was involved for more than three months in the supply of 7,720 tablets of 3,4 methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA) at 0.25 grams per tablet. The total weight of the drug was 1,930 grams which, at $30 per tablet, had an estimated street value of $231,000. In addition the applicant was involved in the supply of 750.94 grams of amphetamine, which are $50 per 0.01 grams had a street value of $375,470. 
        
       
       
        
        In total, the telephone intercept evidence disclosed that between 16 March 2005 and 28 June 2005 the applicant supplied 3,4 methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA) on 23 separate occasions and amphetamine on 13 separate occasions. 
        
       
       
        
        Further, 100 tablets of 3,4 methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA) were located in the applicant’s vehicle on arrest and 900 tablets of 3,4 methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA) were located in his premises upon search by police. Police also found 380.09 grams of amphetamine in his premises and a (smaller) quantity of methylamphetamine. 
        
       
       
        
        During March 2005, the Tuggerah Lakes Drug Unit commenced an investigation into the supply prohibited drugs by the applicant who was born on 29 September 1981, his de facto Stacey Marie McDonald, and Brendan Brian Wardell. 
        
       
       
        
        During the course of this investigation a number of lawfully obtained telephone intercept warrants were obtained and conversations monitored in relation to these telephone warrants. These conversations had been corroborated to some extent by surveillance conducted on the applicant and exhibits later seized by investigators following the execution of search warrants. 
        
       
       
        
        On 11 March 2005, a lawfully obtained telephone intercept was placed on a mobile phone. That mobile phone was used by the applicant. 
        
       
       
        
        The quantity of MDMA actually supplied by the applicant was 1,680 grams. The large commercial quantity applicable to MDMA is 500 grams. The applicant also actually supplied a total quantity of 381.3 grams of amphetamine. The commercial quantity applicable to amphetamine is 500 grams. 
        
       
       
        
        The intercepted telephone conversations were characterised by the use of drug codes, such as ‘palm trees’, ‘cheapies’ (MDMA tablets of a cheaper quality), ‘lady’ (one ounce or 28.4 grams of amphetamine), ‘butterflies’ (MDMA tables bearing a butterfly logo), ‘HSV’s’, ‘slut’ (an ounce or 28.4 grams of amphetamine), ‘eight balls’ (one eight of an ounce of 3.55 grams of amphetamine), ‘one in a bag’ (an ounce of amphetamine and 100 MDMA tables) and ‘apples’ and ‘trees’ (MDMA tablets bearing those logos). The drugs were to be on-supplied by the various purchasers. 
        
       
       
        
        Search warrants were executed on 30 June 2005 by police on the applicant’s premises at 136 Woodbury Park Drive, Mardi. In the main bedroom of the house police located a resealable plastic bag containing a quantity of white tablets believed to be MDMA. When later weighted the bag and tablets weighed 20.8 grams. In the master bedroom shared by the applicant and Stacey McDonald police located a large wooden shoe or blanket box. Inside the base of the box police located eight resealable bags containing MDMA tablets, each bag weighed between 32.8 grams and 34.9 grams. The contents of one bag was counted and contained 100 tablets. Each bag contained 100 tablets. On a kitchen bench police located a resealable plastic bag containing pink tablets and powder believed to be MDMA. When weighed, the bag, pink tablets and powder was found to weigh 3.5 grams. The total weight of the drugs found when analysed was 223.20 grams. 
        
       
       
        
        On 30 June 2005 police went with officers from the New South Wales Crimes Commission to a factory unit leased by the applicant at Johnson Square, Unit 9, 9-11 Johnson Road, Tuggerah for the purpose of seizing a number of motor vehicles which were said to have been purchased with the proceeds of the applicant’s drug dealing. There was a small bar fridge in which two shopping bags were found to contain eleven plastic resealable bags each of which contained a quantity of white powder. That powder was later found to weigh 301.29 grams. The drugs were to be supplied in accordance with telephone calls of 27 June 2005. 
        
       
       
        
        The three charges taken into account on sentence, contained on a Form 1 schedule, arise from the execution of a search warrant upon the applicant’s home on 30 June 2005. In the freezer in the kitchen of the premises police located a resealable plastic bag containing a white block substance believed to be amphetamine. When later weighed the bag and the white block substance weighed was found to be 29.8 grams. In the fridge police located a number of resealable plastic bags containing methylamphetamine, weighing in total 50.3 grams. 
        
       
       
        
        On a kitchen bench of the premises police located a number of items, including bags of methylamphetamine which, when analysed weighed 68.35 grams. In the master bedroom in the house, in the wooden shoe or blanket box, in which the police found prohibited drugs, police located an amount of cash totalling $24,540. The cash was the proceeds of the applicant’s involvement in supplying prohibited drugs. 
        
       
       
        
        At 7.30 am on 30 June 2005, the applicant was stopped by police whilst driving at Mardi. Police from the Tuggerah Lakes Drug Unit attended and placed the applicant under arrest in relation to a number of drug supply matters. The applicant’s detention, arrest and caution was recorded on an in car video system of the Highway Patrol car. He was asked if there was anything in the car which should not be there, he indicated there was a quantity of pills and a bag in the car. Police located 100 MDMA pills in a small resealable bag in a backpack on the passenger’s seat floor of the vehicle. The applicant stated that they were for his own use. Also in the car police located four mobile phones. The phones were the ones used by the applicant in the supply of prohibited drugs. He declined to be interviewed.” 
        
       
       
      The remarks of the sentencing judge 
       
      
    6 Although the applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing her Honour found that he was truly remorseful and contrite. Her Honour afforded the applicant a discount of 25% by reason of his guilty plea at the earliest opportunity.  
     
      
    7 The applicant had no previous criminal history. Her Honour said of that aspect of the matter: 
     
      
       
        
        “Those who choose to make significant profits from trafficking in drugs are often people of otherwise good character. Their good character is something they rely upon to avoid detection. It is often that the lack of criminal antecedents will deflect the police attention away from them and onto others who are known to mix in the criminal milieu.” 
        
       
      
    8 Her Honour found that the applicant was engaged in a sophisticated operation. She concluded that he had access to significant supplies and was wiling to provide significant supplies to others. Her Honour found that the criminality of the applicant in relation to count 1 fell “well within the mid-range of objective seriousness.” The purport of this finding is not clear. Although it is undoubted that the applicant’s offending was at least within the mid-range of objective seriousness her Honour may have intended to indicate that it fell above the mid-range. Such a finding would have been open. 
     
      
    9 Her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “These are offences committed without regard for public safety involving significant planning on his part and were part of planned and organised criminal activity.” 
        
       
      
    10 The sentencing judge found that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation and found special circumstances to allow for a lengthy supervised period on parole to minimise the risk of relapse both in terms of drug and alcohol abuse and re-offending. Although the applicant’s early life was marked by disharmony between his parents his subjective circumstances could neither explain or justify his serious level of offending. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    11 The applicant contends that the sentencing judge made three errors which have the consequence that the sentences imposed were excessive. Even if there were merit in the submissions in my judgment the application must ultimately fail.  
     
      
    12 The effect of her Honour’s sentences is that the applicant has received no effective penalty for any of counts 2, 3 and 4. Each of those counts was itself a serious offences carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years. By wholly subsuming the sentences in the sentence for count 1 the applicant has received a benefit which I am satisfied is greater than any adverse consequence flowing from the matters complained of. 
     
      
    13 The applicant’s first complaint was the finding by her Honour that the offences were committed without regard to public safety. It was submitted that this is a characteristic of a drug supply offence. Her Honour commented that by conducting his drug supplying activities from his home he exposed his children to illicit substances and the presence of undesirable characters coming to collect their orders. The respondent submitted her Honour’s reference to this issue should be understood as a reference to s 21A(2)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I am not satisfied that this is the case. It was of the essence of the offence that it was committed without regard for public safety and it was inevitable that her Honour would refer to the matter. However, there is no indication that her Honour impermissibly had regard to it as a matter of aggravation. 
     
      
    14 It was further submitted that her Honour erred in treating as an aggravating factor that the offence was committed as part of a planned and organised criminal activity. It was again submitted that this should be understood as a reference to s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and in particular to factor (n). It was submitted that because a degree of planning is inherent in the possession of a large quantity of drugs for the purpose of supply, her Honour erred by having regard to it as a matter of aggravation. 
     
      
    15 I do not think this submission can be accepted. Her Honour commented that the offences were committed as part of an organised criminal activity which was clearly the case. That finding was inevitable. There is nothing in her Honour’s remarks to indicate that her Honour impermissibly had regard to it as a matter of aggravation. 
     
      
    16 The third submission was to the effect that her Honour had erroneously failed to give the applicant the benefit of her Honour’s finding of good character. The applicant emphasised the remarks of McHugh J in Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21; (2001) 206 CLR 267 at 275 where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If an offender is of otherwise good character, then the sentencing judge is  
        bound 
         to take that into account in the sentence that he or she imposes.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    17 McHugh J went on to say that the weight to be given to good character will vary according to all of the circumstances. This Court has said on many occasions that the weight to be ascribed to a clean record in drug cases is less than in other types of offending. This is because, as the sentencing judge correctly identified, the lack of a previous record is common in drug supply offences where sophisticated organisation and planning is not uncommon. Although the low level operator may be readily detected, the principals for those in the middle management of the operation may be difficult to identify. 
     
      
    18 It may be that her Honour should be understood as having ignored the applicant’s prior good character, although this is not clearly the case. Her Honour did correctly identify that good character is of less significance in drug cases. In the circumstances of this case if her Honour impermissibly put this issue to one side it has not occasioned an injustice requiring the intervention of this Court.  
     
      
    19 The final submission made by the applicant was that her Honour had overvalued the seriousness of the matters in the Form 1. The applicant’s analysis of the sentence, which I accept, was that her Honour had increased the total sentence for count 1 from a term of 15 years to that of 17 years, an increase of 2 years by reason of the matters on the Form 1. 
     
      
    20 The matters on the Form 1 included the deemed supply of 100 ecstasy tablets, 68.35 grams of methylamphetamine and $24,540 in cash suspected of being stolen. The offence of goods in custody contrary to s 527C of the Crimes Act 1900 carries a maximum sentence of 6 months imprisonment. It was submitted that this modest maximum sentence and the relatively small quantity of drugs involved in the other matters made an increase of 2 years by the inclusion of these matters on the Form 1 excessive. 
     
      
    21 I am satisfied that this submission should be accepted. 
     
      
    22 The appropriate approach by a sentencing court to matters included on a Form 1 has been authoritatively considered by this Court. In Attorney-General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 at [66] Spigelman CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The effect of inclusion on a Form 1 is to give the offences so included a significant lower salience in the sentencing process. There will be an obvious advantage, and hence a greater incentive to admit guilt, where the Form 1 procedure is employed.” 
        
       
      
    23 Although the goods in custody offence was relatively minor the drug matters were more serious and if the applicant was being separately sentenced for each of these offences a total head sentence of 2 years may not have been excessive. However, when included on a Form 1 a 2 year term was outside the appropriate range. 
     
      
       
      Should this Court intervene? 
       
      
    24 Notwithstanding that an error has occurred in relation to the consideration of the matters on the Form 1 I am not satisfied that this Court should intervene to reduce the applicant’s sentence. As I have identified count 1 had a standard non-parole period of 15 years. Although by reason of the applicant’s plea of guilty the significance of the standard non-parole period was diminished a total non-parole period for all of the offences of 10 years was in the circumstances lenient. Counts 2, 3 and 4 each carried a standard non-parole period of 10 years imprisonment. Each was a separate offence in which a significant quantity of the relevant drug was supplied. The total weight of MDMA supplied was 1,930 grams. The total supply of amphetamines was 750.94 grams. Furthermore, it would appear that her Honour paid no regard to the Form 1 matters when determining the non-parole period. 
     
      
    25 Similar considerations are relevant to the head sentence. The multiple and serious counts to which the applicant pleaded guilty should not have been dealt with by the imposition of a single term of imprisonment. Notwithstanding considerations of totality the applicant’s offending should have been marked out with a portion of his sentence expressly related to counts 2, 3 and 4. This would inevitably have extended the total term beyond 15 years and probably beyond 17 years.  
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    26 In these circumstances I am not satisfied that either in respect of the non-parole period or the total sentence a less severe sentence is warranted in law (s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912). Although I would grant leave to appeal I would dismiss the appeal.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: The appellant was tried before his Honour Sorby DCJ and a jury from 21 February 2007 to 1 March 2007 upon the following two counts:  
     
      
      (1) On 21 November 2004 he did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant] without consent knowing that he was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation, namely that immediately before he maliciously inflicted actual bodily harm on [the complainant] (contrary to s 61J(i)  
      Crimes Act 
       1900); and  
      (2) On 21 November 2004 he did maliciously damage the property of [the complainant], namely a statue (contrary to s 195(a) Crimes Act 1900).  
      
    2 The appellant was convicted on both counts; and he was sentenced on the aggravated sexual assault matter to imprisonment for a period of eight and half years with a non-parole period of six years, and on the malicious damage matter for a period of twelve months, to be served concurrently.  
     
      
    3 The appellant appeals against his conviction.  
     
      
       
      Crown case  
      
    4 The Crown case consisted primarily of the evidence of the complainant, which was to the following effect:  
     
      
      (1) The complainant was a 55 year old man. On Sunday 21 November 2004 he was at the Oxford Hotel at Darlinghurst having a few beers with a friend TS. At about 8.15 pm another friend TL arrived and they played pool and drank beer. There he also met the appellant, with whom he had had casual sexual contact in 1988 and 2001. By about 10 pm TS and TL had left the hotel, and the complainant asked the appellant back to his unit for a joint.  
      (2) Then the complainant and the appellant took a taxi to the complainant’s unit at Woolloomooloo, where they shared a joint and had a fill-in conversation on what had happened since they last met. The complainant went to the toilet.  
      (3) When the complainant came out of the toilet, the appellant was holding a hammer belonging to the complainant. The appellant then hit the complainant in the cheekbone with the handle, and said, “get down or I’ll kill you”. The complainant sat down, and the appellant said that “you’re a black fella who doesn’t go with black fellas”; that he had offered $1,000 to TS and $3,000 to TL and they didn’t want him; and that the complainant was keeping white boys for himself. The appellant struck him with his fist on his right ear, and said, “I’ll kill you”.  
      (4) The appellant then upended a table in the room so that porcelain statues fell off and shattered. He then saw a life-size styrofoam statue of Napoleon in the complainant’s room and said, “What are you doing with that?” And went over saying words including “Captain Cook” and “occupation”, and he smashed at the statue with a hammer, threw it over and jumped on it, causing it to break into three pieces.  
      (5) The appellant then said to the complainant “take your clothes off”, the complainant asked why, and the appellant hit him on the elbow with the hammer really hard. The complainant removed his clothing because he thought that otherwise the appellant would kill him. The appellant then looped a belt of the complainant, reefed it around his neck and his left arm, dragged the complainant to the settee, and said, “get on your back”. The complainant did this and said “What are you doing?” and the appellant then hit him above his left eyebrow and again on his cheek.  
      (6) The appellant then said “I’m going to show you what a black fella does” and said “get your legs up”, and hit him on the Achilles tendon; and when the complainant’s legs were up, the appellant hit the complainant on the buttocks and testicles with the belt (which had broken) and pushed the handle of the hammer into his anus, to the extent of about 8 to 10 inches. He then pulled it out and licked the complainant’s sphincter.  
      (7) The appellant then said “You can put your legs down and let me help you tidy up”, to which the complainant said “You put me in fear of my life please just go”. The appellant then went to the door, opened it, and said in a little boy’s voice “You won’t tell anybody will you, you won’t tell”, and left. This was shortly before midnight.  
      (8) The complainant sent a text message to a lady friend VS to the effect that he could not meet her the next day, and then lay on the floor, where he remained until the Tuesday afternoon, apart from getting up when VS and her sister RS came to the unit at 7.15am on the Monday. On that occasion, they were there for about 10 minutes, and the complainant said to them that somebody bashed him.  
      (9) The complainant did not speak to anyone again until VS came to the unit about 2pm on the Thursday, when the complainant told her what the appellant had done in detail, including what he had done with the hammer.  
      (10) At about quarter to six the same day, a friend ML came to the unit, and the complainant told him he had been bashed and raped with a hammer. ML took the complainant to Sydney Hospital, where he was examined by Dr Leaf.  
      (11) On the Friday, the complainant went to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, spoke to a counsellor at the sexual assault unit, and then went to the police.  
      (12) The complainant in 2005 participated in telephone conversations with the appellant, recorded by the police pursuant to a telephone interface warrant, these conversations occurring on 23 March 2005 (twice), 5 April 2005 and 13 April 2005.  
      
    5 Evidence was given by TS and TL of events at the hotel on the Sunday, including evidence from each that the appellant had offered money to have sex with them. TL also gave evidence that he went to the complainant’s flat on the Tuesday or Wednesday, and when the complainant said he had been sexually assaulted by the appellant with a hammer.  
     
      
    6 VS gave evidence of receipt of a text message at 12.22am on the Monday “Hi Darls, will have to cancel 2M [tomorrow] that is unless you all can bear to see what a mate has done to me and my home. Not a good look either but then OK XXX”. VS and RS visited the complainant at about 7.30 or 8am on the Monday, and found him in shock and shaking. VS said she next saw the complainant on the Tuesday at 1pm or 2pm; when the complainant said he had been raped by a friend, that he had used a hammer and a belt, and had him over the bed.  
     
      
    7 RS gave evidence that she had visited the complainant with VS on the Monday morning, and that the complainant was shaken up and had bruising; and that they’d returned to see him in the afternoon of the same day.  
     
      
    8 ML gave evidence that he took the complainant to Sydney Hospital. Dr Leaf gave evidence that the complainant told him he had been assaulted, giving an account which included that a hammer had been inserted into his rectum, and that this was non-consensual. Dr Leaf’s anal examination of the complainant was “unremarkable”, and there were no tears or bruising.  
     
      
    9 Dr Patricia Brennan, a forensic specialist, gave evidence that Dr Leaf’s findings did not preclude penetration by the hammer handle, as described by the complainant.  
     
      
    10 Ms Sharon Neville, forensic biologist, gave evidence that the DNA profile of the major contributor to the lower 11 centimetres of the hammer handle was the complainant’s, while the appellant could not be excluded as a minor contributor; and that the mixture of DNA on the hammer head matched the DNA profiles of both the complainant and the appellant.  
     
      
    11 There was evidence from police officers as to monitored telephone calls, a conversation with the appellant at the time of his arrest and a record of interview with the appellant.  
     
      
    12 There were transcripts of the telephone calls in evidence. The first telephone call included the following exchanges (V.1 is the appellant and V.2 is the complainant):  
     
      
       
        
        V.1 Well I thought it was a, I thought it was a mutual thing and that’s what you wanted.  
         
         
        V.2 What, for you to smash me around with a hammer and stick it up my arse? Are you kidding?  
         
         
        V.1 No, I didn’t smash you around with it. I thought that’s what you wanted me to do, so that’s what I did. And I wouldn’t … 
         
         
        ……… 
         
         
        V.1 I’ve got no idea of why you wanted me to do it. You told me you wanted me to do it.  
         
         
        V.2 Do what?  
         
         
        V.1 Put that thing up you with the hammer on it, I dunno. You’re confusin’ me, mate. Look, just leave it alone, I, where would you like this go? Do you wanna have a, have a coffee or somethin’?  
        
       
      
    13 The second telephone call included the following exchanges:  
     
      
       
        
        V.1 Yeah, well neither could I, I was quite surprised at you wanted me to do, myself. So I did what you wanted me to do and then - - -  
         
         
        V.2 Well I didn’t really want you to stick a hammer up my arse.  
         
         
        V.1 Well mate, you didn’t show much resistance, that’s what you wanted.  
         
         
        V.2 What, much resistance with a belt around my neck.  
         
         
        V.1 Well listen, are you O.K?  
         
         
        ……… 
         
         
        V.2 Yeah, a bit. You know, I still wanna know why it happened?  
         
         
        V.1 Well I don’t know why, I, I’m just, I’m tellin’ you know I thought that’s what you wanted, that’s what, well I was pissed out of my brains.  
        
       
      
    14 In a conversation with police at the time of his arrest, on 14 April 2005, the appellant referred to “S and M” and said he was “real drunk”, and also said this:  
     
      
       
        
        I don’t remember hitting somebody a, oh, I might have, I remember his legs were in the air and he goes ‘go on, do it, do it, do it for me’. So and I, I said, ‘look, I can’t, mate,’ and I pushed it up a little bit, that’s when I took off. I didn’t lick his bottom or anything like that … 
        
       
      
    15 In his record of interview with police later on 14 April 2005, the appellant denied that he had assaulted the complainant physically or that he had inserted the hammer into the complainant’s anus or licked the complainant’s anus, or that he had deliberately hit the statue of Napoleon, although he said that he may have knocked the statue over as he left the complainant’s unit. The appellant said that he remembered the complainant rubbing the handle of the hammer and that he asked the appellant to get on his knees and asked him, “can you see anything going in?”, and the appellant told police that he did not touch the hammer or lick the complainant’s bottom. The appellant said that he and the complainant “had some smoke and, and he had some trips and other stuff there on his little coffee table … and he had the bottle amyl nitrate … whereas I only have the amyl nitrate if I’m having anal sex … I can’t remember if we actually had, if I had done fellatio on him or not. I dunno if, I can’t remember if we had, if we actually touched or anything like that, I remember cuddling, remember have a few cones … from the bong with him …”  
     
      
       
      Appellant’s case  
      
    16 The appellant did not give evidence and no witnesses were called on his behalf.  
     
      
    17 The following propositions were put to the complainant in cross-examination:  
     
      
      (1) That the complainant invited the appellant back to his unit for some brief casual sex;  
      (2) That there had been discussion at the Oxford Hotel between the appellant and the complainant about “S and M” and that this was “S and M” gone wrong;  
      (3) There was discussion between the complainant and the appellant about dominant or passive roles, and about amyl nitrate and amphetamines;  
      (4) That the complainant asked the appellant to take his clothes off so that he could admire the appellant’s body, and that they cuddled;  
      (5) That the complainant took hold of the hammer and rolled it around his own thigh area, and that there was discussion on dominant or passive roles, in which the complainant suggested to the appellant that the complainant wanted the hammer involved in the sexual encounter;  
      (6) That there was further conversation between them about the statue of Napoleon in which the complainant became upset and offended and asked the appellant if he was into the dominant role;  
      (7) That the complainant asked the appellant to get on to his knees whilst the complainant was holding the hammer near his own anal area and that he asked the appellant “can you see anything going in?”;  
      (8) That at some stage the appellant went towards the door as if to leave, that there was some yelling and the complainant told the appellant “you fuck off” and at that point the appellant turned round while the complainant was sitting with the hammer between his legs, motioning towards his own anal area with the hammer.  
      (9) That the appellant then headed back towards him and pulled the hammer away from him and threw it away;  
      (10) That as the appellant was coming towards him, that this was when the statue of Napoleon was knocked over; and  
      (11) That the complainant had inserted the hammer into his own anus.  
      
    18 The complainant denied these propositions.  
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal  
      
    19 The appellant relies on the following grounds of appeal:  
     
      
       
        
        1. The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury in accordance with s 165(1)(c)  
        Evidence Act 
         1995 with respect to the complainant’s ingestion of alcohol and marijuana.  
         
         
        2. The jury’s verdict is unreasonable and/or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence pursuant to s 6(1)  
        Criminal Appeal Act 
         1912.  
        
       
       
      Failure to direct jury  
      
    20 Section 165 of the Evidence Act 1995 is in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        165 Unreliable evidence 
         
         
        (1) This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence: 
         
          
         (a) evidence in relation to which Part 3.2 (hearsay evidence) or 3.4 (admissions) applies, 
         (b) identification evidence, 
         (c) evidence the reliability of which may be affected by age, ill health (whether physical or mental), injury or the like, 
         (d) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding, 
         (e) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness who is a prison informer, 
         (f) oral evidence of official questioning of a defendant that is questioning recorded in writing that has not been signed, or otherwise acknowledged in writing, by the defendant, 
         (g) in a proceeding against the estate of a deceased person—evidence adduced by or on behalf of a person seeking relief in the proceeding that is evidence about a matter about which the deceased person could have given evidence if he or she were alive. 
         
         
        (2) If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to: 
         
          
         (a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and 
         (b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and 
         (c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it. 
         
         
        (3) The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so. 
        (4) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving the warning or information. 
        (5) This section does not affect any other power of the judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury. 
        (6) Subsection (2) does not permit a judge to warn or inform a jury in proceedings before it in which a child gives evidence that the reliability of the child’s evidence may be affected by the age of the child. Any such warning or information may be given only in accordance with section 165B. 
        
       
      
    21 Relevant evidence on this matter included evidence from the complainant to the following effect. The complainant drank a couple of beers at his house and then attended the Oxford Hotel at about 8pm and was drinking schooners of New. By 9.30pm he had drunk two schooners of beer and a soft vodka before the appellant joined their group. He would have had another two beers after the appellant joined them, and the appellant also drank one or two schooners. They left the hotel shortly after 10pm and, although he had consumed a couple of beers at home and then four schooners of New and two shots of vodka at the hotel, he said his state of sobriety was “total”, explaining “I’ve been a heavy user of alcohol for a long time and it didn’t affect me”. When the complainant and the appellant got to the complainant’s house, they drank more beers and shared a joint of marijuana. The complainant said the joint and additional beer had no affect on his sobriety but then said “I was slightly stoned but it didn’t incapacitate me or make me any less mobile than usual”.  
     
      
    22 In the appellant’s record of interview, he said this:  
     
      
       
        
        ""...This is, it was consensual and it was, it got a little bit frantic there at one stage because he was doing some sort of chemicals and I don't do chemicals or anything, speed and all that sort of stuff I just, my body, I'm, I'm an athlete and I just couldn't, and over the years I've just had that rush, you know, to have a sniff of that bottle and, and that's all, but, no, and I wasn't, oh, no, I just couldn't take any of that, that speed stuff that he had, and I just, I was already drunk, I think, from the Oxford Hotel because I remember at the Oxford Hotel my mate, he got shut down from drinking, my white mate, and I actually said to one of the bar staff he, he's OK, he's not screaming at anybody, just frustrated. But he nearly got us evicted, because he was being a bit loud. .."".  
        
       
      
    23 In the trial judge’s summing up, the trial judge did not deal with the detail of the consumption of drugs and alcohol by the complainant or the appellant. At one stage, he said this:  
     
      
       
        
        ""In cross-examination [the complainant] said that at the Oxford Hotel there was never any discussion with the accused about S and M, and he had never practised it. He denied that there was, any discussions with the accused about dominant or passive roles. [The complainant] said that in the unit he and the accused had a beer and made general conversation and smoked a joint. He said there was no discussion about amyl nitrite or amphetamines. He said the conversation was friendly. He said the conversation was friendly. He said the accused appeared to be sober.""  
        
       
      
    24 Later, the trial judge said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “… Before you can convict the accused on the evidence of one witness, you must carefully scrutinise and evaluate that evidence in the light of the criticism made of it by counsel for the accused in regard to count 1 on the indictment. It is only after such careful scrutiny and the evaluation and if you are satisfied that the evidence is truthful, reliable and accurate, that you can use the evidence as a basis of a conviction on charge 1 on the indictment.  
         
         
        I have given you this direction of law in this case because the case against the accused rests entirely on the evidence of the complainant. When that is the position, the direction I have just given you is one I have to give you as a matter of law. The warning is not given to you because I have any particular view abut the evidence. It is because the law requires that I give such a direction to you. ""  
        
       
      
    25 An affidavit has been provided by the appellant’s barrister at the trial, which asserts the following:  
     
      
       
        
        4. I did not seek a direction from the trial judge that there be a warning under s165 Evidence Act that the evidence of the complainant may be unreliable due to his consumption of alcohol or cannabis.  
        5. On reflection, the fact that I did not seek such a direction was an oversight and, therefore, an error on my part. To the best of my memory, there was certainly no tactical basis for not seeking such a direction.  
        6. The decision of Button & Griffin [2002] NSWCCA 159 has been drawn to my attention by senior counsel for the appellant. I did not seek a direction from His Honour regarding the accused's level of intoxication in relation to the consideration of whether the accused knew the complainant was not consenting. On reflection, this was an omission on my part and the request should have been made.  
        7. The absence of any request for such a direction was an oversight and an error on my part; to the best of my memory, there was certainly no tactical basis for not seeking such a direction. 
        
       
      
    26 Mr Dalton SC for the appellant submitted that, having regard to the evidence to which I have referred, the level of the complainant’s alcohol intoxication was clearly a relevant consideration for the jury. The trial judge should have directed the jury that the complainant’s evidence may well have been rendered unreliable as a result of the alcohol and drugs he had consumed leading up to the subject incident: see R v Murphy [2000] NSWCCA 297 at [63]-[93].  
     
      
    27 Mr Dalton submitted that, while there had been no request for a re-direction in this regard, the affidavit of the appellant’s counsel showed that this had been an oversight rather than a tactical decision, and the failure to give the direction as required by s 165 had led to manifest injustice.  
     
      
    28 In my opinion, there was no relevant error by the trial judge and no miscarriage of justice in this respect.  
     
      
    29 The intoxication of the complainant had not been made an issue in the case. It had not been raised in cross-examination. The question of whether, by reason of what the complainant had drunk, the complainant was in a condition such as to affect the reliability of his evidence was not a matter on which the court had knowledge and experience over and above that of the jurors. The same applies in relation to the complainant’s evidence that, having shared marijuana, he was “slightly stoned”.  
     
      
    30 It had been suggested in the appellant’s record of interview that the complainant had ingested “chemicals” or “speed stuff”, and it was put to the complainant in cross-examination that he used amyl nitrate, which the complainant denied. In my opinion, that material did not raise a reasonable basis for the trial judge to give any directions to the jury about the possible effect of drugs other than alcohol and cannabis.  
     
      
    31 This case was very different from the case of Murphy, where there was substantial evidence that the complainant was affected by alcohol in a way likely to impact on the reliability of her evidence, and could not even remember getting home after the events which were the subject of the complaint. In this case, in my opinion, a direction in accordance with s 165(c) was not required.  
     
      
       
      Unreasonable verdict  
      
    32 Mr Dalton submitted that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable. The jury should not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the events occurred as alleged by the complainant or that, even if it were the case that such events occurred without the consent of the complainant, it was proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew that what was done was not consensual.  
     
      
    33 He submitted that the circumstances were that the complainant, who had shared prior sexual encounters with the appellant, invited the appellant back to his unit to share a joint after they had been drinking together at the hotel for some time. The complainant sought to suggest in his evidence that the appellant was sober, even though in a phone conversation of the 23 March, the complainant seemed to accept that the appellant was “pissed out of his brains”. The complainant made no complaint as to being sexually assaulted until some two days after the event, despite numerous opportunities. There was no evidence of any injury to the complainant’s anus despite his claim of having been sexually assaulted there with a hammer without consent.  
     
      
    34 Mr Dalton submitted that the intercepted telephone conversation displayed the complainant showing uncertainty about what had happened. There were inconsistencies in the complainant’s accounts given at various times, for example his statement to VS that the appellant had him over “the bed”; and his evidence at the committal proceedings that he had been hit with the head of the hammer, not the handle as he said at the trial.  
     
      
    35 Mr Dalton submitted that the intercepted telephone conversation consistently and convincingly conveyed that the appellant believed that whatever had happened was consensual, and that the appellant had been seriously intoxicated at the time. These were matters that should appropriately have been drawn to the jury’s attention, but were not: cf R v Button [2002] NSWCCA 159, [2002] 129 CrimR 342 at [79]-[86] and [140]-[154].  
     
      
    36 In my opinion, the reasonableness of the jury’s verdict must be assessed having regard to the way the case was conducted before them and the issues actually raised.  
     
      
    37 The appellant’s counsel at the trial, in his affidavit, has asserted that it was an error on his part not to have sought a direction from the trial judge regarding the appellant’s level of intoxication in relation to the consideration of whether the appellant knew the complainant was not consenting. However, the position taken in the appellant’s defence at the trial was that events described by the complainant had not happened at all; and in relation to that approach, it would have been counter-productive to suggest that the appellant was seriously intoxicated at the time.  
     
      
    38 It is true that the intercepted telephone calls would have been consistent with a defence that, although events occurred of the general nature alleged by the complainant, the appellant understood them to be consensual. However, the position adopted in the appellant’s record of interview, and in the conduct of the trial, was that events of that nature had not occurred, and in particular, that the complainant had inserted the hammer into his own anus. It would have been open to the appellant to take the position at the trial that the telephone intercepts disclosed a true picture, to a greater extent than the record of interview, which was given in the presence of the appellant’s partner. However, that was not the approach taken, and there is and could be no suggestion that this was other than a reasonable forensic decision.  
     
      
    39 The trial judge appropriately directed the jury to the effect that, if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the events described by the complainant occurred, and occurred without his consent, they also had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew that the complainant was not consenting. The verdict of the jury indicates that they were so satisfied; and having regard to the way the case was conducted, I do not consider that this decision was unreasonable.  
     
      
       
      CONCLUSION  
      
    40 For those reasons, in my opinion, the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.

      (a) operating an account with a cash dealer in a false name contrary to s.24(2) FTR Act (four offences);

      Facts of Offences 
       
      
    8 On 21 November 2000, the Applicant was declared bankrupt. Prior to 21 November 2000, the Applicant had incurred debts to various creditors in excess of $1 million, which constituted the foundation for a creditor’s petition for him to be made bankrupt. 
     
      
    9 Between 15 March 2001 and September 2004, the Applicant committed the offences for which he came to be sentenced. These offences involved operating bank accounts in false names, obtaining credit in false names without informing the lender that he was an undischarged bankrupt, possession of a false instrument (a Medicare card in a false name) and one offence of using a false instrument (a stolen cheque made payable in the sum of $50,000.00). In committing these offences, the Applicant used one or other of the following false identities: 
     
      
       
      (a) Henry Thomas; 
       
       
      (b) Dr Henry Thomas; 
       
       
      (c) Henry Van Haltren; 
       
       
      (d) Jonathon Fiske; 
       
       
      (e) Jonathan Fiske. 
       
      
    10 On 12 July 2004, the Applicant arrived at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport on a flight from China. Customs officers searched his bags and located several forms of identification in the names of “Jonathan Fiske” and “Jonathon Fiske”. Following the discovery of Fiske identification documents (NSW driver’s licence, Medicare card, HSBC MasterCard, American Express Card and Virgin MasterCard) in a folded envelope inside a toiletries bag, a conversation ensued between a Customs officer and the Applicant: 
     
      
       
      Officer:  
      “And what is this?”  
      (indicating the envelope). 
       
       
      Applicant:  
      “Actually it’s my friend’s identification. He lets me use it.” 
       
       
      Officer:  
      “Isn’t that illegal sir?” 
       
       
      Applicant:  
      “No, no, not if you have the person’s permission.” 
       
       
      Officer:  
      “Sir your friend looks like you.” 
       
       
      Applicant:  
      “Actually this is my identification. I filed for bankruptcy in 2000. This is now my legitimate alias. All the companies I trade with are aware of this.” 
       
      
    11 The Applicant was arrested on 12 July 2004 and charged with a number of offences. Investigations continued and the Applicant was interviewed by ASIC officers on 4 August 2004, with a search warrant being executed on the Applicant’s Bellevue Hill premises on 6 August 2004. Documents were located, some of which will be referred to shortly.12 The Crown contends that the value of the credit, loans and property which the Applicant obtained in this way was $3.979 million. The victims of the offences were able to recover some of their losses through repossession of the properties or items acquired by the Applicant. However, a precise quantification of the amount obtained by the Applicant by reason of his actions cannot be determined.

      Some Findings of Fact Concerning the Offences 
       
      
    16 I have set out above the criminal conduct of the Applicant encompassed by the offences to which he pleaded guilty, and the additional offences which he asked to be taken into account in passing sentence. It is appropriate to mention some additional findings of fact of the sentencing judge which bear upon the Applicant’s objective criminality. These findings were not challenged in this Court. 
     
      
    17 His Honour found that the Applicant was well aware that he had been bankrupted at the time of committing the offences, but that he did not file a Statement of Affairs with the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia until September 2004 following his arrest on the present matters (ROS3-4). The Applicant’s bankruptcy came to an end in September 2007 (ROS6).  
     
      
    18 As mentioned above (at [10]), when the Applicant was arrested on 12 July 2004, he had in his possession a driver’s licence in the name of Jonathan Fiske (bearing the Applicant’s photograph), a Medicare card in that false name together with two MasterCards and an American Express card (also in that false name). Searches of the New South Wales Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages revealed no record of the birth of Jonathan Fiske. Department of Immigration records contain no record of the arrival or departure of such a person. The number on the driver’s licence in the Applicant’s possession (in the name of Jonathan Fiske) had been issued to another person. The Medicare card in the name of Jonathan Fiske was not a valid Medicare card number (ROS6-7).  
     
      
    19 A search of the Applicant’s Bellevue Hill premises by Australian Federal Police on 6 August 2004 revealed further documents in the name of Jonathan Fiske. In an interview with ASIC officers on 4 August 2004, in response to an enquiry as to the whereabouts of Jonathan Fiske, the Applicant stated that he (Fiske) was “in South Africa at the moment” and was “not due to return until the 26th but I will be speaking to him around 3.00 pm this afternoon”. The Applicant continued to represent falsely to the authorities that there was such a person as Jonathan Fiske (ROS8).  
     
      
    20 During the execution of the search warrant on 6 August 2004, police located a photocopy of an Australian passport in the name of Henry Thomas. The original passport has not been located, but the photograph on the copy passport was that of the Applicant. The passport number displayed on the copy document related to another person. Likewise, a Medicare card was located in the name of Henry Thomas bearing a number which related to another person.  
     
      
    21 Documents were found by police on 6 August 2004 in the Applicant’s premises which revealed that he had resisted earlier suggestions that he and Mr Thomas were the same person. In a letter dated August 2003, the Applicant said to Baycorp Advantage (an entity associated with American Express) that he had “a problem with being cross referenced with Mr Thomas who shares the same birthday as me and was once a close friend”. His Honour observed that a letter dated December 2002 from Henry Thomas to Baycorp Advantage (signed apparently by the Applicant) stated, somewhat ironically, that “It appears that I am the victim of a fraud” (ROS8-9).  
     
      
    22 His Honour Judge Charteris SC found (ROS9-10): 
     
      
       
        
        “The evidence before me shows that the offender utilised the names to which I have referred. For his financial advantage he deceived the credit issuers as regards his identity. His behaviour over a long period of time was nothing less than brazen; a great example of that brazenness being his representations to those who were seeking to associate him with his alias that he was a victim of identity fraud himself.” 
        
       
      
    23 His Honour provided further examples of the Applicant “brazenly attempting to deceive” credit providers. A stark example of this was as follows (ROS10): 
     
      
       
        
        “Indeed in August 2003 again writing a letter under the hand of Henri Van-Haltren he wrote to Baycorp Advantage and said as regards to Henry Thomas: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘It is as obvious as the nose on my face that I am not the person in the cross reference and I am being damaged by it.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Later that month he communicated to American Express Credit Control in the name of Henri Van-Haltren stating amongst other things: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘For reasons unknown to me Baycorp Advantage have cross referenced me with a bankrupt person of similar name’.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    24 His Honour was satisfied that the Applicant had utilised company names for deceptive purposes and had operated bank accounts in various false names (ROS11-12).  
     
      
    25 The length to which the Applicant was prepared to go to aggressively defend his criminal conduct is illustrated by the following finding of the sentencing judge (ROS13): 
     
      
       
        
        “There was also seized during the search of the premises to which I have referred a letter addressed to American Express in August 2003 from Henri Van-Haltren. The letter alleges that Mr Henri Van-Haltren is unable to pay the outstanding account because of a cross reference with a bankrupt. Handwritten upon that letter was a note which recorded ‘If you want to go to court I am ready with a counter claim for damages’. It is apparent that the offender was on occasion prepared to bully any credit provider who was going to suggest that he and one or more of his aliases were the same person.” 
        
       
      
    26 His Honour found that the Applicant had borrowed substantial sums of money from the St George Bank to purchase real estate, with the Bank being left out of pocket in the sum of $553,507.31 following the completion of a real estate transaction (ROS14-15).  
     
      
    27 His Honour found that the Applicant had obtained motor vehicles by means of financing. In January 2004, through Planhall Pty Limited, the Applicant entered into a contract for the purchase of a Mini Cooper S. In January 2004, again through Planhall Pty Limited, he applied for and obtained finance of $205,000.00 to purchase a Porsche motor vehicle. In both cases, the false name Jonathan Fiske was used with a false driver’s licence being utilised for this purpose. The Porsche motor vehicle was ultimately repossessed and sold and the account due to the credit provider, Suncorp, was more than $75,000.00 in arrears after that sale (ROS16).  
     
      
    28 The learned sentencing judge said that the “evidence overwhelmingly establishes that the offender is very well practised in deception” (ROS19). Later, his Honour said (ROS25-26): 
     
      
       
        
        “I can observe that the offender committed each of the offences in a very calculating and cunning way. He utilised identity fraud. He committed the offences well knowing that he was a bankrupt. He deceived many persons working in the finance industry over a period of time. His behaviour when taken together involved him in a high level of deception for more than three years. His motivation was his greed. I have also referred to the fact that he was brazen in some of his behaviour. He sought to dissuade any attempts by any credit provider to link him to his various aliases. He threatened legal action in some cases to which I have referred.” 
        
       
       
      The Applicant’s Subjective Circumstances 
       
      
    29 The Applicant was born in August 1964. He was aged between 36 and 40 years at the time of the offences and was 43 years’ old at the time of sentence.  
     
      
    30 The Applicant has a prior criminal history. On 28 August 1991, he was fined $500.00 on each of two counts of fraud in the Perth Court of Petty Sessions. On 18 August 1992, similar fines were imposed for two further counts of fraud at the same Court. The Applicant had a number of convictions for driving offences, including drink-driving offences in 1996 and 2001. In December 2003, during the period when the present offences were being committed, the Applicant was fined at Redfern Local Court on a number of traffic offences, including stating a false name or address.  
     
      
    31 The sentencing judge described this as a “limited criminal record” which, having regard to the Applicant’s age, was “not a bad record at all” and concluded that the Applicant was “entitled to some mitigation in sentence having regard to that record” (ROS26-27).  
     
      
    32 The Applicant did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings. Ajit Wijesinghe, an acquaintance of the Applicant, gave character evidence which his Honour observed was not of much assistance (ROS22). A number of references were tendered in the Applicant’s case on sentence.33 Given the Applicant’s pattern of deception revealed by the offences, his Honour was “very cautious about accepting the reliability” of the Applicant’s statements concerning his history and background to the probation and parole officer or to any other person or organisation (ROS19-20).  
     
      
    34 Following his arrest on 12 July 2004, the Applicant remained in custody until released on bail in mid-August 2004. He remained on bail until remanded in custody on 8 June 2007 following his pleas of guilty. 
     
      
       
      The Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    35 The Applicant presses three grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
      (a) Ground 1 - insufficient discount was allowed for the Applicant’s assistance to authorities; 
       
       
      (b) Ground 2 - the discount for the Applicant’s pleas of guilty was inadequate; 
       
       
      (c) Ground 3 - the sentence is, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive. 
       
       
      Ground 1 - Insufficient Discount Allowed for Assistance to Authorities 
       
      
    36 The Applicant was arrested on 12 July 2004 and first appeared before Central Local Court on 6 August 2004. On 27 April 2006, he was committed for trial in the Sydney District Court. 
     
      
    37 In 2006 and 2007, the Applicant agreed to be interviewed by Australian Federal Police. It is the assistance to the authorities said to flow from these interviews which is the subject of the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
    38 His Honour dealt with the Applicant’s assistance in the following way (ROS17-19): 
     
      
       
        
        “In April 2006 the offender submitted to interviews by investigating police: that was prior to the date listed for committal proceedings in the matters in Downing Centre Local Court. The offender made certain allegations in that interview but those were said to be of a general nature and did not specify times or locations. It is the view of both the Federal and New South Wales Police Force that the information provided by the defendant was of no value as it was of a general nature. 
        
       
       
        
        On 7 June 2007 the offender, a day prior to entering his pleas of guilty on the indictment, attended the Australian Federal Police Sydney office and participated in a further tape interview in the presence of his counsel and solicitor. The offender made certain denials in relation to various credit accounts that he was said to have operated. He made allegations against a person not named in the statement of facts. Police have spoken to that person who has denied the allegations. The facts detail that some of the material seized on the execution of search warrants from premises occupied by the offender is linked to some of the accounts that the offender denied operating. During the interview, the offender alleged that he had attended properties with two persons with the intention of identifying properties that could be purchased using a system of bank loans given to fictitious applicants, together with over valuation of the real estate. The offender in his interview with police however did not identify any specific properties involved. He did say that the property at Leichhardt however was subject to a valid valuation. The offender denied knowledge of certain fraudulent documents and said that he was willing to provide evidence that some documents were not completed by him. It is observed however that copies of for instance the St George bank loan application were found at his premises during a search warrant execution. A person he nominated as having completed or submitted false documents to St George has denied to police any involvement. Another person identified, said to be a mortgage manager, had left Australia in 2003 and has not been interviewed. The offender did admit to police in that second interview that he was present when documents for bank loans were altered on behalf of one of his employees. 
        
       
       
        
        In addition, after his plea of guilty and prior to sentencing, the offender entered into further interviews with police. I have received a document tendered in the sentencing process being Exhibit D which actually comprised two documents. It is the assertion of the relevant Federal Police Officers that the assistance given by the offender in his most recent interviews was of no value. I am asked by Mr Byrne of senior counsel, on behalf of the offender, to take into account the willingness of the offender to co-operate. I accept that although the material he has delivered in his various interviews has not, in the view of the police, been of any significant value, it is an indication that he was prepared to come forward and answer questions. I will take that into account in determining his penalty and I will give him a very slight discount for that co-operation with authorities as evidence of his regret for his involvement.” 
        
       
      
    39 A little later, his Honour said (ROS23): 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Byrne of senior counsel also tendered, as I have observed, the final statement made to police made by the offender, although the police say the information provided was of ‘nil’ value. As I have observed, I will utilise that material for the purposes of being some evidence of the regret of the offender for his behaviour and his desire to co-operate.” 
        
       
       
      Applicant’s Submissions 
       
      
    40 Mr McClintock SC, for the Applicant, submitted that a “very slight discount” for the Applicant’s co-operation was an insufficient discount in the circumstances of the case. He submitted that there is a significant public policy in encouraging accused persons to co-operate with the police in order to expose other persons who are involved in criminal conduct: De Campos v R [2006] NSWCCA 51 at [25]. He submits that this principle applies here and that the disinclination of police to further investigate information provided by the Applicant ought not to have impacted on the assessment on the quality of the assistance, thereby reducing the discount.  
     
      
    41 He submits that the sentencing judge allowed a combined discount of 15% for the pleas of guilty and for the Applicant’s assistance to the authorities, and that such a combined discount was insufficient in the circumstances of the case. 
     
      
       
      Crown Submissions 
       
      
    42 The Crown submits that no error has been demonstrated in the manner alleged in the first ground of appeal. The police were not challenged in evidence or submissions in the District Court concerning their opinion as to the value of the information provide by the Applicant.  
     
      
    43 The Crown submits that the sentencing judge did not combine the discount to be allowed for the Applicant’s pleas of guilty, and his assistance to the authorities, leading to a single discount of 15%. Rather, the 15% discount was solely referrable to the Applicant’s pleas of guilty with his Honour allowing an additional “very slight discount” for his co-operation. 
     
      
    44 The Crown submits that it was appropriate for his Honour to consider the value, or lack of value, of the Applicant’s assistance to the authorities: Alchikh v R [2007] NSWCCA 345 at [25].  
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    45 I accept the Crown submission that his Honour did not give a rolled-up 15% discount for the Applicant’s pleas of guilty and his co-operation with authorities. It is clear from the remarks on sentence (ROS25) that the 15% discount related solely to the Applicant’s pleas of guilty, which had utilitarian value and indicated the Applicant’s preparedness to facilitate the administration of justice: Cameron v The Queen (2002) 209 CLR 339 at 343-344 [13]-[15]; Cahyadi v R (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 at 49 [34]. The “very slight discount’ which his Honour allowed for the Applicant’s co-operation with authorities was taken into account in addition to the 15% discount in imposition of sentence. 
     
      
    46 The sentencing judge took into account the fact that the Applicant was prepared, long after the relevant events, to provide some information to the police. It was appropriate for his Honour to consider the value of the information provided. In accordance with usual practice, investigating police provided an assessment of the value of the material, indicating that it was of no value. This opinion was expressed after police had assessed the information provided by the Applicant. This assessment was not challenged in the District Court by cross-examination or in submissions made by the Applicant. The nature and content of the information provided by the Applicant (as outlined in the quotation at [38] above) serves to explain why little weight was given to it on sentence. Both the timing and content of the Applicant’s interviews and statement were relevant, and neither operated to assist the Applicant.  
     
      
    47 This is not a case like De Campos v R at [20], where the offender offered to take part in a controlled delivery of drugs, while an investigation was still on foot, but a police officer declined on the basis that it was not worth the effort in light of the likely outcome of such an operation. In that case, the offender made an unconditional offer to assist police in a practical way soon after arrest, and whilst other criminal participants were still actively involved in the offending conduct. Despite the fact that police chose not to take the matter further at the time (for reasons beyond the control of the co-operating offender), the Court said that it was appropriate that the offender be given a discount for this assistance. As Howie J (Beazley JA and Adams J agreeing) observed at [25]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view the applicant should be re-sentenced to take into account this offer of assistance although it will not always be the case that an offer that was not taken up by the police should be rewarded. It is well-known and has been well stated in numerous decisions of this Court that there is a significant public policy in encouraging people to co-operate with the police in order to expose other persons who are in the hierarchy of importing drugs into the country, particularly where those persons reside in this country.” 
        
       
      
    48 De Campos v R is not authority for the proposition that a discount ought be given in every case where an offender provides information.  
     
      
    49 It was open to the sentencing judge to make the findings he did and to determine that a “very slight discount” only ought be allowed for the Applicant’s assistance. Although the attempt made to assist police is one of the matters to be considered, so is the effectiveness of the assistance and its benefit to the authorities: R v El Hani [2004] NSWCCA 162 at [73]; Alchikh v R at [25]. In reality, the Applicant’s proffered assistance came late and was of no practical benefit to the police: Assafiri v R [2007] NSWCCA 159 at [20]-[23]. 
     
      
    50 No error has been demonstrated by the Applicant in the manner in which the sentencing judge approached the Applicant’s provision of information to authorities. I would reject the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 - The Discount for the Applicant’s Pleas of Guilty Was Inadequate 
       
      
    51 Consistent with my conclusion (at [45]) with respect to Ground 1, I approach Ground 2 upon the basis that his Honour allowed a discrete discount of 15% for the Applicant’s pleas of guilty.  
     
      
       
      Applicant’s Submissions 
       
      
    52 Mr McClintock SC submits that the discount allowed for the Applicant’s pleas of guilty was inadequate in the circumstances of this case. 53 Mr McClintock SC points to the history of the matter whereby the Applicant was charged with eight offences in August 2004. Over the ensuing eight months, at different times, a further 40 charges were laid. The Applicant pleaded not guilty in the Local Court to all charges and, on 27 April 2006, he was committed for trial in the District Court. Thereafter, various delays ensued involving the appointment of new legal representatives. At one stage, legal aid was withdrawn and further adjournments resulted. On 12 December 2006, a six-week trial was fixed to commence on 4 June 2007.  
     
      
    54 On 4 June 2007, the Applicant pleaded guilty to nine charges and foreshadowed pleas of guilty to further charges. On 6 June 2007, the Applicant entered a further eight pleas of guilty, and the Crown indicated that a fresh indictment was likely to be filed after the consent of the NSW Director of Public Prosecutions had been obtained. On 8 June 2007, a fresh indictment was presented containing the 26 counts to which the Applicant pleaded guilty. On the same day, the sentencing judge was asked to take into account eight Commonwealth offences for the purposes of s.16BA Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and the State offences on the Form 1. Thereafter, the sentencing hearing proceeded on 5 October 2007 with sentence being passed on 16 November 2007. 
     
      
    55 In the circumstances of the case, Mr McClintock SC submits that the pleas of guilty were useful in avoiding the need for a trial with an estimate of four to six weeks. Although acknowledging that the Applicant sought a number of adjournments, he submits that these were partly a result of the Crown amending charges before the time when the Applicant entered guilty pleas. In these circumstances, he submits that the responsibility for the delay in those pleas cannot be visited entirely on the Applicant. He points to the complexity of the prosecution and contends, in the circumstances, that an inadequate discount was allowed for the Applicant’s pleas of guilty. 
     
      
       
      Crown Submissions 
       
      
    56 The Crown submits that the 15% discount allowed for the Applicant’s pleas of guilty was both open to the sentencing court and appropriate.  
     
      
    57 The Applicant did not challenge the sentencing judge’s finding that pleas had not been entered at the earliest opportunity. The matter had been listed for trial in the District Court on three occasions (30 October 2006, 13 November 2006 and 20 November 2006) with the trial being vacated on each occasion on a defence application. It was not until June 2007, some 14 months after committal, that the Applicant entered pleas of guilty. Although there was a saving of court time as a result of the guilty pleas, the matter had to be prepared for trial on each occasion.  
     
      
    58 The Crown submits that the sentencing judge took into account both the timing of the pleas and the particular benefits arising from the prospective length and complexity of the trial: R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at 418-419 [155], [160]. The Crown also points to the observation of Heydon JA (Bell J and Smart AJ agreeing) in R v Conway (2001) 121 A Crim R 177 at 183-184 [25] that it is not easy to succeed in a challenge to a discretionary sentencing decision upon the basis that insufficient or inadequate weight had been given to a particular factor. In circumstances where the Applicant has not demonstrated an error in principle and the result, so the Crown contends, is not plainly indicative of some error, then Ground 2 ought be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    59 The Applicant pleaded guilty to 25 Commonwealth offences and one State offence, with additional Commonwealth and State offences to be taken into account for the purpose of sentence. The sentencing judge allowed a discount of 15% with respect to the Applicant’s pleas of guilty. The 15% discount took into account the utilitarian value of the pleas and the willingness of the Applicant to facilitate the course of justice. 
     
      
    60 It is appropriate to nominate a discount for pleas of guilty where an offender is charged with both Commonwealth and State offences: Cahyahi v R at 49 [34]. The range of discount nominated in R v Thomson and Houlton has been adopted as a reasonable range with respect to Commonwealth offences: R v Bugeja [2001] NSWCCA 196 at [28]; R v Otto (2005) 157 A Crim R 525 at 540 [69]; Morgan v R [2007] NSWCCA 8 at [21]. 
     
      
    61 Insofar as there is criticism in this case of the percentage discount awarded, the short answer is that the Applicant has no entitlement to any particular discount: Cahyahi v R at 49 [35]. 
     
      
    62 There was no suggestion here that the Applicant had offered a plea of guilty to any count or counts prior to June 2007. This was not a case where a plea of guilty was offered by the Applicant but rejected by the Crown, only to be accepted at a later time by the Crown: Ahmad v R [2006] NSWCCA 177 at [20]. Rather, the Applicant had denied his guilt and was committed for trial, with a trial date being fixed on three occasions thereafter, before (on the day when the trial was to commence) pleas of guilty were ultimately offered and accepted by the Crown to a large number (but not all) of the charges which had been brought against the Applicant. If a plea is entered a long time after a person is first charged, even to a lesser group of charges, the advantages to the administration of justice are less: R v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117 at [5]-[6]. 
     
      
    63 In my view, the sentencing judge took into account, in an appropriate fashion, the timing of the pleas, their utilitarian value and the willingness of the Applicant to facilitate the course of justice. Given the lateness of the pleas of guilty, a 15% discount was reasonably generous to the Applicant. The Applicant has failed to demonstrate that the learned sentencing judge allowed an insufficient discount by reference to the pleas of guilty. 
     
      
    64 I would reject the second ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 - The Manifestly Excessive Ground 
       
       
      Applicant’s Submissions 
       
      
    65 Mr McClintock SC acknowledged that the Applicant’s criminal conduct was serious and took place over a significant period of time with a large amount of money being obtained. A sentence of full-time imprisonment was inevitable. He submits, however, that the length of the overall sentence imposed is manifestly excessive. In view of the discount in the order of 15%, he submits that a starting point of approximately seven years’ imprisonment was excessive.  
     
      
    66 Senior counsel for the Applicant drew support from the statement of Burchett and Higgins JJ in R v McDonald (1994) 71 A Crim R 370 at 379, in the context of a fraud offender, that “a first incarceration may have a very salutary effect, and the prospect that it may do so should not be left out of the count when its length is fixed”.  
     
      
    67 The Applicant referred to a schedule of cases provided to the sentencing judge by the Crown and noted that, with one exception, a head sentence not exceeding two years had been imposed. Mr McClintock SC submits that, by comparison with the sentences referred to in this table, the Applicant’s sentence is excessive. Whilst acknowledging the limitations inherent in relying upon other sentencing decisions, Mr McClintock SC submits that the following additional cases provide some support for the submission that the sentences imposed on the Applicant are manifestly excessive: 
     
      
       
      (a)  
      Valentine v R  
      [2007] NSWCCA 23 concerning sentences imposed for three counts of using a false instrument contrary to s.300(2)  
      Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) 
      ; 
       
       
      (b)  
      R v Watt  
      [2005] NSWCCA 89 concerning sentences imposed for 11 counts of the offender using his position dishonestly to obtain an advantage contrary to s.184(2)  
      Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) 
      ; 
       
       
      (c)  
      R v Cappadonna  
      (2001) 122 A Crim R 52 concerning sentences for eight offences of fraud (on the Australian Taxation Office) contrary to s.29D  
      Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 
      . 
       
      
    68 The Applicant submits that the sentences imposed in the District Court are manifestly excessive and that this Court should intervene and resentence him by way of less severe penalties.  
     
      
       
      Crown Submissions 
       
      
    69 The Crown submits that the sentences imposed in this case are not manifestly excessive. The Applicant had committed a large number of offences, with different maximum penalties, and it was necessary for his Honour to have regard to the principles in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. His Honour determined the individual sentence for each offence and then turned to issues of concurrency and accumulation and the principle of totality. His Honour had regard to relevant factors for the purpose of s.16A Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).  
     
      
    70 His Honour was required to impose a sentence of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offences: s.16A(1) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). Those circumstances included the fact that, between March 2001 and September 2004, the Applicant used false identities (for which he had procured false identification documents such as driver’s licences, Medicare cards and passports) in order to obtain money and other benefits. He used these false identities to open and operate a number of bank accounts and to obtain credit, including real property mortgages. Both general and personal deterrence were significant factors to maintain the integrity of bankruptcy laws: Paragalli v R [2006] NSWCCA 87 at [23]. 
     
      
    71 To the extent that the Applicant seeks to rely upon the schedule of cases provided by the Crown to the sentencing judge, the Crown submits that a review of those cases reveals the criminality involved in each of them was far less than that exhibited by the Applicant. In that sense, the Crown submits that the cases are not comparable to the present case. They provide some indication concerning penalties imposed in other cases but they do not provide true comparisons with the Applicant’s case. 
     
      
    72 The Crown submits that the sentences imposed upon the Applicant were within the available range of sentence and that it has not been demonstrated that the sentences were manifestly excessive.  
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    73 The question for this Court is whether (either patent or latent) error has been demonstrated with respect to sentence and, if so, whether a positive opinion ought be formed that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed: s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912; R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at 719 [79]. 
     
      
    74 The submission of the Applicant is, in reality, that the final sentences imposed were manifestly excessive and that a breach of the proportionality and totality principles may be inferred from the final result. It is said that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive in the sense of being unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25]. 
     
      
    75 The Applicant’s principal submission involves reliance upon other sentencing decisions, in an effort to establish a range of sentence, to support an argument that the present sentences are manifestly excessive. I do not consider that the sentencing decisions relied upon by the Applicant assist him to make good this submission. 
     
      
    76 The Crown provided to the sentencing judge a schedule of cases as examples of sentencing decisions for offences under the same provisions contravened by the Applicant. Sentences for offences under s.269 Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) were considered in R v Halls (2002) 127 A Crim R 209, R v Issaac [2005] NSWCCA 86 and R v Paragalli. Sentences for offences under s.24 FTR Act were considered in Cahyadi v R and offences under s.300(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) were considered in R v Meyer (2002) 135 A Crim R 438. It was appropriate for the Crown to provide these references to the sentencing judge, but it was equally important that the purpose for which the information was provided was kept in mind. His Honour did so in this case. 
     
      
    77 A note of caution has been expressed by this Court when a manifestly excessive ground is based upon comparison with sentences imposed in other cases.  
     
      
    78 In R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368, Hunt CJ at CL (Allen J and Loveday AJ agreeing) said at 371: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is quite wrong to compare the sentence under challenge directly with that imposed upon another offender (who is not a co-offender) simply because the two offenders may have similar characteristics and may have committed similar crimes. What must be looked at is whether the challenged sentence is within the range appropriate to the objective gravity of the particular offence and to the subjective circumstances of the particular offender, and not whether it is more severe or more lenient than some other sentence (other than that of a co-offender) which merely forms part of that range.” 
        
       
      
    79 In R v George (2004) 149 A Crim R 38 at 47, the Court (Wood CJ at CL, Adams and Kirby JJ) approached a ground of appeal which invited comparison with sentences in other cases in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “We are unable to gain any meaningful assistance from a reference to these cases. It is necessary to restate that the practice, which appears to have developed in recent times, of approaching sentence appeals by a search for, and comparison with, sentences passed in other cases, is neither helpful nor justified by authority: see  
        Regina v Morgan 
         (1993) 70 A Crim R 368;  
        Regina v Salameh 
         NSWCCA 9 June 1994 and  
        Regina v Trevenna 
         [2004] NSWCCA 43 per Barr J at 98 to 101. At the most, other cases can do no more than become part of a range for sentencing, which in the case of manslaughter is wider than for any other offence.  
         
         
        The difference in objective and subjective culpability, which is found in these decisions, is such that any search for a correlation between the case at hand and another decided case is to ignore the judicial discretion which is involved in the individual sentencing exercise required. As Barr J said in  
        Trevenna 
        , ‘Even if it were possible to say that the culpability in two unrelated cases was the same it would not be correct to say, if the sentences were different, that for that reason alone one of them must be wrong.’ Inter alia any such approach would have to assume that the other was correct, and that is an assumption which cannot logically be made.” 
        
       
      
    80 After referring to these passages from R v Morgan and R v George, I observed in R v Araya (2005) 155 A Crim R 555 at 567 [70] (with the concurrence of Simpson and Rothman JJ): 
     
      
       
        
        “Similar sentiments have been expressed by this Court when arguments have been advanced on appeal comparing sentences imposed for offences of dishonesty or fraud committed by persons who are not co-offenders:  
        R v Hawker 
         [2001] NSWCCA 148 at paragraphs 17-18;  
        R v Swadling 
         [2004] NSWCCA 421 at paragraphs 29, 54;  
        R v Martin 
         [2005] NSWCCA 190 at paragraph 56. In each of those cases, the Court has emphasised that far greater assistance is derived from references to general sentencing policy.”  
        
       
      
    81 I do not consider that the few cases relied upon by the present Applicant establish a range of sentence for these classes of offences. The cases referred to by the Crown in the District Court were of most assistance for their statements of general sentencing policy for this class of offending.  
     
      
    82 Section 269 Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) is intended to protect persons, in particular credit providers, dealing with an undischarged bankrupt: R v Scott (1996) 131 FLR 137 at 141-142; R v Halls at 216 [25]. Although fraudulent intent is not an element of a s.269(1) offence, the circumstances of a case (such as this) may reveal that an offender has acted in a fraudulent or dishonest way: R v Scott at 142-146; R v Issaac at [37]-[39]. 
     
      
    83 The importance of deterrence with respect to s.269 offences has been emphasised: R v Halls at 215-216 [24]. This Court has said that both general and personal deterrence (but especially general deterrence) are significant factors in aid of maintaining the integrity of the law of bankruptcy, without which there would be serious public disadvantage of various commercial, economic and social kinds: Paragalli v R at [23].  
     
      
    84 The offender’s motive for committing s.269 offences is also relevant on sentence. In R v Issaac at [28], it was relevant that the offender’s motive for commission of offences was “need, as distinct from greed”. The sentencing judge found that the present Applicant was motivated by greed (see [28] above).  
     
      
    85 The present Applicant’s objective criminality far exceeded that revealed in the cases referred to by the Crown in the District Court. 
     
      
    86 The Applicant stood for sentence for a large number of serious offences committed over a lengthy period of time for personal gain, motivated by greed. His deception extended beyond the use of false identities to deceive banks and other corporate entities to the brazen denial that he was using false identities accompanied, at times, by threats of litigation against those who made such suggestions. It was entirely correct for the sentencing judge to emphasise the need for personal and general deterrence in this case. 
     
      
    87 The Applicant engaged in a persistent course of deception over some three-and-a-half years. A range of false identities were utilised by him for unlawful purposes. In another context, it has been observed that a proficient fraudster may be armed with forged documents, such as a driver’s licence, as proof of false identity and that this demonstrates an element of planning and sophistication and a high level of objective criminality: R v Tadrosse [2005] NSWCCA 145 at [26]; R v Araya at 571 [96]. General and specific deterrence are matters of particular importance where there is a pattern of fraudulent activity by an offender over an extended period using false identities and associated paraphernalia (such as fraudulent driver’s licences): R v Araya at 571 [98].  
     
      
    88 The course of criminal conduct of the Applicant involved persistent identity crime, a class of criminal conduct which has drawn particular attention in recent years: see, generally, the Final Report of the Model Criminal Law Officers’ Committee of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, “Identity Crime”, March 2008. Using the nomenclature of that report (at paragraph 2.2), the Applicant’s conduct involved both identity fabrication (the creation of fictitious identities) and identity manipulation (the alteration of his own identity by changing one or more elements of identity). 
     
      
    89 Given the number and range of offences, it was necessary for his Honour to consider questions of accumulation, concurrence and totality: Cahyahi v R at 47-48 [27]-[30]. In R v Knight (2005) 155 A Crim R 252 at 272 [112] it was said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is necessary to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of accumulation, concurrence and totality. The total effective sentence must represent a proper period of incarceration for the totality of the criminality involved:  
        R v AEM 
         [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [70];  
        R v Kalache 
         (2000) 111 A Crim R 152 at 184. The mechanism of making some sentences cumulative and others concurrent (or partly so) may be used where the aggregate of sentences imposed in respect of each count exceeds the appropriate total sentence:  
        R v Myers 
         [2002] NSWCCA 162 at paragraph 34. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure public confidence in the administration of justice by imposing sentences which do not suggest that multiple offences will be punished in the same way as one or two offences:  
        R v Wheeler 
         [2000] NSWCCA 34 at paragraphs 36-37.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour applied these principles in this case. A substantial total sentence was imposed upon the Applicant, but that was the consequence of his persistent and protracted criminality motivated by greed. His Honour had proper regard to the objective circumstances of the offences and the subjective circumstances of the Applicant. 
       
      
    90 The Applicant has not demonstrated that the sentences imposed upon him were manifestly excessive. I reject the third ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    91 Leave to appeal ought be granted, but the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    92 PRICE J: I agree with Johnson J.

    1 HIS HONOUR: I propose to give a decision this morning in the matter raised by Mr Dalton of senior counsel. 
     
      
    2 There is presently before the Court a jury trial of five men charged with conspiring to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. The first stage of the trial has involved the detailed tender of material and objects found in the possession of the accused and their alleged co-conspirators during a series of searches conducted by police agencies in 2005.  
     
      
    3 The first chapter of evidence, if I may so describe it, involved the tender of material and objects found at the home of Mohamed Elomar, one of the accused. This related to a search on 27 June 2005. I will not refer to all of the evidence, but it may be, in general terms, be described, in its relevant part, as dealing with the finding of pistols and rifles in the home at 1 Gallipoli Street, Condell Park.  
     
      
    4 Some of the weapons were located in a firearm safe in the lounge room and others were located in a safe in the master bedroom. The weaponry was tendered on an individual basis and the jury had the opportunity of inspecting the weapons on an individual basis. Some days ago, various applications were received by the Court from media interests. Those concerned included the ABC, SBS, The Telegraph and Channel Nine. Each application sought access to the Elomar weaponry, if I may so describe it, and further sought permission to film or photograph the weapons for the purpose of inclusion in television or newspaper reports concerning the evidence in the trial.  
     
      
    5 Senior counsel for Mr Elomar, Mr Dalton, has opposed the making of any order that would enable the media to film or photograph the weapons, and to display film or photos in the press or on television. Mr Dalton queried the Court's power to make such an order and argued, in any event, the publication of the resultant photographs would be prejudicial to his client before the jury in a number of respects.  
     
      
    6 Initially, Mr Dalton argued that the Court did not have power to grant the media access to the exhibits, but he later conceded that this was not the position. His original argument had focussed on the rather narrow language of s 314 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.  
     
      
    7 Essentially, however, Mr Dalton's overall concern was that the photographs or film of the exhibits would show the weaponry in one group, whereas they had been located in different parts of his client's premises and had been tendered individually before the jury. This situation was likely, Mr Dalton argued, to engender prejudice of one kind or another.  
     
      
    8 At the outset, Miss Larissa Cummings, an employee of The Daily Telegraph, had asked the Court's leave to appear for her client on the application. The position, however, altered on 24 November 2008 when Mr Dawson of counsel appeared for the ABC, SBS and Channel Nine. Mr Dawson's submissions may be regarded as in the interests of media generally. Counsel took issue with Mr Dalton's arguments and submitted that photography or filming access should be permitted and that the photographed weaponry should be permitted to be displayed as part of any fair and accurate report of the court proceedings. 
     
      
    9 Consequently, there are three issues for determination. One, does the Court have the power to allow the media access to the weapons which have been admitted into evidence as exhibits in the trial? Two, does the Court have the power to allow the media, as part of that access, to photograph or film the weapons? (I interpolate that it is to be assumed, for the purpose of answering these preliminary questions, that access to and/or photography of the exhibits is required for the purposes of the media compiling a fair and accurate report of the trial proceedings to date.) Three, on the basis that the Court has the relevant powers, should the procedure sought by the media interests be allowed?  
     
      
    10 As to question one, Mr Dalton correctly, in my view, ultimately conceded that such a power existed. It does so within the framework of the Court's inherent power to ensure that the proper interests of the administration of justice are recognised and served throughout the trial. The only further comment required in relation to this first question is that, although it is not necessary for this decision, I do not consider that s 314 of the Criminal Procedure Act has any bearing on the existence and extent of my power as trial judge to permit the media to have access to the exhibits in question. Section 314 is a relatively confined power conferring jurisdiction on the Registrar to allow access to the media to documentary material in his or her possession. The section says nothing as to the extent of the Court's power to allow access in an appropriate case to exhibits of all kind that may be in its possession or control during the trial.  
     
      
    11 In relation to the second question, Mr Dalton has been unable to point to any statutory enactment, rule of Court, or authority for that matter, which would limit or prohibit the Court's power to permit and extend the provision of media access to an exhibit so as to include photographing the item. The highest the argument could be put was that there was no positive statutory provision permitting the procedure, nor was there any authority sanctioning its existence or speaking as to its exercise. Mr Dalton made some brief submissions regarding the undesirability of allowing filming in the courtroom, that is, filming of the actual trial proceedings, but that, to my mind, is a different question.  
     
      
    12 I have come to the clear conclusion the procedure sought on behalf of the media is a procedure the Court may permit in appropriate circumstances. There are essentially four reasons:  
     
      
    13 First, the principle of open justice points to such an outcome. The principle of open justice is fully described by Chief Justice Spigelman in John Fairfax Publications v District Court of New South Wales (2004) 61 NSWLR 344 at paragraphs 35 to 36. I have referred to this in earlier decisions and there is no need for me to repeat it in this decision.  
     
      
    14 The Court of Appeal, however, endorsed the remarks of McHugh J in John Fairfax & Sons Limited v Police Tribunal of New South Wales (1986) 5 NSWLR 465 at 476G to 477B. It is worth repeating part of that passage. McHugh J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The fundamental rule of the common law is that the administration of justice must take place in open court. A court can only depart from this rule where its observance would frustrate the administration of justice or some other public interest for whose protection Parliament has modified the open justice rule.  
        The principle of open justice also requires that nothing should be done to discourage the making of fair and accurate reports of what occurs in the courtroom 
         (my emphasis).” 
        
       
      
    15 The issue, of course, in both the cases to which I have referred, was the making of a suppression or non-publication order. That is not the case here, but the principle, nevertheless, has wide application to a number of matters that regularly come before the courts. The principle of open justice does not create a free standing right to access or its components; John Fairfax Publications v Ryde Local Court (2005) NSWLR 512 at 521 para 29 per Spigelman CJ. But it recognises the desirability of permitting access in appropriate cases where the access will support the preparation of a report of what has happened in the courtroom during its public sittings. The case books are replete with statements at the highest level emphasising the desirability, the necessity, indeed, for court proceedings to be conducted in the full glare of public gaze, including that aspect of it reflected in media reportage.  
     
      
    16 In Australian Securities Investment Commission v Rich, [2001] 51 NSWLR 643; [2001] NSWSC 496 Austin J referred to the following remarks of the Full Federal Court in R v Davis (1995) 57 FCR 512 at 514: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whatever the media's motives in reporting, their opportunity to do so arises out of a principle that is fundamental to our society and method of government. Except in extraordinary circumstances the courts of the land are open to the public. This principle arises out of the belief that exposure to public scrutiny is the surest safeguard against any risk of the courts abusing their considerable powers. As few members of the public have the time or even the inclination to attend courts in person, as a practical sense this principle demands that the media be free to report what goes on in them.” 
        
       
      
    17 The second reason relates to the guidance to be derived from the Supreme Court Practice Note SC General 2. I agree with Hoeben J’s remarks in HIH Insurance Limited (In Liquidation) v General Reinsurance Limited, unreported, SCNSW 10 March 2006, that this Practice Note does no more than offer guidance as to how the discretion vested in the Court to allow access is ordinarily to be exercised. It is, of course, no more than a Practice Note. It is not a Rule of Court. But in its terms, it presupposes the ability of the Court to allow access to non-parties to material in court files. Interestingly, it contemplates that access to non-documentary material, admitted as evidence, may be permitted; (see para 7 and its contents in the Practice Note.) 
     
      
    18 Once again, while the guidance offered by the Practice Note does not confer a right on the media to access, it supports the possibility that, in an appropriate case, the Court may, within the exercise of its proper discretion, mould its orders so that material in non-documentary form may in a practical way be adequately accessed. It is no great leap to move from the contemplation of, for example, providing a photocopy of a document where access has been granted, to the prospect of permitting the photography or photographing of a non-documentary object. How, otherwise, one might ask, are the members of the public, who neither have the time nor inclination to attend court, to understand the evidence where that evidence relates to a non-documentary object? Is it not appropriate, in general terms, allowing of course that it is an appropriate case, for a photograph of a non-documentary object to be provided or arranged as part of the terms of access so that the public can understand what is being reported?  
     
      
    19 The third reason relates to the media access provisions in the Federal Court Rules and the decision of the Federal Court in what has been described as the “media access” cases. I do not propose to set out those rules or indeed to refer in any detail to the cases. That is because those rules, and those cases relate specifically to that jurisdiction. But it is of interest to note that Sackville J in Seven Network Limited v News Limited (No 9), 5 October 2005, reference being Seven Network Limited v News Limited (2005) FCA 1934, in examining a proposed protocol for access to the media to documentation in the C7 trial, said at paragraph 27: 
     
      
       
        
        “Nonetheless, it seems to me that unless the interests of justice require otherwise, this Court would ordinarily take the view that a non-party should have access to all non-confidential documents and other material admitted into evidence. I say 'ordinarily' because the circumstances of each case will vary and the exercise of the discretion under Federal Court Rules Order 47, Rule 6 will have to take into account the particular circumstances of the case.” 
        
       
      
    20 His Honour went on to hold that an appropriate “touchstone” for determining the question of access by non-parties was whether the documents or other material had been admitted into evidence. His Honour thought that, in general, the application of this principle would serve the interests of open justice.  
     
      
    21 It is true that none of the Federal Court cases appear to grapple directly with the issue confronting me, but I think that considerable degree of support emerges from those authorities, and from the burgeoning recognition that it is appropriate to mould procedures so that appropriate protocols can be put in place for the media to have access to material tendered in court to enable proper reporting to take place.  
     
      
    22 There are obvious limitations on this power, but I do not doubt that the power exists. It is not appropriate for me in this decision to endeavour to state the limitations of the power, or to state the circumstances in which the power should not be exercised. Clearly, there comes to mind issues such as confidential material, and material that is commercially sensitive. In a criminal trial there may be issues arising from the fact that prejudice will be, or may likely be, sustained if access is granted to particular exhibits. Prejudice, of course, can arise in any number of ways. I mentioned, for example, yesterday during argument the situation where the victims of a crime, or the family of a deceased person in a murder trial, might need to be taken into account in a particular situation. These are but examples of the necessary caution with which the Court needs to move in this area. (See R v XU No 1 BC 200500412 (at 43-44) per Kirby J. 
     
      
    23 The fourth and final reason can be briefly stated. I agree with Mr Dawson that, essentially, the present problem does not involve a matter of principle. It is simply an extension of the existing method of facilitating access to the media in respect of material already in evidence. Anecdotally, the Court knows that photographs of non-documentary exhibits have been made in a number of cases over the last few years, and it is my general understanding that this extends not only to the Supreme Court, but to the District Court as well. It may well be, however, that this has occurred by arrangement, and without the need for argument as has occurred here. But, essentially, I accept Mr Dawson's submission that there is no broad matter of principle involved in determining whether this power exists. It is simply a matter of moulding, where appropriate, new procedures to those which are well established.  
     
      
    24 I turn to the third question, and that is whether the discretion should be exercised in favour of the media applications. First of all, I proceed on the assumption that a fair and accurate report of this trial will occur. That is an assumption I think the courts are entitled to make (see, for example, Australian Securities Investment Commission v Rich (2001) NSWLR 496 per Austin J at para 40; see also The Queen v LMV, unreported, NSWSC 15 November 1999 per Studdert J at para 18; and Barrett J in Jagelman v Sheahan 13 May 2002 BC 200202390 [2002] NSWSC 419).  
     
      
    25 Secondly, I address the issue of onus. Although it may be properly said that the onus falls on the applicant to demonstrate that access, including photo access, should be granted, this is an onus easily displaced by the obvious presence of the principle of open justice. The media have no absolute right to access, as I have already said, but, on the other hand, their proper purpose in seeking to obtain access to permit the preparation of a fair and accurate report of court proceedings plainly establishes a legitimate interest, at least on a preliminary basis. Nothing has been put to displace that legitimate basis for the present application, and I am satisfied that the preliminary onus, as I shall call it, has been satisfied.  
     
      
    26 As I indicated earlier, Mr Dalton's principal concern is with prejudice. There were four aspects argued in the submissions in the present matter. These were:  
     
      
       
      (a) The argument that a photograph of the weapons in a group would not adequately reflect the evidence. In that sense, photographs of that kind, or films of that kind, might deceive the jury into believing the weapons were found in a group, as represented by the photographs or film.  
       
       
      (b) The second argument advanced was that the appearance of the weapons in the media in photographic form might well spark a public debate about the undesirability of this amount of weaponry being held by one individual. Such a debate, if it were to occur, would, or could, provide a distraction to the jury and divert it from its true task.  
       
       
      (c) The public debate, and perhaps even outcry, engendered by publication of the photographs of the weapons, might flow on to affect the integrity of the evidence that is to be given by some of the witnesses; for example, people owning properties where the accused are alleged to have attended shooting and camping trips.  
       
       
      (d) Finally, the argument was made that the very presence of photos of the weapons might simply serve to give undue emphasis to them in the mind of the jury.  
       
      
    27 As to (a), the jury has heard very clear and definite evidence about where the weapons were found, and has heard evidence as to their condition and to their safekeeping at the time when they were found. This evidence was given quite recently. The weapons were themselves tendered individually and, with the consent of the parties, the members of the jury were permitted to handle and examine the weapons on an individual basis. I do not think there is any real, or even likely, possibility that the jury would fail to remember the evidence that has been given before them. In any event, I would regard it as my obligation to give an appropriate direction, if the films do appear in the media, to reinforce the situation, and to appropriately direct the jury.  
     
      
    28 As to the second argument, I consider that it is entirely speculative, and I do not think it is at all likely that some type of public debate will emerge to such an extent as to become a distraction. Once again, if that were to happen, a direction could be given to the jury, and I am confident they would heed it.  
     
      
    29 As to the third matter, I do not consider this to be even remotely possible.  
     
      
    30 As to the fourth matter, once again, I would simply say that I do not consider that the appearance of the weapons, even in group form, in the media will result in a jury giving undue emphasis to the exhibits. If for any reason it was thought necessary to do so, of course a further direction could be given so that did not happen.  
     
      
    31 For these reasons, I conclude that there is no valid reason, in the circumstances of this matter, for declining to grant to the media photographic or film access to the particular exhibits, nor is there any reason for ordering that the photographs or films may not be displayed to accompany any fair and accurate reporting of the evidence in the trial.  
     
      
    32 This is a trial where there will be a degree of restriction on publication of material. The National Security legislation will require a closed court on occasions, it will require the use of pseudonyms, and it will require the redaction of transcript. By way of contrast, the court should encourage, in my view, a degree of cooperation between the parties and the media so as to allow reasonable access to material emerging in open court sessions. This is not to encourage prurience or sensationalism. It is, however, to encourage fair and accurate reporting in a trial that will legitimately be of interest to the general public.  
     
      
    33 That really concludes the formal part of this judgment.  
     
      
    34 I order that access be granted to the exhibits and that the media may photograph or film the weapons and may use the photographs or films so taken as part of any fair and accurate report in relation to the evidence taken in the trial.  
     
      
    35 I would like to add this: It is no part of the judgment, as I say, but I would encourage the parties, and of course the Crown is in evidence at this stage, particularly the Crown, to support some type of informal protocol between itself and the media whereby there is a level of communication between the Crown and the media in responsible fashion so that the media is generally made and kept aware of the schedule of witnesses, and the programming for the taking of evidence in the trial.  
     
      
    36 Secondly, I think that the media should feel free to ask the Crown for copies of any documentary exhibits and also to indicate whether there are other copy exhibits (photographs for example) they may wish to secure for the purpose of copying or photographing. Where it appears to the Crown, as it may well clearly appear, that there might be some dissention on that point from the accused, the Crown should notify the accused of the situation so that any application can be made to the Court.  
     
      
    37 By making these remarks, I am not suggesting any encouragement for the proliferation of unnecessary arguments. I think everyone is well aware of the areas where prejudice might possibly be entertained as capable of being sustained in the trial. But, subject to those considerations I think there should be encouragement by the Court to a reasonable degree of cooperation with the media. It is no part of my task to nominate anyone to be on the team, but if I were minded to do so I would be looking directly at Mr Bellew SC to ease the burden on the senior Crown Prosecutor and I would be looking, even though he is not here, at Mr Dalton, because he has so adequately represented the interests of not only Mr Elomar but all the others on this particular argument.

     Headnote 
    The applicant, Mr Lu, pleaded guilty to manslaughter, contrary to s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900. Price J sentenced Mr Lu to a total term of imprisonment of 9 years 4 months, comprising a non-parole period of 6 years 2 months, with a balance of term of 3 years. At the time of sentence, Mr Lu was already serving a sentence imposed by Maguire DCJ for supply prohibited drug, comprising a total term of imprisonment of 4 years 8 months, with a non-parole period of 3 years 7 months. Price J effectively commenced the sentence for the manslaughter offence at the expiration of the non-parole period for the supply prohibited drug offence.Mr Lu seeks leave to appeal against sentence on two grounds: first, that the sentence imposed was too severe; and secondly, that his Honour erred in failing to partially accumulate the sentence for the manslaughter offence on the earlier sentence for the supply prohibited drug offence, imposed by Maguire DCJ.The offence occurred in circumstances where Mr Lu, who was carrying an iron bar and was in the company of another person, chased the victim and attacked him. The victim was stabbed during the attack. On the agreed facts before the Court, the stabbing was done by the other attacker. The altercation was a revenge attack for an incident that occurred between Mr Lu and the victim and their respective female partners a fortnight previously.Mr Lu was sentenced by Price J on the basis that he intended that he and the other person would assault the victim and occasion actual bodily harm, and that Mr Lu was not aware that the other person was in possession of a knife which he would use to fatally stab the deceased.Mr Lu had a lengthy criminal history and poor prospects for rehabilitation. However, Mr Lu’s contrition and remorse were factors in mitigation. A discount of 15 per cent was allowed for the utilitarian effect of the plea of guilty.Price J rejected that the offence arose from the prisoner’s heroin addiction, so that the sentence for manslaughter should be made partially concurrent with the sentence for the supply prohibited drug offence. As the two offences represented discrete and independent acts of criminality, Price J held that partial accumulation would not adequately reflect the criminality of the offence of manslaughter.Held per the CourtGround 1: the sentence imposed by Price J was within the appropriate discretionary range1. The taking of a human life amounting to manslaughter calls for very severe punishment: [21]. 
    2. There is no fixed sentence for manslaughter and the offence is one where the objective gravity can vary in significant degrees: [21]-[22].

    Ground 2: there was no error by the trial judge in refusing to partially accumulate the sentence for the manslaughter offence5. Having regard to the principle of totality of the sentences to be imposed, Price J maintained an appropriate relationship between the totality of the criminality involved in Mr Lu’s offending, and the totality of the sentences to be imposed: [58]-[61], [66].

     Hoang Quang LU v Regina 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: The applicant, Hoang Quang Lu, seeks leave to appeal against sentence imposed upon him by his Honour Price J on 9 November 2007 following his plea of guilty for the manslaughter of Phillip Anthony Rousianos on 1 October 2005. Mr Lu had been indicted for the murder of Mr Rousianos, to which he pleaded not guilty. However, on 15 August 2007, being the first day of trial, he entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter, which was accepted by the Crown in full discharge of the charge on the indictment. 
     
      
    2 The crime of manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment: Crimes Act 1900, s 24. Price J sentenced the applicant to a total term of imprisonment of 9 years 4 months, comprising a non-parole period of 6 years 2 months to commence on 30 April 2009 and to expire on 29 June 2015, together with a balance of term of 3 years 2 months, expiring on 29 August 2018. 
     
      
    3 At the time of sentence, Mr Lu was serving a sentence for supply prohibited drug that had been imposed by Maguire DCJ on 26 May 2006. Maguire DCJ imposed a total term of imprisonment of 4 years 8 months for that offence, with a non-parole period of 3 years 7 months. The sentence and non-parole period commenced on 2 November 2005. The non-parole period expires on 1 June 2009.  
     
      
    4 Price J, after giving credit for a period of 32 days served in custody for the offence of manslaughter, effectively commenced Mr Lu’s sentence for this offence at the expiration of the non-parole period for the supply prohibited drug offence. 
     
      
    5 Mr Lu seeks leave to appeal on the basis that some other lesser sentence was warranted in law. He raises two proposed grounds of appeal: first, that the sentence imposed was too severe; and secondly, that his Honour erred in failing to partially accumulate the sentence on the earlier sentence imposed by Maguire DCJ.  
     
      
    6 Price J made findings of fact for the purposes of sentencing Mr Lu in accordance with the following agreed facts. The deceased was killed on 1 October 2005, when he was stabbed on the front porch of premises into which he had run to escape from Mr Lu and another person, who were chasing him. At the time, Mr Lu was armed with an iron bar. Mr Lu and the other person jumped over the fence of the property into which the deceased had fled and surrounded him. The deceased kicked out at Mr Lu, who then punched the deceased in the face. It was agreed at the sentencing hearing before his Honour that the other person produced a knife and fatally stabbed the deceased. That person was later tried separately and was acquitted. 
     
      
    7 The attack on the deceased came about one month after there had been an altercation between the deceased and Mr Lu’s girlfriend, Ms Hudson. That had occurred when, in the early hours of the morning, the deceased and his girlfriend, Ms Malcolm, had driven to Mr Lu’s premises. Ms Malcolm had knocked on the door of the premises, which had been opened by Mr Lu’s girlfriend, Ms Hudson. The two women had an argument, Ms Malcolm wanting Mr Lu to be woken up so she could speak to him directly. Ms Malcolm returned to the car, but was followed out of the house by Ms Hudson. The argument between the two women continued and there was a physical confrontation between them.  
     
      
    8 The deceased got out of his car and punched Ms Hudson. Mr Lu emerged from the house and there was a physical altercation between Mr Lu and the deceased. During that altercation, Mr Lu was punched and kicked by the deceased, whilst he was on the ground. Ms Hudson had to intervene, to stop the deceased from kicking Mr Lu. In the course of this, the car in which the deceased and Ms Malcolm had driven to the premises rolled backwards and over Ms Malcolm, injuring her. 
     
      
    9 The deceased and Ms Malcolm left and returned to their home unit. Shortly thereafter, Mr Lu arrived, wielding a machete. Mr Lu confronted the deceased, raising the machete towards him. At that point, the deceased’s father and younger brother intervened and Mr Lu backed off, but not before making death threats towards the deceased. Mr Lu then left.  
     
      
    10 The circumstances immediately preceding the stabbing of the deceased occurred when Mr Lu was driving along Lachlan Street, Liverpool and saw the deceased and the deceased’s mother and brother walking along the street. Mr Lu returned to his home, where the other person was at the time. Mr Lu and the other person then drove back to where Mr Lu had last seen the deceased. They did so, having agreed to attack the deceased, assault him and occasion him actual bodily harm. They found the deceased, his mother and brother, still walking along the street. Mr Lu and the other person jumped out of the vehicle, Mr Lu holding the iron bar which had been in his vehicle, and began yelling at the deceased. The deceased ran and the attackers chased him. 
     
      
    11 His Honour identified the unlawful and dangerous acts which substantially contributed to the death of the deceased as including a threat of violence to the deceased, occasioned when Mr Lu waved an iron bar at the deceased whilst he was standing at the side of the fence. At that time, the deceased was on the porch of the residence knocking on the front door seeking help. Both Mr Lu and the other person then jumped over the fence and surrounded the deceased. His Honour also referred to Mr Lu’s actual violence in punching the deceased in the face.  
     
      
    12 His Honour found that this was “an objectively serious offence of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. His Honour considered that Mr Lu was motivated by a desire for revenge for what had occurred a month earlier in the incident involving Mr Lu’s girlfriend. His Honour sentenced him on the basis that his offending did not involve an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased, or reckless indifference to human life. Central to that finding was that there was no suggestion Mr Lu knew that the other person was in possession of a knife which he would use to fatally stab the deceased. Rather, his Honour considered Mr Lu intended that he and the other person would assault the deceased and occasion actual bodily harm.  
     
      
    13 Senior counsel for Mr Lu had submitted to the trial judge that the confrontation at Mr Lu’s home a month prior, occurred when the deceased had gone there to obtain prohibited drugs. It was suggested that the reason Mr Lu could not report the assault upon his girlfriend to police was because of his own involvement in that criminal activity. His Honour rejected this as a matter of mitigation. His Honour pointed out that neither Mr Lu’s involvement in criminal activity, nor the assault upon him and his girlfriend, could justify Mr Lu taking the law into his own hands and seeking to exact physical revenge: see R v Buddle [2005] NSWCCA 82 per Wood CJ at CL at [11]. 
     
      
    14 His Honour next referred to the applicant’s lengthy criminal history, which commenced in 1990 and included driving offences, a series of break enter and steal offences, the possession of house breaking implements, drug offences and robbery in company. 
     
      
    15 His Honour stated that this criminal history deprived Mr Lu of any consideration of leniency to which he may have been entitled, if the current offence had been an isolated act of criminality. His Honour considered that having regard to Mr Lu’s criminal history, he would give more weight to considerations of personal deterrence and the protection of the community than otherwise would be the case: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; (2006) 66 NSWLR 566; 163 A Crim R 381; R v MAK; R v MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; 167 A Crim R 159.  
     
      
    16 His Honour found as aggravating circumstances the fact that at the time of the offence, Mr Lu was subject to a s 12 bond which he had entered into on 20 June 2005 and that he was on conditional bail for the charge of supply prohibited drug, for which he was sentenced by Maguire DCJ on 26 May 2006.  
     
      
    17 His Honour had regard to Mr Lu’s personal circumstances, including a traumatic early life, when, as a boy of nine, his family had fled Vietnam on a small boat. The applicant had been further traumatised during the boat journey, when the boat capsized and his uncle and younger brother, aged seven, drowned. Mr Lu has been diagnosed by a psychologist, Mr Watson-Munro, who provided an assessment for the purposes of the sentence hearing, as having a post-traumatic stress disorder, which he described as “escalating”. Mr Lu attempted to treat his disorder by self-medicating with heroin, cannabis and alcohol at a high level of intensity. Mr Lu’s drug abuse commenced at age 15. Mr Lu also had a very difficult adjustment to life in Australia. He had last worked in 1992. He is married, but separated, with a 15 year old son with whom he speaks regularly.  
     
      
    18 Although Mr Watson-Munro considered that Mr Lu had been drug-free for an extensive period and that he had developed some insight into his problems, his Honour found that his prospects for rehabilitation were poor. 
     
      
    19 His Honour allowed a discount of 15 per cent for the utilitarian effect of the plea of guilty, which he did not accept had been entered at the first available opportunity. This is not in dispute and it is not necessary to investigate the circumstances in which that plea was entered. His Honour did accept, however, that Mr Lu had shown contrition and remorse for the offence and took this into account as a factor in mitigation: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 21A(3)(i). 
     
      
    20 Finally, his Honour rejected a submission that as this offence arose from the prisoner’s heroin addiction, this sentence should be made partially concurrent with the sentence imposed by Maguire DCJ for the offence of supply prohibited drug. His Honour considered that the manslaughter offence had occurred due to Mr Lu’s desire for revenge and that the two offences represented discrete and independent acts of criminality. His Honour recognised that this was not determinative of whether the sentences ought to be imposed partially, concurrently, or consecutively: see Cahyadi v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 per Howie J at [27]. However, he considered that partial accumulation in this case would not adequately reflect the criminality of the offence of manslaughter. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: the sentence imposed was too severe 
       
      
    21 Senior counsel for Mr Lu acknowledged that there were four important principles to which regard needed to be had in respect of this ground of appeal. First, that a life was lost and that the taking of human life amounting to manslaughter calls for very severe punishment. Secondly, there is no fixed sentence for manslaughter and the offence is one where the objective gravity can vary in significant degrees. As Spigelman CJ observed in R v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377; (2005) 160 A Crim R 1, at [133], the offence is “almost unique in its protean character” and that its objective gravity may vary from “a joke gone wrong to facts just short of murder”. In short, matters of fact and degree arise in all categories of manslaughter: see Forbes at [134].  
     
      
    22 Thirdly, a sentencing judge is given considerable latitude when considering the appropriate sentence and its relationship with other sentences. In Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357, Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ, at [27], once again reiterated that there is no single correct sentence to be imposed in respect of a particular offence: see Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 624 [46]. Their Honours pointed out that judges at first instance were to be “allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies”.  
     
      
    23 In Forbes, Hall J, having noted, at [190], the difficulty in establishing a sentencing pattern in cases of manslaughter, then set out the following propositions that he considered could be derived from other judgments of this Court: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        
       
      
    · The peculiar difficulty in the case of manslaughter is to discern a range of commonly imposed sentences. Sentences for manslaughter vary greatly because of great variations in the circumstances of individual instances of the offence. There have been many statements made by this court to that effect: Kirby, P., (Grove and Newman, JJ. agreeing) said in Regina v. Troja (CCA, unreported 16 July 1991 at p.3):- 
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
           ‘This aspect of sentencing law, as it applies to a person convicted of manslaughter, presents a particular difficulty to an appellate court where it is invited to review the sentence imposed by the trial judge in the exercise of that judge’s discretion. In the vast range of circumstances giving rise to such a sentence, it is difficult to discern any clear pattern or coherent standard. As Wood, J. himself observed, the sentence which is appropriate to each case of manslaughter depends ultimately upon its own special circumstances.’ 
           
          
         
        
       
      
    · Wood, J. (Hunt, CJ. at CL. and Sharpe, J. agreeing) said in Regina v. Morabito (1992) 62 A. Crim. R. 82 at 86:-  
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
           ‘That kind of analysis can be helpful, but the circumstances involving manslaughter being so various, it would be erroneous to place too much store on any sentencing survey, let alone to look for a median or average outcome.’ 
           
          
         
        
       
      
    · In Regina v. Maguire (CCA, unreported 060609/94), James, J. (Grove and Hulme, JJ. agreeing) stated:-  
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
           ‘I agree that if a comparison is to be made between a sentence for manslaughter and other sentences for manslaughter, it will usually be more fruitful to compare the case under consideration with other cases of manslaughter of a similar sort. For example, if the case under consideration is a case of manslaughter by reason of provocation, it will usually be more useful if any comparison is a comparison with other cases of manslaughter by reason of provocation. This was the approach adopted by the Chief Judge at Common Law at first instance in  
           Regina v. Alexander 
           . 
           
          
         
         
          
           
           In some cases of voluntary manslaughter where, apart from the partial defence of provocation or diminished responsibility, the prisoner would have been guilty of murder but the Crown has not succeeded in disproving either provocation or diminished responsibility, a heavy sentence will be appropriate. But there will also be cases of involuntary manslaughter, that is of cases of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act or manslaughter by criminal negligence, where a heavy sentence will also be appropriate. 
           
          
         
        
       
      
    · In Regina v. Woodland [2001] NSWSC 416, Wood, CJ. at CL. (at [27] to [30]) stated:-  
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
           ‘The offence of manslaughter is one for which the maximum available sentence is one of imprisonment for 25 years. The offence involves the felonious taking of human life, and for that reason it has been recognised as a most serious crime:  
           Hill 
            (1981) 3 A. Crim. R. 397 at 402. The value, which the community places upon the preservation of human life, is reflected by the need to have conduct involved in its taking denounced by a sentence appropriate to the circumstances of the case:  
           Macdonald  
           (NSWCCA, unreported 12 December 1995). It is, however, an offence, which involves an excessively wide variety of circumstances, calling for a range of penal and, sometimes, non-penal outcomes, with the consequence that it is difficult to obtain much by way of assistance from reference to the Judicial Commission’s statistics or from other cases:  
           Elliott 
            (NSWCCA, unreported 14 February 1991, per Newman, J.) and  
           Green 
            [1999] NSWCCA 97’.” 
           
          
         
        
       
       
      Hall J also appended to his judgment an analysis of the manslaughter sentences that he had reviewed.  
       
      
    24 Mr Lu draws upon some of these cases as indicating that where sentences similar to that imposed on him were considered, the level of personal culpability of the offender in those other cases had been significantly greater than in his case. The cases upon which he relied to demonstrate this are R v Hung Duc Dang [2001] NSWCCA 321; R v Lewis [1999] NSWSC 131; R v Hoang [2004] NSWSC 205; R v Newman (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Barr J, 3 September 1997, unreported); R v Avakian [2003] NSWSC 1042; and R v Diab [2003] NSWSC 978.  
     
      
    25 The Crown submits that these cases have been chosen selectively and Mr Lu’s reliance on them overlooks significant differences in them as compared to Mr Lu’s circumstances. In particular, the Crown submits that the subjective features of the accused persons and their moral culpability in those cases were different from Mr Lu’s position and mostly more favourable to the accused person.  
     
      
    26 As this is a significant aspect of the approach taken on behalf of Mr Lu in seeking to establish that the sentence imposed on him was manifestly excessive, it is appropriate to consider each of these cases.  
     
      
       
      Diab 
       
      
    27 Mr Diab (Diab) pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 9 years, with a non-parole period of 6 years. The principal offender pleaded guilty to murder by shooting the deceased with a firearm. Diab was present at the shooting and knew that the principal offender was in possession of a loaded and unauthorised weapon, which Diab had purchased. He was also aware that the principal offender intended to threaten the victim: [5]. It was apparent from offences contained on a Form 1 that two days prior to the shooting, Diab had threatened a group of young men with the same firearm.  
     
      
    28 Diab had entered a plea of guilty on the second day of trial, for which the trial judge gave an overall discount of 25 per cent: [45]. There were a number of factors favouring leniency in his case, including that he was young, with strong prospects for rehabilitation. He had also expressed contrition. The trial judge accepted that Diab might not have known that the principal offender had reached for the gun on alighting from the car and that there was a lesser degree of forethought about the possibility of its use: [52]. The trial judge also found special circumstances, based on his age, his less than average academic and reading ability, the absence of any prior criminal history, strong family ties, a work ethic with career prospects, and his contrition evidenced by an early plea of guilty and expressions of remorse: [60]. His Honour also had regard, as an aggravating factor, to the fact that some penalties had been imposed on Diab whilst he was in custody. 
     
      
    29 Leave to appeal against sentence was granted, but the appeal dismissed: R v Diab [2005] NSWCCA 64. 
     
      
       
      Dang 
       
      
    30 Mr Dang (Dang) was tried for murder and was found guilty of manslaughter, for which he was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years 6 months, with a non-parole period of 4 years. This sentence was imposed cumulatively upon sentences for two offences committed at the same time. The total term of imprisonment was 10 years, with a non-parole period of 6 years 6 months. The circumstances of the offence were these. Following the commission of a robbery in company, Dang’s co-offender killed a pursuer who was attempting to detain him. Both offenders were carrying knives and it was in Dang’s contemplation that the co-offender might commit an unlawful and dangerous act with the knife by stabbing someone, other than in self-defence. During the course of the incident, Dang also wounded another person who had followed him. 
     
      
    31 The following factors were relevant to Dang’s sentence: he was young (21 as at the date of sentence); he had no prior criminal history; he came from a good family background and he had a supportive family. The trial judge found special circumstances, including that i) the sentence was to be served cumulatively upon other sentences for fixed terms, which were not themselves subject to any possibility of release on parole, ii) Dang was a youthful first offender who would serve his sentence upon protection, iii) there was a need for counselling to address his lack of insight and drug use, resulting in the non parole period being set to 65 per cent of the total term. 
     
      
    32 On appeal, the Court found that whilst the sentence was a heavy one, it was not outside the legitimate range of sentencing discretion: R v Dang [2001] NSWCCA 321. 
     
      
       
      Lewis 
       
      
    33 Mr Lewis (Lewis) pleaded guilty to manslaughter, which the Crown accepted in full discharge of an indictment of five counts, including murder. He was sentenced for manslaughter to a term of imprisonment of 9 years, with a non-parole period of 6 years. Lewis was involved in a bikie gang, who committed a violent group assault on the victim. The victim had been removed from a club by a security guard and a member of the gang. A scuffle ensued. Lewis joined in the assault and repeatedly delivered blows to the victim’s head with his elbow and fist, causing him to fall face down. Lewis then tried to pin the victim’s arms, and repeatedly kicked him whilst he was on the ground. During this time, three or four other members of the gang joined in. Lewis saw the assailants stomping on the victim, but did not see the victim being stabbed, which ultimately caused his death.  
     
      
    34 Lewis’ participation was aggravated by the fact that at the time of the offence, he was in breach of parole for offences related to malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (by stabbing), for which he had been sentenced to 4 years with a non-parole period of 1 year 11 months; and driving whilst disqualified, for which he had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 6 months: [15] ff. He had also moved cities and assumed a false identity for a year to avoid arrest, before surrendering to police. Lewis accepted that he knew at least some of his fellow assailants were armed with knives and that an assault in such circumstances exposed the victim to an appreciable risk of serious injury by stabbing: [21].  
     
      
    35 The trial judge considered that as a matter of objective criminality, this was a most serious criminal offence, in light of the group assault and the supposed interest of teaching the victim a “lesson” for drunk and abusive behaviour: [24]. Lewis was 25 years and 6 months old at the time of the offence. His Honour considered that he should be given modest credit for his remorse and that he had good prospects for rehabilitation, as he had family support and significant creative, manual skills. However, militating against his prospects for rehabilitation was the risk that Lewis would resume his gang related activities: [31]. His Honour also took into account Lewis’ plea of guilty. His Honour did not quantify any percentage discount in this regard. It should be noted, however, that this decision predated the commencement of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. His Honour found special circumstances, including the risk of imperilling Lewis’ marriage, which was very important to his ultimate rehabilitation, and protection from revenge attacks by fellow inmates: [46]-[47].  
     
      
       
      Hoang 
       
      
    36 Mr Hoang (Hoang) was convicted by a jury of manslaughter and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 8 years 6 months, with a non-parole period of 5 years. Hoang participated in a gang attack, in which two of the victims were stabbed. The attack resulted in the death of one young man and the wounding of another. The trial judge found that it was a deliberate group crime, which involved gratuitous violence and planning by a body of young men, who combined to attack to other young men. Both the attackers and Hoang saw it as an attack of revenge: [30]. 
     
      
    37 Hoang had previous convictions for shoplifting and drug offences, that appeared to relate to his use of cannabis from age 14, and heroin at 15. The trial judge was not convinced that Hoang had ceased contact with his co-offenders and other drug-using peers whilst in custody: [20]. His Honour found special circumstances, based on Hoang’s youth, remorse and positive efforts made in prison: [20]. 
     
      
       
      Avakian 
       
      
    38 Mr Avakian (Avakian) pleaded guilty to manslaughter, which the Crown accepted in full discharge of an indictment for the charge of murder. The plea was entered on the sixth day of the trial, after a request by Avakian for re-arraignment. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 5 years 6 months, with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months. 
     
      
    39 Avakian and three other males had approached the victim and his three friends, two of them female, and asked the victim his name and accused him of stealing mobile phones from children. The victim put his hand on his pocket, and Avakian said, “What’s that a knife? What is a knife going to do against a gun?” Avakian told the deceased he had a gun and pointed a silver object at his head, which Avakian’s friends believed was a gun. It was in fact a mobile phone. Avakian said several times, “Are you prepared to die tonight?” and “You are going to die tonight” or “You are going to cop it”. Avakian and his group began to assault the deceased, during which the deceased was stabbed. Avakian did not stab the victim, nor was he aware that any of his company was in possession of a knife: [9]. In addition to two stab wounds, the deceased suffered multiple bruising, abrasions, lacerations, and a nose fracture: [10].  
     
      
    40 The trial judge found as an aggravating factor that Avakian was acting in concert with a group, with a shared intention to assault the deceased, which carried an appreciable risk of injury: [12], [34]. In addition, the trial judge found that Avakian’s role was pivotal, leading to the escalation of violence: [35]. Further, at the time of the offence, Avakian was subject to periodic detention orders and was on a bond for charges that included maliciously wound, and assault of a police officer: [15], [34].  
     
      
    41 Avakian had suffered abuse as a child by his mother, during which time his father was periodically absent. He had a poor academic and employment record and had been a user of hard drugs from age 15. Around this time, he tried to commit suicide. The trial judge found youth as a mitigating factor, as well as that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity, that there had been some expression of remorse and reasonable prospects for rehabilitation with counselling: [36]-[38]. His Honour found that a discount of 15 per cent was appropriate in relation to the plea, and special circumstances warranted a variation of the statutory proportion between head sentence and non-parole period to facilitate paroled supervision for counselling and drug and alcohol abstention: [47].  
     
      
       
      Newman 
       
      
    42 Mr Newman (Newman) pleaded not guilty to murder, but guilty to manslaughter and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 9 years, with a non parole period of 6 years for the manslaughter offence. 
     
      
    43 The facts were as follows: after the closure of a hotel in the early morning, Newman and a Mr Gash (Gash) and the remaining patrons exited to the street. Gash threatened the two victims and their friends, took out a hunting knife and swung it at a member of the group, chased him and cut him on the chest. The attack momentarily subsided, during which time Newman retrieved an iron pipe from his car and walked back towards the group, making intimidating remarks. Newman raised the pipe and brought it down one victim’s head, causing a 40-50 mm laceration. The deceased pushed Newman to protect his friend, and Gash stabbed him in the back, ultimately causing his death. The offenders threw away their weapons. Newman later recovered the knife, and washed and hid it. 
     
      
    44 It was agreed at the sentence hearing that the stabbing was not completely beyond the scope of the joint enterprise, but was an incident of the commission of the enterprise that Newman had not expected. However, a reasonable person in his position would have realised that he was exposing the deceased to an appreciable risk of serious injury. The trial judge found, at 8: 
     
      
       
        
        “… [Newman] was not the leader of the attack but was willing and alert. He was not the man who did the stabbing and had no intent to do really serious bodily injury or kill. However, he did desire to put [the deceased] in fear and was prepared in doing so to inflict substantial injury short of grievous bodily harm. He was armed and in company.” 
        
       
      
    45 Newman had a criminal history, having been dealt with by the Children’s Court for numerous offences. After being charged with murder and assault in respect of this incident, he was released on bail. However, he breached his bail conditions by committing offences, namely, possession of a dangerous drug; break and enter with intent to commit a felony; and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, for which he was imprisoned for terms totalling 4 years. Newman then escaped from custody, during which he committed further offences and was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment. Later, he was convicted and fined for wilful and unlawful destruction of property. 
     
      
    46 The trial judge found that Newman showed signs of remorse and had assisted police to some extent, but nevertheless had “no particular interest in leading a law abiding life”. Although Newman entered a plea of guilty, the trial judge did not consider it as evidence of contrition. The trial judge made an allowance in the sentence for the fact that Newman would serve the rest of his prison term on protection. 
     
      
    47 As is apparent from this overview, Mr Lu’s sentence is the most severe of the cases relied upon, but only marginally so. However, the other cases involved offenders who were young or relatively young (Lewis was the oldest, being 25 years 6 months). Mr Lu was 32 at the date of the offence and 34 at the date of sentence. Not all had a criminal history and Mr Lu has an extensive criminal history. Most had good prospects of rehabilitation. Mr Lu did not. The offence was aggravated by the fact that Mr Lu was on conditional liberty at the time of its commission.  
     
      
    48 Nothing has been shown, either by comparison with these sentences, or by reference to any other material, that the sentence imposed by his Honour was outside an appropriate discretionary range. Indeed, the sentence imposed by his Honour was an appropriate sentence having regard to the circumstances of the offence, Mr Lu’s age, his prior criminal record and the fact he was on conditional liberty at the time.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2: Did his Honour err in failing to partially accumulate this sentence on an earlier sentence imposed by the District Court? 
       
      
    49 It will be recalled that Mr Lu was on bail at the time he committed this offence in respect of an offence of supply prohibited drug (the drug offence). He was sentenced for that offence on 26 May 2006 to a total term of imprisonment of 4 years 8 months, with a non-parole period of 3 years 7 months. He was serving that sentence at the time his Honour imposed sentence in this matter.  
     
      
    50 In determining the sentence which should be imposed, including the commencement date of sentence for the offence of manslaughter, his Honour had regard to the sentence imposed for the drug offence and to the principles of totality. In doing so, his Honour referred to Mill v R [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59.  
     
      
    51 As already indicated above, his Honour rejected the submission that the manslaughter offence should be considered as being due to Mr Lu’s heroin addiction, so that it should be imposed partially concurrently with the drug offence. 
     
      
    52 His Honour recognised that although he considered both offences to be discrete and independent criminal acts, that was not determinative of whether the sentence ought to be imposed partially, concurrently, or consecutively: see Cahyadi per Howie J at [27]. His Honour held that partial accumulation would not adequately reflect the criminality for the offence of manslaughter: see Johnson v R [2004] HCA 15; (2004) 205 ALR 346 at [18]. 
     
      
    53 Mr Lu contends that his Honour’s failure to allow any period of partial concurrence involved an erroneous exercise of his Honour’s sentencing discretion. It was submitted that it carried an element of double punishment and resulted in a potentially crushing sentence, involving an effective total non-parole period of 9 years 9 months. It was submitted that this was “simply too long in relationship to the combined criminality” of Mr Lu’s crimes. 
     
      
    54 In support of this submission, Mr Lu said that the sentence imposed for the drug offence was a heavy one, as recognised by this Court in Lu v R [2007] NSWCCA 74, at [16]. That submission has to be considered with care. Mr Lu had pleaded guilty to an offence of supply contrary to the provisions of ss 25, 29 and Sch 1 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The maximum penalty for such offences involving less than 250 g was 15 years imprisonment: ss 32(1)(c) and 32(1)(g). The quantity involved in Mr Lu’s case was comparatively small, being slightly more than 24 g. Hulme J (McClellan CJ at CL and Hislop J agreeing) observed, at [11], that the sentence of 4 years 8 months fell within the top 14 per cent of sentences for a plea of guilty imposed for such an offence. Mr Lu’s non-parole period fell within the top 4 per cent. His Honour considered that a quantity of 24 g argued for a lower, rather than a higher sentence, although quantity was not the only relevant factor.  
     
      
    55 Hulme J considered, at [6], that Mr Lu’s subjective circumstances “were not such as to inspire leniency”. His Honour referred to Mr Lu’s long record of offending, his prior periods of imprisonment and the fact he had committed the supply offence whilst on conditional liberty. His Honour noted there was no evidence of contrition and there were poor prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour also noted it was apparent that Mr Lu was a drug dealer. His Honour concluded, at [16], that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Personal and general deterrence, retribution and the protection of the community all argued for a heavy sentence.” 
        
       
      
    56 Mr Lu argues that the factors which disentitled him to leniency in the sentencing for the drug offence, were precisely the same factors as taken into account by Price J in disentitling leniency and justifying the imposition of a heavy sentence for the present matter. He said that having regard to those considerations, it was impossible to isolate a relevant sentencing factor as applying solely to one of the respective offences, or as having only one effect upon the individual sentence. There was, therefore, a real danger that as the factors disentitling him to leniency in each case were the same, that he was disadvantaged by the failure to make the sentences partially concurrent.  
     
      
    57 It was submitted that similar considerations arise when the purposes of sentencing, as now set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, are considered. This submission acknowledged that a sentence for each particular crime had, as a critical component, personal and general deterrence. However, whilst there were strong arguments for saying that general deterrence impacts separately for each discrete offence, the same cannot be said for personal deterrence. It followed that partial concurrence would not have resulted in a less severe effective sentence for the manslaughter. Further, the harm done to the victim would still have been recognised. It was submitted that partial concurrence would have seen Mr Lu adequately punished for each offence, protected the community by removing him from it for a substantial time, denounced his conduct and made him accountable for his actions. 
     
      
    58 Mr Lu also advanced an argument that the unnecessarily lengthy combined sentence which has resulted from the refusal of his Honour to partially accumulate, will not assist in promoting his rehabilitation. Reference was made to the statement of McHugh J in Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 307-308 that a sentencing judge must ensure the aggregation of sentences is a “just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved”.  
     
      
    59 In R v MAK; R v MSK the Court (Spigelman CJ, Whealy and Howie JJ), after referring to this statement of principle in Postiglione, noted that the need to maintain an appropriate relationship between the totality of the criminality involved in a series of offences and the totality of the sentences to be imposed arose for at least two reasons. First, the severity of the sentence was not simply the product of a linear relationship. In this regard, the Court, at [16], adopted the comments of Malcolm CJ in R v Clinch (1994) 72 A Crim R 301 at 306, that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the severity of a sentence increases at a greater rate than any increase in the length of the sentence. Thus, a sentence of five years is more than five times as severe as a sentence of one year. Similarly, while a sentence of seven years may be appropriate for one set of offences and a sentence of eight years may be appropriate for another set of offences, each looked at in isolation, where both sets were committed by the one offender a sentence of 15 years may be out of proportion to the degree of criminality involved because of the compounding effect on the severity of the total sentence of simply aggregating the two sets of sentences. 
        
       
      
    60 Secondly, an extremely long total sentence may be “crushing” to the offender, which in turn increases the severity of the sentence. It also “destroys such prospects as there may be of rehabilitation and reform”: see at [17]. 
     
      
    61 The Court in MAK warned, at [18], that the sentencing court must take care in applying the totality principle. Questions of public confidence in the administration of justice meant that it was necessary to avoid any suggestion that the effect of the totality principle was to provide some kind of discount for multiple offending. Further, it must be apparent that when an offender who is already serving a sentence comes to be sentenced for additional offences, the impression must not be given that little or no penalty is imposed for the additional offences. 
     
      
    62 In this case, Mr Lu does not contend that the sentence should be substantially accumulated on the existing sentence. However, he does submit that some modest accumulation was required to avoid a crushing sentence and the risk of double counting. In advancing this submission, he acknowledged the flexibility which must be given to judges at first instance when imposing sentence: see Johnson per Gummow, Callinan and Hayne JJ at [26]. 
     
      
    63 The Crown submits that no appellable error has been shown in his Honour’s failure to partially accumulate the sentence on the drug offence. It submitted that there was effectively an accumulation when regard was had to the total sentence. This submission, however, does not address the issue raised by Mr Lu, who seeks partial accumulation on the non-parole period.  
     
      
    64 Focussing on that question, the Crown particularly emphasises the seriousness of Mr Lu’s conduct in committing the offence whilst on bail: see R v WHS (NSWCCA, Hunt CJ, Smart and McInerney JJ, 27 March 1995, unreported); R v Richards [1981] 2 NSWLR 464 at 465 per Street CJ. See also R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109, where Wood CJ at CL, with whom Spigelman CJ, Newman, Hulme and Simpson JJ agreed, said, at [15]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Betrayal of the opportunity for rehabilitation offered through probation or parole, or of provisional release on bail, is regarded very seriously and should here have been weighed against the respondent.” 
        
       
      
    65 The Crown also points out that in this case, the offence was further aggravated by the fact that it was committed at a time when Mr Lu was serving a suspended sentence imposed by Barrett J in the Drug Court (for an offence different from that imposed by Maguire DCJ for the drug offence).  
     
      
    66 This aspect of the appeal has not been easy to resolve. The matters advanced by Mr Lu invoke important principles which he is entitled to have taken into account in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. Likewise, the principle, repeatedly stated by this Court in cases such as WHS, Richards and Tran is of fundamental importance to the protection of the community. The question for consideration by this Court is where the proper balance lies. Mr Lu has, for a period spanning 15 years, shown a disregard of the law. His prior offending has not been trivial. It has included an offence of assault, drug related offences and break enter and steal offences. His conduct in this case demonstrated that he was prepared to carry out a personal act of revenge intending to occasion actual bodily harm to the deceased. Mr Lu has had several periods of imprisonment, none of which has deterred his criminal activity. He has committed offences whilst on bail and whilst on a suspended sentence. In all of the circumstances, the principles stated in WHS, Richards and Tran have particular application in this case. There was no error in the trial judge, after a considered decision, refusing to partially accumulate the sentence he imposed in this matter on the sentence imposed in respect of the drug offence. 
     
      
    67 In the circumstances, we would grant leave to appeal against sentence, but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    68 Accordingly, the orders of the Court are: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal against sentence granted; 
       
       
      2. Appeal dismissed.

     OLIVIA MARKO v GREGORY FALK 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCOLL JA: The appellant, Olivia Marko, brought proceedings to recover damages against the respondent, Dr Gregory Falk, a surgeon specialising as an upper gastrointestinal surgeon endoscopist, alleging he had been negligent and in breach of contract in performing a procedure known as an upper endoscopy (gastroscopy) on her. The respondent located a sessile polyp in the appellant’s duodenum (the first portion of the small intestine) during the endoscopic examination and removed it piecemeal using a process of cauterising the polyp with a diathermy current. The respondent perforated the appellant’s duodenum during the process of removing the polyp. The perforation was not discovered at the time of the operation. Sepsis occurred, resulting in the appellant requiring further medical attention and leaving her with ongoing problems. 
     
      
    2 The proceedings were commenced in the District Court of New South Wales in May 2001. It appears that at some stage, not disclosed by the appeal papers, they were transferred to the Supreme Court’s Professional Negligence List. It was common ground that they were not subject to the Civil Liability Act 2002: see Schedule 1, cl 2(2)(a). 
     
      
    3 It appears to be common ground that the perforation of the appellant’s duodenum occurred in the following manner. If during the process of cauterising the polyp using the diathermy method the wall of the duodenum is burnt by the electric current, necrosis ensues. The cells in the duodenum die and within a day or two as a result of necrotic breakdown, the tissue of the duodenum crumbles and the contents of the duodenum spill into the abdomen leading to sepsis. 
     
      
    4 At trial the appellant’s case was that the respondent was negligent in (1) undertaking three surgical procedures under the same anaesthetic, (2) the sequencing of the procedures, (3) failing to warn or advise of the risks of the operation pre-operatively, (4) failing to defer the removal of the polyp, and (5) in the performance of the endoscopy. 5 Hislop J found in favour of the respondent on liability. As to the last way in which the appellant advanced her case, he concluded that the decision as to the method used to remove the polyp was a matter for the respondent’s clinical judgment. Expert evidence, accepted by his Honour, supported the proposition that it was appropriate for the respondent to remove the polyp piecemeal using the diathermy method. There was also evidence from both parties’ experts that a perforation could occur during the removal process without negligence on the respondent’s part. 
     
      
    6 The primary judge entered verdict and judgment for the respondent and ordered the appellant to pay the respondent’s costs: Marko v Falk [2007] NSWSC 14. In the event he had erred on the issue of liability, he assessed damages. It was agreed on appeal that the damages his Honour would have awarded had the appellant succeeded on liability (after undertaking calculations required by the terms of his order) would have been $797,956.91. 
     
      
    7 On appeal the appellant relied on a narrower case than that she had advanced at trial. She contended that the respondent was negligent because he removed a large sessile polyp piecemeal by an endoscopic procedure. She contended the Court could make a finding without recourse to expert evidence, and despite the expert evidence to the contrary, that the respondent was negligent in the manner in which he removed the polyp. 
     
      
       
      Statement of the case 
      
    8 In January 1996 the appellant was diagnosed as having a gallstone. She was offered, but declined, a cholecystectomy (surgical removal of the gallbladder). In September 1999 she had a severe attack of pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Ultrasound confirmed the presence of a gallstone. Her general practitioner referred her to the respondent for cholecystectomy.  
     
      
    9 She consulted the respondent on one occasion only before the operation. The primary judge made detailed findings about that consultation (primary judgment at [10]). Having regard to the narrow issue to which the appeal in liability is confined, it is unnecessary to set out those findings. It is sufficient to note that the respondent formed the view the appellant was very frightened of anaesthetic and only wanted to have one anaesthetic. She told him that she would not come back and have two separate anaesthetics: primary judgment (at [10(e)]). 
     
      
    10 At the conclusion of the consultation the respondent or his staff gave the appellant patient information brochures in relation to each of the three procedures. These were relevant to the failure to warn case. The appellant said she read these documents after the consultation but before the operation. It was not suggested she was unable to understand the content of the brochures or that she attempted to contact the defendant for clarification of anything in them or in respect of the proposed procedures. Again it is unnecessary to set out the primary judge’s comprehensive examination of their contents: see primary judgment (at [12] – [15]).  
     
      
    11 On 21 December 1999 the respondent performed a cholecystectomy, a colonoscopy and an upper endoscopy upon the appellant. The procedures were performed consecutively whilst the appellant was under a general anaesthetic. The upper endoscopy revealed a sessile polyp in her duodenum.  
     
      
    12 A polyp is a mass composed of neoplastic tissue or other structure. It comprises a head on a long stalk (peduncle or pedicle). The stalk varies in dimension from polyp to polyp. A sessile polyp is one which is attached by a broad base, rather than a long stalk: primary judgment (at [18]). 
     
      
    13 The primary judge found (at [19]) that a polyp of the duodenum is rare and will almost inevitably be cancerous or precancerous. They may be removed either by open surgery, by laparoscopic procedure or by an endoscopic snare procedure.  
     
      
    14 The respondent performed an endoscopic snare removal of the polyp, removing it piecemeal. In the course of the procedure the appellant’s duodenum was perforated. As I have said, the perforation was not discovered at that time and sepsis occurred, resulting in the appellant requiring further medical attention and leaving her with ongoing problems. 
     
      
    15 The primary judge found: 
     
      
       
        
        “20 If a polyp is encountered on endoscopy it is necessary to assess its position and the available treatment options. Matters for consideration in this regard are the location of the polyp, the size of the polyp, whether it is pedunculated (this is unusual in a duodenal polyp) or sessile, whether it is of or under the mucosa and if it is obviously cancerous.  
        21 If it is determined to remove the polyp endoscopically then a lasso type structure at the end of the endoscope is placed over the polyp and it is ascertained whether it can close on the stalk or base. If it is able to be closed over the stalk or base then the snare is positioned and a diathermy current is applied to burn through the stalk and thus excise the polyp. The level of application of current is controlled by a foot switch. If the base is too thick for the lasso to close over it then the polyp can be removed piecemeal by snaring portions of it and applying diathermy current with progressive tightening of the snare as it cuts through the tissue. If the polyp is not to be removed then samples for biopsy normally are taken.” 
        
       
      
    16 The primary judge described the notes of the operation and the polyp which was located as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “23 An operation note in respect of the endoscopy states:  
         
          
          Gastro large duodenal polyp snared. Observe for haemorrhage.  
          
         
        24 Two still photographs were taken using the endoscope. One shows the polyp in situ and the other the site after the polyp was removed. The polyp in the photograph was described as quite characteristic of a duodenal polyp. It was located in the second and third parts of the duodenum. It was sessile or partly pedunculated.” 
        
       
      
    17 A number of expert witnesses were called. Professor Williamson, Professor Morris and Associate Professor Bolin gave evidence for the appellant. Their qualifications were set out by the primary judge (primary judgment (at [25])): 
     
      
       
        
        “Professor Williamson was a consultant surgeon in London who had many years experience in complicated surgery of the epigastric area. However it was some 16 years since he had last performed an endoscopy. Professor Morris was a general surgeon who had specialised knowledge of the area involved but did not profess to have any significant experience in the treatment of polyps by way of endoscopic removal. Associate Professor Bolin was a physician who conducted an endoscopic practice.”  
        
       
      
    18 The respondent called evidence from Dr Hugh, a surgeon who conducted an endoscopic practice, and Associate Professor Yeo, a gastroenterology surgeon, who did not do endoscopic polyp removal: primary judgment (at [26]).19 The primary judge referred to the duty the respondent owed the appellant, whether expressed in tort or as breach of an implied term of contract, as stated in Rogers v Whitaker [1992] HCA 58; (1992) 175 CLR 479 (at 483):  
     
      
       
        
        “The law imposes on a medical practitioner a duty to exercise reasonable care and skill in the provision of professional advice and treatment. That duty is a ‘single comprehensive duty covering all the ways in which a doctor is called upon to exercise his skill and judgment’; it extends to the examination, diagnosis and treatment of the patient and the provision of information in an appropriate case. It is of course necessary to give content to the duty in the given case.  
        
       
       
        
        The standard of reasonable care and skill required is that of the ordinary skilled person exercising and professing to have that special skill …” 
        
       
      
    20 Applying that passage, his Honour held that the standard of reasonable care and skill required of the respondent was that of a surgeon specialising as an upper gastrointestinal surgeon endoscopist who practiced at a tertiary referral centre. The appellant does not challenge that conclusion.  
     
      
    21 The primary judge then dealt with the appellant’s case that the respondent breached his duty of care because he undertook three surgical procedures under the same anaesthetic, because of the order in which he performed the three procedures and because he failed to warn or advise of the risks of the operation pre-operatively. He found against the appellant in all three respects. His conclusions in this respect are no longer challenged. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to recount his Honour’s reasons in detail, although some observations he made in the course of dealing with them should be noted. 
     
      
    22 The primary judge found (at [34]) that “[t]he risk of a polyp being encountered was rare [and] [t]he risk that a polyp would be encountered and that a perforation would occur, particularly at the hands of the [respondent], was remote”. Expanding on this proposition, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “37 It was common ground that the finding of a polyp on upper endoscopy was unlikely. Professor Williamson described such a finding as ‘rare’. Associate Professor Bolin, who performed 750 upper gastric tract endoscopic procedures per annum said that in a three year period he had encountered only two duodenal polyps. Professor Morris described it as a rare condition. Dr Hugh described the finding of a polyp such as the plaintiff’s as an extremely unexpected event. The defendant described it as rare.  
        38 There was an acknowledged risk of perforation occurring during upper endoscopic removal of a duodenal polyp. This risk also was rare. Dr Hugh referred to a risk level with colonic polypectomy of between 0.5 – 1% but was a little reserved as to the correlation between colonic and duodenal polyps.  
        39 Thus the risk of the injury to the plaintiff which in fact eventuated required the conjunction of two rare events.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    23 The primary judge made detailed findings about the question whether the respondent should have deferred removal of the polyp and then discussed the options available for its removal with the appellant. They should be set out in full: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Failure to defer removal of the polyp 
        54 The alleged breach in this regard is particularised in the Amended Statement of Claim as follows:  
         
          
          (iv) Failure to restrict the said surgery performed on 21 December 1999 to the cholecystectomy, gastroscopy and colonoscopy procedures, reserving the duodenal polyp removal for an appropriate later time. 
          
         
        55 The plaintiff submitted the defendant’s failure to restrict the surgery by reserving the duodenal polypectomy for a later time was negligent. The proper course, it was submitted, was to complete the visual inspection of the upper gastrointestinal tract and then withdraw the endoscope, without removing the polyp or taking a biopsy, and when the plaintiff had recovered from the anaesthetic to inform her of the findings and the options open to her and obtain her instructions as to the further course to be taken.  
        56 The plaintiff’s submission was supported by Professors Williamson, Morris and Associate Professor Bolin save that each would have regarded it as a necessary procedure to take a biopsy before withdrawing.  
        57 The available options contended for were endoscopic removal or open surgery though laparoscopic surgery was also a possibility. No specialist advocated that nothing be done because of the likelihood the polyp was potentially cancerous or precancerous and the need for its prompt removal was mandatory.  
        58 Professors Williamson, Morris and Associate Professor Bolin advocated open surgery as the preferable way to proceed. This was because it was said to have fewer risks as the polyp could be clearly visualised and more space was available to remove it.  
        59 The defendant did not take the course of withdrawing without removing the polyp. In my opinion it was not incumbent on him to do so. He did not do so because his impression of the plaintiff was that she had a morbid fear of anaesthetic and would not consent to another anaesthetic if the procedure was not completed. In these circumstances he considered that the removal of the polyp was necessary as it was probably either malignant or premalignant. The alternative, advocated by the medical experts qualified for the plaintiff of taking a biopsy and then withdrawing, also involved a risk of harm particularly as a large sample or samples were required to ensure accurate pathology results were obtained. I note the plaintiff did not plead her case in trespass to the person nor was such a case pressed on hearing.  
        60 In my opinion the defendant did not act in breach of duty in removing the polyp and not deferring its removal.  
        61 If I am wrong in that conclusion the question of causation of injury would need to be considered.  
        62 The evidence of the plaintiff bearing on this question was:  
         
          
          ‘Q. Had surgery been required as a result of that endoscopy, what did you have in mind? 
          A. I presume that after Dr Falk had a look and if he thought there was something to be, I needed the surgery, I would like him to explain the reason for it and what sort of surgery it would be. 
          Q. And if there were optional versions of the surgery, in other words if you could do something endoscopically or if he had to do open surgery, what was your view about discussing that with the doctor as well? 
          A. Well, if there was an open surgery required I would accept it because I would have thought about the possibility of open surgery for gallbladder.’ 
          
         
        63 On the available evidence the defendant, if he had deferred removal of the polyp and was properly advising the plaintiff would have told her:  
         
          
          (a) he had found a duodenal polyp which should be removed; 
          (b) there were three ways to remove it: 
          (i) endoscopic snaring – he would be comfortable in removing it endoscopically. There was a risk of perforation but this was unlikely and had never occurred in any such procedure performed previously by him. Endoscopic removal would not cause any visible scarring and she would be back at work in 1 – 2 days; 
          (ii) laparoscopy – this was a technically difficult procedure and he would prefer endoscopic snare removal. This procedure would result in minor scars and a period off work of 4 – 5 days; 
          (iii) open surgery – this would enable the polyp to be clearly visible but involved some risks and would leave a relatively large scar. It would result in a greater period of absence from work. 
          
         
        64 In my opinion reasonable care did not require the defendant to advise open surgery, or laparoscopic surgery in preference to endoscopic snaring. The laparoscopic procedure was technically difficult and  
        there was no clear cut advantage in having open surgery as opposed to endoscopic surgery where the latter was performed by an experienced and skilled endoscopist which the defendant, in my opinion, undoubtedly was. All procedures involve risks. Professor Morris indicated that in addition to scarring with open surgery there was a risk of wound dehiscence, peritonitis and sepsis as well as anaesthetic risks. 
         Associate Professor Bolin was of the opinion that risks of surgical removal of a duodenal polyp were less than an endoscopic polypectomy:  
         
          
          ‘… unless you practice in a centre where there is a huge experience in removing these things and you act as a tertiary referral centre, so patients are sent from all around the State or from other countries.’ 
           
          
         
        The defendant, of course, performed polypectomies in tertiary referral circumstances 
         with referrals of difficult cases to him from Sydney and throughout the State. Associate Professor Bolin was unaware that the defendant operated in such a centre.  
        The difference between the experts on this question was primarily one dependant upon their area of practice. As Professor Williamson accepted, it was a matter for clinical judgment as to which procedure should be performed. 
        65 In my opinion it is probable the plaintiff would have instructed the defendant to proceed with an endoscopic snare removal which would entail the same risks as if the procedure had been carried out initially. Deferring the procedure would have simply exposed the plaintiff to additional risks involved in taking a biopsy during the first procedure.  
        66 The plaintiff’s evidence recorded at [62] above does not establish she would have instructed the defendant to take some other course than endoscopic removal of the polyp. Nor should it be inferred. In my opinion the plaintiff has not established causation. I do not uphold this head of liability.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    24 Importantly, the primary judge held that even if the respondent had taken the course for which the appellant contended, namely deferred removal of the polyp, she would still have decided that the polyp should be removed by the endoscopic snare method, a method which would have entailed the same risks as if the procedure had been carried out initially. The appellant has not challenged that conclusion.  
     
      
    25 The main thrust of the appellant’s case at trial, as it is on appeal, was that the size of the polyp and its sessile nature made it inappropriate for the respondent to proceed with endoscopic snare removal: primary judgment (at [72]). The appellant’s case was that “the way in which this procedure was carried out just speaks negligence on the part of the defendant”: primary judgment (at [68]). The primary judge said of this submission: 
     
      
       
        
        “69 In an appropriate case the fact of the accident by itself is sufficient in the absence of an explanation to justify the conclusion that most probably the defendant was negligent and that his negligence caused the injury (res ipsa loquitur). However, as Scott LJ said in  
        Mahon v Osborne 
         (1939) 2 KB 14 at 21 - 23:  
         
          
          ‘The presumption of fact only arises because it is an inference which the reasonable man knowing the facts would naturally draw, and that is in most cases for two reasons: 
          (i) because the control over the happening of such an event rested solely with the defendant, and 
          (ii) that in the ordinary experience of mankind such an event does not happen unless the person in control has failed to exercise due care … 
          How can the ordinary Judge have sufficient knowledge of surgical operations to draw such an inference … what does he know of ‘the ordinary course of things’ in a complicated abdominal operation?’ 
          
         
        70  
        That res ipsa loquitur has no application in this case is underscored by the medical evidence that injury such as occurred could occur in the course of a polypectomy without negligence on the part of the surgeon. As Professor Williamson accepted, diathermy injury can occur in the best of hands and was not necessarily the result of substandard care and there was a fine balance between arresting haemorrhage and destroying the tissue to remove the polyp. 
          
        71 It is thus necessary, if the plaintiff is to succeed, for her to establish by reference to the evidence, a negligent act or omission on the part of the defendant.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    26 The primary judge found (at [72]) that there was no evidence that there were any contraindicators for snare removal by reason that the polyp was obviously malignant or that the duodenum wall moved when the polyp was moved. 
     
      
    27 His Honour then considered the evidentiary debate about the size of the appellant’s polyp. This was relevant to the question whether there was a positive association between polyp size and perforation risk: primary judgment (at [73]). Professor Williamson, Professor Morris and Associate Professor Bolin gave evidence that such a relationship existed. According to them, the larger the polyp the greater the risk as more diathermy was required. The respondent accepted that there was a correlation between the size of the polyp and the degree of hazard. Dr Hugh did not accept such a relationship. In his view there was no medical data to establish a positive association between polyp size and perforation risk. His Honour noted that Professor Morris accepted that it was speculation on his part whether the perforation occurred because it was a large polyp, because a perforation can occur even in the smallest polyp: primary judgment (at [74]).  
     
      
    28 The primary judge accepted the respondent’s evidence that the polyp was in the order of 2 centimetres in diameter: primary judgment (at [83]). There is no challenge to this finding.  
     
      
    29 The respondent’s evidence was that he used the endoscopic snare procedure to remove polyps up to 2 centimetres: primary judgment (at [77]). It was his usual practice to use a blended current for diathermy, which reduced the likelihood of a burn injury, and to remove large polyps piecemeal further reducing the risk of a burn injury. He said he had removed the appellant’s polyp piecemeal: primary judgment (at [79]).  
     
      
    30 The primary judge recorded the evidence of two of the appellant’s experts concerning the respondent’s method of removing the polyp: 
     
      
       
        
        “79…Professor Williamson accepted that one way of obviating the risk when you have a large sessile polyp is to do piecemeal surgery. Professor Morris accepted many sessile polyps could be removed safely endoscopically and agreed piecemeal removal could decrease the risks of full thickness burns.” 
        
       
      
    31 There were no guidelines and no specific standards as at December 1999 as to the size and type of polyp which might be endoscopically removed by the snare procedure. There was evidence that at the time of trial duodenal polyps up to 4 centimetres in diameter were routinely removed by the endoscopic snare procedure: primary judgment (at [80]).  
     
      
    32 Both Professor Williamson and Associate Professor Bolin accepted that the decision to do endoscopic removal of the polyp was a matter of clinical judgment for the respondent based on what he observed and in the light of his skills and experience as to whether it was safe to excise the polyp in this manner: primary judgment (at [81] – [82]).  
     
      
    33 Dr Hugh also considered it was a matter for clinical assessment at the time by the surgeon to determine if it was safe to remove the polyp endoscopically: primary judgment (at [84]). In his view, the respondent’s actions in removing the polyp were reasonable. Associate Professor Yeo considered the snare removal fully justified and that the respondent’s care was of the highest standard: primary judgment (at [84]).  
     
      
    34 The primary judge found that the respondent was skilled and experienced in his area of expertise and, indeed, was more experienced than any other witness. He concluded that the respondent’s decision to remove the polyp endoscopically involved an exercise of his clinical judgment based on his observations, skill and experience: primary judgment (at [83]).  
     
      
    35 The primary judge noted that the technique of polypectomy had a risk of perforation due to electrical cautering as there was necessarily some element of imprecision in the application of the current. He found that the fact that a burn occurs did not indicate excessive diathermy as appropriate diathermy may cause a perforation. He concluded the evidence did not establish a lack of reasonable care in the application of the current by the respondent: primary judgment (at [86]). 36 The primary judge considered Professor Williamson’s evidence that it may have helped to inject the mucosa with saline to lift off the sessile polyp as an alternative to piecemeal removal. Associate Professor Bolin said that the use of that technique could have decreased the risk of perforation. However, he accepted that the technique had been in evolution “in the last 7-8 years” (I assume that means up to the year of trial in 2006) and may not have been known in 1999. Dr Hugh and Associate Professor Yeo said the use of saline injections was not common practice.  
     
      
    37 The primary judge accepted that the use of saline injections was not common practice in the medical profession in Australia at the relevant time: see primary judgment (at [89], [91]). He held that the fact the respondent was not using saline injections at the time did not bespeak negligence on his part and also that the evidence did not establish that the use of a saline injection would, more likely than not, have obviated the injury which occurred: primary judgment (at [91]). 
     
      
    38 The primary judge concluded that the appellant had not established that the size of the polyp was causative of injury or that the respondent was in breach of his duty of care or contract in the performance of the snare procedure: primary judgment (at [97]). 
     
      
    39 In case he had erred on liability, the primary judge considered the issue of damages. Although the Notice of Appeal generally challenges his Honour’s assessment, in oral submissions the appellant did not pursue the challenge to the award of $180,000 for general damages. I shall, therefore address his Honour’s findings on the issue of economic loss and domestic assistance. 
     
      
    40 There was no doubt that the appellant suffered extensive pain and discomfort as a result of developing sepsis. She was in hospital for approximately four months. She suffered scarring and had to undergo scar revision surgery. She continued to complain of lower back and stomach pains, frequency of bladder and bowel, and headaches. She said she had lost her sense of taste, had difficulty keeping food down and could not eat spicy foods as she had problems with swallowing, digestion and constant reflux. She had been diagnosed with scoliosis when she was 15 or 16, and said she continued to have intermittent back pain up to her hospitalisation, although she said that did not prevent her from doing anything. 
     
      
    41 The appellant resumed work in the latter part of 2000 but said she found she was not able to sit by her computer for more than an hour due mainly to pain in her back and abdomen nor was she able to concentrate for more than an hour. She resigned in 2002 due to health reasons. She said at trial that she was unable to do any work between ceasing her employment in 2002, and 2005. She obtained employment in a travel agency in 2005, working a few hours a day, three days a week. She said she was unreliable as her pain levels caused her on occasions to be unable to attend on the required days. She ceased this work in August 2005 when a full time employee was hired. She had not worked since, and said she did not know what she could do. 
     
      
    42 The primary judge held: 
     
      
       
        
        “118 I would accept that symptomatic spinal pathology pre-existed the perforation but find the symptoms thereof were exacerbated as a result of the plaintiff being nursed in hospital in a banana position and by deconditioning of her musculature during her stay in hospital and convalescence. I would accept the effect of the exacerbation is continuing but decreasing and in time will be overtaken by the underlying degeneration.  
        119 I would accept the plaintiff, as a result of the perforation, has some ongoing stomach pain, abdominal scarring which is distressing to her as she is a woman conscious of her body image, a problem of urinary and faecal urgency which she finds embarrassing though she is normally able to manage the problem and avoid accidents and she suffers from headaches.  
        120 I would accept the opinion of Dr Skinner that the plaintiff is suffering from an adjustment disorder rather than a major depression. This essentially accords with the opinion of Dr Ellard who was qualified on behalf of the plaintiff. I prefer that diagnosis to that put forward by Dr Sokolovic.  
        121 Although the plaintiff effectively asserts she is unable to work and has little social life that is to be contrasted with the fact she able to drive a car and to travel overseas and for a time did share a romantic relationship.” 
        
       
      
    43 His Honour referred to the report of Dr Henke, who was qualified for the respondent, who opined that the appellant had the potential to work 3 – 4 hours per day doing clerical type duties. He agreed with these comments save that in his view, the appellant’s ultimate capacity to work in clerical type duties was likely to be greater than 4 hours per day.44 His Honour also accepted Dr Skinner’s opinion that the appellant would not remain an invalid in her future life with respect to her psychiatric condition. He did not agree that she would remain dependant on psychiatric treatment in the future. 
     
      
    45 Based on those findings, his Honour assessed the appellant’s damages as follows (at [124]): 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) General damages – the defendant suggests a range of $150,000 - $170,000. The plaintiff suggests $220,000. I would award $180,000 with interest at 2% on 2/3 of that sum; 
        (b) Past out of pocket expenses – the plaintiff claims a total of $86,889.19. The defendant objects to $4,930.65 of that claim on the basis the items have not been shown to be a consequence of the perforation. I would award $85,000 together with interest at 6% on such of the monies as were not paid by Medicare; 
        (c) Future out of pocket expenses – the plaintiff claims $219,217.60. The claim comprises: 
         
          
          (i) surgery: $20,000; 
          (ii) pharmaceuticals: $53,721.60; 
          (iii) health store: $145, 496. 
          
         
        The defendant contends there is no evidence to support items (i) and (iii). That appears to be correct. The defendant would allow $10,000 - $15,000 for painkillers and antidepressant medication. I would allow $25,000; 
        (d) Past economic loss – the plaintiff effectively claims total loss of wages from 28 December 1999 to date less the plaintiff’s earnings during that period. The defendant concedes total incapacity to 30 June 2000 and thereafter loss of wages on the basis of a partial incapacity for work calculated at 10 hours per week. The plaintiff was totally incapacitated when undergoing and convalescing from the scar revision surgery in 2001 as well as the initial period of hospitalisation and convalescence. She is entitled to be compensated for total incapacity for those periods. I would also allow total incapacity from 28 December 1999 to 1 January 2001. Otherwise I would allow partial incapacity calculated at 50% of the earnings which the plaintiff would have received from Centrelink if uninjured. I would allow interest on past economic loss at 6%. I would allow past loss of superannuation calculated at 8% of the gross loss of earnings and interest thereon at 6%; 
        (e) Impairment of future earning capacity – the plaintiff claims total loss to age 65 less 15% for vicissitudes. The defendant contends an appropriate award would be a cushion in the amount of $45,000 - $90,000. I would allow impairment of future earning capacity calculated at 50% of the earnings she would have received from Centrelink had she continued to work there and been uninjured. I would calculate the loss to age 62 rather than 65 to allow for the likely effect of the plaintiff’s pre-existing conditions particularly that of the back. I would reduce the figure assessed by a further 10% for remaining contingencies. I would allow future loss of superannuation calculated at 9% of the gross loss of earnings; 
        (f) Past domestic assistance – the plaintiff claims past domestic assistance at an average of 11 hours per week to date. The defendant submits that insofar as part of that claim was for emotional support it is not compensable. The plaintiff expressly did not press that part of the claim. The defendant contends the assessment should be calculated at an average of 3 hours per day from the day the plaintiff was discharged from hospital (12 April 2000) to 12 July 2000 and thereafter at 1 hour per day to 1 November 2002 thereafter nil. The defendant points to the evidence that the cleaner employed by the friend with whom the plaintiff has lived since the end of October 2002 cleans the house, does the ironing and any heavy tasks. It is submitted that in those circumstances the plaintiff is not entitled to compensation for domestic assistance. I would accept the defendant’s submission. I would allow interest on past domestic assistance at 6%; 
        (g) Future domestic assistance – the plaintiff claims future domestic assistance at an average of 11 hours per week. The defendant contends this claim should be rejected. In my opinion the plaintiff would have difficulty in performing heavy cleaning tasks which could give rise to a compensable need if she was to cease to live with her friend or he ceased to employ a cleaner. The plaintiff may have had a need to employ a cleaner herself, irrespective of the perforation due to an increase of disability resulting from to her pre-existing back condition and other problems. In these circumstances I would award the plaintiff assistance for an average of 2 hours per week to age 70.” 
        
       
      
    46 As I have said, after undertaking the calculations required by his Honour’s assessment, the parties agreed that the appellant would have been awarded $797,956.91 if she had succeeded on liability. 
     
      
      Consideration 
       
      
    47 The appellant’s Amended Notice of Appeal agitated five grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. His Honour erred in finding that the Respondent did not breach his duty of care or contract to the Appellant by preferring polypectomy to open or laparoscopic surgery. 
        
       
       
        
        2. His Honour erred in failing to find the Respondent breached his duty of care or contract to the Appellant by removing a large sessile polyp by polypectomy.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        3. Alternatively to Ground 2, His Honour erred in failing to find that the Respondent breached his duty of care or contract to the Appellant in that he removed a large sessile polyp: - 
        [i] without having first injected a saline solution; and/or 
        [ii] without having first secured adequate vision of the polyp’s far side; and/or 
        [iii] whilst engaging the appellant in a colonoscopy procedure; and/or 
        
       
      
     [iv] without inserting a drain at the same time 
     
      
       
        
        4. (a) His Honour erred in not [or not adequately] taking into account evidence of the Respondent in cross examination, which included that large sessile polyps were generally too hazardous to remove by polypectomy. 
        (b) His Honour erred in mistaking the evidence of the Respondent in cross-examination by not assigning to it the categorisation of concession or admission. 
        
       
       
        
        5. His Honour erred in his assessment of damages.” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
       
      
    48 Mr M Neil of Queen’s Counsel appeared for the appellant with Mr C Stewart on appeal, but not at trial. His essential submission was that the Court should conclude that the respondent was negligent in the manner in which he removed the polyp for two reasons. First, because he could not see the far side of the polyp. Secondly, because the inference that he was negligent could be drawn from the fact that the appellant’s duodenum was perforated. The latter submission appeared to agitate the res ipsa loquitur claim the primary judge rejected. Although not expressly referred to in the Amended Notice of Appeal, I am prepared to accept it is possibly subsumed in ground 2 as the appellant’s written submissions contended. The respondent did not complain about it being raised. 
     
      
    49 Mr Neil argued that there was a risk that the duodenum wall would be burnt during piecemeal removal because where a polyp was large and sessile, lack of visualisation of the polyp’s far side meant that it was not possible to know where to put the snare safely. He contended that it could not be assumed that the polyp’s configuration was the same on both sides, so it was not possible in such circumstances to know how far the base of the polyp had invaded the duodenum wall on the far side. In particular, he drew attention to the risk of “tenting”, where the duodenum wall is inadvertently pulled up by the snare so that the duodenum wall, not the stalk of the polyp, is burnt during snare removal. He submitted that piecemeal removal was therefore inappropriate in the circumstances and that the respondent should have completed the endoscopy without removing the polyp.  
     
      
    50 Mr Neil submitted that the evidence bespoke negligence. In his written submissions, he relied on a passage from Professor P B Cotton, Practical Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, (4th ed 1996), Chapter 10 at 298, a work tendered in the respondent’s case which the latter said was a primer for training endoscopists. Under the heading “Polypectomy outside the colon”, the author stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “The wall of the duodenum and small intestine is thin and there is a corresponding need for caution in snaring and electrosurgery…the major indication for duodenal polypectomy is in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis.  
        The large sessile polyps that occur in about 10% of these patients are too hazardous to remove… 
        ” (emphasis added) 
        
       
       
      In the appellant’s written submissions, the word “endoscopically” was inserted in parentheses after the word “remove”. Mr Neil did not explain the basis on which it was suggested that word should be inserted. 
       
      
    51 The passage I have emphasised was that which appeared in the appellant’s written submissions. After extracting that quote, the written submissions argued, “the respondent was never able to explain why in the appellant’s situation, he had acted contrary to such accepted wisdom”. It was submitted that on the basis of that extract alone, there should have been a verdict for the appellant. Alternatively the appellant relied on res ipsa loquitur. 
     
      
    52 A number of comments may be made about that submission which require the passage to be put in the context of the unitalicised passage I have included from Professor Cotton’s work. 
     
      
    53 First, it will be noted that the passage refers to “patients with familial adenomatous polyposis”, a condition Professor Williamson said that the appellant did not have. People with that condition tend to form polyps as a familial trait.  
     
      
    54 Secondly, when this passage from Professor Cotton’s work was put to the respondent, he disagreed with the proposition that it meant the author “regarded large sessile polyps as too hazardous to remove”. He appears to have accepted there was a hazard in the treatment of large sessile polyps, but thought the quote was a generalisation. 55 Thirdly, and more importantly, on page 287 of the same book the following appears:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Problem polyps 
        Sessile polyps 
        Having appreciated the principles of current density in electrocoagulation, it should be obvious why removal of large sessile polyps (Fig.10.29a) or broad-stalked polyps presents problems to the endoscopist. Fortunately, many so-called ‘sessile’ are simply semipedunculated and can be pulled up by the snare onto an adequate and compressible pseudostalk. Having snared a polyp, the closed snare should always be moved to and fro; if the mucosa moves, but not the bowel wall, there is no danger; if the colon moves too, the full thickness of the wall has been ‘tented’ (Fig.10.29b) and the snare should be repositioned to take only a smaller part.  If a polyp base is over 1.5 cm in diameter, without a stalk, the safe course is to take the head piecemeal in a number of bits (Fig. 10.30); each bit can be cut through with no risk of full-thickness burns and little risk of bleeding since the vessels of the head are much smaller than those in the stalk. With the submucosal injection technique described below, however, it may be possible to remove flat sessile polyps up to 1.5 – 2 cm in diameter in a single specimen. 
        
       
       
        
        Sometimes a sessile polyp is better removed by surgery (or laparoscopy), but this should be a matter of expert opinion and clinical judgment; sessile polyps up to 5 cm in diameter can be removed, providing that the hazards and the trauma involved are appreciated by all concerned and that the endoscopist is very experienced. 
         As a rule of thumb it has been suggested that sessile polyps occupying more than one-third of the colon circumference, or involving two haustral folds, are too big for safe endoscopic removal. If in doubt it is better to make repeated piecemeal attempts at different sessions to lessen the chance of full-thickness heat damage to the bowel wall, to give time for histological assessment (surgery will be indicated if any piece contains malignancy) and to allow the site to be checked for recurrent polyp tissue. The endoscopic approach is the obvious one in a patient who is a bad operative risk and is prepared to accept repeated endoscopy. In a younger patient, or if there are technical difficulties, it may be better sometimes to admit that the risks of surgery are not excessive compared to the trials of aggressive endoscopy, which may not remove all neoplastic tissue, or the use of a laser which destroys the evidence.” 
        
       
      
    56 In my view, this passage directly contradicts the appellant’s reliance on the earlier short extract from Professor Cotton’s work. It supports the proposition that the question whether a sessile polyp is removed by surgery, laparoscopy or endoscopy is “a matter of expert opinion and clinical judgment, not that they are “too hazardous to remove” and, further, that if “a polyp base is over 1.5 cm in diameter, without a stalk, the safe course is to take the head piecemeal in a number of bits”, a proposition which was illustrated in Figure 10.30. As I have said, the primary judge accepted the respondent’s evidence that the appellant’s polyp measured approximately 2 cm in diameter. There was no issue that he removed the polyp piecemeal. Accordingly, rather than demonstrating the apparent negligence of the respondent, as the appellant submitted, Professor Cotton’s work supported the proposition that the respondent acted in accordance with accepted practice in removing it as he did. 
     
      
    57 The passage I have emphasised from Professor Cotton’s work also advised that once snared a polyp should be moved to and fro to determine whether in doing so the colon moved as well. If it moved, that demonstrated the full thickness of the wall had been “tented” (i.e. the snare had captured the intestinal wall as well as the polyp) so that there was a risk of mechanical perforation of the duodenal wall if the polyp was removed endoscopically. In this case the respondent performed that test and the appellant’s duodenal wall did not move: see primary judgment (at [72], [94]).  
     
      
    58 Mr Neil also submitted that independently of Professor Cotton’s work and the medical evidence accepted at trial, the Court could hold the appellant must have undertaken the endoscopic removal of the polyp negligently because the appellant’s duodenum was perforated. He argued that Rogers v Whitaker left this course open. 
     
      
    59 In Rogers v Whitaker the defendant was an ophthalmic surgeon who failed to warn Mrs Whitaker, the plaintiff (who was almost totally blind in her right eye) of the possibility that if he operated on her right eye, there was a risk, said to occur only once in approximately 14,000 such procedures, of a development of sympathetic ophthalmia in her left eye. The defendant argued that in not warning Mrs Whitaker of this risk, he was acting in accordance with the standards of the medical profession generally. The High Court held that those standards were not determinative, that he should have warned the patient, and that he was liable to compensate her. 
     
      
    60 In their joint judgment, Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ considered (at 483 – 484) the operation of the “so-called Bolam principle, derived from the direction given by McNair J to the jury in the case of Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee [1957] 1 WLR 582; [1957] 2 All ER 118.” They observed that in Sidaway v Board of Governors of Bethlem Royal Hospital [1985] UKHL 1; [1985] AC 871 (at 881), Lord Scarman stated the Bolam principle in these terms:  
     
      
       
        
        ""The Bolam principle may be formulated as a rule that a doctor is not negligent if he acts in accordance with a practice accepted at the time as proper by a responsible body of medical opinion even though other doctors adopt a different practice. In short, the law imposes the duty of care: but the standard of care is a matter of medical judgment.” 
        
       
      
    61 There was evidence from a body of reputable medical practitioners that, in the circumstances of the case, they would not have warned Mrs Whitaker of the danger of sympathetic ophthalmia. There was also evidence from similarly reputable medical practitioners that they would have given such a warning: Rogers v Whitaker (at 484). 
     
      
    62 Their Honours said that the basis of the Bolam principle lay in the recognition that, “in matters involving medical expertise, there is ample scope for genuine difference of opinion and that a practitioner is not negligent merely because his or her conclusion or procedure differs from that of other practitioners”. They referred (at 484 – 485) to authorities in which the Bolam principle had been applied in cases of competing medical opinion and in which it had been held, in short, that the plaintiff had not discharged the onus of proving the medical practitioner had failed to exercise the ordinary skill of a doctor practising in the relevant field. They considered (at 485 – 486) the division in the House of Lords in Sidaway as to whether the Bolam principle should apply in a case concerning an allegation of failure to warn a patient of inherent risks of proposed treatment. The majority of the House of Lords in Sidaway (Lord Scarman dissenting) held that it did. 
     
      
    63 They then referred (at 486 – 487) to shortcomings in the application of the Bolam principle in cases involving the provision of advice or information. In such cases, if it was applied, then “even if a patient asks a direct question about the possible risks or complications, the making of that inquiry would logically be of little or no significance; medical opinion determines whether the risk should or should not be disclosed and the express desire of a particular patient for information or advice does not alter that opinion or the legal significance of that opinion”. 
     
      
    64 In their Honours view (at 487, footnotes omitted): 
     
      
       
        
        “In Australia, it has been accepted that the standard of care to be observed by a person with some special skill or competence is that of the ordinary skilled person exercising and professing to have that special skill. But, that standard is not determined solely or even primarily by reference to the practice followed or supported by a responsible body of opinion in the relevant profession or trade. Even in the sphere of diagnosis and treatment, the heartland of the skilled medical practitioner, the  
        Bolam 
         principle has not always been applied. Further, and more importantly, particularly in the field of non-disclosure of risk and the provision of advice and information, the  
        Bolam 
         principle has been discarded and, instead, the courts have adopted the principle that, while evidence of acceptable medical practice is a useful guide for the courts, it is for the courts to adjudicate on what is the appropriate standard of care after giving weight to ‘the paramount consideration that a person is entitled to make his own decisions about his life’.” 
        
       
      
    65 The Court considered and approved F v R (1983) 33 SASR 189 in which King CJ held that expert medical evidence could not exclusively determine whether a medical practitioner had been negligent in failing to warn a patient of the risks in an operative procedure. They then said (at 489, footnotes omitted): 
     
      
       
        
        “Acceptance of this approach does not entail an artificial division or itemization of specific, individual duties, carved out of the overall duty of care. The duty of a medical practitioner to exercise reasonable care and skill in the provision of professional advice and treatment is a single comprehensive duty.  
        However, the factors according to which a court determines whether a medical practitioner is in breach of the requisite standard of care will vary according to whether it is a case involving diagnosis, treatment or the provision of information or advice; the different cases raise varying difficulties which require consideration of different factors 
        . Examination of the nature of a doctor-patient relationship compels this conclusion.  
        There is a fundamental difference between, on the one hand, diagnosis and treatment and, on the other hand, the provision of advice or information to a patient. In diagnosis and treatment, the patient's contribution is limited to the narration of symptoms and relevant history; the medical practitioner provides diagnosis and treatment according to his or her level of skill. 
         However, except in cases of emergency or necessity, all medical treatment is preceded by the patient's choice to undergo it. In legal terms, the patient's consent to the treatment may be valid once he or she is informed in broad terms of the nature of the procedure which is intended. But the choice is, in reality, meaningless unless it is made on the basis of relevant information and advice. Because the choice to be made calls for a decision by the patient on information known to the medical practitioner but not to the patient, it would be illogical to hold that the amount of information to be provided by the medical practitioner can be determined from the perspective of the practitioner alone or, for that matter, of the medical profession.  
        Whether a medical practitioner carries out a particular form of treatment in accordance with the appropriate standard of care is a question in the resolution of which responsible professional opinion will have an influential, often a decisive, role to play 
        ; whether the patient has been given all the relevant information to choose between undergoing and not undergoing the treatment is a question of a different order. Generally speaking, it is not a question the answer to which depends upon medical standards or practices…” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    66 Gaudron J expressed concern (at 492) about a duty of care for medical practitioners expressed as a “single comprehensive duty” covering diagnosis, treatment and the provision of information and advice. Such a statement, in her view, said “ nothing worthwhile … as to the content of the duty” and “fails to take account of the considerable conceptual and practical differences between diagnosis and treatment, on the one hand, and the provision of information and advice, on the other.” She said (at 492 – 493, footnotes omitted): 
     
      
       
        
        “The duty involved in diagnosis and treatment is to exercise the ordinary skill of a doctor practising in the area concerned. To ascertain the precise content of this duty in any particular case it is necessary to determine, amongst other issues, what, in the circumstances, constitutes reasonable care and what constitutes ordinary skill in the relevant area of medical practice. These are issues which necessarily direct attention to the practice or practices of medical practitioners. And, of course, the current state of medical knowledge will often be relevant in determining the nature of the risk which is said to attract the precise duty in question, including the foreseeability of that risk.  
        The matters to which reference has been made indicate that the evidence of medical practitioners is of very considerable significance in cases where negligence is alleged in diagnosis or treatment. However, even in cases of that kind, the nature of particular risks and their foreseeability are not matters exclusively within the province of medical knowledge or expertise. Indeed, and notwithstanding that these questions arise in a medical context, they are often matters of simple commonsense. And, at least in some situations, questions as to the reasonableness of particular precautionary measures are also matters of commonsense. Accordingly, even in the area of diagnosis and treatment there is, in my view, no legal basis for limiting liability in terms of the rule known as ‘the Bolam test’ which is to the effect that a doctor is not guilty of negligence if he or she acts in accordance with a practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of doctors skilled in the relevant field of practice. That is not to deny that, having regard to the onus of proof, ‘the Bolam test’ may be a convenient statement of the approach dictated by the state of the evidence in some cases. As such, it may have some utility as a rule-of-thumb in some jury cases, but it can serve no other useful function.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    67 The plurality cited three decisions in support of the proposition that the standard of care to be observed by a skilled person was not determined solely by reference to practice in the relevant profession or trade. In the first, Florida Hotels Pty Ltd v Mayo [1965] HCA 26; (1965) 113 CLR 588, architects retained to supervise and inspect the execution of certain works in accordance with plans and specifications failed to inspect reinforcing mesh before concrete was poured. When the framework was removed, the slab collapsed, injuring an employee. Evidence was led at the trial of the practice of architects where an obligation for periodic inspection or supervision is accepted. Barwick CJ (with whom Kitto, Taylor and Menzies JJ agreed) described that evidence (at 593) as “[u]seful and persuasive” but not “decisive of the legal obligations which such a retainer as an architect imports”. Windeyer J made similar observations (at 601). Florida Hotels is a case in which Gaudron J’s observation in Rogers v Whitaker about the utility of common sense is clearly pertinent.  
     
      
    68 Albrighton v Royal Prince Alfred Hospital [1980] 2 NSWLR 542 was a case in which the plaintiff was injured during corrective surgery, directed towards straightening and lengthening her spine. The procedure was undertaken at a Sydney hospital under the supervision of an orthopaedic surgeon. The plaintiff called a consulting neurologist who had practised in London, but not in Sydney, who gave evidence for the plaintiff as to the relevant anatomy, normal and morbid, of the significance of the signs which the plaintiff exhibited, and of the risks involved in applying traction in cases where there is a tethering of the spinal cord. The trial judge refused to permit him to give evidence as to what could or ought to be done in cases where the existence of tethering is, in some degree, indicated. The trial judge rejected that evidence on the basis, inter alia, that he was not a Sydney practitioner. The remarks of Reynolds JA (with whom Hope and Hutley JJA agreed), which were footnoted in Rogers v Whitaker (at 487) appear to be directed to the territorial exclusion the trial judge had applied. Thus Reynolds JA said (at 562 – 563): 
     
      
       
        
        “(64) It also, in my view, is based on a wrong assumption that a jury should be directed that, if what is charged as negligence is shown to have been done in accordance with the usual and customary practice and procedure then prevailing in what was called a particular ‘medical community’, they cannot find negligence. This, in my opinion, is plainly wrong, because it is not the law that, if all or most of the medical practitioners in Sydney habitually fail to take an available precaution to avoid foreseeable risk of injury to their patients, then none can be found guilty of negligence. … 
        (65) These obvious facts do not render inadmissible an expression of opinion without temporal connotation as to medical facts and practices, because the conduct in issue occurred one, two, three or nine years earlier….Though evidence of local practice is admissible as to whether what was done constituted negligence, local practice provides no basis for the exclusion of evidence by experts lacking local experience as to the correct way in which a particular treatment should be performed, or whether a particular treatment should be given at all.” 
        
       
      
    69 Nothing in Albrighton, in my view, supports the proposition that in that case the jury could have found the defendants negligent absent medical opinion about the procedure in which the plaintiff was injured. 
     
      
    70 In E v Australian Red Cross Society [1991] FCA 20; (1991) 27 FCR 310, the third case to which the High Court referred, the plaintiff contracted AIDS in 1984 as a result of receiving a post-operative blood transfusion from blood plasma collected by the first and second defendants and administered at the hospital for which the third defendant was responsible. The defendants sought to rely on American practice as to the procedures for collecting blood and, it would appear, devising procedures for excluding high risk donors. Wilcox J (at 357) considered whether, in determining the question of breach of duty by a medical practitioner, the practitioner was “entitled to exoneration if it appears that he or she has acted in accordance with ordinary professional practice”. After discussing Bolam, Sidaway, Albrighton and F v R, he held (at 360) that “whilst evidence of the practice usually adopted by persons in the position of a defendant will generally be of great assistance, and often decisive, the way must be left open to a plaintiff to persuade the court that the practice does not ensure an adequate standard of care”. His observation, in my view, does not advance the jurisprudence on this issue beyond the general statements in Rogers v Whitaker to which I have referred. 
     
      
    71 Mr Neil argued that the Court could conclude the respondent was negligent, notwithstanding the expert opinion accepted by the primary judge to the contrary, first because the appellant’s wall was perforated in the operation. As to this it serves to recall that the primary judge accepted that a perforation was rare, and (at [86]) the opinions given by the experts called by both the appellant and the respondent that perforation of the duodenum wall could occur without any negligence on the respondent’s part. 
     
      
    72 Mr Neil stressed, however, that the Court could reach an opposite conclusion because the polyp was large and was so understood by the respondent, secondly, because it was a sessile polyp and it was so understood by the respondent and thirdly, because the respondent could not observe the other side of the polyp from that which he was observing.  
     
      
    73 The first two propositions do not advance the issue. There was ample expert evidence that a sessile polyp of 2 centimetres in diameter could be removed endoscopically. As to the third point, the respondent agreed he could not see the back of the polyp as he was removing it. However it was never put to him that not being able to see behind the polyp meant it was not safe to proceed. 
     
      
    74 When it is borne in mind that the respondent removed the polyp piecemeal i.e. did not grasp the entirety of it, especially a side he could not see, this point becomes, in my view, as Mr Menzies of Queens Counsel, who appeared for the respondent on appeal, but not at trial, with Ms K Burke submitted, a red herring. Indeed the fragility of this submission was underlined by Mr Neil’s concession that “the problem may well be because the respondent could not see what was on the other side”. He simply did not know – the issue had not been explored at trial – despite six experts, including the respondent, being called. There is no basis, in my view, on which the Court could conclude that the respondent acted negligently in removing the polyp piecemeal without being able to see the other side.  
     
      
    75 The procedure the respondent adopted was that advocated by Professor Cotton to obviate risks during removal of sessile polyps, namely to snare the polyp, move it to check that there was no tenting, then proceed with piecemeal removal. To the extent that inference is available, in my view it favours the respondent. The inference I would draw is that whatever risk may flow from not being able to see the other side of the polyp is obviated by the movement test, and then by its piecemeal removal. 76 Mr Neil submitted that Rogers v Whitaker supported the proposition that if all members of a particular profession were doing something that was not in accordance with what the Court considered to be careful practice, then the Court should say so. That submission was pitched at such a high level of generality as to be meaningless. It fails to recognise the careful distinction all members of the High Court drew in Rogers v Whitaker between diagnosis and treatment, and warning of risks. Mr Neil did not suggest any sensible route by which the Court could impose a view as to careful practice contrary to the medical opinions called on both parties’ behalves.  
     
      
    77 Mr Neil could not refer the Court to any case since (or before) Rogers v Whitaker in which the court had taken the course he propounded in a case which involved clinical judgment in an operational context.78 It will be recalled that the primary judge rejected the appellant’s argument that the accident bespoke negligence in reliance upon Scott LJ’s reasons in Mahon v Osborne [1939] 2 KB 14. His Lordship was of the view that that inference would only be drawn if, inter alia, “in the ordinary experience of mankind such an event does not happen unless the person in control has failed to exercise due care” and queried how a judge could have sufficient knowledge of surgical operations to draw such an inference in a “complicated abdominal operation”. His Honour rejected the appellant’s case in this respect because of the medical evidence that injury such as occurred could occur in the course of a polypectomy without negligence on the part of the surgeon. Mr Neil did not directly address this passage of his Honour’s reasons. For my part I find it compelling in the circumstances of this case.  
     
      
    79 In my view the appellant has not demonstrated any error on the primary judge’s part in dealing with the issue of liability. In my view this was a case where the plurality view in Rogers v Whitaker as to the often decisive role professional opinion may play has strong resonance.  
     
      
    80 I would reject the appeal insofar as it concerns liability.  
     
      
    81 I turn to damages, like his Honour, against the possibility this conclusion is incorrect. 
     
      
    82 The appellant’s written submissions on damages were diffusely expressed. In short they pointed, as the respondent observed, to evidence favourable to the appellant, asserting, baldly, that the primary judge ought to have accepted it. Save to that extent, the submissions did not identify error on the part of the primary judge in undertaking the necessarily evaluative exercise involved in assessing damages.83 Thus the submissions referred to Dr Adler and Dr Henke’s conclusions that the appellant could only work a four hour sedentary day if she could regularly change posture and should her mental state improve. They pointed to the fact that “all medical opinions supported the proposition that the appellant was suffering from depression which had led to her suffering from memory and concentration deficits”. They referred to the appellant’s evidence that these deficits had impeded her attempt to return to employment and asserted that those deficits had not sufficiently improved for her to return, part-time or otherwise, to a non-demanding clerical job.  
     
      
    84 To the extent that the appellant travelled overseas, the written submissions asserted that she did so with the assistance of relatives, suitable travelling accommodation and medication. In short, the written submissions asserted that the appellant was unemployable for all practical purposes and had been so since the operation. 
     
      
    85 Insofar as domestic assistance was concerned, the written submissions referred to Dr Henke’s conclusion that the appellant needed four hours of such assistance a week in 2002. While Dr Henke had opined that that need would reduce as the appellant’s condition improved, the appellant asserted that that improvement did not occur. The appellant submitted that “something between a four hour allowance and the allowances carefully calculated by Ms Henry – minus perhaps, the ‘emotional support’ component – should be awarded for the past up to date and into the future as the appellant’s condition had become chronic”.86 It is apparent from reading the primary judge’s reasons on damages that, in some respects, and contrary to the appellant’s submission, he did not accept her evidence on her level of disability. In this respect, it should be noted, that the respondent’s case was that she had exaggerated her disability, as demonstrated by her ability to travel overseas on a number of occasions, generally by herself.  
     
      
    87 In such circumstances his Honour’s conclusions are to be approached applying the appellate restraint appropriate in such circumstances: Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; (2003) 214 CLR 118 (at [23]) per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ. Thus where a trial judge’s finding depends to any substantial degree on the credibility of the witness, the finding must stand unless it can be shown that “incontrovertible facts or uncontested testimony … demonstrate that the trial judge's conclusions are erroneous” or the trial judge “failed to use or has palpably misused his advantage” or has acted on evidence which was “inconsistent with facts incontrovertibly established by the evidence” or which was “glaringly improbable”: Devries v Australian National Railways Commission [1993] HCA 78; (1993) 177 CLR 472 (at 477) per Brennan, Gaudron and McHugh JJ; Fox v Percy (at [28] – [29]); CSR Ltd v Della Maddalena [2006] HCA 1; (2006) 80 ALJR 458 (at [21]). 
     
      
    88 The appellant did not point to any error of this nature which could undermine the primary judge’s assessment of the appellant’s ability to engage in employment up to trial and into the future, nor her need for domestic assistance. 
     
      
    89 In my opinion the primary judge has not been shown to have been in error in his assessment of damages.

    90 I would dismiss the appeal with costs.
