on appeal from the court of appeal for alberta

                    Criminal
law — Evidence — Circumstantial evidence — Inferences — Reasonable verdict —
Accused found guilty on charge of possession of child pornography —
Whether trial judge erred in his analysis of circumstantial evidence by
requiring that inference supporting conclusion other than guilt be based
on evidence rather than upon lack of evidence — Whether guilty verdict was
unreasonable. 

                    V
was having problems with his laptop computer, so he left it with a repair shop.
The repair technician found child pornography on the laptop. He called the
police, whose search of the laptop confirmed the presence of child pornography.
V was charged with a number of pornography related offences, including
possession of child pornography. The trial judge found that the mainly
circumstantial evidence against V proved guilt on the charge of possession of
child pornography beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial judge also disagreed
with V that the police search of the laptop violated s. 8  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms . The Court of Appeal concluded that the
judge had misstated the current law respecting circumstantial evidence and that
the verdict of guilt based on that evidence was unreasonable. The Court of
Appeal therefore set aside the conviction and entered an acquittal. The Court
of Appeal declined to consider the Charter  issues because its acquittal
of V made those issues academic.

                    Held: The appeal should be allowed, the acquittal set aside and the case
remanded to the Court of Appeal for hearing and disposition of the Charter  ss. 8  and 24(2) 
issues.  

                    No
particular form of instruction to the jury is required where the evidence on
one or more elements of the offence is entirely or primarily circumstantial.
However, where proof of one or more elements of the offence depends solely or
largely on circumstantial evidence, it may be helpful for the jury to receive instructions
that will assist them to understand the nature of circumstantial evidence and
the relationship between proof by circumstantial evidence and the requirement
of proof beyond reasonable doubt. 

                    An
explanation of the difference between direct and circumstantial evidence is
included in most criminal jury charges and rarely causes difficulty. An
instruction concerning the use of circumstantial evidence and the reasonable
doubt instruction have different, although related, purposes. The reasonable doubt
instruction describes a state of mind — the degree of persuasion that
entitles and requires a juror to find an accused guilty. An instruction about
circumstantial evidence, in contrast, alerts the jury to the dangers of the
path of reasoning involved in drawing inferences from circumstantial evidence.
Telling the jury that an inference of guilt drawn from circumstantial evidence
should be the only reasonable inference that such evidence permits will often
be a succinct and accurate way of helping the jury to guard against the risk of
“filling in the blanks” by too quickly overlooking reasonable alternative
inferences. While this Court has used the words “rational” and “reasonable”
interchangeably to describe the potential inferences, there is an advantage of
using the word “reasonable” to avoid the risk of confusion between the
reasonable doubt standard and inferences that may arise from circumstantial
evidence. However, using the traditional term “rational” is not an error as the
necessary message may be imparted in different ways. 

                    A
view that inferences of innocence must be based on proven facts is no longer
accepted. In assessing circumstantial evidence, inferences consistent with
innocence do not have to arise from proven facts. The issue with respect to
circumstantial evidence is the range of reasonable inferences that can be drawn
from it. If there are reasonable inferences other than guilt, the Crown’s
evidence does not meet the proof beyond the reasonable doubt standard. A
certain gap in the evidence may result in inferences other than guilt. But
those inferences must be reasonable given the evidence and the absence of
evidence, assessed logically, and in light of human experience and common
sense. When assessing circumstantial evidence, the trier of fact should
consider other plausible theories and other reasonable possibilities which are
inconsistent with guilt. The Crown thus may need to negative these reasonable
possibilities, but certainly does not need to disprove every possible
conjecture which might be consistent with innocence. Other plausible theories
or other reasonable possibilities must be based on logic and experience applied
to the evidence or the absence of evidence, not on speculation. 

                    The
Court of Appeal found that the trial judge erred because he failed to consider
reasonable inferences inconsistent with guilt that could have arisen from a
lack of evidence. While there are certainly some problematic statements in the
trial judge’s reasons, when the reasons are read as a whole and these passages
are read in their proper context, he made no reversible error. The judge
correctly stated the law in relation to circumstantial evidence. Contrary to V,
the judge did not lose sight of proper process of inference-drawing, the
overall burden of proof, or the difference between the standard applied to a
committal for trial and the reasonable doubt standard applied to a finding of
guilt.

                    The
judge’s conclusions that a user of V’s computer knowingly downloaded
pornography and that V was knowingly in possession of
the child pornography that had been saved on his computer were reasonable. While there were gaps in the Crown evidence about V’s possession and
control of the computer, the Court of Appeal’s analysis of these gaps in effect
retried the case. It was for the trial judge to decide whether the evidence of
V’s possession and control, when considered in light of human experience and
the evidence as a whole and the absence of evidence, excluded all reasonable
inferences other than guilt. While not every trier of fact would inevitably
have reached the same conclusion as did the trial judge, that conclusion was a
reasonable one.

judgment of the Court was delivered by

                    Cromwell J. — 

I.             
Introduction

[1]                             
The respondent, Mr. Oswald Villaroman, was
having problems with his laptop computer, so he left it with a repair shop. The
repair technician found child pornography on the laptop. He called the police,
whose search of the laptop confirmed the presence of child pornography. Mr.
Villaroman was charged with a number of pornography-related offences, including
possession of child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(4)  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , the only charge relevant to this appeal.

[2]                             
At trial, Yamauchi J. found that the mainly
circumstantial evidence against the accused proved guilt on the charge of
possession of child pornography beyond a reasonable doubt: 2013 ABQB 279, 562
A.R. 105. The Court of Appeal, however, concluded that the judge had misstated
the current law respecting circumstantial evidence and that the verdict of
guilt based on that evidence was unreasonable: 2015 ABCA 104, 599 A.R. 294, at
paras. 20 and 38. The Court of Appeal therefore set aside the conviction and
entered an acquittal. The Crown appeals, submitting that the Court of Appeal
erred by requiring the Crown in effect to disprove all innocent possibilities
and, more specifically, by requiring the Crown to prove either that the accused
had downloaded the pornography or that he had exclusive access to the computer
where it was stored. The Crown maintains that the judge did not make any legal
error in his treatment of the circumstantial evidence and that the verdict of
guilt was reasonable. The respondent supports the decision and reasoning of the
Court of Appeal and points to a number of what he says are clear legal errors
in the trial judge’s analysis.

[3]                             
I would allow the appeal. As I see it, the trial
judge’s reasons, read as a whole, do not contain any legal errors and his
finding of guilt was reasonable.

II.          
Issues

[4]                             
The Court of Appeal found that the case law in
relation to circumstantial evidence “may not be readily consistent” and “seems
to have changed in very recent years”: paras. 8 and 20. This appeal is an
opportunity to provide any needed clarification. For the purposes of my
analysis, I have found it helpful to approach the case by answering two
questions:

1.              
Did the Court of Appeal err in finding a legal
error in the trial judge’s analysis in relation to the circumstantial evidence?

2.              
Was the guilty verdict unreasonable?

[5]                             
Some issues related to whether the police search
of the laptop violated s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  were
argued at trial and before the Court of Appeal.  The trial judge found that
the police search was lawful (2012 ABQB 630, 557 A.R. 1), while the Court of
Appeal declined to consider the search issues because its acquittal of Mr.
Villaroman made those issues academic: paras. 38-39. On appeal before this
Court, the parties agreed that if we accept the Crown’s position with respect
to the circumstantial evidence, the case should be remanded to the Court of
Appeal to deal with those issues.   I accept the parties’ position and would
remand these issues back to the Court of Appeal.

III.       
Overview of the Facts and Decisions

A.          
Background

[6]                             
Mr. Villaroman took his laptop computer to a
MyMacDealer shop for repairs to the power button and battery. (While it was not
conceded at trial that Mr. Villaroman was the person who delivered the
computer, it is for the purposes of this appeal.) He provided his name,
address, and telephone number to the repair shop. The technician, Alan Sopczak,
examined the computer, which was not password-protected, and identified the
necessary repairs.  He then telephoned Mr. Villaroman, who authorized the work.


[7]                             
After completing some repairs, Mr. Sopczak
checked some files randomly to test whether the computer’s software was
operating properly. While checking the music files, he discovered child pornography
files in the music folder of the iTunes library folder. He thought the number
of files ruled out a random occurrence and called the police, who seized the
computer. Days later, when Mr. Villaroman came to the shop to get the laptop,
Mr. Sopczak informed him that the police had seized it. 

[8]                             
Mr. LaFontaine, a forensic analyst, testified
that there was only one user account associated with the computer, named
“oswaldvillaroman”. The user account was set up on the computer on July 1, 2007
and there had been almost daily activity on it from that date until November
29, 2009, a couple of days before the computer was brought to the shop. 

[9]                             
Mr. LaFontaine’s evidence was that the
computer’s hard drive contained 36 child pornography files: one picture and 35
videos. Two of the file names appeared to be in an Asian language, but all of
the rest suggested or expressly described underage pornographic content.  The
files were downloaded using a peer-to-peer downloading software called
“Limewire”. Eighteen of the videos were partial or incomplete downloads located
in the Limewire “incomplete” folder. Seventeen were complete downloads that
were found, along with the one picture, in the computer’s music folder. The
user had viewed some videos from each folder using two different media-playing
programs. 

[10]                         
Mr. Villaroman admitted that the computer was
his and that the 36 files found on it constituted child pornography as defined
in the Criminal Code . The main factual issue at trial in relation to the
possession of child pornography charge was whether the evidence established
that Mr. Villaroman had been in possession of the child pornography. As the
trial judge noted, this required the Crown to prove that he knew the nature of
the material, had the intention to possess it, and had the necessary control
over it: para. 26, citing R. v.  Daniels, 2004 NCLA 73, 242 Nfld. & P.E.I.R.
290. 

B.           
Trial Findings

[11]                         
The trial judge noted that the Crown’s case
depended on the circumstantial evidence provided by the technician, Mr.
Sopczak, and the forensic analyst, Mr. LaFontaine. Asking himself whether the
inferences drawn from the evidence satisfied him beyond a reasonable doubt that
Mr. Villaroman had committed the offence: para. 43, citing R. v. Lifchus, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320, the
trial judge concluded that they did. He found that Mr. Villaroman “knew the
nature of the material, had the intention to possess it, and had the necessary
control over it”: para. 68. 

C.           
Court of Appeal Decision

[12]                         
The Court of Appeal found that the trial judge
had “misstated the current law” on weighing circumstantial evidence and that
the verdict was unreasonable: para. 20. In the Court of Appeal’s opinion, there
was not sufficient evidence to raise a case for the defence to answer: para.
38.  The conviction was set aside and an acquittal entered. 

IV.       
Analysis

A.          
First Question: Did the Court of Appeal Err in
Finding a Legal Error in the Trial Judge’s Analysis in Relation to the
Circumstantial Evidence?

(1)          
The Alleged Errors

[13]                         
At the core of the errors identified by the
Court of Appeal, and elaborated upon by the respondent, is that the trial judge
erred in his treatment of circumstantial evidence, a subject that dates back at
least to Hodge’s Case (1838), 2 Lewin 227, 168 E.R. 1136.  That case
contains a jury instruction about how the jury should assess circumstantial
evidence of identity. The jury was told that in order to convict, they must be
satisfied not only that the circumstantial evidence was consistent with guilt
but rationally inconsistent with any other conclusion than guilt. The nub of
the issue in this case is whether the trial judge erred by requiring that “any
other conclusion than guilt” be based on the evidence. 

[14]                         
The Court of Appeal, as I read its reasons,
found that the trial judge erred by requiring that an inference or hypothesis
supporting a conclusion other than guilt be based on evidence rather than upon
a lack of evidence: para. 10.  The respondent (as he is entitled to do in
seeking to uphold the Court of Appeal’s order), relies on what he claims are
additional errors made at trial: that the trial judge relied on inapplicable
sources; erroneously analyzed the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt;
and wrongly reversed the burden of proof. But at the core of all of these
alleged errors is the point taken by the Court of Appeal: that the trial judge
was wrong to exclude from consideration innocent explanations which had no
foundation in the evidence. 

[15]                         
Before turning to a more detailed analysis, it
is important to remember that a trial judge’s reasons for judgment should not
be “read or analyzed as if they were an instruction to a jury”: R. v.
Morrissey (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 514 (C.A.), at p. 525. Rather, the reasons
must be “read as a whole, in the context of the evidence, the issues and the
arguments at trial, together with ‘an appreciation of the purposes or functions
for which they are delivered’”: R. v. Laboucan, 2010 SCC 12, [2010] 1
S.C.R. 397, at para. 16, citing R. v. R.E.M., 2008 SCC 51, [2008] 3 S.C.R.
3, at para. 16; see also R. v. C.L.Y., 2008 SCC 2, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 5, at
para. 11.

Did the Trial Judge Err by Requiring Innocent
Explanations to be Based on the Evidence?

[16]                         
The Court of Appeal’s concern with the trial
judgment arises from some ongoing difficulties caused by the old rule in Hodge’s
Case. While that case was not mentioned by name, the principle that it
enunciated cast a long shadow over the judgments at trial and on appeal. I will
turn first to some of the troublesome aspects of the jurisprudence flowing from
Hodge’s Case and then return to the errors of law the trial judge is
alleged to have committed.

(a)          
The Current Status of the “Rule” in Hodge’s Case

[17]                         
In Hodge’s Case, the evidence of
identification was made up entirely of circumstantial evidence: p. 1137.  Baron
Alderson, the trial judge, instructed the jury that in order to convict, they
must be satisfied “not only that those circumstances were consistent with [the
accused] having committed the act, but they must also be satisfied that the
facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than
that the [accused] was the guilty person”: p. 1137.  This sort of jury
instruction came to be required in circumstantial cases: see, e.g., McLean v.
The King, [1933] S.C.R. 688.

[18]                         
Over time, this requirement was relaxed: see,
e.g., R. v. Mitchell, [1964] S.C.R. 471; R. v. Cooper, [1978] 1
S.C.R. 860.  It is now settled that no particular form of instruction to the
jury is required where the evidence on one or more elements of the offence is
entirely or primarily circumstantial.  As Charron J. writing for a majority of
the Court put it in R. v. Griffin, 2009 SCC 28, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 42, at para. 33:

We
have long departed from any legal requirement for a “special instruction” on
circumstantial evidence, even where the issue is one of identification: R. v. Cooper, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 860. The essential
component of an instruction on circumstantial evidence is to instill in the
jury that in order to convict, they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
that the only rational inference that can be drawn from the circumstantial
evidence is that the accused is guilty. Imparting the necessary message to
the jury may be achieved in different ways: R. v. Fleet
(1997), 120 C.C.C. (3d) 457 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 20. See also R. v. Guiboche, 2004 MBCA 16, 183 C.C.C. (3d) 361, at
paras. 108-10; R. v. Tombran
(2000), 142 C.C.C. (3d) 380 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 29.
[Emphasis added.]

 

[19]                         
There may be some tension between the first and
the second sentence of this passage from Griffin: see, e.g., L.
Dufraimont, “R. v. Griffin and the Legacy of Hodge’s Case”
(2009), 67 C.R. (6th) 74. While the first sentence states that there is no
required special instruction, the second sentence makes it an “essential
component” of a jury instruction to ensure that the jury understands that they
must be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that the only rational inference is
guilt. However, the cases cited with approval by Charron J. in this passage and
our subsequent decision in R. v. Mayuran, 2012 SCC 31, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 162,
at para. 38, clear up any doubt about what was intended.

[20]                         
In the above passage, Charron J. cited with
approval R. v. Fleet (1997), 120 C.C.C. (3d) 457 (Ont. C.A.), at para.
20. It is worth quoting that paragraph at length as in my view it makes Charron
J.’s meaning clear:

It will be recalled that, in Cooper,
Ritchie J. specifically rejected the necessity for any formula of words to be
used in a case of circumstantial evidence of identity. In our view, he can
hardly have intended to reject the mandatory recitation of one formula only to
substitute another in its place. We read the object of both judgments in
Cooper to be the eradication of any formulaic approach to such cases so
long as the jury is clearly made aware of the necessity to find the guilt of
the accused to be established beyond a reasonable doubt. This object may be
achieved in more ways than one. Thus, the trial judge, reviewing the evidence
and setting out the position of the defence and relating the substantial parts
of the evidence to that position, may frame the requisite instruction in the
manner he or she considers most appropriate in the circumstances, for example,
by:

 

(a)    charging the jury in accordance with the traditional language of
proof beyond a reasonable doubt (per Laskin C.J.C. in Cooper);

 

(b)   charging the jury in accordance with that language and pointing out
to the jury the other inferences that the defence says should be drawn from the
evidence and the necessity to acquit the accused if any of those inferences
raises a reasonable doubt (as the trial judge did in Cooper in the final
portion of his recharge); or

 

(c)    charging the jury that it must be satisfied beyond a reasonable
doubt that the guilt of the accused is the only reasonable inference to be
drawn from the proven facts (per Ritchie J. in Cooper and Dubin
J.A. in Elmosri).

[21]                         
Charron J. also cited with approval R. v.
Tombran (2000), 142 C.C.C. (3d) 380 (Ont. C.A.), (a decision in which she
participated as a member of the Ontario Court of Appeal), at para. 29. Once
again, it is worth quoting that paragraph:

The modern approach to the problem of
circumstantial evidence, enunciated clearly in Cooper, supra, and
reiterated and reinforced by Fleet, supra, is to reject a
formulaic approach and to deal with all the evidence in terms of the general
principles of reasonable doubt. Trial judges are given a degree of latitude to
formulate the appropriate instruction as befits the circumstances of the case.
Trial judges are not required to adopt any specific language or wording,
provided the charge conveys to the jury in a clear fashion the central point,
namely, the necessity to find the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.
In particular, trial judges are not required to deliver to the jury a general,
abstract lecture on the nature of circumstantial evidence or on the steps of
logic to be followed in assessing circumstantial as distinct from direct
evidence. An academic exercise along those lines may well confuse rather than
assist the jury. Trial judges are entitled to conclude that the essential
message of the need to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt can be better
conveyed in other ways.

[22]                         
These paragraphs, quoted with approval in Griffin,
are consistent with what Charron J. conveyed in her reasons. This reading of
the judgment is confirmed by our subsequent decision in Mayuran in which
the Court reiterated the statement from Griffin that “[w]e have long
departed from any legal requirement for a ‘special instruction’ on
circumstantial evidence”: per Abella J., writing for a unanimous Court, at
para. 38. There is therefore no particular form of mandatory instruction.
However, where proof of one or more elements of the offence depends solely or
largely on circumstantial evidence, it may be helpful for the jury to receive
instructions that will assist them to understand the nature of circumstantial
evidence and the relationship between proof by circumstantial evidence and the
requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt. I will touch briefly on both of
these aspects.

(i)                
An Explanation of the Difference Between Direct
and Circumstantial Evidence

[23]                         
An explanation of the difference between direct
and circumstantial evidence is included in most criminal jury charges and
rarely causes difficulty.  One example of how this distinction may be conveyed
to a jury is found in s. 10.2 of the Model Jury Instructions (online) prepared
by the National Committee on Jury Instructions of the Canadian Judicial
Council:

[1] As
I explained at the beginning of the trial, you may rely on direct evidence and
on circumstantial evidence in reaching your verdict. Let me remind you what
these terms mean.

[2] Usually, witnesses tell us what they personally
saw or heard. For example, a witness might say that he or she saw it raining
outside. That is called direct evidence.

[3] Sometimes, however, witnesses say things from
which you are asked to draw certain inferences. For example, a witness might
say that he or she had seen someone enter the courthouse lobby wearing a
raincoat and carrying an umbrella, both dripping wet. If you believed that
witness, you might infer that it was raining outside, even though the evidence
was indirect. Indirect evidence is sometimes called circumstantial evidence.

[24]                         
While there is no particular required form of
explanation, something along these lines will usually be helpful when one or
more elements of the Crown’s case depends solely or mainly on circumstantial
evidence.

(ii)           
The Relationship Between Circumstantial Evidence
and Proof Beyond Reasonable Doubt

[25]                         
The Court has generally described the rule in Hodge’s
Case as an elaboration of the reasonable doubt standard: Mitchell;
John v. The Queen, [1971] S.C.R. 781, per Ritchie J., at pp. 791-92; Cooper;
Mezzo v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 802, at p. 843. If that is all that Hodge’s
Case was concerned with, then any special instruction relating to
circumstantial evidence could be seen as an unnecessary and potentially
confusing addition to the reasonable doubt instruction.

[26]                         
However, that is not all that Hodge’s Case
was concerned with. There is a special concern inherent in the inferential
reasoning from circumstantial evidence. The concern is that the jury may
unconsciously “fill in the blanks” or bridge gaps in the evidence to support
the inference that the Crown invites it to draw. Baron Alderson referred to
this risk in Hodge’s Case. He noted the jury may “look for — and often
slightly . . . distort the facts” to make them fit the inference that they are
invited to draw: p. 1137. Or, as his remarks are recorded in another report,
the danger is that the mind may “take a pleasure in adapting circumstances to
one another, and even straining them a little, if need be, to force them to
form parts of one connected whole”: W. Wills, Wills’ Principles of
Circumstantial Evidence (7th ed. 1937), at p. 45; cited by Laskin J. in John,
dissenting but not on this point, at p. 813.

[27]                         
While this 19th century language is not suitable
for a contemporary jury instruction, the basic concern that Baron Alderson
described — the danger of jumping to unwarranted conclusions in circumstantial
cases — remains real. When the concern about circumstantial evidence is understood
in this way, an instruction concerning the use of circumstantial evidence and
the reasonable doubt instruction have different, although related, purposes:
see B. L. Berger, “The Rule in Hodge’s Case: Rumours of its Death are Greatly
Exaggerated” (2005), 84 Can. Bar Rev. 47, at pp. 60-61.  

[28]                         
The reasonable doubt instruction describes a
state of mind — the degree of persuasion that entitles and requires a juror to
find an accused guilty: Berger, at p. 60. Reasonable doubt is not an inference
or a finding of fact that needs support in the evidence presented at trial:
see, e.g. Schuldt v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 592, at pp. 600-610. A
reasonable doubt is a doubt based on “reason and common sense”; it is not
“imaginary or frivolous”; it “does not involve proof to an absolute certainty”;
and it is “logically connected to the evidence or absence of evidence”: Lifchus,
at para. 36. The reasonable doubt instructions are all directed to describing
for the jurors how sure they must be of guilt in order to convict.

[29]                         
An instruction about circumstantial evidence, in
contrast, alerts the jury to the dangers of the path of reasoning involved in
drawing inferences from circumstantial evidence: Berger, at p. 60.  This is the
danger to which Baron Alderson directed his comments. And the danger he
identified so long ago — the risk that the jury will “fill in the blanks” or
“jump to conclusions” — has more recently been confirmed by social science
research: see Berger, at pp. 52-53.  This Court on occasion has noted this
cautionary purpose of a circumstantial evidence instruction: see, e.g., Boucher
v. The Queen, [1955] S.C.R. 16, per Rand J., at p. 22; John, per
Laskin J., dissenting but not on this point, at p. 813. 

[30]                         
It follows that in a case in which proof of one
or more elements of the offence depends exclusively or largely on
circumstantial evidence, it will generally be helpful to the jury to be
cautioned about too readily drawing inferences of guilt.  No particular
language is required. Telling the jury that an inference of guilt drawn from
circumstantial evidence should be the only reasonable inference that such
evidence permits will often be a succinct and accurate way of helping the jury
to guard against the risk of “filling in the blanks” by too quickly overlooking
reasonable alternative inferences. It may be helpful to illustrate the concern
about jumping to conclusions with an example. If we look out the window and see
that the road is wet, we may jump to the conclusion that it has been raining.
But we may then notice that the sidewalks are dry or that there is a loud noise
coming from the distance that could be street-cleaning equipment, and
re-evaluate our premature conclusion. The observation that the road is wet, on
its own, does not exclude other reasonable explanations than that it has been
raining. The inferences that may be drawn from this observation must be
considered in light of all of the evidence and the absence of evidence,
assessed logically, and in light of human experience and common sense.

[31]                         
I emphasize, however, that assistance to the
jury about the risk of jumping to conclusions may be given in different ways
and, as noted in Fleet, trial judges will provide this assistance in the
manner they consider most appropriate in the circumstances: p. 549.

(iii)               
“Rational” v. “Reasonable” Inferences

[32]                         
I have suggested the use of the word
“reasonable” to describe the potential inferences rather than the word
“rational” used by Baron Alderson in Hodge’s Case and in many other
cases including Griffin.  Which of these words should be used was one of
the issues touched on by the Court of Appeal (at para. 9) and I should explain
why I think that the word “reasonable” is preferable. The
following comments also apply to the adjective “logique”, which has been
frequently used in the French version of this Court’s jurisprudence on this
issue.

[33]                         
The words “rational” and “reasonable” are
virtually synonyms: “rational” means “of or based on reasoning or reason”;
“reasonable” means “in accordance with reason”: Canadian Oxford Dictionary
(2nd ed. 2004). While some have argued that there is a significant difference,
I do not find that position convincing: see, e.g., E. Scott, “Hodge’s Case: A
Reconsideration” (1965-66), 8 C.L.Q. 17, at p. 25; A. M. Gans, “Hodge’s
Case Revisited” (1972-73), 15 C.L.Q. 127, at p. 132. It seems that our
jurisprudence has used the words “rational” and “reasonable” interchangeably
with respect to inferences: see McLean; Fraser v. The King,
[1936] S.C.R. 1, at p. 2;  Boucher, at pp. 18, 22 and 29; John,
at p. 792; Cooper, at p. 881; Lizotte v. The King, [1951]
S.C.R. 115, at p. 132; Mitchell, at p. 478; Griffin, at para.
33.  This, in addition to the dictionary definitions, suggests that there is no
difference in substance between them. 

[34]                         
There is an advantage of using the word
“reasonable”. It avoids the risk of confusion that might arise from using the
word “reasonable” in relation to “reasonable doubt” but referring to “rational”
inferences or explanations when speaking about circumstantial evidence: see John,
per Laskin J., dissenting but not on this point, at p. 815.  In saying this, I
do not suggest that using the traditional term “rational” is an error: the
Court has said repeatedly and recently that the necessary message may be
imparted in different ways: see, e.g., Griffin, at para. 33.

(iv)         
Whether the Inference Must Be Based on “Proven
Facts”

[35]                         
At one time, it was said that in circumstantial
cases, “conclusions alternative to the guilt of the accused must be rational
conclusions based on inferences drawn from proven facts”: see R. v. McIver,
[1965] 2 O.R. 475 (C.A.), at p. 479, aff’d without discussion of this point
[1966] S.C.R. 254. However, that view is no longer accepted. In assessing
circumstantial evidence, inferences consistent with innocence do not have to
arise from proven facts: R. v. Khela, 2009 SCC 4, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 104,
at para. 58; see also R. v. Defaveri, 2014 BCCA 370, 361 B.C.A.C. 301,
at para. 10; R. v. Bui, 2014 ONCA 614, 14 C.R. (7th) 149, at para. 28. 
Requiring proven facts to support explanations other than guilt wrongly puts an
obligation on an accused to prove facts and is contrary to the rule that
whether there is a reasonable doubt is assessed by considering all of the
evidence. The issue with respect to circumstantial evidence is the range of
reasonable inferences that can be drawn from it. If there are reasonable
inferences other than guilt, the Crown’s evidence does not meet the standard of
proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

[36]                         
I agree with the respondent’s position that a
reasonable doubt, or theory alternative to guilt, is not rendered “speculative”
by the mere fact that it arises from a lack of evidence.  As stated by this
Court in Lifchus, a reasonable doubt “is a doubt based on reason
and common sense which must be logically based upon the evidence or lack of
evidence”: para. 30 (emphasis added).  A certain gap in the evidence may
result in inferences other than guilt. But those inferences must be reasonable
given the evidence and the absence of evidence, assessed logically, and in
light of human experience and common sense.

[37]                         
When assessing circumstantial evidence, the
trier of fact should consider “other plausible theor[ies]” and “other
reasonable possibilities” which are inconsistent with guilt:  R. v. Comba,
[1938] O.R. 200 (C.A.), at pp. 205 and 211, per Middleton J.A., aff’d [1938]
S.C.R. 396; R. v. Baigent, 2013 BCCA 28, 335 B.C.A.C. 11, at para. 20; R.
v. Mitchell, [2008] QCA 394 (AustLII), at para. 35. I agree with the
appellant that the Crown thus may need to negative these reasonable
possibilities, but certainly does not need to “negative every possible
conjecture, no matter how irrational or fanciful, which might be consistent
with the innocence of the accused”: R. v. Bagshaw, [1972] S.C.R. 2, at
p. 8. “Other plausible theories” or “other reasonable possibilities” must be
based on logic and experience applied to the evidence or the absence of
evidence, not on speculation.  

[38]                         
Of course, the line between a “plausible theory”
and “speculation” is not always easy to draw. But the basic question is whether
the circumstantial evidence, viewed logically and in light of human experience,
is reasonably capable of supporting an inference other than that the accused is
guilty. 

[39]                         
I have found two particularly useful statements
of this principle. 

[40]                         
The first is from an old Australian case, Martin
v. Osborne (1936), 55 C.L.R. 367 (H.C.), at p. 375:

In the inculpation of an accused person
the evidentiary circumstances must bear no other reasonable explanation.
This means that, according to the common course of human affairs, the degree
of probability that the occurrence of the facts proved would be accompanied by
the occurrence of the fact to be proved is so high that the contrary cannot
reasonably be supposed. [Emphasis added.]

[41]                         
While this language is not appropriate for a
jury instruction, I find the idea expressed in this passage — that to justify a
conviction, the circumstantial evidence, assessed in light of human experience,
should be such that it excludes any other reasonable alternative — a helpful
way of describing the line between plausible theories and speculation.

[42]                         
The second is from R. v. Dipnarine, 2014
ABCA 328, 584 A.R. 138, at paras. 22 and 24-25. The court stated that “[c]ircumstantial
evidence does not have to totally exclude other conceivable inferences”; that
the trier of fact should not act on alternative interpretations of the
circumstances that it considers to be unreasonable; and that alternative
inferences must be reasonable, not just possible.  

[43]                         
Where the line is to be drawn between
speculation and reasonable inferences in a particular case cannot be described
with greater clarity than it is in these passages.

(b)          
Did the Trial Judge Err?

[44]                         
I return to the question of whether the Court of
Appeal was wrong to find a legal error in relation to circumstantial evidence
in the trial judge’s reasons.

[45]                         
The Court of Appeal found that the trial judge
erred because he failed to consider reasonable inferences inconsistent with
guilt that could have arisen from a lack of evidence.  The court found
that, by failing to give the accused the benefit of “gaps” in the evidence, the
trial judge had, in effect, put a burden on the accused to prove something:
paras. 19-20. The respondent supports that conclusion and makes two additional
points. He submits that the trial judge erred in relying on McIver which
wrongly required inferences alternative to guilt to be supported by the
evidence and that the trial judge relied on inapplicable sources — certiorari
applications to quash committals to stand trial, where the beyond a
reasonable doubt standard does not apply.  In doing so, it is submitted, the
judge failed to appreciate the burden of proof on the Crown and the difference
between the standard applied when deciding to commit someone to stand trial at
a preliminary inquiry and the reasonable doubt standard applied at trial.  

[46]                         
I respectfully disagree with the Court of
Appeal’s conclusion and I cannot accept the respondent’s submissions.

[47]                         
There are certainly at first glance some
problematic statements in the trial judge’s reasons.  He mentions that
“inferences are drawn from the evidence that the Crown presents to [the court]”:
para. 45; that speculation is “forming a theory or conjecture without
factual basis”: para. 46; and that “it is evidence that ‘bridges’
the inferential gap”: para. 49.   He cites a number of cases which state that
inferences must be drawn from facts or evidence: paras. 45-49. He cites McIver,
which states that conclusions alternative to guilt must be founded on proven
facts: para. 49. And he wrote that the “Court has no evidence before it
that would support these hypothetical scenarios [of innocence]”: para. 81
(emphases added).  

[48]                         
However, when the trial judge’s reasons are read
as a whole and these passages are read in their proper context, I am not
persuaded that he made any reversible error.  

[49]                         
For example, most of the references to the
effect that inferences must arise from evidence concern the Crown’s burden
to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  Of course, there is no error in this
regard as the Crown cannot rely on a gap in the evidence to prove an element of
the offence. 

[50]                         
When dealing with the defence position, the
judge correctly stated the law, in my opinion.  The judge properly noted that
“the accused cannot ask this Court to rely on supposition or conjecture, that
flows from a purely hypothetical narrative to conclude that the Crown has not
proven he is guilty of the offences with which the Crown has charged him”:
para. 47.  The judge’s citation of McIver was intended to make the same
point, i.e. that a reasonable doubt cannot arise from speculation or
conjecture. This is perfectly correct. As the Court said in Lifchus, “a
reasonable doubt must not be imaginary or frivolous”; need not be proof to an
absolute certainty; and must be based on “reason and common sense”: paras. 31
and 36. The burden on the Crown does not extend to “negativing every
conjecture”:  R. v. Paul, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 181, at p. 191. 

[51]                         
The respondent submits that the judge erred by
relying on a number of cases dealing with committals for trial at a preliminary
inquiry, a context in which the reasonable doubt standard does not apply.
However, the judge referred to these authorities in relation to his assessment
of the range of available and reasonable inferences. He did not, as the
respondent claims, fail to recognize and apply the beyond reasonable doubt
standard of proof. The trial judge stated the proper standard in his reasons,
and there is nothing in his reasons to show that he departed from this
standard:

The
Crown’s counsel and the accused spent a great deal of time arguing about the
inferences that this Court may or may not draw from the evidence that Mr.
Sopczak and Mr. LaFontaine provided. Essentially, the arguments may be boiled
down to the simple question of whether the totality of the evidence that the
Crown has presented to this Court supports an inference that the accused
committed the offences with which the Crown has charged him.  Of course, the
inferences that this Court draws from the evidence must satisfy it beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused committed the offences with which the Crown
has charged him . . . . [Emphasis added; para. 43.]

 

[52]                         
Finally, the respondent submits that, by
misapprehending the law in relation to innocent inferences and in applying the
law relating to committals to trials, the trial judge improperly reversed the
burden of proof and applied the wrong standard of proof.  For the reasons I
have just given, the trial judge did not apply the wrong law in these areas,
and properly put the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt solely on the
Crown.

[53]                         
A fair reading of the judge’s reasons as a whole
does not support the respondent’s position that the judge somehow lost sight of
proper process of inference-drawing, the overall burden of proof, or the
difference between a committal for trial and a finding of guilt. The judge did
not err in this regard.

[54]                         
I conclude that the judge did not make any legal
error in relation to his assessment of the circumstantial evidence.

B.           
Second Question: Was the Verdict of Guilt Reasonable?

(1)          
Legal Principles

[55]                         
A verdict is reasonable if it is one that a
properly instructed jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered: R.
v. Biniaris, 2000 SCC 15, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381. Applying this standard
requires the appellate court to re-examine and to some extent reweigh and
consider the effect of the evidence: R. v. Yebes, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168,
at p. 186. This limited weighing of the evidence on appeal must be done in
light of the standard of proof in a criminal case. Where the Crown’s case
depends on circumstantial evidence, the question becomes whether the trier of
fact, acting judicially, could reasonably be satisfied that the accused’s guilt
was the only reasonable conclusion available on the totality of the evidence:  Yebes,
at p. 186; R. v. Mars (2006), 205 C.C.C. (3d) 376 (Ont. C.A.), at para.
4; R. v. Liu (1989), 95 A.R. 201 (C.A.), at para. 13; R. v. S.L.R.,
2003 ABCA 148 (CanLII); R. v. Cardinal (1990), 106 A.R. 91 (C.A.); R.
v. Kaysaywaysemat (1992), 97 Sask. R. 66 (C.A.), at paras. 28 and 31. 

[56]                         
The governing principle was nicely summarized by
the Alberta Court of Appeal in Dipnarine, at para. 22. The
court noted that “[c]ircumstantial evidence does not have to totally exclude
other conceivable inferences” and that a verdict is not unreasonable simply
because “the alternatives do not raise a doubt” in the jury’s mind.  Most
importantly, “[i]t is still fundamentally for the trier [of] fact to decide if
any proposed alternative way of looking at the case is reasonable enough to
raise a doubt.”  

(2)          
Analysis

[57]                         
In order to establish possession of child
pornography, the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent
was aware that he had physical custody of the pornography and that he was aware
of what it was: see, e.g., R. v. Morelli, 2010 SCC 8, [2010] 1 S.C.R.
253, at paras. 16 and 136. There can be no serious question about the fact that
the respondent had physical possession of the material in the sense discussed
by the majority of the Court in Morelli: it had been downloaded on to
his computer and he had physical possession of the computer. The real question
is whether it was reasonable for the judge to find that the respondent knew
that he had physical possession of the pornography that was in fact in his
computer’s memory.

[58]                         
I have found it helpful to consider this issue
in two steps. At the first, the question is whether a user of the respondent’s
computer knowingly downloaded pornography. The judge found that a user of this
computer had done so and, in my view, that conclusion was reasonable: para. 67.

[59]                         
The evidence was that Limewire, a file-sharing
software, was installed on the computer on the same day that the only user
account (named “oswaldvillaroman”) was created. Limewire, the evidence
disclosed, does not download files or other material without the user taking
some action to download the file or material. The user must enter keywords and
double click on the desired search result.  The evidence further showed that a
user of this computer had changed the default saved folder so that completed
files would be saved in the computer’s iTunes music folder.  A user of the
computer had viewed some of the videos from both the Limewire “incomplete”
folder and iTunes music folder through two different media-playing programs.
These viewed files were not automatically opened by either of these
media-playing programs. The evidence was also to the effect that the titles of
downloaded files were “explicit, disturbing, and would logically indicate that
the associated files are child pornography”: para. 62. All of this evidence
tended to show that the offending material would not be downloaded and viewed
without the user’s consent or knowledge, and that the nature of the material
would be obvious to the user.  

[60]                         
These facts were recited in the trial judge’s
reasons, and his conclusion at para. 67 that the “oswaldvillaroman” user
account downloaded the child pornography onto the computer using the Limewire
program was reasonable.

[61]                         
The second step is to ask whether it was
reasonable to conclude that the respondent was knowingly in possession of the
child pornography that had been saved on his computer.  

[62]                         
The trial judge found that the respondent was
the user who had downloaded the material, but I agree with the Crown that this
finding was not essential to proof of the respondent’s knowledge. The judge
also found — and this is the critical finding — that the respondent was aware
of the pornography on his computer: para. 85.  The trial judge considered and
rejected the respondent’s submission that the evidence was not sufficient to
establish the respondent’s knowledge of the nature of the material on his
computer. Noting that the Crown does not have to negative every conjecture, he
found that the evidence as a whole persuaded him beyond a reasonable doubt that
the respondent “was aware that the child pornography resided on the Computer”:
para. 85. 

[63]                         
Contrary to the respondent’s submission, the
trial judge did not merely consider the fact that the accused owned the
computer in coming to this conclusion.  He relied on the evidence of Mr. LaFontaine
and Mr. Sopczak, and referred to the following pieces of evidence before the
court in particular:

(a)    two people with whom the accused lives did not download child
pornography to the Computer;

 

(b)   the child pornography was in the iTunes “Music” folder, which is
accessible to the Computer’s user;

 

(c)    the Computer belongs to the accused;

 

(d)   the Computer was used “almost daily” from July 1, 2007, to November
29, 2009;

 

(e)    the user name that was established on the same day that Limewire was
installed is “oswaldvillaroman”;

 

(f) the Computer was left at the MyMac on December 2, 2009, and the
accused’s name and home address are shown on the Service Repair Order; and

 

(g)   the specific problems that the Computer was suffering are listed
under “Problem Description” on the Service Repair Order and specifically refers
to the fact that the “client reports” the problems.

 

. .
. the clock on the Computer was accurate [which meant that some of the
pornography had been on the computer for about three months before Mr.
Villaroman took the computer in for repairs.] [paras. 82-83]

[64]                         
Was the conclusion that the respondent knew this
material was on his computer reasonable? In my view, it was.

[65]                         
As noted, Mr. Villaroman admitted that the
laptop was his. He had possession and control of it for the purposes of having
it repaired. He delivered it to the shop, paid for the repairs, tried to pick
it up, stated that he was the person who could authorize the work and
authorized the required repairs. The only user account on the computer,
“oswaldvillaroman”, was created using his name. The Limewire software was
installed on the computer the same day. There had been almost daily use of the
computer since. Some of the pornography had been stored on the computer for
about three months before Mr. Villaroman took it in for repairs.  As discussed
earlier, the nature of the material would be obvious to a user of the computer
who saw the file names. Mr. Villaroman admitted that he resided at the same
address as Benigno and Maxima Villaroman, and that neither of them had put the
child pornography on the computer. There was no evidence that anyone else lived
there or that anyone else had the opportunity to download pornography onto the
computer.  While the accused need not lead evidence to show that another person
had such access to his laptop, based on the evidence and lack of evidence
before the Court, it is speculative to consider whether another person had such
an opportunity, let alone to assume that Mr. Villaroman would be ignorant of
the presence of the material on his computer.  

[66]                         
The judge did not ignore hypothetical
alternative explanations advanced by the respondent’s counsel. He found that
they were speculative, noting that the Crown does not have the burden “of negativing
every conjecture to which circumstantial evidence might give rise and which
might be consistent with the innocence of the accused”: para. 81; citing Paul,
at p. 191.

[67]                         
The Court of Appeal, in my respectful view,
erred by focusing on hypothetical alternative theories and, at times, engaging
in speculation rather than on the question of whether the inferences drawn by
the trial judge, having regard to the standard of proof, were reasonably open
to him. 

[68]                         
It is true, as the Court of Appeal noted, that
there was no evidence about where the computer was kept or used and that anyone
who had temporary physical access to the laptop computer could work the laptop,
and could access or transmit the child pornography on it: paras. 25-26. The
Court of Appeal found that the pornography was not “accompanied by any email or
similar communication”, nor was there any evidence about whether an ordinary
user of the computer would notice the child pornography in the music folder:
paras. 34-35. It further found that the pornography was not downloaded very
frequently, at an average of a little over one file per month, which does not
“make actions by another user impossible, nor even highly unlikely”: para. 32. 
I note that this last point is not only speculative, but inaccurate.  The
evidence shows that the pornography was downloaded over a three-month period.

[69]                         
These were gaps in the Crown evidence about Mr.
Villaroman’s possession and control of the computer that the trial judge had to
take into account in weighing the evidence. However, the Court of Appeal, in
its analysis of these gaps, in effect retried the case. It was for the trial
judge to decide, as he did, whether the evidence of Mr. Villaroman’s powers of
control and direction over the computer; the coincidence of his name and the
only user name on the computer; the file names descriptive of their
pornographic contents; the admission in relation to the non-involvement of two
other people with whom he lived; and the length of time the pornography had
been on the computer, when considered in light of human experience and the
evidence as a whole and the absence of evidence, excluded all reasonable
inferences other than guilt. In my view, while not every trier of fact would
inevitably have reached the same conclusion as did the trial judge, that
conclusion was a reasonable one.

[70]                         
At certain points in its analysis, the Court of
Appeal crossed the line from considering the effects of gaps in the Crown
evidence to raising purely speculative possibilities. For example, the Court of
Appeal considered questions such as whether the “laptop [went] to work” or
“during the day to a school, college, or university” or “may have sat much of
each day in a location or locations frequented by many friends, coworkers, or
fellow students”: paras. 28 and 31. These particular factual scenarios are
purely speculative and postulating them goes beyond the bounds of properly
considering the impact of the gaps in the Crown evidence about the physical
location of the laptop. 

[71]                         
The Court of Appeal’s analysis overlooks the
important point made in Dipnarine that it is fundamentally for the trier
of fact to draw the line in each case that separates reasonable doubt from
speculation. The trier of fact’s assessment can be set aside only where it is
unreasonable. While the Crown’s case was not overwhelming, my view is that it
was reasonable for the judge to conclude that the evidence as a whole excluded
all reasonable alternatives to guilt.

[72]                         
In my view, the judge’s finding that this
evidence proved that Mr. Villaroman had possession of the child pornography
found on his computer was not unreasonable.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

                    Criminal
law — Charge to jury — Evidence — Admissibility — Limiting instructions — Characterization
of witness’s testimony — Accused convicted of manslaughter — Accused’s
appearance changing between time of offence and time of trial — Whether
photographs of accused taken days after offence admissible — Whether trial
judge’s instructions to jury on use it could make of photographs of accused
insufficient — Whether trial judge erred in jury instructions by referring to
witness’s account of conversation with accused as confession.

                    A
was convicted of manslaughter for his alleged involvement in a shooting that took
place in a Toronto park. The victim and some friends were socializing in the
park when a group of men entered the park and attempted to rob some of them. The
victim was shot and killed while chasing after the assailants who fled the
scene. Eyewitnesses only provided general descriptions of the assailants — young,
black, thin and clean-shaven — and described the shooter as being between 5’4”
and 5’8”. A, who was 6’1” at the time, was not identified as being among the
assailants. He was arrested five days after the shooting, when a teacher of his
notified the police that A had approached him and confessed to being present at
the shooting but not to having fired the gun. 

                    Because
A’s appearance had changed between the time of the shooting and his trial, the
Crown sought to have admitted two photographs of him taken five days after the
shooting in order to establish what he looked like at the time. The defence
objected, arguing that the photographs were highly prejudicial. The trial judge
admitted the photographs for the purpose of allowing the jury to consider
whether A had any of the physical attributes described by the eyewitnesses,
subject to a limiting instruction that warned the jury that it could not
conclude that A was among the assailants solely because his appearance fit
within the general description provided by the eyewitnesses. In his
instructions to the jury, the trial judge also summarized the Crown’s position
that the conversation which took place between A and his teacher should be
viewed as a confession of guilt. A appealed his conviction and sentence. A
majority of the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and remitted the matter for
a new trial.

                    Held:
The appeal should be allowed, A’s conviction for manslaughter restored, and the
matter remanded to the Court of Appeal for consideration of the sentencing
appeal.

                    There
is no reason to disturb the trial judge’s finding that the photographs were admissible.
Whether A could have been among the assailants was a critical issue in this
case, because he denied being in the park the night of the shooting. Moreover,
A did not concede that his appearance fit within the general eyewitness
descriptions. Accordingly, the photographs were relevant to the limited
question of whether A’s appearance at the time of the shooting fit within the
general descriptions provided by witnesses. Regarding the potential prejudicial
effect of the photographs, there are particular dangers involved in showing
eyewitnesses a single photograph to determine if the individual shown is the
individual they saw, because the witness’s memory may be tainted by exposure to
that photograph. However, this concern is not relevant where it is the jury who
has been exposed to the photograph of a single person and asked to consider
whether the person shown falls within a general description. The jury has no
pre-existing memory of the person’s appearance to corrupt, nor is the concern
about the over-persuasiveness of tainted witness testimony relevant in this
context. In light of the deference afforded to trial judges on questions of
balancing probative effect against prejudice, there is no reason to disturb the
trial judge’s finding that the risk associated with the photographs could be
appropriately mitigated by a limiting instruction, and thus that the probative
value of the photographs outweighed their prejudicial effect. 

                    The
trial judge’s limiting instruction with respect to the use it could make of the
photographs was adequate. Parsing the language in one particular sentence to
determine whether it was sufficient to warn of an impermissible line of
reasoning, without taking into consideration the greater context of the jury
instructions and the trial itself, represents the kind of dissection and minute
scrutiny this Court has warned against. In this case, there does not appear to
be a considerable risk that the jury would have, as a consequence of minor
imperfections with the jury instructions, abandoned their common sense and
adopted clearly flawed reasoning. Moreover, the risk of a juror actually using
the photographs as the basis for an impermissible line of reasoning in the
context of this case was appropriately minimized both by the fact that Crown
counsel did not urge the jury to adopt impermissible lines of inference and by
the trial judge’s charge to the jury as a whole.

                    The
trial judge’s use of the word “confession” in his jury instructions does not
constitute a toxic instruction such that a new trial should be ordered. Indeed,
the trial judge did not himself label A’s statements to his teacher as
confessions. Rather, he repeatedly described the school exchange as a conversation.
Moreover, the trial judge only referred to the exchanges as a confession when
reiterating the Crown’s position, which was that the school conversation should
be viewed as a confession of guilt. When viewed in light of the trial judge’s
other cautions to the jury, including the caution that the teacher’s testimony
be evaluated only for its evidence of what A said, rather than the teacher’s
interpretation of his statements, as well as the caution that confession to
mere presence at the scene was not sufficient to establish guilt, a single use
of the word “confession” in describing the Crown’s submissions would not have
been so toxic as to call for a correcting instruction. The trial judge fairly
described the conversation between A and his teacher and it was properly for
the jury to conclude whether the conversation amounted to a confession. 

                    Since
the jury instructions were adequate, it is not necessary to consider whether
the facts of this case would warrant the application of the curative proviso
provided in s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .

                    The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

[1]                             
Rothstein J. — Nahoor Araya was tried by a judge and jury
for second degree murder and convicted of the included offence of manslaughter
for his alleged involvement in a shooting that took place in a Toronto park on
October 3, 2008. The Ontario Court of Appeal (Strathy J.A. (as he then was),
dissenting) overturned that conviction and ordered a new trial, finding that
the jury instructions given at trial were insufficient to warn the jury against
making improper inferences with regard to certain photographs of Mr. Araya
taken a few days after the shooting and admitted at trial. The Crown appeals
this decision and asks that the manslaughter conviction be restored. In the
alternative, the Crown argues that the majority of the Court of Appeal erred in
failing to apply the curative proviso in s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 .

[2]                             
In supporting the decision of the majority of
the Court of Appeal, Mr. Araya proffered two additional arguments: first, that
the photographs had no probative value whatsoever and were thus inadmissible,
and second, that the jury instructions were also flawed with respect to the
testimony of Cordel Browne, Mr. Araya’s high school English teacher, with whom
Mr. Araya spoke after the shooting.

[3]                             
On the issue of the jury instructions regarding
the photographs, I agree with Strathy J.A. that the trial judge’s instructions
were adequate. While not perfectly phrased, the totality of the instructions,
viewed in the context of the case as a whole, adequately guarded against the
possibility that the jurors might use the photographs as the basis for
impermissible reasoning.

[4]                             
On the issue of admissibility, I do not agree
with Mr. Araya’s contention that the photographs had no probative value.
Identity was a key issue in this case. Mr. Araya’s appearance had changed from
the time of the shooting to the time of his trial. The defence never conceded
that Mr. Araya fell within the admittedly broad descriptions of the assailants
given by eyewitnesses to the events in the park. Thus, the burden remained on
the Crown to establish identity, and the trial judge found that the photographs
were probative in showing that Mr. Araya fit within the class of individuals
described by the eyewitnesses. I agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial
judge’s decision on admissibility should not be disturbed.

[5]                             
Finally, on the issue of Mr. Browne’s testimony,
I do not agree with Mr. Araya’s contention that the trial judge erred in
instructing the jury with regard to the proper uses or characterization of Mr.
Browne’s testimony. The trial judge fairly described the conversation between
Mr. Araya and Mr. Browne in the jury charge, and it was properly for the jury
to conclude whether this conversation amounted to a confession. 

[6]                             
I would allow the appeal and remand the matter
to the Court of Appeal for consideration of the sentencing issue. It is thus
unnecessary to consider the issue of the curative proviso.

Factual Background

[7]                             
On the evening of October 3, 2008, 17-year-old
Boris Cikovic and a group of friends were drinking and socializing in and
around the tennis courts in Buttonwood Park in west Toronto. According to
witnesses, a second group of around three or four men entered the park at about
10:30 p.m., got into a confrontation with some of the individuals in Mr.
Cikovic’s group, and attempted to rob some of them. Mr. Cikovic resisted and
used a taser against one of the assailants. The assailants then fled the scene
and Mr. Cikovic chased after them, at which point one of the assailants turned
and shot Mr. Cikovic, killing him.

The lighting near the tennis courts was dim, and
eyewitnesses were only able to provide broad, general descriptions of the
unknown men: young, black, thin, and clean-shaven. Some witnesses recalled some
of the men wearing bandanas over their faces. The shooter was described as
being between 5’4” and 5’8”. Mr. Araya was 6’1” at the time. None of the
witnesses specifically identified Mr. Araya as being among the assailants.

[9]                             
On October 7, four days after the shooting, Mr.
Araya approached Mr. Browne, his English teacher, and asked to speak to him in
private. There was disagreement at trial over the nature of the conversation.
Mr. Araya testified at trial that while he did have a conversation with Mr.
Browne, he did not mention being in Buttonwood Park or having any involvement
with the shooting. Instead, he testified that he made up a fabricated story
about a confrontation at a different location, in the hopes that Mr. Browne
would worry about Mr. Araya’s well-being and offer him a place to stay that
night. According to Mr. Browne, Mr. Araya said that he had been with the group
of people who robbed and shot Mr. Cikovic at Buttonwood Park on October 3, but
that he had not fired the gun and wanted Mr. Browne’s advice on what to do. Mr.
Browne told Mr. Araya that he should inform the authorities, and subsequently
notified the police of his conversation with Mr. Araya. Mr. Araya was arrested
on October 8. Mr. Browne also gave the police a statement on October 8 about
his conversation with Mr. Araya at school the previous day.

II.          
Procedural History

A.          
Trial Proceedings

[10]                         
Mr. Araya was tried before a jury in 2011 on the
basis that he was among the assailants on the night of the shooting, and was
thus liable for second degree murder pursuant to s. 21(2)  of the Criminal
Code . The Crown did not allege that Mr. Araya was the shooter. Eyewitnesses
to the event testified to their recollections about the description of the
assailants. As noted above, these descriptions were limited to vague, general
characteristics – young, black, thin, and clean-shaven. 

[11]                         
Mr. Araya testified that he was not in
Buttonwood Park on the night of October 3, 2008, but was instead at a friend’s
house several kilometres away from the park. He admitted to having a
conversation with Mr. Browne at school on October 7, but disputed the nature of
that conversation. His position was that he made up a story related to a
different robbery to get Mr. Browne’s attention and concern, but that even in
this fabricated story, he did not admit to having been at Buttonwood Park on
the night of October 3. 

[12]                         
Mr. Araya pointed to a number of discrepancies
that had arisen between Mr. Browne’s statement to police the day after the
school conversation and his testimony at trial. Specifically, while Mr. Browne
testified that Mr. Araya had admitted to being in the group of assailants at
the park on October 3, Mr. Araya said that discrepancies in this testimony,
such as whether he had told Mr. Browne “I was involved” or “I wasn’t involved”,
and “we rolled up” or “they rolled up”, undermined the value of Mr. Browne’s inculpatory
testimony (Mr. Browne testified that he understood “roll up” in this context to
mean to rob the individuals in the tennis court). 

[13]                         
The question of whether Mr. Araya was in
Buttonwood Park was thus central to the case against Mr. Araya. He disputed
that he was among those at the park, and never conceded that his appearance on
October 3, 2008 fit within the general description provided by the
eyewitnesses. 

[14]                         
Mr. Araya’s appearance had changed between the
events in 2008 and his trial: by 2011, he had gained weight, had shorter hair,
was clean-shaven, and wore glasses. The Crown sought to admit two photographs
of Mr. Araya taken five days after the shooting in order to establish what he
looked like at the time. The defence objected to the admission of the
photographs, arguing at trial that they were highly prejudicial. The concern
was that the jury might hear the vague eyewitness descriptions of the
assailants, note that the photographs of Mr. Araya showed that he fit those
descriptions, and impermissibly conclude that Mr. Araya must have been one of
the assailants as a result. The trial judge, McMahon J., admitted the
photographs for the limited purpose of allowing the jury to consider whether
Mr. Araya had any of the physical attributes described by the eyewitnesses,
subject to a limiting instruction that warned against improperly concluding
that Mr. Araya was among the assailants based solely on his appearance fitting
within the general eyewitness descriptions.

[15]                         
Before the jury retired to consider their
verdict, the trial judge issued lengthy jury instructions that addressed, inter
alia, the photographs at issue and Mr. Browne’s testimony.

[16]                         
Mr. Araya was convicted of manslaughter and
sentenced to eight years in prison, less credit for the time he had spent in
pre-trial custody. 

B.           
Ontario Court of Appeal, 2013 ONCA 734, 312
O.A.C. 284

[17]                         
Mr. Araya appealed his conviction and sentence
to the Ontario Court of Appeal, where he argued that the trial judge erred in
admitting the photographs and, in the alternative, that if the photographs were
properly admitted, the limiting instructions to the jury were insufficient to
protect against prejudice.

(1)        
The Majority (per Gillese J.A., Laskin J.A.
Concurring)

[18]                         
The majority found no error in the trial judge’s
finding that the photographs were relevant and had some probative value (para.
31), but agreed with Mr. Araya that this probative value was minimal in light of
the fact that the defence did not challenge the allegation that Mr. Araya’s
appearance in 2008 fit within the general description provided by eyewitnesses
(para. 32).

[19]                         
The majority then found that the use of the
photographs could have had a significant prejudicial effect by leading jurors
to engage in a flawed and impermissible line of reasoning in the following
manner: “The photos of the appellant at the time of the shooting reveal a
young, thin, relatively clean-shaven black male. Thus, at the time of the
shooting, the appellant fit the eyewitness generic descriptions of the robbers
in the tennis courts. Therefore, the appellant was in the park and/or one of
the robbers” (para. 33).

[20]                         
Given the potential prejudice that would arise
if a juror were to engage in such reasoning, the majority found that clear jury
instructions were required, and that the instructions had to meet two
requirements. First, they had to indicate the permissible use that could have
been made of the photos, and second, they had to explain the dangers of
impermissible lines of reasoning (para. 42). The majority found that the first
of these requirements was met (para. 45), but found the instructions
insufficient with regard to the second requirement because they did not
“clearly explain to the jury the chain of impermissible reasoning” (para. 47).
The majority also took issue with the specific wording of the trial judge’s
limiting instruction, finding it “confusing” (para. 46). 

[21]                         
In light of the insufficiency of the limiting
instruction, the majority found that there was a “risk of a serious miscarriage
of justice” (para. 50), and allowed the appeal on this ground. The majority
thus did not find it necessary to address Mr. Araya’s other asserted grounds
for appeal, including the trial judge’s treatment of Mr. Browne’s testimony.

[22]                         
The majority allowed the appeal and remitted the
matter for a new trial.

(2)        
Strathy J.A., Dissenting

[23]                         
Strathy J.A. dissented. He agreed with the
majority that the photographs were probative. He stated that in the absence of
an admission from Mr. Araya that he fit within the general eyewitness
descriptions in 2008, his appearance “remained a live issue” (para. 154). He
reviewed the trial judge’s jury charge and found it adequate to guard against
the risk of a miscarriage of justice. Specifically, he found that the risk of
prejudice needed to be evaluated “having regard to all the evidence before the
jury, the arguments of counsel, and the trial judge’s charge, taken as a whole”
(para. 157, citing R. v. Hay, 2013 SCC 61, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 694, at para.
47).

[24]                         
Looking at the trial proceedings as a whole,
Strathy J.A. found that the impugned photographs played a minor role in the
Crown’s case. They were also referred to by the defence as serving to exclude
Mr. Araya from the general eyewitness descriptions, because some of the
witnesses had described the assailants as clean-shaven, while Mr. Araya had
facial hair at the time (para. 158). He also noted that the defence did not
object to the jury instruction on this issue (para. 171). He found that the
majority’s view that there was significant risk that jurors would make
impermissible use of the photos “gives no credit to the jury’s common sense and
no weight to the trial judge’s instruction that it was precisely what they
should not do” (paras. 178-79).

[25]                         
Strathy J.A. also considered several other
arguments raised by Mr. Araya at the Court of Appeal. Most relevant to the
arguments before this Court, he considered whether the trial judge erred in his
instructions pertaining to Mr. Browne’s testimony. Strathy J.A. summarized both
Mr. Browne’s version and Mr. Araya’s version of the conversation they had at
school on October 7, 2008 (paras. 93-109), as well as their respective versions
of a subsequent conversation at the Metro West Detention Centre on October 23,
2008 (paras. 116-22). He acknowledged that there were apparent discrepancies
between Mr. Browne’s police statement and his testimony at trial (para. 104),
but that the trial judge “thoroughly reviewed the evidence of both the appellant
and Browne concerning their two conversations” (para. 246), that the jury
instructions explained how the jury should consider the differences between Mr.
Browne’s police statement and his testimony at trial (para. 247), and that the
jury was told to consider Mr. Browne’s testimony as to what Mr. Araya said, not
what Mr. Browne interpreted those statements to mean (para. 249). 

[26]                         
Strathy J.A. concluded that the apparent
discrepancies between Mr. Browne’s police statement and trial testimony about
the school conversation and between Mr. Browne’s and Mr. Araya’s
characterization of the detention centre conversation arose because of
ambiguous language (paras. 253-54). Thus, “it was for the jury to consider the
explanation of the alleged inconsistency and to determine what to make of the
evidence” (para. 255). The trial judge’s explanation of the jury’s duties and
his caution that Mr. Browne’s testimony be considered only for Mr. Araya’s
words, rather than Mr. Browne’s interpretation of them, were sufficient to render
the jury instructions adequate (para. 255).

[27]                         
Strathy J.A. would have dismissed the appeal
from conviction.

III.       
Issues

[28]                         
The Crown raises the following issues on appeal:

(1)        Whether the trial judge’s jury instructions regarding the
permissible and impermissible uses of the two photographs of Mr. Araya were
insufficient; and

(2)        Whether the majority at the Court of Appeal erred in
failing to apply the curative proviso in s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code .

[29]                         
Mr. Araya seeks to uphold the decision of the majority
of the Court of Appeal and raises the following additional issues:

(3)        Whether the photographs were inadmissible because they
lacked any probative value whatsoever; and

(4)        Whether the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the
jury that Mr. Browne’s account of the October 7, 2008 conversation with Mr.
Araya could not be relied upon as a confession of his involvement in the
robbery. This issue was raised by Mr. Araya before the Court of Appeal but not
addressed by the majority.

IV.       
Analysis

[30]                         
Under s. 686(1)(a) of the Criminal
Code , a court of appeal may allow an appeal against a conviction where the
verdict is unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence, where there has been a
wrong decision on a question of law, or where a miscarriage of justice has
occurred. Mr. Araya asserts that the trial judge’s decision to admit the
photographs, his instructions to the jury regarding the permissible use of the
photographs, and his instructions regarding the use of Mr. Browne’s testimony
each amounted to a miscarriage of justice. Based on the grounds raised, I am of
the opinion that these arguments are properly understood as assertions that the
trial judge engaged in misdirection or non-direction of the jury amounting to
errors of law.

A.          
Admissibility of Photographs

[31]                         
It is a basic principle of the law of evidence
that the probative value of a particular piece of evidence depends on the
context in which it is proffered. In assessing whether evidence was admissible
at trial, the trial judge’s weighing of probative value and prejudicial effect
is entitled to significant deference. Though this deference is not unlimited,
“the trial judge’s advantage of being able to assess on the spot the dynamics
of the trial and the likely impact of the evidence on the jurors” provides good
reason to defer to his or her weighing of the probative value against any
prejudicial effect that might arise as a result of admission: R. v. Shearing,
2002 SCC 58, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 33, at para. 73.

[32]                         
Under s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code , an
accused may be found culpable of an offence if that person shares a common
intent to commit an unlawful act with one or more other people, and one of
those other people commits an offence that the defendant knew or ought to have
known was a probable consequence of the plan.[1]
In this case, Mr. Araya was convicted of manslaughter under this party
liability provision; while the Crown did not assert that Mr. Araya was the
shooter, it did argue that Mr. Araya was among the group of assailants, and
that the shooting was a probable consequence of their plan to accost Mr.
Cikovic’s group in the park. Accordingly, the Crown needed to establish that
Mr. Araya was in Buttonwood Park at the time of the shooting, as well as the
extent of his involvement in the assailants’ common intent to commit robbery
and that he knew or should have known that the shooting was a probable
consequence of that plan.

[33]                         
Whether Mr. Araya could have been among the
assailants was a critical issue in this case, because he denied being in
Buttonwood Park the night of the shooting. The Crown sought to admit the
post-arrest photographs of Mr. Araya as bearing on the question of identity,
and defence counsel objected on the ground that the photographs were highly
prejudicial. The trial judge, in ruling on the admissibility of the
photographs, remarked that the jury was presented with testimony from multiple
witnesses that established a set of vague physical attributes possessed by the
assailants. He then noted that the jury had been able to observe Mr. Araya’s
appearance at trial over several weeks, and that this appearance differed
considerably from Mr. Araya’s appearance in 2008. He found that the photos were
circumstantially relevant to the limited question of whether Mr. Araya’s
appearance in 2008 fit within the general descriptions provided by witnesses.

[34]                         
Mr. Araya contends that the photos were not
relevant to a live issue at trial, and thus were improperly admitted, because
it was “apparent” that he did not dispute that his appearance had changed
significantly between 2008 and 2011. However, even if this Court were to accept
this implied concession, the issue of whether his appearance had changed is a
distinct matter from the issue of whether his appearance in 2008 fit within the
eyewitness descriptions. Here, Mr. Araya did not concede that his appearance
fit within the general eyewitness descriptions. Accordingly, I see no reason to
challenge the trial judge’s finding that the photographs were relevant for this
particular purpose.

[35]                         
Mr. Araya relies on R. v. Proctor (1992),
69 C.C.C. (3d) 436 (Man. C.A.), for the proposition that the Crown may not
adduce prejudicial evidence that bears on matters that are not in dispute. This
reliance is misplaced. Proctor concerned the Crown’s refusal to accept a
“crystal clear” defence admission as to identity in order to artificially
preserve an issue at trial such that highly inflammatory evidence could be
adduced with reference to that issue: pp. 440 and 447. Here, there was no clear
admission that Mr. Araya’s appearance fit within the eyewitness descriptions,
nor did the Crown reject an admission in an attempt to adduce inflammatory
evidence; the trial judge in this case remarked that the photographs were
relatively innocuous in and of themselves, and did not feature the defendant in
an overtly prejudicial light. In addition, at the time the Crown sought to
admit the photographs, it could not have known what would or would not be said
with regard to Mr. Araya’s appearance and the general eyewitness descriptions
when the defence’s evidence was adduced or in defence counsel’s closing
address. Thus, Proctor does not bear on the circumstances at issue in
this case.

[36]                         
Mr. Araya also asserts that, because it would
have been impermissible to show the photographs of a single individual to the
eyewitnesses and ask them if the person shown was the person they observed, it
was impermissible to show the photographs to the jury in this case. I agree
that there are particular dangers involved in showing eyewitnesses a single
photograph to determine if the individual shown is the individual they saw. In
such a case, there is a distinct possibility that “the person who has seen the
photograph will have stamped upon his memory the face he has seen in the
photograph, rather than the face he saw on the occasion of the crime”: R. v.
Goldhar (1941), 76 C.C.C. 270 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 271. But this danger
relates to the fact that the witness’s memory, which may be given
considerable persuasive weight by the jury if found to be credible and
reliable, may be tainted by exposure to a single photograph: Goldhar, at
p. 271; R. v. Smierciak, [1947] 2 D.L.R. 156 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 157-58.
This concern is not relevant where it is the jury who has been exposed to
photographs of a single person and asked to consider whether the person shown
falls within a general description. The jury has no pre-existing memory of the
person’s appearance to corrupt, nor is the concern about the
over-persuasiveness of tainted witness testimony relevant in this context.

[37]                         
Regarding the weighing of probative value and
prejudicial effect, the trial judge was satisfied that “there is probative
value to the jury knowing in an identification case what the accused looked
like at the time of the event”. He also acknowledged Mr. Araya’s argument that
the photos may have a prejudicial effect: 

Since none of the eyewitnesses can
identify the accused, the jury, armed with the photos, could improperly use the
photos to conclude that the accused may have been there because he may have fit
a general description of some eyewitnesses who could only provide vague
descriptions. It is submitted by the defence that this is the risk of prejudice
to the accused. [A.R., vol. VII, at p. 88]

He found that this
prejudicial effect could be appropriately mitigated by a limiting instruction,
and thus concluded that “the probative value of these photographs outweigh[s]
the prejudicial effect”. 

[38]                         
In light of the deference afforded to trial
judges on questions of balancing probative effect against prejudice, I agree
with the Court of Appeal that there is no reason to disturb the finding of the
trial judge that the photos were admissible.

B.           
Adequacy of Limiting Instruction

[39]                         
When considering an alleged error in a trial
judge’s jury instructions, “[a]n appellate court must examine the alleged error
in the context of the entire charge and of the trial as a whole”: R. v. Jaw,
2009 SCC 42, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 26, at para. 32, per LeBel J. Further, trial
judges are to be afforded some flexibility in crafting the language of jury
instructions: see Hay, at para. 48, citing R. v. Avetysan, 2000
SCC 56, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 745, at para. 9. While trial judges must seek to ensure
that their instructions adequately prepare the jury for deliberation, the
standard for jury instructions is not perfection. Appellate review of jury
instructions is meant to “ensure that juries are properly — not perfectly —
instructed”: R. v. Jacquard, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at para. 62, per Lamer
C.J. This Court has emphasized that the charge generally should not be
“endlessly dissected and subjected to minute scrutiny and criticism”: R. v.
Cooper, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 146, at p. 163. As Bastarache J. has summarized it
in R. v. Daley, 2007 SCC 53, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 523, at para. 30:

The cardinal rule is that it is the
general sense which the words used must have conveyed, in all probability, to
the mind of the jury that matters, and not whether a particular formula was
recited by the judge. The particular words used, or the sequence followed, is a
matter within the discretion of the trial judge and will depend on the
particular circumstances of the case. 

Appellate courts should
not examine minute details of a jury instruction in isolation. “It is the
overall effect of the charge that matters”: Daley, at para. 31.

[40]                         
I begin with an examination of the jury
instructions. Justice McMahon’s comprehensive jury charge was delivered over a
total of approximately four hours, and discussed a considerable number of
factual and legal issues relevant to the jury’s deliberations, including the
issue of the eyewitness descriptions and their relationship to the photographs.
Because of the importance of taking a functional and contextual approach to
reviewing jury instructions on appeal, the relevant portions of the charge that
address the question of whether Mr. Araya was in Buttonwood Park are reproduced
here. Regarding the eyewitness accounts, the trial judge instructed:

Now, members of the jury,
along with all the evidence I have already reviewed on this issue about whether
or not he was in the park that night, you should also consider how the people
that were in the tennis court that night described the black males that came
in. I want to remind you that none of the young people in the park can identify
Mr. Araya as being there. Many of the people in the tennis court told you
because of how dark it was, how the black males were dressed and how quickly
events took place, they could not tell you what any of the males’ faces looked
like.

 

Some of them were, however,
able to provide vague descriptions of clothing, height and skin colour. Some
were able to provide descriptions of hair style, and my recollection is none of
the people described the males as having facial hair. I also believe none of
the witnesses say they saw any of the males, when I say the males, the black
males that came in, as having a bag or knapsack when they arrived. As you
heard, these descriptions were very vague. [A.R., vol. I, at p. 94]

[41]                         
The trial judge then instructed the jury with
regard to the permissible and impermissible uses that could be made of the
photographs:

Now, you have photographs of
what Mr. Araya looked like five days after the shooting. I believe his evidence
and Ms. Cooke’s [sic] was that is what he looked like about that time of
October 3. You can consider whether he fits or does not fit the vague
descriptions provided by the various witnesses. You cannot, of course, however,
conclude based only on the vague descriptions of what Mr. Araya looked like in
the photographs, that he must be the person. That would be completely improper
since the descriptions are so vague and people can’t identify anyone. If there
are features described which are dissimilar to the accused, they may be used to
demonstrate that the accused was not present.

 

You will recall that none of
the witnesses described seeing facial hair. Now, you will have a picture of Mr.
Araya taken five days later which witnesses say reflect[s] how he looked on
October 3. It would appear he has some facial hair on his chin. Obviously he
does not have a bushy beard. It is what it is in the picture. It will be for
you to decide whether that is something that the witnesses would have noticed
considering the opportunity to observe, the condition of the witnesses and the
lighting conditions. [A.R., vol. I, at pp. 94-95] 

[42]                         
Finally, the trial judge instructed the jury on
how the eyewitness and photographic evidence bearing on Mr. Araya’s presence or
absence in the park related to broader issues of culpability:

If you believe and accept the
witnesses that the males were all clean shaven, then Mr. Araya could not have
been one of the males. Later in my review of the witnesses, I will go over each
witness’ evidence and their brief description.

 

You can, however, consider
how the accused looked and the vague descriptions of the males as but one piece
of circumstantial evidence, whether the accused’s physical appearance fit or
did not fit the vague descriptions. You would consider this along with the
totality of the evidence to determine whether the Crown has satisfied you
beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Araya was one of the black males who
attended the tennis court.

 

After you consider all that
evidence, if on the totality of the evidence you are not satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that Mr. Araya was in Buttonwood Park that night, the night
that Mr. Boris Cikovic was shot, then you will find the accused not guilty and
your deliberations would be over, and you won’t go through any further steps on
the decision tree.

 

If on the totality of the
evidence you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Araya was in that
park that night, then you must go on to determine if he committed any criminal
offence. As I mentioned earlier, simply being present at the scene of a crime
is not enough to find a person guilty of an offence. So assuming you are
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in the park, you would
go to the next step. [A.R., vol. I, at pp. 95-97]

[43]                         
In finding the jury instructions to be
insufficiently clear, the majority at the Court of Appeal placed significant
emphasis on the following sentence from para. 41 above: “You cannot, of course,
however, conclude based only on the vague descriptions of what Mr. Araya looked
like in the photographs, that he must be the person.” The majority found this
sentence confusing for two reasons. First, the phrase “vague descriptions of
what Mr. Araya looked like in the photographs” appears incongruous. The vague
descriptions were of the assailants the eyewitnesses saw in the park, and not
the photographs of Mr. Araya. Second, the majority found the use of the phrase
“he must be the person” unclear, because it did not specify whether the jury
was barred from inferring that he was only in the park or inferring that he was
one of the robbers (para. 46).

[44]                         
With respect, these concerns are overstated when
viewed in the context of the broader instructions. Regarding the apparent
ambiguity about the phrase “vague descriptions of what Mr. Araya looked like in
the photographs”, this phrasing appears to be a minor misstatement. A clarified
articulation in the judge’s oral charge would have stated that the jurors could
not draw conclusions about identity based only on the general descriptions and
what Mr. Araya looked like in the photographs. Indeed, the written charge to
the jury stated exactly this in instructing that the jury could not “conclude
based only on the vague descriptions and what Mr. Araya looked like in
the photographs, that he must be the person” (emphasis added). I would not go
so far as to suggest that all flaws in oral jury instructions may be remedied
by corrected written instructions alone, as some jurors may place significant
weight on what they hear in the courtroom. But where the criticism of oral jury
instructions rests on the possibility that the jurors may have been confused,
including unambiguous language in the written instructions helps ensure that
jurors who found themselves confused would have had access to that clarified
language for reference.

[45]                         
Further, in the context of the oral jury charge
itself, the trial judge adopted a clear phrasing moments later when he instructed
the jury that “[y]ou can, however, consider how the accused looked and
the vague descriptions of the males as but one piece of circumstantial
evidence, whether the accused’s physical appearance fit or did not fit the
vague descriptions” (emphasis added). This statement further clarifies the
logical relationship between the photos and the vague descriptions.

[46]                         
Regarding the second issue, that the jury may
have been confused by the phrase “he must be the person”, the majority at the
Court of Appeal was concerned that this phrasing did not make it clear exactly
which inferences would be improper to draw based only on the eyewitness
descriptions and the photos. Specifically, given the general nature of the
evidence, it would have been impermissible to infer from the eyewitness
descriptions and the photos alone whether Mr. Araya was in the park or part of
the group of assailants. However, two paragraphs later in the trial judge’s
instructions, he notes that “[i]f you believe and accept the witnesses that the
males were all clean shaven, then Mr. Araya could not have been one of the
males.” Not only does this latter statement emphasize the exculpatory features
of the photographs in a way that would seem to help minimize the danger that
they would be highly prejudicial to Mr. Araya, it further emphasizes that the
inferences relevant to the photographs are those that would place Mr. Araya
with the assailants in the park. 

[47]                         
From the entirety of the jury instructions and
the context of the trial, it is clear that “the males” refers to the group of
male assailants in Buttonwood Park. While I do not dispute that the phrase “he
must be the person” could have been made more explicit, it seems reasonably
clear in the context of this case that inferring that Mr. Araya was “the
person” meant inferring that he was in Buttonwood Park and among the
assailants. Having regard to the context of the jury instructions, I am not
persuaded that the jury would have been confused by the phrase “he must be the
person”.

[48]                         
Before this Court, counsel for Mr. Araya argued
that the trial judge erred further in instructing the jury with regard to the
extent of Mr. Araya’s facial hair at the time of the shooting, and whether the
witnesses would have observed it. The trial judge instructed that “[i]t will be
for you to decide whether [Mr. Araya’s facial hair, as shown in the post-arrest
photographs,] is something that the witnesses would have noticed considering
the opportunity to observe, the condition of the witnesses and the lighting
conditions.”

[49]                         
It was asserted by Mr. Araya’s counsel that this
instruction is problematic because it amounts to an assumption that Mr. Araya
was in the park. I cannot agree. Taken in context, it cannot fairly be said to
expressly or impliedly assume that he was in the park. The very next sentence
in the jury charge instructs the jury that if they believe the witnesses that
all of the assailants were clean-shaven, Mr. Araya could not have been among
them. Thus, the possibility that Mr. Araya may not have been in the park or
among the assailants was expressly acknowledged. Reading these two statements
together, I do not find that there was a significant risk that the jury may
have been improperly swayed by the instruction regarding whether the witnesses
would have been able to observe Mr. Araya’s facial hair. It remained
sufficiently clear that the question of whether Mr. Araya was in the park or
among the assailants was one for the jury to decide. 

[50]                         
It is worth noting that neither counsel invited
the jury to follow the impermissible line of reasoning or use the photographs
in the problematic manner suggested by the majority of the Court of Appeal.
That is not to say that a flawed instruction could not by itself give rise to a
miscarriage of justice, but it is a relevant consideration in evaluating the
context of the jury instructions.

[51]                         
It is also relevant that Mr. Araya’s trial
counsel (not counsel on appeal) — the person in the courtroom most attuned to
Mr. Araya’s interests — did not object to the allegedly confusing and insufficient
instruction at trial. This failure to object suggests that the phrasing of this
instruction, heard in its full context in the courtroom, did not sound likely
to confuse or to invite improper reasoning. This Court has stated that while
defence counsel’s failure to object to jury instructions is not determinative
on appeal, it nonetheless “says something about both the overall accuracy of
the jury instructions and the seriousness of the alleged misdirection”: Jacquard,
at para. 38.

[52]                         
Parsing the language in one particular sentence
to determine whether it was sufficient to warn of an impermissible line of
reasoning, without taking into consideration the greater context of the jury
instructions and the trial itself, represents the kind of dissection and minute
scrutiny this Court warned against in Cooper. While the instruction
regarding impermissible use was not perfect, I would emphasize Dickson C.J.’s
comments in R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, at p. 692, that “it
would be quite wrong to make too much of the risk that the jury might
use the evidence for an improper purpose. This line of thinking could seriously
undermine the entire jury system” (emphasis in original). In this case, there
does not appear to be a considerable risk that the jury would have, as a
consequence of minor imperfections with the jury instructions, abandoned their
common sense and adopted the clearly flawed reasoning that because Mr. Araya’s
appearance fit within a broad description that could have encompassed a great
many individuals, he must have been in Buttonwood Park.

[53]                         
Finally, in assessing the overall adequacy of
the jury instructions, the majority of the Court of Appeal emphasized that
“this was not a strong Crown case” (para. 49). Before this Court, Mr. Araya’s
counsel further urged that the adequacy of the jury instructions should be
evaluated in light of the strength of the Crown’s case. I agree with the Crown
that the strength of its case was not a proper consideration in evaluating the
adequacy of the jury instructions. As this Court observed in R. v. Hibbert,
2002 SCC 39, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 445, at para. 43, per Arbour J., the proper order
of inquiry in evaluating jury instructions requires judges first to look to the
adequacy of the instructions. Only then, if they are found inadequate, must the
nature and effect of the error in the instructions be determined with reference
to the strength of the Crown case, in the context of the curative proviso
framework of s. 686(1)(b)(iii). 

[54]                         
In my opinion, the foregoing establishes that
the risk of a juror actually using the photographs as the basis for an
impermissible line of reasoning in the context of this case was appropriately
minimized both by the fact that Crown counsel did not urge the jury to adopt
impermissible lines of inference and by the trial judge’s charge to the jury.
Accordingly, I am satisfied that the limiting instruction, taken in context,
was adequate.

C.           
Characterization of the Testimony of Mr. Browne

[55]                         
Mr. Araya emphasizes certain inconsistencies
between Mr. Browne’s testimony and police statement about the school
conversation on October 7, 2008 and argues that, in light of these
inconsistencies, it was an error for the trial judge to refer to that conversation
as a “confession” in the jury instructions. Three questions are relevant in
addressing this argument: first, what was the nature of the alleged
inconsistencies between Mr. Browne’s police statement and his testimony at
trial? Second, did the trial judge err in his consideration of those
inconsistencies? Third, did the trial judge err in labeling the school
conversation a “confession” in the jury instructions?

(1)        
Inconsistencies Between Mr. Browne’s Police
Statement and His Trial Testimony

[56]                         
Mr. Araya points to several phrases that he
argues establish significant inconsistencies between Mr. Browne’s police
statement and his testimony at trial. Further, he says that Mr. Browne’s
testimony contained his interpretation of Mr. Araya’s words, rather than the exact
words used by Mr. Araya during the school conversation (R.F., at para. 53), and
that the manner in which the testimony was framed for the jury in the jury
instructions constituted a miscarriage of justice. (As indicated earlier, I am
of the opinion that this is better characterized as an allegation that the
trial judge erred in law.) I will first consider each of the alleged
inconsistencies. I will then consider whether the jury instructions respecting
those alleged inconsistencies were adequate given the potentially inconsistent
nature of Mr. Browne’s statements. However, in considering each alleged
inconsistency, it is important to observe that the analysis of any particular
phrase, removed from the context of the trial record and jury instructions, should
not be given undue weight in evaluating the adequacy of the jury charge as a
whole. Rather, analysis of these phrases informs the broader contextual inquiry
into whether the jury was adequately instructed on how, as a matter of law,
they could consider Mr. Browne’s statements. 

[57]                         
First, Mr. Browne indicated in his police
statement that Mr. Araya told him “[t]hey rolled up on these guys” in
the park, while at trial he testified that Mr. Araya said “[w]e rolled
up on these guys” (R.F., at para. 55 (emphasis in factum)). Mr. Araya asserts
that the first phrasing indicates that he was not participating in the robbery
that led to the shooting, while the second phrasing suggests he was an active
participant (R.F., at para. 55). He argues that the two statements are
fundamentally inconsistent, and that the critical implication that he was a
participant in the robbery arose out of Mr. Browne’s interpretation of Mr.
Araya’s comments, and not from Mr. Araya’s actual words during the school
conversation. Put briefly, Mr. Araya argues that Mr. Browne’s police statement
should be taken as accurate and exculpatory, while his statements at trial
should be viewed as an impermissible interpretive spin on Mr. Araya’s actual
words.

[58]                         
Examining these two phrases in greater context,
I am not persuaded that they are irreconcilable. During his police statement,
Mr. Browne occasionally spoke in sentence fragments and mixed his recollections
of Mr. Araya’s actual words with his own summaries of Mr. Araya’s words and
with recollections of his own words. Regarding the issue of who rolled up on
Mr. Cikovic’s group in the park, Mr. Browne described this portion of the
conversation to the police as follows: “And [Mr. Araya] went on to explain
basically that he said, no, he didn’t want to be involved in it but they rolled
up on the guys anyway.” By contrast, Mr. Browne’s testimony at trial was that
“the summary would be I was there, I was involved. We rolled up on some guys. I
didn’t have the gun, things went down, someone got hit, but I wasn’t the one
carrying the gun.”

[59]                         
In my view, Mr. Browne’s police statement that
“they rolled up on the guys” could have been a direct recollection of Mr.
Araya’s specific use of the word “they” — doing so could have been Mr. Araya’s
way of distancing himself from the assailants by removing himself from the
group. Alternately, this phrase could have been Mr. Browne speaking about Mr.
Araya and the rest of the group of assailants rolling up on Mr. Cikovic’s group
together after Mr. Araya’s initial protest. It does not seem unreasonable that
the jury could have interpreted Mr. Browne’s use of “they” in this latter
sense. Nor do these statements necessarily establish that Mr. Browne was
spinning Mr. Araya’s words during his testimony at trial to make them seem more
inculpatory than the statements he initially reported to police.

[60]                         
Second, Mr. Araya emphasizes that at trial, Mr.
Browne described his recollection of Mr. Araya’s statement as follows: “Well,
you know, someone got shot but I -- I didn’t do it. I was there, I was
involved, but I didn’t do it. I didn’t have the gun” (emphasis added). By
contrast, during his police statement, Mr. Browne described Mr. Araya’s
statement as follows: 

. . . I said what about [the
shooting in Buttonwood Park] and he’s like well I was there but I wasn’t
involved and I said what do you mean Nahoor? And he’s like, I was there but
I wasn’t involved, I didn’t have the gun and he went on to explain
basically that um he had said no he didn’t want to be involved in it but they
rolled up on the guys anyway. [Emphasis added; A.R., vol. VII, at pp. 138-39.]

Mr. Araya asserts that
Mr. Browne’s initial statement to the police (“I was there but I wasn’t
involved”) was his recollection of what Mr. Araya said to him, while what Mr.
Browne said at trial (“I was there, I was involved, but I didn’t do it”) was
his interpretation of Mr. Araya’s statements (see R.F., at para. 53).

[61]                         
Mr. Browne gave additional testimony that
creates some ambiguity about whether Mr. Araya actually admitted to
“involvement” in the robbery, despite his protestations that the group should
not go through with it. Mr. Browne testified that he understood Mr. Araya’s
statement that he was present in the park as implying involvement in the
robbery: “. . . him being there, I’m interpreting it as he’s
involved” (emphasis added). However, when asked by defence counsel immediately
after that statement whether “it’s only your interpretation that he was
involved in rolling up”, Mr. Browne clarified: “No, he said that he was there
and that they decided to roll up on this guy. He was one of the guys saying no.
Something went down, someone was hit, and now he’s seeking my advice as to what
he should do about his involvement in this matter.” While Mr. Browne expressly
denied that his testimony contained any interpretive spin, it appears that his
testimony contained both efforts to recall Mr. Araya’s actual words as well as
statements that could be read as Mr. Browne’s interpretation of the meaning of
those words. Even if this statement to the police were to be considered
inconsistent, however, it must nonetheless be considered in the context of the
rest of Mr. Browne’s testimony and the trial judge’s instructions to the jury
in this regard.

[62]                         
Third, regarding Mr. Browne’s own statements to
Mr. Araya during the school conversation, Mr. Araya argues that there is an
important difference between Mr. Browne’s testimony that he told him to “inform
the authorities” and his testimony that he told him to “turn [your]self in”
(R.F., at para. 55). Mr. Araya argues that the phrase “inform the authorities”
is more appropriately said to a witness, rather than a participant in a crime,
and that this inconsistency, combined with the other alleged inconsistencies in
Mr. Browne’s testimony, made it wrong for the trial judge to use the word
“confession” in the jury instructions (R.F., at para. 57). I am not persuaded
by Mr. Araya’s argument that the use of the phrase “inform the authorities”
should be given significant weight on appeal in determining whether the trial judge
acted improperly in using the word “confession” as he did in the jury
instructions. Examining Mr. Browne’s testimony regarding the school
conversation as a whole, his memory of his words to Mr. Araya was imperfect,
but he recalls telling him to inform the authorities with the understanding
that this phrase meant to turn himself in. 

[63]                         
The context of Mr. Browne’s testimony thus
indicates some uncertainty about the exact words he and Mr. Araya used in their
conversation at school, as well as his explanation for that uncertainty, which
the jury was entitled to consider. Further, the trial judge did take note of
inconsistencies in Mr. Browne’s testimony in his jury instructions, framing
them as follows:

Cordel Browne told you in
examination-in-chief that Mr. Araya told him he was there and involved in the
robbery but not the shooting. In cross-examination he was asked about the video
statement he gave to the police the day after that conversation. He admitted
telling the police that Mr. Araya said he was not involved. He also admitted
that what he told the police was the truth. He also provided an explanation for
the difference between what he said here and what he said in his earlier
statement. Since it would appear Mr. Browne adopted his prior statement, you may
consider that as part of his evidence. You must also consider his explanation
for the differences. [A.R., vol. I, at p. 38]

[64]                         
Given the possible interpretations of Mr.
Browne’s police statement and testimony, and of his testimony regarding the
meaning of the inconsistencies, I do not find that the trial judge’s
instruction regarding how the jury was to consider Mr. Browne’s evidence
amounted to misdirection. Where there were possible inconsistencies between Mr.
Browne’s police statement and trial testimony, the jury was properly instructed
to evaluate these differences. 

[65]                         
Even if one were to find some amount of
interpretive spin in Mr. Browne’s testimony about Mr. Araya’s statements on
October 7, 2008, as, for example, where he discusses the meaning of the word
“involved”, the trial judge’s jury instructions also expressly warned the jury
about the dangers of such testimony. The jury was instructed that it was “what
Mr. Browne was told that is relevant, not what Mr. Browne thinks Mr. Araya
meant by what he said”. Accordingly, I am not persuaded that the trial judge
misdirected the jury in relation to Mr. Browne’s evidence.

(2)        
Characterizing the School Conversation as a
“Confession”

[66]                         
Mr. Araya argues that the inconsistencies in Mr.
Browne’s testimony and the exculpatory nature of Mr. Araya’s statements as
initially recounted by Mr. Browne during his police statement make it
impermissibly prejudicial to describe the school conversation as a
“confession”. In this regard, Mr. Araya takes issue with the following jury instruction:

It is submitted that on October 7,
2008, Mr. Araya confessed to being one of the group of males who “rolled up” to
rob Mr. Cikovic and his friends in Buttonwood Park on the evening of October 3,
2008. It is submitted he told his teacher, Mr. Browne, that he did not have the
gun, he did not fire the shot, but that he was part of the group that “rolled
up.” It is the Crown’s position that in this context, Mr. Araya was using the
term “roll up” to mean they were going to commit a robbery. [A.R., vol. I, at
p. 159]

[67]                         
According to counsel for Mr. Araya, the use of
the word “confession” in this context was a “toxic instruction” that should
give rise to a new trial under the reasoning of R. v. Samuels (2005),
196 C.C.C. (3d) 403 (Ont. C.A.) (R.F., at para. 58). I do not agree. This case
is not like Samuels; in that case, the defendant’s statements were
largely exculpatory, but the trial judge himself instructed the jury that “the
statements of the accused Samuels contain both admissions or confessions as well
as excuses which tend to exonerate him”: para. 27. The trial judge went on to
suggest that greater weight should be placed on the defendant’s inculpatory
statements than his exculpatory ones. Armstrong J.A. held that the instruction
in that case was “seriously flawed. The statements of the appellant are largely
exculpatory and support his defence of accident. It is therefore wrong and
prejudicial to describe the statements as containing ‘admissions’ or
‘confessions’”: Samuels, at para. 28. Samuels thus found it
prejudicial for the trial judge, in the context of that case, to label
certain statements of the defendant as “confessions”.

[68]                         
By contrast, the trial judge in this case did
not himself label Mr. Araya’s statements as confessions. Indeed, he repeatedly
described the school exchange as a “conversation”, rather than a confession,
elsewhere in the charge. In the portion of the jury instructions emphasized by
Mr. Araya, the trial judge remarked that “[i]t is submitted that . . .
Mr. Araya confessed” (emphasis added). This statement amounts to a reiteration
of the Crown’s position, which was that the school conversation should be
viewed as a confession of guilt. When viewed in light of the trial judge’s
other cautions to the jury, including the caution that Mr. Browne’s testimony
should be evaluated only for its evidence of what Mr. Araya said, rather than
Mr. Browne’s interpretation of his statements, as well as the caution that
confession to mere presence at the scene was not sufficient to establish guilt,
I do not find that the single use of the word “confession” in describing the
Crown’s submissions would have been so “toxic” an instruction as to call for a
correcting instruction.

D.          
Grounds of Appeal Before the Ontario Court of
Appeal

[69]                         
Before the Court of Appeal, Mr. Araya asserted
that the trial judge had made seven errors. The majority of the Court of Appeal
found that the alleged flaws in the jury instructions pertaining to the
permissible use of the photographs were sufficient to allow the appeal, and thus
did not address the remaining alleged errors. Two of the seven errors
originally asserted — the admissibility of the photographs and the associated
jury instructions, and the trial judge’s treatment of Mr. Browne’s testimony —
were argued before this Court. The other five grounds that Mr. Araya asserted
before the Court of Appeal were that the trial judge erred in: 

(b) failing to caution the
jury concerning how to use disbelief of the appellant’s alibi; 

 

(c) failing to give a Vetrovec
caution with respect to the evidence of one eyewitness, George Athens; 

 

(d) failing to properly
instruct the jury regarding party liability under s. 21(2)  of the Criminal
Code  . . .;

 

. . .

 

(f) failing to instruct the
jury that it was improper for the Crown to ask the appellant to comment on why
his teacher would lie and implicate him in the shooting, given their positive
relationship; and 

 

(g) permitting the Crown to
lead evidence of the appellant’s demeanour at the time he learned of the
warrant for his arrest, and following his arrest, as after the fact conduct
capable of supporting an inference of guilt. 

(Court
of Appeal reasons, at para. 68, per Strathy J.A., dissenting) 

[70]                         
For the reasons of Strathy J.A., I agree that
the trial judge did not err in regard to any of these five additional grounds
of appeal.

E.           
Curative Proviso

[71]                         
Because I find the jury instructions to have
been adequate, it is not necessary to consider whether the facts of this case
would warrant the application of the curative proviso provided in s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code .

V.          
Conclusion

[72]                         
The appeal is allowed and the respondent’s
conviction for manslaughter is restored. The matter is remanded to the Ontario
Court of Appeal for consideration of the sentencing appeal.

                    Appeal
allowed.

on appeal from the court of appeal for manitoba

                    Criminal
law — Defences — Evidence — Admissibility — Unknown third party suspect — Accused
denied involvement in abduction-murder case — Accused sought to adduce evidence
at trial that unknown third party suspect involved in similar alleged abduction
which accused could not have committed — Trial judge found on balance of
probabilities that alleged abduction had not happened and refused to admit
evidence — Appropriate framework for determining admissibility of defence-led
evidence concerning unknown third party suspect — To what extent framework
requires trial judge to assess and weigh evidence of unknown third party
suspect.

                    In
2007, G was charged with the first degree murder of D, a notorious cold-case,
on the basis of newly-tested DNA evidence. G denied any involvement in the
murder, and sought to adduce evidence to suggest that, based on the modus
operandi and other physical evidence, D’s abductor had also abducted W while
G was in custody.

                    Having
found that the same legal test applied to the admissibility of known third
party suspect evidence and unknown third party suspect evidence, the trial
judge concluded on a balance of probabilities that the alleged abduction of W
had not happened. He refused to admit the evidence. G was convicted of second
degree murder by the jury. The Manitoba Court of Appeal concluded that G should
have been permitted to lead the evidence, allowed his appeal and ordered a new
trial.

                    Held: 
The appeal should be dismissed.

                    While
the tests governing known third party suspect evidence and similar fact
evidence may provide useful insights into the underlying concerns and
principles, they should not be stretched beyond the particular circumstances that
they were designed to address. Instead, first principles governing the
admissibility of evidence properly balance the competing interests that arise
when the defence seeks to lead evidence of an unknown third party suspect.

                    Defence-led
evidence is admissible where (1) the evidence is relevant to a fact in
issue, and (2) the probative value of the evidence is not substantially
outweighed by its prejudicial effects. The trial judge must therefore first
determine whether the evidence is logically relevant to an available defence.
Where the defence’s theory is that an unknown third party committed the
indicted crime, this factual foundation will be established by a sufficient
connection between the crime for which the accused is charged and the allegedly
similar incident(s) suggesting that the crimes were committed by the same
person, coupled with evidence that the accused could not have committed the
other offence. Once a sufficient connection is shown, the evidence will be
admissible unless its prejudicial effects substantially outweigh its probative
value. This assessment is inherently individualized, and is capable of
responding to various levels and forms of prejudice. It does not require the
accused to satisfy a higher admissibility threshold or require the trial judge
to engage in an enhanced evaluation of the evidence. The trial judge may not
invade the province of the jury and determine the strength of the evidence.

                    In
this case, the trial judge erred in law in treating the evidence relating to
the alleged abduction of W as known third party suspect evidence and in
requiring G to establish on a balance of probabilities that the alleged
abduction of W took place.  These errors entitled the Court of Appeal to
conduct its own assessment of the evidence. It was entitled to conclude that
there was evidence upon which the jury could find that the alleged crime
against W had occurred and, having regard to the similarities, that it had been
committed by the same person who killed D. The evidence that G could not have
committed the offence against W and the evidence of similarities between the
two offences would have provided some evidence capable of giving the unknown
third party suspect defence an air of reality. While an appellate court is
entitled to step into the shoes of the trial judge if the record permits, in
this case, the Court of Appeal was not in the position to assess and weigh the
extent of the probative value and the extent of prejudicial effect of the
unknown third party suspect evidence. The trial judge’s legal errors were
clearly not minor, and do not attract the application of the curative proviso
in s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code . The verdict would not
necessarily have been the same had the trial judge applied the correct
principles in determining the test for the admissibility of this defence
evidence. As this case must be re-tried in any event, the balancing of the
probative value and the prejudicial effect of the evidence is best left for the
trial judge.

I.             
Introduction

[1]                             
In 2007, the respondent, Mark Edward Grant, was
charged with the first degree murder of Candace Derksen, a notorious cold-case
murder that occurred in Winnipeg, Manitoba, almost 23 years earlier.  The
Crown’s case depended substantially on the recent analysis of small quantities
of DNA found at the scene of the crime.  Mr. Grant challenged the DNA evidence
and sought to lead evidence suggesting that an unknown third party suspect had committed
the crime.  The trial judge refused to admit the evidence of an allegedly
similar offence committed within months of the Derksen murder, while Mr. Grant
was in custody on an unrelated matter.[1] 
Mr. Grant was subsequently convicted of second degree murder by the jury.  The
Manitoba Court of Appeal concluded that Mr. Grant should have been permitted to
lead the evidence.  It allowed his conviction appeal and ordered a new trial.

[2]                             
The issues before this Court are the appropriate
framework for determining the admissibility of defence-led evidence concerning
an unknown third party suspect, and to what extent this framework requires the
trial judge to assess and weigh the evidence.

[3]                             
Obviously, the identification of an accused as the perpetrator of
the crime charged is essential to establishing criminal liability.  The burden
to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person before the court is the
guilty party rests squarely on the Crown.  In accordance with the presumption
of innocence, the accused is never required to prove her innocence.  An accused
person’s Charter-protected right to make full answer and defence
entitles her to challenge the Crown’s case and lead evidence to raise a
reasonable doubt about whether the accused committed the crime.

[4]                             
However, the accused’s rights are not the
only interests at stake.  The integrity of the administration of justice
requires that the proceedings stay focused on the indicted crime and not
devolve into trials within a trial about matters that may not be sufficiently
connected to the case.  Such tangents risk causing delays, confusion and
distractions that undermine the trial’s truth-seeking function.  This risk is
especially heightened where the defence seeks to introduce other alleged
suspects or crimes into the trial.

[5]                             
The parties agree that balancing these interests requires the
trial judge to evaluate the probative value of defence-led evidence of an
unknown third party suspect against the elevated risks it poses to the
integrity of the trial, but disagree about what this evaluation entails.  The
appellant the Manitoba Prosecution Service (the Crown) says that the trial
judge must apply the stringent admissibility tests developed for known third
party suspect and similar fact evidence.  The defence maintains that these
tests place an unfair burden on the accused and that the general rules of
admissibility adequately address the issues of relevance, probative value and
prejudicial effects.

[6]                             
In my view, it is not helpful to slot evidence
concerning an unknown third party suspect into categories that were not
designed to accommodate it.  While the tests governing known third party
suspect evidence and similar fact evidence may provide useful insights into the
underlying concerns and principles, they should not be stretched beyond the
particular circumstances that they were designed to address.

[7]                             
Instead, first principles governing the
admissibility of evidence properly balance the competing interests that arise
when the defence seeks to lead evidence of an unknown third party suspect.  In
such cases, the defence must first establish the logical relevance of the
evidence.  This may be done by demonstrating a sufficient connection ― or
similarity ― between the crime charged and another crime the accused
could not possibly have committed to support the logical inference that the
same person committed both crimes.  Once this threshold is met, the evidence will be admissible unless its prejudicial effects substantially
outweigh its probative value (R. v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577).

[8]                             
In this case, I conclude that the trial judge
erred in evaluating and assessing the credibility of the unknown third party
suspect evidence on a balance of probabilities.  I agree with the Court of
Appeal that a new trial is required.

II.          
Facts

[9]                             
Candace Derksen, a 13-year-old girl, went
missing after leaving school on Friday, November 30, 1984.  Her body was
discovered tied up in a shed in an industrial yard on January 17, 1985.  She
had died of hypothermia resulting from exposure.

[10]                         
In May 2007, Mr. Grant was arrested and charged
with first degree murder on the basis of newly tested DNA evidence.

[11]                         
Mr. Grant denied any involvement in the
abduction-murder, and sought to adduce evidence of the alleged involvement of
an unknown third party suspect.  That evidence related to the alleged abduction
of a 12-year-old girl (P.W.) after she left school on Friday, September 6,
1985, at a time when Mr. Grant was in custody.  Mr. Grant argued that the modus
operandi and other physical evidence indicated that the same person had
abducted both Candace Derksen and P.W.

A.          
Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench

[12]                         
In reviewing the applicable legal framework,
Joyal A.C.J.Q.B. concluded that the legal test set out in R. v. Grandinetti,
2005 SCC 5, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 27, applies equally to admissibility of both
unknown third party suspect evidence and known third party suspect evidence. 
Thus, evidence of an unknown third party suspect could be “admitted only after
some threshold evidence ha[d] been demonstrated respecting a link between the
third party, known or unknown, and the crime before the court” (trial transcript,
A.R., vol. III, at p. 48).  The trial judge also referred to this Court’s
jurisprudence for similar fact evidence and, specifically, to R. v. Handy,
2002 SCC 56, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908.

[13]                         
After reviewing the documentary and testimonial
evidence adduced on the voir dire, the trial judge found that he was
“not, even on a balance of probabilities, able to conclude that the alleged
offence [against P.W.] happened” (A.R., vol. I, at pp. 8-9).  As a result, he
found there could be no unknown third party suspect and thus “no useable
similarities” (p. 9).  The trial judge concluded that the evidence was not
sufficiently probative to justify the impact its admission would have on the
length and complexity of the trial, and ordered that the defence not make any
reference to the P.W. incident.

B.           
Manitoba Court of Appeal, 2013 MBCA 95, 299 Man.
R. (2d) 202

[14]                         
Before the Manitoba Court of Appeal, Mr. Grant
appealed his conviction and brought a motion to adduce fresh evidence relating
to DNA analysis and juror bias.  After rejecting several grounds relating to
the conviction, Monnin J.A., writing for the court, held that the trial judge
erred in not allowing Mr. Grant to lead evidence relating to an alleged unknown
third party suspect (paras. 9-10, 78).

[15]                         
The Court of Appeal concluded that the trial
judge made factual and credibility findings that “he was not entitled to make”
in determining admissibility and that he relied “almost exclusively on the viva
voce evidence of P.W. to the exclusion of all of the other evidence before
him, including P.W.’s two prior statements” (para. 68).  The trial judge erred
in applying the balance of probabilities standard to determine whether the P.W.
incident occurred; he should have instead applied the Seaboyer test that
broadly governs the admissibility of defence-led evidence (paras. 73-74). 
Furthermore, in determining whether the defence theory had an air of reality,
all that was required was “some evidence” that could leave a jury with a
reasonable doubt as to the accused’s guilt (para. 68).

[16]                         
The Court of Appeal characterized the evidence
tendered in this case as “more akin to similar-fact evidence” than to known
third party suspect evidence (para. 72).  However, the court concluded that the
test applicable to Crown-led similar fact evidence does not apply when such
evidence is advanced by an accused; rather, defence-led similar fact evidence
is admissible unless its prejudicial effects substantially outweigh its
probative value, in accordance with Seaboyer.

[17]                         
The Court of Appeal concluded that the evidence
pertaining to the P.W. incident was “very relevant” and “pointed to the
possibility that the same person who killed Candace Derksen abducted P.W., if
the jury so found that to have occurred” (para. 70).  As Mr. Grant was in
custody at the time of the P.W. incident, this evidence “could provide the
basis upon which a reasonable, properly instructed jury could acquit” (ibid.). 
The court concluded that, since the prejudicial effects of the evidence did not
substantially outweigh its probative value, Mr. Grant should have been
permitted to place the evidence of the P.W. incident before the jury (para.
78).  The court noted that this evidence was also relevant in assessing
the evidence of the defence DNA expert that excluded Mr. Grant as a suspect. 
The accused was denied his opportunity to make full answer, and this legal
error was sufficient to set aside the conviction and order a new trial.

III.       
Analysis

A.          
Principles Governing the Admission of Defence
Evidence in Criminal Proceedings

[18]                         
The truth-seeking function of the trial creates
a starting premise that all relevant evidence is admissible (R. v. L. (D.O.),
[1993] 4 S.C.R. 419; R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670).  Evidence is
logically relevant where it has any tendency to prove or disprove a fact in
issue (Corbett, at p. 715).

[19]                         
However, not all relevant evidence is
admissible.  The trial judge must also balance the probative value of the
evidence against the prejudicial effects of its admission (R. v. Noël, 2002 SCC 67, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 433; Corbett;
Sweitzer v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 949; Seaboyer; R. v. Harrer, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 562).  Evidence led by the Crown will be excluded where its prejudicial
effects outweigh its probative value (Seaboyer).  The presumption of the
accused’s innocence leads us to strike a different balance where defence-led
evidence is concerned.  As this Court explained in Seaboyer, “the prejudice must substantially outweigh the value of the evidence
before a judge can exclude evidence relevant to a defence allowed by law” (p.
611; see also R. v. Shearing, 2002 SCC 58, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 33; R. v. Arcangioli,
[1994] 1 S.C.R. 129).

[20]                         
In order for the judge to put a defence to the
jury, the accused must point to evidence on the record
that gives the defence an air of reality (R. v. Cinous, 2002 SCC 29,
[2002] 2 S.C.R. 3).  The trial judge must
determine whether there is some evidence that is “reasonably capable of
supporting the inferences required for the defence to succeed” (ibid.,
at para. 83).  The air of reality test applies to all
defences, and acts as a threshold to ensure that “fanciful or far-fetched”
defences are not put before the trier of fact (para. 84).  When applying this
test, the trial judge must take the evidence to be true and must not assess
credibility or make other findings of fact (para. 54).

[21]                         
These principles are distinct, but may be
interrelated.  In most cases, where the defence evidence relates to the facts
underlying the offence charged, the logical relevance and the admissibility of
the evidence will be obvious.  However, where the evidence refers to a factual
matrix beyond the offence charged, its relevance to a fact in issue or an
available defence may be less clear.  In such circumstances, the gate-keeping
role of the trial judge may require her to determine whether the evidence is
logically relevant and connected to a defence that has an air of reality.  For
example, while the degree of similarity may be logically relevant to whether
the same person committed the offence, it will not relate to a fact in issue at
trial unless the defence has an air of reality.  In this case, the unknown
third party suspect defence will not have an air of reality unless there is
evidence that the accused could not have committed the other offence.  Thus,
logical relevance will sometimes be assessed with reference to whether the
defence for which the evidence is tendered is available.  That said, the air of
reality test set out in Cinous does not displace the Seaboyer admissibility
test.  The air of reality test and the Seaboyer admissibility test
remain two distinct inquiries.

[22]                         
These principles are firmly established in this
Court’s jurisprudence and are not generally challenged by the parties to this
appeal.  Instead, the dispute concerns their proper application to evidence
concerning an unknown third party suspect.

[23]                         
The Crown
argues that a modified version of Seaboyer must be applied,
incorporating aspects of the tests governing similar fact and known third party
suspect evidence.  I disagree.  As I discuss below, these tests are designed to
respond to the particular risks and benefits presented by particular types of
evidence.  Where evidence does not fit within these categories ― where it
does not present these specific risks and benefits ― its admission is
governed directly by the general principles of admissibility set out in Corbett
and Seaboyer.

B.           
The Known Third Party Suspect Test Does Not
Provide the Proper Template for Determining the Relevance of Unknown Third
Party Suspect Evidence

[24]                         
In order for evidence relating to a known third
party suspect to have any probative value, the evidence must show a sufficient
connection between the third person and the crime for which the accused is
charged (Grandinetti, at para. 47; McMillan v. The Queen, [1977]
2 S.C.R. 824).  The defence points to such evidence to raise a reasonable doubt
that someone else committed the crime in question.  Evidence that this third
person had the motive, the means, or the propensity to commit the crime will
often establish this sufficient connection.

[25]                         
As this Court recognized in McMillan, the
sufficient connection test is nothing more than an elaboration of the logical
relevance analysis applied in the particular context of allegations that
another, known individual committed the crime (pp. 828-29).  Abella J. affirmed
this point in Grandinetti, where she wrote:

The
requirement that there be a sufficient connection between the third party and
the crime is essential.  Without this link, the third party evidence is neither
relevant nor probative.  The evidence may be inferential, but the inferences
must be reasonable, based on the evidence, and not amount to speculation.  [para.
47]

Without a sufficient connection
between the third party and the crime, the evidence of a known third party
suspect is simply not logically relevant.

[26]                         
There is no principled reason to require that
the connection be established by evidence relating directly to the third party
where that individual is unknown.  Such an articulation of the test ―
designed, for example, to capture the motive, propensity or opportunity of a
known third party to commit the crime ― would place an unrealistic burden
on the accused.  How could an accused establish the motive, propensity or opportunity of an
unknown individual?  (See, on this point, State
v. Scheidell, 227 Wis.2d 285 (1999), at paras. 24-27.)

[27]                         
Where the third party’s identity is unknown, the
nature of the connection must reflect a different factual matrix.  In such
circumstances, the sufficient connection ― to anchor the relevance and
probative value of the evidence ― generally arises from similarities
between the crime charged and another crime that the accused could not possibly
have committed.

[28]                         
This focus on the similarities between the
offences is not a formulation of a new, categorical test. Rather, it reflects
the principles underlying Grandinetti which play out differently in
different factual contexts.  Like known third party suspect evidence, “in the
absence of some nexus with the alleged offence”, unknown third party suspect
evidence will constitute mere speculation (R. v. McMillan (1975), 7 O.R.
(2d) 750 (C.A.), at p. 758, aff’d [1977] 2 S.C.R. 824).  Unless the
circumstances and similarities to the other offence are sufficient to suggest
that the same individual committed both crimes, unknown third party suspect
evidence will not be logically relevant.

[29]                         
This is consistent with the
approaches taken by other common law jurisdictions in assessing defence-led
evidence of similar acts.[2]

[30]                         
A finding of logical relevance does not end the
admissibility inquiry.  Even the Grandinetti sufficient connection test
speaks only to the probative value side of the Seaboyer equation.  Once
the relevance threshold is met, the trial judge must still be satisfied that
the probative value of the evidence tendered by the defence is not
substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effects.

C.           
The Admissibility Test for Crown-led Similar
Fact Evidence Does Not Apply to Defence-led Evidence of the Similar Acts of a Non-accused

[31]                         
Similar fact evidence is, most
commonly, evidence of the accused’s prior bad acts led by the Crown.  Such
evidence is presumptively inadmissible, as its highly prejudicial effects
generally outweigh its probative value (R. v. Arp, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 339; Handy). 
As this Court noted in R. v. B. (C.R.), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 717, at p. 732, putting
evidence of the accused’s “prior immoral or illegal acts” before the jury
inevitably results in a “heavy prejudice” to the accused.  The presumptive
inadmissibility of this evidence is tied to both the moral aspect of this
prejudice ― the
danger that the trier of fact will wrongfully convict the accused simply to
condemn her for her prior bad acts ― and the reasoning aspect of this prejudice ― the danger that the
trier of fact will become distracted by the similar bad act evidence and accord
it more weight than it merits (Handy, at paras. 139-47).  Exceptionally,
similar fact evidence will be admitted where, based on the similarity of the
alleged acts, the Crown “satisf[ies] the trial judge on a balance of
probabilities that . . . the probative value of the evidence in relation to a
particular issue outweighs its potential prejudice and thereby justifies its
reception” (Handy, at para. 55).  Where the Crown leads similar fact
evidence to establish the identity of the perpetrator, the Crown must
satisfy the trial judge that, on a balance of probabilities, “the same person
committed the alleged similar acts” (Arp, at para. 48).

[32]                         
In addition to applying the Grandinetti
test for known third party suspects, the trial judge in the present case
applied a “balance of probabilities” threshold test to determine whether the
P.W. incident actually occurred.  In so doing, he referred to the admissibility
test for Crown-led similar fact evidence, as set out in Handy.  The
Court of Appeal found that the evidence in question was “akin to similar-fact
evidence”, but noted that, because this is defence-led evidence, Seaboyer,
not Handy, governs its admissibility (paras. 73-74).

[33]                         
This conclusion is
consistent with the approach taken by Canadian appellate courts where evidence
of a non-accused’s similar acts is sought to be introduced.  Appellate courts
faced with this issue have consistently found that such evidence is not
governed by the test applicable to
evidence of an accused’s similar acts (see, for example, R. v. Scopelliti
(1981), 34 O.R. (2d) 524 (C.A.); R. v. Pollock (2004), 187 C.C.C. (3d) 213 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 104; R. v. Kendall (1987), 35 C.C.C.
(3d) 105 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Sims (1994), 28 C.R. (4th) 231 (B.C.C.A.); R.
v. Hamilton, 2003 BCCA 490, 180 C.C.C. (3d) 80; R. v. Brousseau,
2006 QCCA 858).

[34]                         
Defence-led evidence concerning an
unknown third party suspect is only similar fact evidence in the sense that its
probative value is derived from the similarity between the incidents where it
is impossible for the accused to have committed the uncharged offence.  An onus
requiring proof on a balance of probabilities is not consistent with the
lower evidential burden of the accused to put a defence in issue by adducing
sufficient evidence “upon which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably
could acquit” (Cinous, at para. 49).  Rendering such defence-led
evidence presumptively inadmissible would effectively impose a persuasive burden
on the accused to prove her innocence.  As this Court noted in Seaboyer,
the test governing defence-led evidence must be accountable to “the fundamental
tenet of our judicial system that an innocent person must not be convicted” (p.
611).

[35]                         
Moreover, unknown third party
suspect evidence does not risk causing moral prejudice to the accused.  Such
evidence is intended to be exculpatory when raised by an accused, as it was in
this case.  Although the evidence engages some of the same reasoning prejudice
concerns as does evidence of the prior bad acts of the accused (Arp, at
para. 40; Handy, at para. 37), this prejudice can be addressed directly
under Seaboyer.

[36]                         
To conclude, the balance of probabilities test governing the admissibility of similar
fact evidence does not apply to unknown third party suspect evidence proffered
by the accused.  The similarity of the acts goes to the relevance of the
evidence, but imposing the onus of the Handy test on the accused is
neither consistent with the presumption of innocence nor necessary to protect
the accused from moral prejudice.  Any reasoning prejudice or risks to the
integrity of the trial process engaged by this evidence are better addressed
directly within the Seaboyer framework.

D.          
The Seaboyer Test Applies to the Admission of
Unknown Third Party Suspect Evidence

[37]                         
In my view, the
admissibility of evidence concerning an unknown third party suspect is best
determined in accordance with the broader, principled approach to the admission
of evidence found in Seaboyer.  Evaluating the admissibility of this
evidence under Seaboyer, rather than under disparate tests not designed
for its particularities, allows the trial judge to tailor her evaluation and
weighing of the probative value and prejudicial effects of the evidence to the
specific facts presented.  In accordance with Seaboyer, once the
evidence has been found to be relevant, unknown third party suspect evidence will be admitted unless its prejudicial
effects substantially outweigh its probative value.

[38]                         
As noted above, there are two components to the Seaboyer
analysis.  First, in applying Seaboyer, the trial judge must assess the
potential probative value of the evidence.  Where the
evidence relates to an unknown third party suspect, probative value will depend
in part on the strength of the connection or nexus between the two events
― that is, the degree of similarity between the indicted crime and the
allegedly similar incident.  As the Supreme Court of Wisconsin noted in Scheidell, “the
greater the similarity, complexity, and distinctiveness of the events, as well
as the relative frequency of the event, the stronger the case for admission” (para.
41, citing State v. Sullivan, 216 Wis.2d 768 (1998), at para. 54).

[39]                         
Second, the Seaboyer test is concerned
with the potential prejudicial effects of the evidence.  Unknown third party
suspect evidence, like Crown-led similar fact evidence, poses a particular risk
of reasoning prejudice.  Introducing evidence of other crimes that are
sufficiently similar to the crime charged may risk “the distraction of members
of the jury from their proper focus on the charge itself aggravated by the
consumption of time” (Handy, at para. 144).

[40]                         
However, these significant prejudicial effects
must nonetheless be evaluated in accordance with the fundamental principles
governing criminal proceedings.  In giving constitutional protection to the
accused’s rights to make full answer and defence and to be presumed innocent
until proven guilty, we must accept a certain amount of complexity, length, and
distraction from the Crown’s case as a necessary concession to the
actualization of those rights.  (See, for example, Scheidell,
at para. 65, per Abrahamson C.J., dissenting in the result.)

[41]                         
Contrary to the Crown’s submissions, applying Seaboyer
does not “mak[e] the test for admissibility turn on whether or not the third
party is named” (A.F., at para. 44).  Known third party suspect evidence is already
subject to the Seaboyer admissibility test:  do the prejudicial effects
substantially outweigh the probative value?  (See, for example, R. v. Murphy,
2012 ONCA 573, 295 O.A.C. 281 (third party suspect evidence); R. v.
Underwood, 2002 ABCA 310, 170 C.C.C. (3d) 500 (hearsay evidence of a
third party suspect).)  Indeed, defence-led evidence is generally subject to Seaboyer
(Shearing (defence cross-examination of a complainant); R. v. Clarke
(1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (complainant’s credibility); R. v. Jackson,
2013 ONCA 632, 301 C.C.C. (3d) 358, aff’d 2014 SCC 30, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 672
(deceased victim’s criminal convictions); R. v. C. (T.) (2004),
189 C.C.C. (3d) 473 (Ont. C.A.) (third party records in the possession of the
accused); Pollock (character evidence of a co-accused); R. v. Humaid (2006), 37 C.R. (6th) 347
(Ont. C.A.) (defence hearsay evidence); Hamilton (bad character evidence
of the deceased)).  Thus, while the principles in Seaboyer will always
apply, they play out differently in different situations.

[42]                         
As this discussion demonstrates, many of the
concerns animating the specific tests governing the admissibility of known
third party suspect and similar fact evidence are also addressed in the Seaboyer
analysis.  In all cases, the evidence must be beyond mere speculation and
conjecture.  The value of the evidence must be balanced against the risks posed
to the integrity of the trial when a party seeks to expand the ambit of the
trial to individuals or events not directly related to the crime indicted.

E.           
The Trial Judge’s Role as Evidentiary Gatekeeper
and the Seaboyer Test

[43]                         
The Crown argues that the trial judge, as
gatekeeper, must assess the quality and reliability of evidence as part of the
admissibility inquiry.  In light of the elevated risks posed by unknown third
party suspect evidence, the Crown submits that the Court of Appeal dangerously
lowered the threshold for third party suspect evidence by applying the “some
evidence” standard articulated in Cinous.  For the reasons that follow,
I do not accept this submission.

[44]                         
The trial judge plays a fundamentally important
role as evidentiary gatekeeper, tasked with preserving both the right of the
accused to make full answer and defence and the integrity of the trial
process.  To fulfill this mandate, the trial judge engages in a limited
weighing of the evidence to ensure that the jury only considers evidence (1) that
is relevant to a fact in issue, including an available defence; and (2) whose
probative value is not substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effects. 
These inquiries often overlap.  However, the trial judge is not permitted to
invade the province of the jury and determine the strength of the evidence (R.
v. Hart, 2014 SCC 52, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 544, at para. 98).

[45]                         
The trial judge must determine whether the
evidence is logically relevant to an available defence ― one that can be
put to the jury.  The air of reality test requires the trial judge, taking the
proposed evidence at its greatest strength, to determine whether the record
would contain “a sufficient factual foundation for a properly instructed jury
to give effect to the defence” (R. v. Buzizi, 2013 SCC 27, [2013] 2
S.C.R. 248, at para. 16).  Where the defence’s theory is that an unknown third
party committed the indicted crime, this factual foundation will be established
by a sufficient connection between the crime for which the accused is charged
and the allegedly similar incident(s), coupled with the impossibility that the
accused committed the other offence.

[46]                         
The trial judge must also assess and balance the
extent of the probative value and prejudicial effects of the evidence in
accordance with Seaboyer.  Like the air of reality test, the Seaboyer
admissibility test does not permit the trial judge to decide how much
weight to give the evidence or to make findings of fact.  Doing so would usurp
the role of the jury and would place a persuasive burden on the accused
inconsistent with the presumption of innocence.

[47]                         
The Crown argues that the substantial prejudice
arising from evidence concerning an unknown third party suspect requires a
higher threshold for both admissibility and putting the defence to the jury. 
However, substantial prejudice does not require a higher threshold; it simply
weighs heavier in the balance.  The Seaboyer admissibility test does not
presuppose a particular level of prejudice or probative value for certain
categories of evidence; instead, it requires a trial judge to conduct the
balancing process contextually, based on the particularities of the evidence
before her.  As an inherently individualized assessment, it is capable of
responding to various levels and forms of prejudice.  No other test or higher
threshold is required to protect the integrity of the trial process.

[48]                         
The same is true of the “some evidence”
threshold in the air of reality test, which the Crown argues the Court of
Appeal erred in applying in this case.  This standard does not indirectly lower
the threshold for unknown third party suspect evidence.  Rather, this standard,
when used in conjunction with the requirement for a sufficient connection
between the crimes, respects the requirements of Corbett, Seaboyer and
Cinous, and properly balances the integrity of the trial process with
the accused’s right to make full answer and defence.

[49]                         
This conclusion does not, as the Crown submits
it would, increase the scope of the Crown’s potential disclosure obligations
such that compliance becomes impossible.  The Crown continues to be required to disclose all relevant evidence
to the defence (R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, at pp. 336-40). 
The application of the Stinchcombe test obviously depends on the
circumstances of each case and each disclosure request.

[50]                         
In this case, the disclosure request was based
on notes by the lead investigator in the police file on the Derksen murder concerning a similar crime
(the P.W. incident) that was “very probably” connected to the Derksen murder (A.R., vol.
II, at p. 135).  The evidence for which disclosure was
sought was clearly relevant.

[51]                         
Where the similarities or the temporal or
geographic connections between the charged crime and the crime(s) for which
disclosure is sought are insufficient, the evidence will not be relevant, and
disclosure will not be required.  Allowing the defence to establish a
sufficient connection with reference to the crimes, rather than to the suspect,
does not extend the Crown’s duty of disclosure.

[52]                         
Nor does this conclusion jeopardize the Crown’s
ability to protect the privacy interests of individuals implicated in unrelated
criminal matters or the confidentiality of ongoing investigations.  The
disclosure test remains one of relevancy, and the legislative measures that
restrict disclosure to protect the privacy interests of individuals implicated
in criminal matters continue to apply (see, for example, Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, ss. 278.1  to 278.91 ; R. v. Quesnelle, 2014 SCC 46,
[2014] 2 S.C.R. 390).  Moreover, the Crown exercises discretion with respect to
the manner and timing of disclosure, thus allowing the Crown to delay
disclosure to ensure the safety of individuals involved in an ongoing
investigation (Stinchcombe, at pp. 339-40).  This discretionary
decision, like all other exercises of Crown discretion in disclosure matters,
must be justified on review (Stinchcombe, at p. 340).

F.            
Summary of Analysis 

[53]                         
To summarize, any
elevated risks of prejudice that arise when an accused seeks to introduce
evidence of an unknown third party suspect do not require the accused to
satisfy a higher admissibility threshold or require the judge to engage in an
enhanced evaluation of the evidence.  Existing rules achieve the appropriate
balance of maintaining the integrity of the trial
process while protecting the right of an accused to make full answer and
defence to the charges against her.

[54]                         
Thus, defence
evidence is admissible where (1) the evidence is relevant to a fact in
issue; and (2) the probative value of the evidence is not substantially
outweighed by its prejudicial effects.  Where the connection between the
evidence and a fact in issue at trial is not obvious, the air of reality test
may help a trial judge in determining if the evidence tends to prove a defence
that may become available.  Relevant evidence concerning an
unknown third party suspect will only be excluded where its prejudicial effects
substantially outweigh its probative value.

G.          
Application to the Facts

[55]                         
The trial judge erred in law in treating the
evidence relating to the P.W. incident as known third party suspect evidence. 
The connections tying a known third party to the charged crime ―
generally motive, opportunity or propensity ― do not fit the context of
an unknown third party suspect.  He also erred in requiring the accused to
establish on a balance of probabilities that the alleged abduction took place. 
There is no such evidentiary burden on the accused where he seeks to rely on
the defence that an unknown third party committed the crime in question.  To
the extent that the trial judge made findings of probative value and
prejudicial effects, those findings are intimately tied to the incorrect
balancing tests he used, and thus cannot be relied upon.

[56]                         
These errors entitled the Court of Appeal to
conduct its own assessment of the evidence (Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002
SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at paras. 31-35).  The court considered P.W.’s viva
voce testimony and her prior statements to the police, which the trial
judge had accepted (for the purposes of the voir dire) for the truth of
their contents, in accordance with R. v. Khelawon, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2
S.C.R. 787.  The court also considered other statements that had been admitted
on the voir dire for the truth of their contents with the Crown’s
consent, and other evidence pertaining to the incident, including the police
reports noting a possible connection between the P.W. incident and the Derksen
murder.

[57]                         
The Court of Appeal concluded that the evidence
was “very relevant” and that its probative value arose from the marked
similarities between the alleged abduction of P.W. and the crime for which Mr. Grant
is charged.  In each case, the victim was of a similar age.  Both victims left
school at the same time of day, on the same day of the week, nine months
apart.  Both were left in unlocked shed-like premises in the same industrial
area of Winnipeg, 2.6 kilometres apart.  Both victims were found abandoned with
their hands and feet tied with similar knots.  In neither case was there
evidence of physical or sexual assault.  The same type of gum wrapper was found
at both scenes (although, in the crime charged, it was found in the deceased’s
pocket, suggesting it may have been hers).

[58]                         
I cannot accept the Crown’s submission that
these similarities are insufficient on any test and that the evidence relied
upon by the Court of Appeal would not be available at trial.  As the Crown
cannot resile from its concession that the various statements were admissible
for their truth for the purpose of determining admissibility, the Court of
Appeal was entitled to rely upon this voir dire evidence in assessing
its potential probative value.

[59]                         
The Court of Appeal was entitled to conclude
that there was evidence upon which the jury could find that the subsequent
crime had occurred and, having regard to the similarities, that it had been
committed by the same person who killed Candace Derksen.  In light of the
evidence that the accused could not have committed the other offence, there was
some evidence capable of giving the unknown third party suspect defence an air
of reality.

[60]                         
The Court of Appeal applied Seaboyer as
follows:

It is left to be decided whether this
relevant evidence should be excluded because its prejudicial effect
substantially outweighed its probative value. In this case, the only
prejudicial effect would be the impact this evidence would have had on the trial
process in what was an already complicated and lengthy trial.  From his
reasons, the judge was obviously concerned about this impact.  In my view, that
concern did not substantially outweigh the probative value.  [para. 78]

[61]                         
Seaboyer requires
the court to measure and weigh the extent of probative value and the extent of
the prejudicial effect of the evidence.  Obviously, this balancing is highly
fact driven and best done by the trial judge.  The prejudicial effects of this
evidence primarily concern the impact on the complexity, focus, and length of
the trial process.  To some extent, the trial judge can craft a process that
will limit these prejudicial effects.  However, the trial judge did not address
this issue in any detail.

[62]                         
While an appellate court is entitled to step
into the shoes of the trial judge if the record permits, in this case, the
Court of Appeal was not in the position to assess and weigh the extent of the
probative value of the unknown third party suspect evidence and the extent of
prejudicial effect of this evidence.

[63]                         
The trial judge’s legal errors were clearly not
minor, and do not attract the application of the curative proviso in s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code .  The verdict would not necessarily have been the
same had the trial judge applied the correct principles in determining the test
for the admissibility of this defence evidence (R. v. Morin, [1988] 2
S.C.R. 345, at p. 374).  This case must be re-tried in any event.  In these
circumstances, the balancing of the Seaboyer factors is best left for
the trial judge.

[64]                         
Before this Court, Mr. Grant also submitted a
motion to adduce fresh evidence relating to DNA analysis and juror bias. 
Because of my finding with respect to the admission of evidence relating to an
unknown third party suspect, it is not necessary to deal with that motion.

Chief Justice Joyal (as he then was) of the Court of Queen’s Bench of Manitoba,
dated January 19, 2011, A.R., vol. I, at p. 90.





[2]         Australian law
requires the defence to show “a sufficient similarity between the two acts as
to allow the jury to conclude that there is a real possibility that the same
person was involved” (J. D. Heydon, Cross on Evidence (9th Aust. 2013),
at p. 713).  In the United Kingdom, evidence of the bad character of someone
other than the defendant is admissible where the similarities give the evidence
“substantial probative value” (Criminal Justice Act 2003 (U.K.),
2003, c. 44, s. 100(1)(b), (3)(c) and (d); H. M. Malek et al., eds., Phipson
on Evidence (18th ed. 2013), at paras. 22-04, 22-24 to 22-27).  Similarly, in the United States, some
federal and state jurisprudence holds that defence-led evidence of similar acts
will be admissible where it is
“sufficiently similar to the crime at bar so that it is relevant” (United
States v. Stevens, 935 F.2d 1380 (3rd Cir. 1991), at p. 1384; Scheidell,

on appeal from the court of appeal for quebec

                    Criminal
law — Sentencing — Appeals — Powers of Court of Appeal — Court of Appeal
reducing sentence of imprisonment from six and a half to four years — Whether
Court of Appeal erred in substituting sentence it considered appropriate for
one imposed by trial judge, primarily on basis that trial judge had deviated
from sentencing range established by courts for impaired driving offences — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, s. 687 .

                    Criminal
law — Sentencing — Considerations — Impaired driving causing death — Whether it
was open to trial judge to consider frequency of impaired driving in region
where offence was committed as relevant sentencing factor — Whether length and
other terms of driving prohibition imposed by trial judge were appropriate —
Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, ss. 259(2) (a.1 ), 718 to 718.2.

                    On
June 17, 2011, at about 4:00 a.m., L lost control of his vehicle
while entering a curve on a country road in the Beauce region. He was speeding,
and his ability to drive was impaired by alcohol. Two passengers sitting in the
back seat of the vehicle died instantly. Neither the vehicle’s mechanical
condition nor the weather contributed to the accident. L is entirely responsible
for it, and he pleaded guilty to two counts of impaired driving causing death.

                    The
trial judge sentenced L, on each count, to six years and six months’
imprisonment; the two sentences were to be served concurrently. He also
prohibited L from operating a vehicle for a period of 11 years starting
from the sentencing date. The Court of Appeal replaced the sentence imposed by
the trial judge with one of four years’ imprisonment. It also reduced the
length of the driving prohibition to four years commencing at the end of L’s
incarceration.

                    Held
(McLachlin C.J. and Gascon J. dissenting): The appeal should be
allowed and the sentence imposed by the trial judge restored except as regards
the driving prohibition, which should be reduced to two years and four months
commencing at the end of L’s incarceration.

                    Per
Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Wagner and Côté JJ.: Sentencing remains
one of the most delicate stages of the criminal justice process in Canada.
Although this task is governed by ss. 718 et seq. of the Criminal Code ,
and although the objectives set out in those sections guide the courts and are
clearly defined, it nonetheless involves, by definition, the exercise of a
broad discretion by the courts in balancing all the relevant factors in order
to meet the objectives being pursued in sentencing.

                    The
Court has on many occasions noted the importance of giving wide latitude to
sentencing judges. Since they have, inter alia, the advantage of
having heard and seen the witnesses, sentencing judges are in the best position
to determine, having regard to the circumstances, a just and appropriate
sentence that is consistent with the objectives of the Criminal Code .
Ultimately, except where a sentencing judge makes an error of law or an error
in principle that has an impact on the sentence, an appellate court may not
vary the sentence unless it is demonstrably unfit.

                    Proportionality
is the cardinal principle that must guide appellate courts in considering the
fitness of a sentence imposed on an offender. The more serious the crime and
its consequences, or the greater the offender’s degree of responsibility, the
heavier the sentence will be. In other words, the severity of a sentence
depends not only on the seriousness of the crime’s consequences, but also on the
moral blameworthiness of the offender. Determining a proportionate sentence is
a delicate task. Both sentences that are too lenient and sentences that are too
harsh can undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.
Moreover, if appellate courts intervene without deference to vary sentences
that they consider too lenient or too harsh, their interventions could
undermine the credibility of the system and the authority of trial courts.

                    Although
sentencing ranges are used mainly to ensure the parity of sentences, they
reflect all the principles and objectives of sentencing. Sentencing ranges are
nothing more than summaries of the minimum and maximum sentences imposed in the
past, which serve in any given case as guides for the application of all the
relevant principles and objectives. However, they should not be considered
“averages”, let alone straitjackets, but should instead be seen as historical
portraits for the use of sentencing judges, who must still exercise their
discretion in each case.

                    There
will always be situations that call for a sentence outside a particular range:
although ensuring parity in sentencing is in itself a desirable objective, the
fact that each crime is committed in unique circumstances by an offender with a
unique profile cannot be disregarded. The determination of a just and
appropriate sentence is a highly individualized exercise that goes beyond a
purely mathematical calculation. It involves a variety of factors that are
difficult to define with precision. This is why it may happen that a sentence
that, on its face, falls outside a particular range, and that may never have
been imposed in the past for a similar crime, is not demonstrably unfit.
Everything depends on the gravity of the offence, the offender’s degree of
responsibility and the specific circumstances of each case. Thus, the fact that
a judge deviates from a sentencing range established by the courts does not in
itself justify appellate intervention.

                    In
this sense, the Court of Appeal erred in this case in basing its intervention
on the fact that the sentence fell outside the sentencing range established by
the courts, while disregarding the criteria that are normally applied in the
determination of a just and appropriate sentence. Any other conclusion would
have the effect of authorizing appellate courts to create categories of
offences with no real justification and accordingly intervene without deference
to substitute a sentence on appeal. But the power to create categories of
offences lies with Parliament, not the courts.

                    The
Court of Appeal also erred in failing to address the factor relating to the
local situation, that is, to the frequency of impaired driving in the Beauce
region, on which the trial judge had relied. Although the fact that a type of crime
occurs frequently in a particular region is not in itself an aggravating
factor, there may be circumstances in which a judge might nonetheless consider
such a fact in balancing the various sentencing objectives, including the need
to denounce the unlawful conduct in question in that place and at the same time
to deter anyone else from doing the same thing. In this case, the mere fact
that the trial judge found that impaired driving is a scourge in the Beauce
district was in itself sufficient for him to consider this factor in
determining what would be a just and appropriate sentence. It was inappropriate
for the Court of Appeal to disregard this factor in assessing the fitness of
the sentence, as that meant that its analysis was incomplete. In the context of
offences such as the ones at issue, courts from various parts of the country
have in fact held that the objectives of deterrence and denunciation must be
emphasized in order to convey society’s condemnation, as such offences are ones
that might be committed by ordinarily law‑abiding people.

                    The
Court of Appeal was therefore wrong to reduce the sentence imposed by the trial
judge. Even though the trial judge had made an error in principle by
considering an element of the offence as an aggravating factor (the fact that L
was intoxicated), that error had clearly had no impact on the sentence. The
sentence of six years and six months’ imprisonment imposed by the trial
judge, although severe, falls within the overall range of sentences normally imposed
in Quebec and elsewhere in the country and is not demonstrably unfit. It must
therefore be restored.

                    As
to the term of the driving prohibition, the length of the presentence driving
prohibition should be subtracted from that of the prohibition imposed in the
context of the sentence. In this case, the driving prohibition of four years
and seven months is demonstrably unfit and must be reduced to two years and
four months to take account of the recognizance entered into by L under
which he was to refrain from driving from his release date until his sentencing
date (two years and three months).

                    Finally,
the Court of Appeal erred in not admitting the fresh evidence of L’s breaches
of his recognizances. That evidence was relevant. It could have affected the weight
given to the favourable presentence report and could therefore have affected
the final sentencing decision. In particular, the Court of Appeal might have
reached a different conclusion if it had admitted that evidence, which would
have helped it in assessing the fitness of the sentence that had been imposed
at trial.

                    Per McLachlin C.J. and Gascon J. (dissenting): Sentencing
judges must take into consideration, inter alia, the objectives of
deterrence and rehabilitation, any relevant aggravating and mitigating
circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and the principle that a
sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for
similar offences committed in similar circumstances. If a judge fails to
individualize a sentence and to consider the relevant mitigating factors while
placing undue emphasis on the circumstances of the offence and the objectives
of denunciation and deterrence, all that is done is to punish the crime. The
reconciliation of the different factors requires that the sentence be
consistent with the fundamental principle of proportionality.  This principle
requires that full consideration be given to each of the factors.
Proportionality is a limiting principle that requires that a sentence not exceed
what is just and appropriate in light of the moral blameworthiness of the
offender and the gravity of the offence. Deterrence can thus work through
conditions tailored to fit the offender. This is even more important in the
case of a young person with no criminal record.

                    The
standard of intervention to be applied by appellate courts in sentencing
matters is well known: a sentence can only be interfered with if it is
demonstrably unfit or if it results from an error in principle, the failure to
consider a relevant factor or the overemphasis of a relevant factor. If a party
shows that the trial judge made an error in principle, failed to consider a
relevant factor or overemphasized appropriate factors, there is no requirement
that the sentence also be shown to be demonstrably unfit before an appellate
court can intervene. Even if none of these three situations exists, however,
intervention may be necessary if the sentence is demonstrably unfit. 

                    Where
a reviewable error is shown in the reasoning on which a sentence is based, it
is appropriate for an appellate court to be able to intervene and assess the
fitness of the sentence. The error that is identified thus opens the door to
intervention and permits an appellate court to reopen the sentencing analysis.
However, the court of appeal’s role in ensuring consistency in sentencing
requires it before intervening to ascertain, among other things, that the
sentence represents a substantial and marked departure from the sentences
customarily imposed for similar offenders who have committed similar crimes.
There is no such thing as a uniform sentence for a particular crime, and
sentencing is an inherently individualized process. A sentence must reflect a
consideration of all the relevant factors, and it is in this sense that the
“process” of sentencing is important. It is by correctly repeating the
analytical exercise that the court can determine whether the sanction imposed
on the offender is just and appropriate or whether it should be varied, and the
court need not show deference in such a case.

                    The
sentencing ranges established by appellate courts are only guidelines, and not
hard and fast rules. A judge can therefore order a sentence outside the
established range as long as it is in accordance with the principles and
objectives of sentencing. As a corollary, the mere fact that a sentence falls
within the range applicable to a certain type of crime does not necessarily
make it fit. It is by analyzing the trial judge’s reasoning or thought process
that an appellate court can determine whether a sentence that falls within the
proper range is tailored to fit the circumstances of the offender and is
therefore individualized and proportionate.

                    The
Court of Appeal properly justified its intervention in this case. The trial judge
committed a number of errors, and the sentence that resulted from his analysis
was thus neither proportionate nor individualized; it also represented a
substantial and marked departure from the sentences customarily imposed on
similar offenders who have committed similar crimes in similar circumstances.
In his analysis, the trial judge began by identifying some aggravating factors
that were not really aggravating factors, namely an element of the offence —
the fact that L was intoxicated — and the impact on those close to L. Next, he
discounted some relevant factors that are normally characterized as mitigating
factors and that must be considered in determining the appropriate sentence —
namely the youth of the accused and the facts that he had expressed remorse,
that he had no criminal record and that the presentence report was favourable
to him. Indeed, the trial judge failed to discuss the presentence report and
its positive findings, which represented a mitigating factor that was relevant
to and important for the determination of the appropriate sentence. Finally,
his failure to consider certain mitigating factors that favoured L’s potential
for rehabilitation and the emphasis he placed on exemplarity led him to impose
an excessive sentence that departed from the principle of proportionality.

                    The
local situation factor clearly magnified the exemplary focus of the sentence
with which the Court of Appeal took issue. When considered in the
sentencing context, the frequency of a crime in a given region does not help
paint a portrait of the accused, but instead reflects external factors. The degree of
censure required to express society’s condemnation of the offence is limited by
the principle that an offender’s sentence must be equivalent to his or her moral
culpability. Even though courts of appeal have noted that a trial judge can sometimes
consider the local situation when imposing a sentence, the judicial notice that
judges can take of their communities is not without limits, and caution must be
exercised in establishing its scope. Being familiar with the local situation in
one’s region is one thing, but claiming to compare that situation with what
happens elsewhere in order to draw conclusions or inferences from it is
something else. Although a court has wide latitude as to the sources and types of evidence upon
which to base the sentence to be imposed, it must never lose sight of
the importance of procedural fairness and must bear in mind the importance of the
facts in question and the impact on the offender of how they are dealt with. In this case,
there is no indication that the trial judge was in a position to take judicial
notice of the fact that impaired driving is trivialized in the Beauce region
more than elsewhere. Knowing the impact on sentencing of that factor, which he
considered to be aggravating, and the particular weight he was going to attach
to it in imposing a more severe sanction, he should, in the interest of
procedural fairness, have informed L of his concerns on this point and requested
submissions from him. But he did not do so, even though the importance he
attached to that aggravating factor ultimately led him to impose a sentence
that favoured exemplarity at the expense of proportionality. 

                    Given
that the trial judge overemphasized the objectives of
exemplarity and deterrence while at the same time overlooking the principles of
similarity of sentences and individualization in sentencing, the Court of
Appeal was justified in intervening and reopening the analytical process in
order to determine whether the sentence was just and appropriate. In the name of
deterrence and exemplarity, the trial judge focused on the perceived prevalence
of the crime in the community and disregarded the individual and contextual
factors, which led him to impose a sentence that was excessive in L’s case. In so doing, he disregarded the principle
that sentences should be similar to other sentences imposed in similar
circumstances, which is the corollary of the principle of proportionality. He provided little if any explanation for the sentence of
78 months’ imprisonment that he ultimately imposed on L, despite the fact
that the severity of that sentence is not in any doubt. Although it would also
have been preferable for the Court of Appeal to provide a more thorough
explanation, the 48‑month sentence it imposed is much more consistent
with what can be seen in comparable decisions. Unlike the one imposed by the trial judge, this sentence does not represent a substantial and marked departure from
the sentences imposed on similar offenders who committed similar crimes in
similar circumstances. Rather, it is consistent with the sentences imposed on
offenders with characteristics similar to those of L. Insofar as the Court of
Appeal correctly stated the law before intervening, it is not open to the Court
to substitute its view for that of the Court of Appeal on the sentence.

                    On
the issue of the driving prohibition, the length of the presentence prohibition
is a factor to be considered in analyzing the reasonableness and
appropriateness of the prohibition to be imposed under s. 259(3.3) (b)
of the Criminal Code . In light of the length of the presentence
prohibition in this case, it is appropriate to reduce the length of L’s driving
prohibition to one year and nine months, plus the period of 48 months
to which he was sentenced to imprisonment.

                    Finally,
the Court of Appeal did not make an error warranting intervention when it
declined to admit the fresh evidence of two breaches by L of his
recognizances.  Absent an error of law or a palpable and overriding error of
fact, the Court should not reconsider the weight attached by the Court of
Appeal to those breaches and substitute its view of what would have been
relevant.

I.             
Introduction

[1]                             
Sentencing remains one of the most delicate
stages of the criminal justice process in Canada. Although this task is
governed by ss. 718 et seq. of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985,
c. C‑46 , and although the objectives set out in those sections guide the
courts and are clearly defined, it nonetheless involves, by definition, the
exercise of a broad discretion by the courts in balancing all the relevant
factors in order to meet the objectives being pursued in sentencing. 

[2]                             
For this purpose, the courts have developed
tools over the years to ensure that similar sentences are imposed on similar
offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances — the
principle of parity of sentences — and that sentences are proportionate by
guiding the exercise of that discretion, and to prevent any substantial and
marked disparities in the sentences imposed on offenders for similar crimes
committed in similar circumstances. For example, in Quebec and other provinces,
the courts have adopted a system of sentencing ranges and categories designed
to achieve these objectives.

[3]                             
The credibility of the criminal justice system
in the eyes of the public depends on the fitness of sentences imposed on
offenders. A sentence that is unfit, whether because it is too harsh or too
lenient, could cause the public to question the credibility of the system in
light of its objectives.

[4]                             
One of the main objectives of Canadian criminal
law is the rehabilitation of offenders. Rehabilitation is one of the
fundamental moral values that distinguish Canadian society from the societies
of many other nations in the world, and it helps the courts impose sentences
that are just and appropriate.

[5]                             
In the context of offences such as the ones in
the case at bar, namely impaired driving causing either bodily harm or death,
courts from various parts of the country have held that the objectives of
deterrence and denunciation must be emphasized in order to convey society’s
condemnation: R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, at
para. 129; R. v. Lépine, 2007 QCCA 70, at
para. 21 (CanLII); R. v. Brutus, 2009 QCCA 1382, at
para. 18 (CanLII); R. v. Stimson, 2011 ABCA
59, 499 A.R. 185, at para. 21; R. v. McIlwrick, 2008 ABQB 724, 461
A.R. 16, at para. 69; R. v. Junkert, 2010 ONCA 549, 103 O.R. (3d)
284, at paras. 46‑47; R. v. Ruizfuentes, 2010 MBCA 90, 258
Man. R. (2d) 220, at para. 36.

[6]                             
While it is normal for trial judges to consider
sentences other than imprisonment in appropriate cases, in the instant case, as
in all cases in which general or specific deterrence and denunciation must be
emphasized, the courts have very few options other than imprisonment for
meeting these objectives, which are essential to the maintenance of a just,
peaceful and law‑abiding society.

[7]                             
The increase in the minimum and maximum sentences
for impaired driving offences shows that Parliament wanted such offences to be
punished more harshly. Despite countless awareness campaigns conducted over the
years, impaired driving offences still cause more deaths than any other
offences in Canada: House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human
Rights, Ending Alcohol‑Impaired Driving: A Common Approach
(2009), at p. 5. 

[8]                             
This sad situation, which unfortunately
continues to prevail today, was denounced by Cory J. more than
20 years ago:

                        Every year, drunk driving leaves a terrible
trail of death, injury, heartbreak and destruction. From the point of view of
numbers alone, it has a far greater impact on Canadian society than any other
crime. In terms of the deaths and serious injuries resulting in
hospitalization, drunk driving is clearly the crime which causes the most
significant social loss to the country.

(R. v. Bernshaw, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 254, at para. 16)

[9]                             
Such is the backdrop to the main issues in the
case at bar. The appellant is appealing a Quebec Court of Appeal judgment that
reduced from six and a half to four years a term of imprisonment imposed on the
respondent by the trial judge after the respondent had pleaded guilty to two
counts of impaired driving causing death.

[10]                         
This appeal affords this Court, first of all, an
occasion to clarify the standard on the basis of which an appellate court may
intervene and vary a sentence imposed by a trial judge. The Court must
determine, inter alia, the extent to which a deviation from a sentencing
range that is otherwise established and adhered to may justify appellate
intervention. 

[11]                         
This Court has on many occasions noted the
importance of giving wide latitude to sentencing judges. Since they have, inter alia,
the advantage of having heard and seen the witnesses, sentencing judges are in
the best position to determine, having regard to the circumstances, a just and
appropriate sentence that is consistent with the objectives and principles set
out in the Criminal Code  in this regard. The fact that a judge deviates
from the proper sentencing range does not in itself justify appellate
intervention. Ultimately, except where a sentencing judge makes an error of law
or an error in principle that has an impact on the sentence, an appellate court
may not vary the sentence unless it is demonstrably unfit.

[12]                         
In such cases, proportionality is the cardinal
principle that must guide appellate courts in considering the fitness of a
sentence imposed on an offender. The more serious the crime and its
consequences, or the greater the offender’s degree of responsibility, the
heavier the sentence will be. In other words, the severity of a sentence
depends not only on the seriousness of the crime’s consequences, but also on
the moral blameworthiness of the offender. Determining a proportionate sentence
is a delicate task. As I mentioned above, both sentences that are too lenient
and sentences that are too harsh can undermine public confidence in the
administration of justice. Moreover, if appellate courts intervene without deference
to vary sentences that they consider too lenient or too harsh, their
interventions could undermine the credibility of the system and the authority
of trial courts. With respect, I am of the opinion that the Court of Appeal was
wrong in this case to reduce the sentence imposed by the trial judge by basing
its intervention on the fact that he had departed from the established
sentencing range.

[13]                         
Secondly, this appeal also raises the question
whether it is appropriate for a judge to consider the fact that a type of
offence occurs with particular frequency in a given region as a relevant factor
in determining a just and appropriate sentence. In this case, I am of the
opinion that it was open to the trial judge, in balancing the relevant
sentencing factors, to consider the frequency of impaired driving offences in
the district where the crime was committed. Moreover, the Court of Appeal
failed completely to address this question.

[14]                         
Another question raised in this appeal relates
to the length and other terms of the driving prohibition imposed by the trial
judge. In this case, the length of the presentence driving prohibition should
be subtracted from that of the prohibition imposed in the context of the
sentence. In addition, the driving prohibition of four years and seven months
is demonstrably unfit and must be reduced to two years and four months to take
account of the recognizance entered into by the respondent under which he was
to refrain from driving from his release date until his sentencing date (two
years and three months).

[15]                         
Finally, the appeal also concerns the
admissibility of fresh evidence. In this case, the evidence in question was of
two breaches of recognizances the respondent had entered into. The Court of
Appeal found that the fresh evidence was inadmissible. Unlike the Court of
Appeal, I am of the opinion that the evidence was admissible and that it
provided information that was relevant to the determination of a just and
appropriate sentence.

[16]                         
In short, I respectfully find that the Court of
Appeal erred in intervening, without valid grounds, to substitute a sentence it
considered appropriate for the one that had been imposed by the trial judge.
Even though the trial judge had made an error in principle by considering an
element of the offence as an aggravating factor, that error had clearly had no
impact on the sentence, which, moreover, was not demonstrably unfit. In this
sense, the Court of Appeal erred in basing its intervention on the fact that
the sentence fell outside the sentencing range established by the courts, while
disregarding the criteria that are normally applied in the determination of a
just and appropriate sentence. It also failed completely to address the factor
relating to the local situation, that is, to the frequency of the type of
offence at issue, on which the trial judge had relied. For these reasons, the
appeal should be allowed and the sentence of imprisonment imposed by the trial
judge should be restored.

Background and Judicial History

A.          
Facts

[17]                         
The respondent pleaded guilty to two counts
of alcohol‑impaired driving causing death, an offence under
s. 255(3)  of the Criminal Code . The parties filed a joint statement
of facts. The following facts taken from it are relevant for the purposes of
this appeal.

[18]                         
On June 17, 2011, at about 4:00 a.m.,
Tommy Lacasse, the respondent in this appeal, lost control of his vehicle while
entering a curve on a country road in Sainte‑Aurélie in the Beauce
region. He was speeding, and his ability to drive was impaired by alcohol.
Nadia Pruneau, who was celebrating her 18th birthday that night, and
Caroline Fortier, aged 17, were in the back seat of the vehicle. They both
died instantly. Neither the vehicle’s mechanical condition nor the weather
contributed to the accident. The respondent is entirely responsible for it.

[19]                         
The respondent admitted to having smoked a joint
of cannabis at about 7:00 p.m., after which he had drunk four small beers
between 7:30 p.m. and midnight, another between 1:00 and 2:30 a.m.
and about 100 mL of a lemonade and vodka mixture between 10:30 and
11:00 p.m. The parties agreed that it was the alcohol and not the cannabis
that had impaired the respondent’s ability to drive.

[20]                         
The collision investigation report concluded
that the vehicle had been travelling at 130 km/h, whereas the recommended
speed for taking the curve was 75 km/h. The vehicle skidded more than
60 metres before hitting the bottom of a ditch, lifting off the ground and
rolling over several times.

[21]                         
The respondent did not testify at the sentencing
hearing, although the defence adduced some evidence to show that he had been
deeply distressed during the weeks and months following the accident. The
evidence also showed that he had become suicidal and had said that he wished he
had died instead of the victims.

[22]                         
At the time of the sentencing hearing, the
respondent was 20 years old. He was living with his parents and working as
an autobody repairer in his family’s business. He did not have a criminal
record, although he had been convicted of offences under the Highway Safety
Code, CQLR, c. C‑24.2, including three speeding offences.

B.           
Court of Québec, 2013 QCCQ 11960

[23]                         
In the Court of Québec, the appellant asked for
a sentence of six to eight years’ imprisonment followed by a seven‑year
driving prohibition. The respondent suggested a sentence of no more than three
years’ imprisonment.

[24]                         
Judge Couture began by listing the aggravating
factors: the facts that the respondent had been intoxicated and had smoked
cannabis, the context in which he had been drinking alcohol, the speed at which
he had been driving, his driving record with the Société de l’assurance
automobile du Québec, the number of victims and the impact of the accident on
the victims’ families. He also identified a few mitigating factors, but he
reduced the weight to be attached to them, except as regards the fact that the
presentence report was favourable to the respondent.

[25]                         
More specifically, Judge Couture attached less
weight to the fact that the respondent had pleaded guilty on the ground that he
had done so relatively late, long after he was in a position to make decisions
about the conduct of his trial. Judge Couture also attached less weight to
the fact that the respondent did not have a criminal record, because in his
view, the offence was one that was likely to be committed by people who do not
have criminal records. He relied in this regard on this Court’s decision in Proulx,
at para. 129. He also noted that the respondent had sustained injuries,
but pointed out that this was merely a consequence of the respondent’s own
actions. In addition, Judge Couture reduced the weight attached to the
respondent’s youth.

[26]                         
After reiterating the principle of
proportionality together with the principle of parity of sentences, Judge
Couture stressed the importance of individualizing sentences and the need to
emphasize the objectives of deterrence and denunciation where crimes involving
impaired driving are concerned. He specified that sentencing ranges are only
guidelines, and not hard and fast rules. He added that, in the case of impaired
driving offences, it is the most law‑abiding citizens who must be
targeted in an approach based on deterrence and denunciation.

[27]                         
Furthermore, Judge Couture emphasized the
particular situation in the Beauce region, where approximately one in five
cases involves an impaired driving offence. He even posed the question whether
driving while impaired is trivialized more there than elsewhere. 

[28]                         
In the end, he found that the aggravating
circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances in this case.

[29]                         
For all these reasons, Judge Couture sentenced
the respondent, on each count of impaired driving causing death, to six years
and six months’ imprisonment minus the period of one month the respondent had
spent in pre‑trial detention; the two sentences were to be served concurrently.
He also prohibited the respondent from operating a vehicle for a period of
11 years starting from the sentencing date.

C.           
Quebec Court of Appeal, 2014 QCCA 1061

[30]                         
The Court of Appeal essentially focused its
analysis on the application of the sentencing range outlined in R. v. Comeau,
2008 QCCQ 4804, which it had confirmed in R. v. Paré, 2011 QCCA 2047.
According to that range, which is divided into three categories, sentences are
to be imposed as follows:

(1)   lenient sentences varying between 18 months’ and three years’
imprisonment where the predominant factors favour the accused;

(2)   harsh sentences varying between three and six years’ imprisonment
where the factors of deterrence and denunciation outweigh the personal factors
of the accused;

(3)   very harsh sentences varying between six and nine years’
imprisonment where personal factors are unfavourable to the accused, and even
more severe sentences are possible [translation]
“when circumstances approach the worst‑case situations” (Paré, at
para. 21 (CanLII)).

[31]                         
The Court of Appeal noted that the trial judge
had placed the sentence he imposed at the lower end of the sentences in the
third category, adding that personal factors unfavourable to the accused
are normally what explain a move from the second to the third category. But, it
stated, such factors were almost non‑existent in this case.

[32]                         
The Court of Appeal found that the sentence of
six years and five months was excessive because it departed from the principle
of proportionality. In the court’s opinion, the trial judge should have given
greater consideration to the respondent’s potential for rehabilitation and
placed less emphasis on the objective of making an example of an offender.

[33]                         
The Court of Appeal accordingly replaced the
sentence imposed by the trial judge with one of four years’ imprisonment minus
one month for the period of pre‑trial detention. It also reduced the
length of the driving prohibition to four years commencing at the end of the
respondent’s incarceration.

[34]                         
In addition, the Court of Appeal held that the
fresh evidence the appellant wanted to adduce was inadmissible. The record
showed that the respondent had breached two recognizances with which he had
agreed to comply while awaiting trial. First, he had failed to comply with
the terms of a curfew imposed on him by the court and, second, he had contacted
Maxime Pruneau, the brother of one of the victims, although he was prohibited
from doing so. According to the Court of Appeal, this fresh evidence was
inadmissible because the breaches in question had been punished separately, by
an additional 15 days’ imprisonment. Moreover, they were not indicative of
a risk of the respondent’s reoffending in this case. The Court of Appeal also
held that the fresh evidence in question was unlikely to affect the result of
the appeal, because the disparity between the sentence imposed at trial and the
one that, in the court’s opinion, had to be substituted for it was too great.

III.       
Issues

[35]                         
The appeal raises the following issues:

1.         Was it
open to the Court of Appeal to substitute the sentence it considered
appropriate for the one imposed by the trial judge, primarily on the basis that
the trial judge had deviated from the sentencing range established by the
courts for impaired driving offences?

2.         Was it
open to the trial judge to consider the frequency of impaired driving in the
region where the offence was committed as a relevant sentencing factor? If so,
was it open to the Court of Appeal to disregard this factor in analyzing the
fitness of the sentence?

3.         Were the
length and the other terms of the driving prohibition imposed by the trial
judge appropriate?

4.         Did the
Court of Appeal err in holding that the fresh evidence the appellant wished to
file was inadmissible?

IV.       
Analysis

A.          
Standard for Intervention on an Appeal From a
Sentence

[36]                         
Appellate courts generally play a dual role in
ensuring the consistency, stability and permanence of the case law in both the
criminal and civil law contexts. First, they act as a safeguard against errors
made by trial courts and are thus required to rectify errors of law and review
the reasonableness of the exercise of discretion. They must ensure that trial
courts state the law correctly and apply it uniformly.

[37]                         
Second, appellate courts must ensure the
coherent development of the law while formulating guiding principles to ensure
that it is applied consistently in a given jurisdiction. They must therefore
clarify the law where clarification is necessary or where conflicting decisions
have been rendered: T. Desjardins, L’appel en droit criminel et pénal
(2nd ed. 2012), at p. 1. In Quebec, the Court of Appeal has an
additional responsibility in civil cases, since it ensures the harmonious
interpretation of the distinctive rules of Quebec civil law. 

[38]                         
In the criminal law context, appellate courts play
this dual role in appeals from both verdicts and sentences. In the case of an
appeal from a sentence, the power of an appellate court to substitute a
sentence for the one imposed by the trial judge is provided for in s. 687 
of the Criminal Code :

                          687. (1) Where
an appeal is taken against sentence, the court of appeal shall, unless the
sentence is one fixed by law, consider the fitness of the sentence appealed
against, and may on such evidence, if any, as it thinks fit to require or to
receive,

(a) vary the sentence within
the limits prescribed by law for the offence of which the accused was
convicted; or

(b) dismiss the appeal.

                          (2) A
judgment of a court of appeal that varies the sentence of an accused who was
convicted has the same force and effect as if it were a sentence passed by the
trial court.

[39]                         
This Court has reiterated on many occasions that
appellate courts may not intervene lightly, as trial judges have a broad
discretion to impose the sentence they consider appropriate within the limits
established by law: s. 718.3(1)  of the Criminal Code ; see also R.
v. Shropshire, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, at para. 46; R. v. L.M.,
2008 SCC 31, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 163, at para. 14; R. v. L.F.W., 2000
SCC 6, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 132, at para. 25; R. v. Nasogaluak,
2010 SCC 6, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, at paras. 43‑46. 

[40]                         
In this regard, Iacobucci J. explained in Shropshire
that consideration of the fitness of a sentence does not justify an appellate
court taking an interventionist approach on appeal:

                    An
appellate court should not be given free rein to modify a sentencing order
simply because it feels that a different order ought to have been made. The
formulation of a sentencing order is a profoundly subjective process; the trial
judge has the advantage of having seen and heard all of the witnesses whereas
the appellate court can only base itself upon a written record. A variation in
the sentence should only be made if the court of appeal is convinced it is not
fit. That is to say, that it has found the sentence to be clearly unreasonable.
[para. 46]

[41]                         
In Proulx, this Court, per
Lamer C.J., discussed these same principles, which continue to be
relevant:

                        In recent years, this Court has repeatedly
stated that the sentence imposed by a trial court is entitled to considerable
deference from appellate courts: see Shropshire, supra, at
paras. 46‑50; M. (C.A.), supra,
at paras. 89‑94; McDonnell, supra, at paras. 15‑17 (majority); R. v. W. (G.),
[1999] 3 S.C.R. 597, at paras. 18‑19. In M. (C.A.), at
para. 90, I wrote:

                                    Put
simply, absent an error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, or
an overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only
intervene to vary a sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is demonstrably
unfit. Parliament explicitly vested sentencing judges with a discretion
to determine the appropriate degree and kind of punishment under the Criminal
Code . [First emphasis added; second emphasis in original.]

. . .

                        Although
an appellate court might entertain a different opinion as to what objectives
should be pursued and the best way to do so, that difference will generally not
constitute an error of law justifying interference. Further, minor errors in
the sequence of application of s. 742.1 may not warrant intervention by
appellate courts. Again, I stress that appellate courts should not second‑guess
sentencing judges unless the sentence imposed is demonstrably unfit.
[paras. 123 and 125]

These principles have
since been reiterated in L.M. and Nasogaluak.

[42]                         
My colleague states that a sentence may be unfit
if there is a reviewable error in the thought process or reasoning on which it
is based (para. 140). For this reason, in his view, where there is a
reviewable error in the trial judge’s reasoning, for example where the judge
has characterized an element of the offence as an aggravating factor
(para. 146), it is always open to an appellate court to intervene to
assess the fitness of the sentence imposed by the trial judge. Having done so,
the court can then affirm that sentence if it considers the sentence to be fit,
or impose the sentence it considers appropriate without having to show
deference (paras. 139 and 142). In other words, any error of law or error
in principle in a trial judge’s analysis will open the door to intervention by
an appellate court, which can then substitute its own opinion for that of the
trial judge. 

[43]                         
With all due respect for my colleague, I am of
the view that his comments on this point need to be qualified. I agree that an
error in principle, the failure to consider a relevant factor or the erroneous
consideration of an aggravating or mitigating factor can justify the
intervention of an appellate court and permit that court to inquire into the
fitness of the sentence and replace it with the sentence it considers
appropriate. However, in my opinion, every such error will not necessarily
justify appellate intervention regardless of its impact on the trial judge’s
reasoning. If the rule were that strict, its application could undermine the
discretion conferred on sentencing judges. It is therefore necessary to avoid a
situation in which [translation]
“the term ‘error in principle’ is trivialized”: R. v. Lévesque‑Chaput,
2010 QCCA 640, at para. 31 (CanLII).

[44]                         
In my view, an error in principle, the failure
to consider a relevant factor or the erroneous consideration of an aggravating
or mitigating factor will justify appellate intervention only where it appears
from the trial judge’s decision that such an error had an impact on the
sentence. 

[45]                         
For example, in R. v. Gavin, 2009 QCCA 1,
the Quebec Court of Appeal found, first, that the trial judge had erred in
considering a lack of remorse and the manner in which the defence had been
conducted as aggravating circumstances (para. 29 (CanLII)). However, it
then considered the impact of that error on the sentence and stated the
following, at para. 35 :

                        [translation]  I find that the lack of
remorse was a secondary factor in the trial judge’s assessment. This is apparent
in the wording of the judgment. The judge referred to and considered all of the
relevant sentencing factors, and the issue of lack of remorse was nothing more
than incidental. . . . Consequently, unless the Court finds that
the sentence imposed was harsher because the judge erroneously determined that
the defence’s conduct (as in R. v. Beauchamp, supra) and the lack
of remorse were aggravating circumstances, this error in principle had no real
effect on the sentence. Essentially, therefore, our task now is to ensure that
the sentence is not clearly unreasonable . . . .

Thus, the Court of
Appeal, finding that the error in principle made by the trial judge was not
determinative and had had no effect on the sentence, rightly concluded that the
error in question could not on its own justify the court’s intervention. This
ultimately led the court to inquire into whether the sentence was clearly
unreasonable having regard to the circumstances.

[46]                         
The Quebec Court of Appeal also adopted this
reasoning in R. v. Sidhu, 2009 QCCA 2441. As in Gavin, the trial
judge had considered lack of remorse as an aggravating factor (para. 23
(CanLII)), but the Court of Appeal found that this error was not determinative
and had had no effect on the sentence (para. 24). Since the sentence the
judge imposed would not have been different had there been no mistake in that
respect (para. 26), the error was not reviewable (para. 55). Thus,
rather than simply substituting its opinion for that of the trial judge because
he had made an error in principle, the Court of Appeal limited itself to
considering whether, independently of that error, the sentence was unreasonable
or demonstrably unfit. On finding that that was not the case, it decided not to
intervene (para. 55).

[47]                         
On this issue, the impact of two decisions cited
by my colleague in support of his opinion that any error of law or error in
principle justifies the intervention of a court of appeal needs to be clarified
and qualified. In R. v. Flight, 2014 ABCA 380, 584 A.R. 392, the
Alberta Court of Appeal found that the trial judge had erred in considering the
consumption of alcohol and the death of a victim as aggravating circumstances
where the accused was charged with impaired driving causing death
(para. 4). The Court of Appeal therefore intervened to substitute its own
opinion for that of the trial judge on the ground that the judge had erred in
principle. However, the court explained that it was difficult to determine what
weight the trial judge had given to the aggravating factors at issue in her
judgment (para. 5). And in Stimson, the Alberta Court of Appeal
identified at least four errors in principle in the trial judge’s reasons,
and there was no doubt that they had affected his analysis (paras. 20‑27).
The Court of Appeal’s intervention was therefore clearly warranted. 

[48]                         
The reminder given by this Court about showing
deference to a trial judge’s exercise of discretion is readily understandable.
First, the trial judge has the advantage of having observed the witnesses in
the course of the trial and having heard the parties’ sentencing submissions.
Second, the sentencing judge is usually familiar with the circumstances in the
district where he or she sits and therefore with the particular needs of the
community in which the crime was committed: R. v. M. (C.A.), [1996]
1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 91. Finally, as Doherty J.A. noted in R. v.
Ramage, 2010 ONCA 488, 257 C.C.C. (3d) 261, the appropriate use of judicial
resources is a consideration that must never be overlooked:

                    Appellate
repetition of the exercise of judicial discretion by the trial judge, without
any reason to think that the second effort will improve upon the results of the
first, is a misuse of judicial resources. The exercise also delays the final
resolution of the criminal process, without any countervailing benefit to the
process. [para. 70]

[49]                         
For the same reasons, an appellate court may not
intervene simply because it would have weighed the relevant factors
differently. In Nasogaluak, LeBel J. referred to R. v. McKnight
(1999), 135 C.C.C. (3d) 41 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 35, in this
regard:

                    To
suggest that a trial judge commits an error in principle because in an
appellate court’s opinion the trial judge gave too much weight to one relevant
factor or not enough weight to another is to abandon deference altogether. The
weighing of relevant factors, the balancing process is what the exercise of
discretion is all about. To maintain deference to the trial judge’s exercise of
discretion, the weighing or balancing of relevant factors must be assessed
against the reasonableness standard of review. Only if by emphasizing one
factor or by not giving enough weight to another, the trial judge exercises his
or her discretion unreasonably should an appellate court interfere with the
sentence on the ground the trial judge erred in principle. [para. 46]

[50]                         
The Quebec Court of Appeal commented to the same
effect in Lévesque‑Chaput, at para. 31:

                    [translation]  There is no doubt that he
focused on the mitigating circumstances, overemphasizing them in the
appellant’s opinion, but that balancing exercise was within his jurisdiction
and the reasons he gave make it easy to follow his reasoning.

[51]                         
Furthermore, the choice of sentencing range or
of a category within a range falls within the trial judge’s discretion and
cannot in itself constitute a reviewable error. An appellate court may not
therefore intervene on the ground that it would have put the sentence in a different
range or category. It may intervene only if the sentence the trial judge
imposed is demonstrably unfit.

[52]                         
It is possible for a sentence to be demonstrably
unfit even if the judge has made no error in imposing it. As Laskin J.A.
mentioned, writing for the Ontario Court of Appeal, the courts have used a
variety of expressions to describe a sentence that is “demonstrably unfit”:
“clearly unreasonable”, “clearly or manifestly excessive”, “clearly excessive
or inadequate”, or representing a “substantial and marked departure” (R. v.
Rezaie (1996), 31 O.R. (3d) 713 (C.A.), at p. 720). All these
expressions reflect the very high threshold that applies to appellate courts
when determining whether they should intervene after reviewing the fitness of a
sentence.

[53]                         
This inquiry must be focused on the fundamental
principle of proportionality stated in s. 718.1  of the Criminal Code ,
which provides that a sentence must be “proportionate to the gravity of the
offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender”. A sentence will
therefore be demonstrably unfit if it constitutes an unreasonable departure
from this principle. Proportionality is determined both on an individual basis,
that is, in relation to the accused him or herself and to the offence committed
by the accused, and by comparison with sentences imposed for similar offences
committed in similar circumstances. Individualization and parity of sentences
must be reconciled for a sentence to be proportionate: s. 718.2 (a)
and (b) of the Criminal Code .

[54]                         
The determination of whether a sentence is fit
also requires that the sentencing objectives set out in s. 718  of the Criminal
Code  and the other sentencing principles set out in s. 718.2  be taken
into account. Once again, however, it is up to the trial judge to properly
weigh these various principles and objectives, whose relative importance will
necessarily vary with the nature of the crime and the circumstances in which it
was committed. The principle of parity of sentences, on which the Court of
Appeal relied, is secondary to the fundamental principle of proportionality.
This Court explained this as follows in M. (C.A.): 

                    It
has been repeatedly stressed that there is no such thing as a uniform sentence
for a particular crime. . . . Sentencing is an inherently individualized
process, and the search for a single appropriate sentence for a similar
offender and a similar crime will frequently be a fruitless exercise of
academic abstraction. [para. 92] 

[55]                         
This principle of parity of sentences also means
that the deference owed to the sentencing judge must be shown except in the
circumstances mentioned above. The Court said the following in this regard in L.M.:

                        This
exercise of ensuring that sentences are similar could not be given priority
over the principle of deference to the trial judge’s exercise of discretion,
since the sentence was not vitiated by an error in principle and the trial
judge had not imposed a sentence that was clearly unreasonable by failing to
give adequate consideration to certain factors or by improperly assessing the
evidence (M. (C.A.), at para. 92, quoted in McDonnell,
at para. 16; W. (G.), at para. 19; see also Ferris, at
p. 149, and Manson, at p. 93). [para. 35]

B.           
Sentencing Ranges

[56]                         
The principle of parity of sentences has
sometimes resulted in the adoption of a system of sentencing ranges and
categories. This concern for parity in sentencing did not originate with the
codification of the principle in 1996. As early as the 19th century, “tariffs”
were being used by the English courts: D. A. Thomas, Principles of
Sentencing (2nd ed. 1979), at p. 29. The tariffs
synthesized, as it were, the relevant principles applicable to each type of
crime in order to standardize sentencing for it:

                             While in certain contexts the Court
articulates a principle, or series of principles, in a systematic manner, it is
frequently necessary to identify the operative principles from the examination
of a considerable number of cases, none of which specifically identifies the
relevant criteria, but which, when viewed collectively, clearly conform
substantially to a pattern which can be described. This is particularly true of
what is conventionally known as “the tariff”, the principles governing the
lengths of sentences of imprisonment.

(Thomas, at p. 5)

[57]                         
Tariffs differ from sentencing ranges in that
tariff‑based sentencing is theoretically the opposite of sentence
individualization, which the ranges allow: Thomas, at p. 8. On the other
hand, the principle underlying the two approaches is the same: ensuring that
offenders who have committed similar crimes in similar circumstances are given
similar sentences. The same is true of the starting‑point approach, which
is used mainly in Alberta but sometimes also in other Canadian provinces: R.
v. McDonnell, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948, at para. 69. Ultimately, whatever
mechanism or terminology is used, the principle on which it is based remains
the same. Where sentencing ranges are concerned, although they are used mainly
to ensure the parity of sentences, they reflect all the principles and objectives
of sentencing. Sentencing ranges are nothing more than summaries of the minimum
and maximum sentences imposed in the past, which serve in any given case as
guides for the application of all the relevant principles and objectives.
However, they should not be considered “averages”, let alone straitjackets, but
should instead be seen as historical portraits for the use of sentencing
judges, who must still exercise their discretion in each case:

                    Even when an appellate court has established a
range, it may be that a fact pattern will arise, which is sufficiently
dissimilar to past decisions that the “range”, as it were, must be expanded.
The fundamental point is that a “range” is not a straitjacket to the exercise
of discretion of a sentencing judge.

(R. v. Keepness, 2010 SKCA 69, 359 Sask. R. 34, at
para. 24)

[58]                         
There will always be situations that call for a
sentence outside a particular range: although ensuring parity in sentencing is
in itself a desirable objective, the fact that each crime is committed in
unique circumstances by an offender with a unique profile cannot be
disregarded. The determination of a just and appropriate sentence is a highly
individualized exercise that goes beyond a purely mathematical calculation. It
involves a variety of factors that are difficult to define with precision. This
is why it may happen that a sentence that, on its face, falls outside a
particular range, and that may never have been imposed in the past for a
similar crime, is not demonstrably unfit. Once again, everything depends on the
gravity of the offence, the offender’s degree of responsibility and the
specific circumstances of each case. LeBel J. commented as follows on this
subject:

                    A judge can order a sentence outside that range
as long as it is in accordance with the principles and objectives of
sentencing. Thus, a sentence falling outside the regular range of appropriate
sentences is not necessarily unfit. Regard must be had to all the circumstances
of the offence and the offender, and to the needs of the community in which the
offence occurred.

(Nasogaluak, at para. 44)

[59]                         
In Brutus, the Quebec Court of Appeal
described the limits of the process of ensuring the similarity of sentences as
follows:

                        [translation]  There is no doubt that the
sentence imposed in this case differs from certain sentences imposed in other
cases for the same offence. However, as our colleague Rochon J.A. stated
in Ferland v. R, 2009 QCCA 1168, with respect to the principle of parity
of sentences that is set out in section 718.2 (b) Cr.C., it “has
some limits because of the individualized nature of the sentencing process” and
cannot provide a basis for departing from the principle of deference to the
trial judge’s exercise of his or her sentencing discretion (R. v. L.M., supra,
at para. 35). [para. 12]

[60]                         
In other words, sentencing ranges are primarily
guidelines, and not hard and fast rules: Nasogaluak, at para. 44.
As a result, a deviation from a sentencing range is not synonymous with an error
of law or an error in principle. Sopinka J. stated this clearly in McDonnell, although
he was referring in that case to categories of assault:

                        . . .
in my view it can never be an error in principle in itself to fail to place a
particular offence within a judicially created category of assault for the
purposes of sentencing. . . . If the categories are defined
narrowly, and deviations from the categorization are generally reversed, the
discretion that should be left in the hands of the trial and sentencing judges
is shifted considerably to the appellate courts. [para. 32]

[61]                         
Any other conclusion would have the effect of
authorizing appellate courts to create categories of offences with no real
justification and accordingly intervene without deference to substitute a
sentence on appeal. But the power to create categories of offences lies
with Parliament, not the courts: McDonnell, at para. 33.

[62]                         
It should also be noted that Parliament has
regularly raised the level of the minimum and maximum sentences applicable to
impaired driving offences. For example, in 2000, the maximum sentence for the
crime of impaired driving causing death was raised from 14 years to
imprisonment for life: An Act to amend the Criminal Code (impaired driving
causing death and other matters), S.C. 2000, c. 25. 

[63]                         
Similarly, in 2008, the minimum sentences for
all crimes related to impaired driving were increased to $1,000 for a first
offence, imprisonment for 30 days for a second offence and
imprisonment for 120 days for any subsequent offence: Tackling Violent
Crime Act, S.C. 2008, c. 6 . 

[64]                         
The sentences imposed for such crimes in Quebec
have also changed. For example, before 2009, the terms of imprisonment imposed
for impaired driving causing death varied from one to 10 years: R. v.
Verreault, 2008 QCCA 2284, at para. 25 (CanLII); R. v. Morneau,
2009 QCCA 1496, at para. 21 (CanLII). Since Comeau, however, the
Quebec courts have used a new sentencing range divided into
three categories. As I mentioned above, the Court of Appeal held in Paré
that it was appropriate for the courts to use that range. 

[65]                         
The appellant correctly observes that Quebec is
the only province in which the courts have subdivided the sentencing range into
categories for the crime of impaired driving causing death. Other provinces
have also adopted the range system, but without subdividing the ranges into
categories. In those provinces, sentences vary from 18 months to two years in
the least serious situations and from seven to eight years in the most serious:
R. v. Bear, 2008 SKCA 172, 320 Sask. R. 12, at para. 59; R.
v. Berner, 2013 BCCA 188, 297 C.C.C. (3d) 69, at para. 37; R. v.
Smith, 2013 BCCA 173, 296 C.C.C. (3d) 386, at para. 60; Stimson,
at para. 18; Ruizfuentes, at para. 22. 

[66]                         
The Ontario Court of Appeal has refused to
define a sentencing range for the crime of impaired driving causing death,
noting that the crime can be committed in an infinite variety of circumstances:
Junkert, at para. 40; R. v. Kummer, 2011 ONCA 39, 103 O.R.
(3d) 641. This is why there is so much variation in the ranges and why
penitentiary sentences much longer than six and a half years have been reported
almost everywhere in Canada.

[67]                         
Like the range itself, the categories it
comprises are tools whose purpose is in part to promote parity in sentencing.
However, a deviation from such a range or category is not an error in principle
and cannot in itself automatically justify appellate intervention unless the
sentence that is imposed departs significantly and for no reason from the
contemplated sentences. Absent an error in principle, an appellate court may
not vary a sentence unless the sentence is demonstrably unfit. 

[68]                         
My colleague finds that the Court of Appeal’s
reasons, read as a whole, show that it did not intervene solely because of a
deviation from the sentencing range (para. 144). With respect, I cannot
agree with this interpretation. As can be seen from the Court of Appeal’s
reasons, it justified its intervention on the basis that it was not open to the
trial judge to impose a sentence falling into the third category of the
sentencing range, because personal factors unfavourable to the respondent,
which would normally support such a sentence rather than one from the second
category, were almost non‑existent in this case. It is clear from the
Court of Appeal’s reasons that it based its intervention primarily on an
erroneous determination of the applicable sentencing category by the trial
judge. 

[69]                         
I believe that the Court of Appeal was wrong to
apply the sentencing range rigidly. By saying that the sentence should have
been in the second category rather than at the lower end of the sentences in
the third category, the Court of Appeal substituted its own assessment for that
of the trial judge without first determining that the sentence in question was
demonstrably unfit. In doing so, the Court of Appeal erred in applying the
sentencing range mechanism as if it were a straitjacket. The sentencing ranges
must in all cases remain only one tool among others that are intended to aid
trial judges in their work.

[70]                         
In this case, even though the sentence fell
outside one of the categories of sentences that have been established since Comeau,
this did not mean that it was manifestly excessive. Terms of imprisonment of
six years or more have in fact been imposed on people without criminal records
who were convicted of impaired driving causing death. For example, in Kummer,
the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld an eight‑year prison sentence imposed
on a driver with no criminal record who had caused the deaths of three people
while driving under the influence of alcohol. In R. v. Wood (2005), 196
C.C.C. (3d) 155, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld a nine‑year sentence
imposed on a person who had no criminal record for impaired driving but had
caused the deaths of three people and caused permanent injuries to another. In Morneau,
the Quebec Court of Appeal upheld a six‑year term of imprisonment on a
charge of impaired driving causing the death of one person. Although the
offender in that case already had a criminal record consisting of three
convictions, the convictions all dated back more than 10 years. In light of the
foregoing, therefore, the sentence of six and a half years imposed in the
instant case on an offender who caused the deaths of two young girls was not
disproportionate.

[71]                         
Moreover, by justifying its intervention on the
basis of the trial judge’s failure to adhere to the categories of sentences,
the Court of Appeal was acknowledging that a six‑year sentence was one of
the possible results in this case. The six‑month difference between the
sentence imposed by the trial judge and the one the Court of Appeal believed
should have been imposed on the basis of the category of sentences it chose
does not constitute a marked departure that would have authorized it to
intervene. In addition, although the sentence imposed at trial departs somewhat
from the sentences applicable to the category the Court of Appeal considered
the most appropriate, it falls within the overall range established by the
Quebec courts, and lies clearly within the range of sentences imposed elsewhere
in the country for similar offences.

[72]                         
In sum, the sentence imposed by Judge Couture is
consistent with the sentencing objectives and principles set out in the Criminal
Code . Judge Couture properly emphasized the importance of deterrence and
denunciation in this case, but he did not overlook the objective of
rehabilitation (para. 92 (CanLII)). Indeed, the Court of Appeal
acknowledged that [translation]
“[t]he trial judge gave extensive reasons for the judgment to which the motion
relates, and it is clear that he very carefully weighed the sentencing
objectives and principles set out in sections 718  to 718.2  of the Criminal
Code ” (para. 5 (CanLII)). Because Judge Couture did not make a
reviewable error in his judgment, and because the sentence he imposed was not
demonstrably unfit, it was not open to the Court of Appeal to intervene and
substitute its own assessment for his. The Court of Appeal nevertheless reduced
the sentence imposed at trial, which was indeed severe, without taking account
of the principle that deterrence and denunciation must be emphasized in such
cases. In reducing the sentence imposed by Judge Couture on the basis that it
departed from the principle of proportionality, the Court of Appeal also
disregarded the local reality, thereby itself departing from the objectives of
deterrence and denunciation.

C.           
Deterrence and Denunciation

[73]                         
While it is true that the objectives of
deterrence and denunciation apply in most cases, they are particularly relevant
to offences that might be committed by ordinarily law‑abiding people. It
is such people, more than chronic offenders, who will be sensitive to harsh
sentences. Impaired driving offences are an obvious example of this type of
offence, as this Court noted in Proulx:

                    .
. . dangerous driving and impaired driving may be offences for which harsh
sentences plausibly provide general deterrence. These crimes are often
committed by otherwise law‑abiding persons, with good employment records
and families. Arguably, such persons are the ones most likely to be deterred by
the threat of severe penalties: see R. v. McVeigh (1985), 22 C.C.C. (3d)
145 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 150; R. v. Biancofiore (1997), 119 C.C.C.
(3d) 344 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 18‑24; R. v. Blakeley
(1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 541 (C.A.), at pp. 542‑43. [para. 129]

[74]                         
As I mentioned in the introduction, courts from
various parts of the country have adhered to the principle that the objectives
of deterrence and denunciation must be emphasized in imposing sentences for
this type of offence. For example, the Quebec Court of Appeal made the following comments in Lépine:

                        [translation] 
Sentences imposed for crimes involving dangerous operation of a motor vehicle
while under the influence of alcohol must be aimed at deterring the public
generally from driving in that manner. This Court has therefore upheld
significant custodial sentences for such offences: R. v. Kelly, J.E. 97‑1570
(C.A.).

                        Very often, the objective gravity of such
crimes is based more on their consequences and the extent of those consequences
than on consciousness of guilt, which is why Parliament has increased the
maximum sentences on the basis of the consequences of the operation of the
vehicle.

                        A
loss of human life caused by the operation of a vehicle while impaired is a
consequence that cannot be remedied, which is why it is important for the
courts to convey a message of denunciation to those who put themselves in
potentially dangerous situations, even if the offender does not have a criminal
record and did not wish to cause the tragic accident. [paras. 19‑21]

[75]                         
Along the same lines, the Quebec Court of Appeal
said the following in Brutus: 

                        [translation] In closing, it should be
borne in mind that the courts have long been sharply critical in discussing the
commission of driving offences of this nature and have asserted that the
objectives of denunciation and deterrence must be emphasized in order to convey
their wish to give expression to society’s condemnation of such crimes by means
of exemplary sentences, particularly in cases (like this one) involving serious
consequences for the victims. Society’s condemnation may be reflected in longer
terms of imprisonment, which have a deterrent effect both on the offender and
on all those who might be tempted to imitate the offender. The sentence imposed
in this case is not unreasonable in light of this objective, nor is it
unreasonable in light of all the circumstances of the case. [para. 18]

[76]                         
The Quebec Court of Appeal was right to note the
importance of the objectives of deterrence and denunciation. With respect,
however, it erred in the instant case in departing from those objectives and
intervening.

[77]                         
My colleague is of the opinion that
Judge Couture overemphasized the objective of deterrence (para. 145).
He also maintains that Judge Couture made several errors of law by considering
aggravating factors that were not really aggravating factors and by failing to
consider some important mitigating factors, such as the respondent’s youth and
the facts that he had expressed remorse, that he had no criminal record and
that the presentence report was favourable to him (ibid.). For these
reasons, my colleague “believe[s] the Court of Appeal was justified in
intervening and reopening the analytical process in order to determine whether
the sentence was just and appropriate” (para. 164). 

[78]                         
Here again, I find that my colleague’s comments
need to be qualified. Judge Couture did not fail to consider the
mitigating factors in question (para. 33), but instead attached less
weight to them because of the nature of the offence at issue, as the respondent
himself acknowledges (at para. 29 of his factum). In short, what is being
criticized is the weight the trial judge attached to those factors. As I
mentioned above, however, determining the weight to be given to aggravating or
mitigating circumstances falls strictly within the sentencing judge’s
discretion. The decision to weigh such factors in a given way is not in itself
an error that opens the door to appellate intervention unless the weighing is
unreasonable. 

[79]                         
This being said, the trial judge was justified
in attaching less weight to the mitigating factors in this case. Although an
offender’s youth is often an important mitigating factor to consider, it should
be noted that it is young people who are affected the most by motor vehicle
accidents that result from impaired driving. In light of the importance that
must be attributed to the objectives of deterrence and denunciation in such
cases as well as the dire consequences of the accident in the instant case, for
which the respondent is entirely responsible, the trial judge was right to
reduce the weight attached to his youth as a mitigating factor. 

[80]                         
As to the fact that the respondent did not have
a criminal record, Judge Couture was right to point out that his driving
record was not clean. He had been convicted three times for speeding. This
showed that he was irresponsible when behind the wheel, and his convictions
under the Highway Safety Code were all the more relevant given that
speeding had played a part in the accident in this case. The respondent
repeatedly and frequently drove irresponsibly. 

[81]                         
The trial judge was also right to attach less
weight to the remorse expressed by the respondent and to his guilty plea
because of the lateness of that plea. A plea entered at the last minute before
the trial is not deserving of as much consideration as one that was entered
promptly: R. v. O. (C.), 2008 ONCA 518, 91 O.R. (3d) 528, at
paras. 16‑17; R. v. Wright, 2013 ABCA 428, 566 A.R. 192, at
para. 12. 

[82]                         
I would also point out that the trial judge
considered the presentence report, which was favourable to the respondent, as
well as the latter’s prospects for rehabilitation. At para. 92 of his
judgment, he stated that [translation]
“[t]he objective of separation implies that the sentence should not be so long
as to hamper the rehabilitation of the accused.” However, for the reasons given
above, the trial judge cannot be criticized for having discounted this factor. 

[83]                         
My colleague is also of the opinion that Judge
Couture erred in identifying certain elements of the offence, including the
fact that the respondent was intoxicated, as aggravating factors
(para. 146) and that this constitutes a reviewable error warranting the
intervention of the Court of Appeal. As I mentioned above, however, the
erroneous consideration of an aggravating or mitigating factor warrants
appellate intervention only if it can be seen from the trial judge’s decision
that the error had an actual impact on the sentence. In the instant case, I
agree with my colleague that the fact that the accused was intoxicated should
not have been mentioned as an aggravating factor, since being intoxicated is
one of the elements of the offence. However, this is a non‑determinative
error that did not unduly affect the sentence, given that Judge Couture
identified other aggravating factors (para. 32). Unlike the situation in Flight,
in which it was difficult to determine what weight the judge had attached to
what she had erroneously identified as an aggravating factor, it is apparent
from the decision of Judge Couture in the instant case that he attached no real
weight to this factor in his judgment; rather, he simply included it in the
list of aggravating factors. 

[84]                         
Incidentally, I note that this enumeration of
aggravating factors also includes the fact that the respondent had consumed
cannabis. I agree with Judge Couture that even if the consumption of
cannabis played no role in the accident, it is nevertheless evidence of the
respondent’s irresponsibility.

[85]                         
My colleague also states that “the impact on
those close to the accused cannot be considered an aggravating factor that
would justify a harsher sentence for the accused” (para. 147). He cites
s. 718.2  of the Criminal Code  in support of this assertion. But the
list of aggravating factors in that section is not exhaustive. Also, this
factor, like that of intoxication, played a secondary role in the determination
of the sentence. Moreover, contrary to the respondent’s contention, the impact
on those close to the victim can be an aggravating factor: R. v. J.B.,
2015 QCCQ 1884, at para. 59 (CanLII); R. v. Tang, 2010 QCCS
5009, at para. 23 (CanLII). 

[86]                         
In any event, the Court of Appeal justified its
decision not on the basis of these supposed errors by the trial judge but,
rather, by finding that the judge had departed from the sentencing range
established by the courts for impaired driving offences and that the sentence
he had imposed departed from the principle of proportionality. In short, the
arguments to the effect that the trial judge made errors in respect of the
mitigating and aggravating factors must fail.

D.          
Local Situation

[87]                         
In conducting his sentencing analysis, the trial
judge also referred to the [translation]
“local situation” factor (para. 73) and stressed the need to convey a strong
message of general deterrence and denunciation. The Court of Appeal completely
overlooked this in its decision. With all due respect, I find that in so doing,
the Court of Appeal made another error.

[88]                         
I note in this regard that the respondent
submits that the trial judge erred in considering the particular situation in
the Beauce region with regard to impaired driving offences. In my view, the
respondent is wrong.

[89]                         
Even though the Criminal Code  applies
everywhere in the country, local characteristics in a given region may explain
certain differences in the sentences imposed on offenders by the courts. The
frequency of a type of offence in a particular region can certainly be a
relevant factor for a sentencing judge. In M. (C.A.),
Lamer C.J. stated the following:

                    The
determination of a just and appropriate sentence is a delicate art which
attempts to balance carefully the societal goals of sentencing against the
moral blameworthiness of the offender and the circumstances of the offence, while
at all times taking into account the needs and current conditions of and in the
community. [Emphasis added; para. 91.]

He then added the
following in the next paragraph:

                    As
well, sentences for a particular offence should be expected to vary to some
degree across various communities and regions in this country, as the “just and
appropriate” mix of accepted sentencing goals will depend on the needs and
current conditions of and in the particular community where the crime occurred.
[para. 92]

[90]                         
Although the fact that a type of crime occurs
frequently in a particular region is not in itself an aggravating factor, there
may be circumstances in which a judge might nonetheless consider such a fact in
balancing the various sentencing objectives, including the need to denounce the
unlawful conduct in question in that place and at the same time to deter anyone
else from doing the same thing. It goes without saying, however, that the
consideration of this factor must not lead to a sentence that is demonstrably
unfit.

[91]                         
The Quebec Court of Appeal has played an
important role in the development of the Canadian case law on this subject. For
example, in R. v. Valiquette, 2004 CanLII 20126, at paras. 48‑50,
it affirmed the decision of the trial judge, who had considered an upsurge in
crimes involving the production of drugs in the Joliette district in order to
emphasize the objectives of denunciation and general deterrence in the
determination of a just and reasonable sentence.

[92]                         
Similarly, the Quebec Court of Appeal found in R.
v. Nguyen, 2007 QCCA 1500, at para. 7 (CanLII), that, in
determining the sentence, the trial judge had been right to take into account
the fact that there had been a large number of offences involving the
cultivation of cannabis in certain parts of the Basses‑Laurentides
region, as well as the existence of a well‑developed narcotics
trafficking network there. In the Court of Appeal’s view, the trial judge had
not therefore been wrong to impose a sentence that would be harsh enough to
deter individuals who might be tempted by the lure of gain to commit such
offences.

[93]                         
Other Canadian courts of appeal have also
referred to the principle that the local situation may be one of the relevant
factors to consider in determining a just and appropriate sentence: R. v.
Morrissette (1970), 1 C.C.C. (2d) 307 (Sask. C.A.), at p. 310; R.
v. Laurila, 2010 BCCA 535, 296 B.C.A.C. 139, at para. 6; R. v.
Woghiren, 2004 CanLII 46649 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 3.

[94]                         
It is true that considerations of procedural
fairness will generally require that a judge who intends to attach weight to
the local reality and to the frequency of a crime in a given region offer the
parties an opportunity to make representations on the subject. However, this
was not an issue in the case at bar, given that the local reality was not in
dispute. The record shows that the point about the local reality was raised by
the appellant in argument in a timely fashion and that the respondent therefore
had all the information he needed in deciding to say nothing in this regard:
transcript from September 14, 2013, A.R., vol. II, at p. 91. 

[95]                         
In any event, I am of the view that it was open
to Judge Couture to take judicial notice of the evil represented by the
large number of offences related to drinking and driving that are committed in
the Beauce district. Judge Couture was the resident judge in that
district. He was therefore in a position to observe and assess the magnitude of
the problem in his region, especially given that it is well established in our
law that judges can take judicial notice of the contexts in which they perform
the duties of their offices: R. v. Z.Z., 2013 QCCA 1498, at
para. 68 (CanLII); R. v. Hernandez, 2009 BCCA 546, 277
B.C.A.C. 120, at para. 29. This Court stated in R. v. MacDougall,
[1998] 3 S.C.R. 45, at para. 63, per McLachlin J., that trial judges
and provincial courts of appeal are in the best position to know the particular
circumstances in their jurisdictions. In the case at bar, the frequency of
impaired driving offences is something that can be determined objectively by
consulting the court rolls. In short, it is public information that is known
and uncontroversial, and the local reality was not in dispute in the instant
case.

[96]                         
In the circumstances, requiring the preparation
and filing of additional evidence to establish that prosecutions for impaired
driving offences were regularly on the penal or criminal roll in the Beauce
district is in my opinion pointless. It is the trial judge who is in the best
position to know the nature of the cases before his or her court.

[97]                         
My colleague agrees that, in the circumstances,
Judge Couture cannot be criticized for the comments he made on the situation in
his region in referring (at para. 72) to [translation]
“this scourge” in his district. Having said this, my colleague states that
Judge Couture was not in a position to take judicial notice of the fact that
impaired driving is trivialized in the Beauce region more than elsewhere in
Quebec. Yet that is not what Judge Couture did. Rather, he merely asked out
loud whether, given the large number of criminal charges involving impaired
driving that have been laid in the Beauce district, driving in such a state is
trivialized there more than elsewhere.

[98]                         
In any case, it would have been open to the
trial judge, as the resident judge in the Beauce district and one who was
required to sit in other judicial districts, to compare the hearing rolls in
the Beauce district with the rolls of other districts had he in fact done so.
In R. v. Dumais, 2010 QCCA 1030, at para. 7 (CanLII), the
Quebec Court of Appeal affirmed the sentence that had been imposed by the trial
judge, which was based, in part, on his having taken judicial notice of a
scourge of drug trafficking in the Baie‑Comeau area. Even though the
trial judge did not reside in Baie‑Comeau, he was familiar with the
community, where he sat regularly and where he had previously presided over a
trial concerning a major drug trafficking network that had taken several weeks
to complete. 

[99]                         
At any rate, I am of the opinion that the mere
fact that the trial judge found that impaired driving is a scourge in the
Beauce district was in itself sufficient for him to consider this factor in
determining what would be a just and appropriate sentence. 

[100]                     
The case law of the Quebec Court of Appeal
supports this conclusion. For example, in Valiquette, that court found
that it had been open to the trial judge to consider an upsurge in crimes
involving the production of narcotics in the Joliette district as a relevant
factor in the sentencing process. It did not require the trial judge to
compare the local situation with the situation elsewhere before emphasizing the
objectives of general deterrence and denunciation, as it merely stated that [translation] “the judge [had] not
err[ed] in taking the local situation and the upsurge in this type of crime in
the Joliette area into account”: Valiquette, at para. 48. 

[101]                     
And in a recent case, R. v. St‑Germain,
2015 QCCA 1108, at paras. 38 and 47 (CanLII), the Quebec Court of Appeal
affirmed a decision in which the trial judge had emphasized the objectives of
deterrence and denunciation because of the upsurge in crimes involving the
production of drugs in the Joliette district. No comparative analysis was
necessary, nor was one required by the Court of Appeal, in support of that
conclusion. 

[102]                     
Moreover, the fact that trial judges normally
preside in or near the communities that have borne the consequences of the
crimes in question is one of the factors in support of deferring to their
sentencing decisions, and it is not necessary for them to have knowledge of the
situations in other judicial districts. They are accordingly aware of the
frequency of various offences in their communities, and for that reason in
particular, they are in the best position to determine what weight to attach to
this and [translation] “to
properly assess the particular combination of sentencing objectives that is
just and appropriate for the protection of [the] community”: R. v. Pelletier,
2008 QCCA 1616, at para. 3 (CanLII). 

[103]                     
For the reasons set out above, I am of the
opinion that Judge Couture did not make an error in principle by referring in
his decision to the particular situation in the Beauce region as one of the
relevant factors to consider in imposing an exemplary or deterrent sentence.

[104]                     
For the same reasons, I respectfully find that
the Court of Appeal erred in principle by failing to consider the local
situation factor in its decision despite the fact that it had previously found
this factor to be legitimate in other cases. Given that Judge Couture had
stressed the relevance of the local situation in the circumstances of this
case, it was inappropriate for the Court of Appeal to disregard this factor in
assessing the fitness of the sentence, as that meant that its analysis was
incomplete.

[105]                     
In conclusion, it is my opinion that the
sentence of six years and six months’ imprisonment imposed by Judge
Couture, although severe, falls within the overall range of sentences normally
imposed in Quebec and elsewhere in the country and is not demonstrably unfit.
It must therefore be restored.

E.           
Driving Prohibition

[106]                     
The appellant submits on the basis of
s. 719(1)  of the Criminal Code  that a sentence must commence when
it is imposed and that the Court of Appeal erred in imposing a four‑year
driving prohibition on the respondent at the end of his term of incarceration.

[107]                     
In my view, the appellant is wrong on this
point. The case on which the appellant relies for this, R. v. Laycock
(1989), 51 C.C.C. (3d) 65 (Ont. C.A.), was decided in 1989, at which time
s. 259(2) (a) of the Criminal Code  was worded as follows:

                          259. . . .

                          (2) Where an offender is convicted or
discharged under section 736 of an offence under section 220, 221,
236, 249, 250, 251, 252 or this section or subsection 255(2)  or (3) 
committed by means of a motor vehicle, vessel or aircraft, the court that
sentences the offender may, in addition to any other punishment that may be
imposed for that offence, make an order prohibiting the offender from operating
a motor vehicle on any street, road, highway or other public place, a vessel or
an aircraft, as the case may be,

(a)
during any period that the court considers proper, if the offender is liable to
imprisonment for life in respect of that offence;

[108]                     
This provision was subsequently amended. The
relevant paragraph currently reads as follows:

                          (a.1) during any period that the
court considers proper, plus any period to which the offender is sentenced
to imprisonment, if the offender is liable to imprisonment for life in respect
of that offence and if the sentence imposed is other than imprisonment for
life;

[109]                     
By adding the words “plus any period to which
the offender is sentenced to imprisonment”, Parliament was making it clear that
it intended driving prohibitions to commence at the end of the period of
imprisonment, not on the date of sentencing. Section 719(1)  provides that
a sentence commences when it is imposed, except where an enactment otherwise
provides. That is exactly what s. 259(2)  does. The Court of Appeal did not
err in this regard. 

[110]                     
What remains is a simple mathematical operation.
Judge Couture imposed an 11‑year driving prohibition commencing at the
time of sentencing. If the term of imprisonment of six years and
five months is subtracted, the driving prohibition should have been for
four years and seven months commencing at the time of the respondent’s release.


[111]                     
Another question concerning the driving
prohibition arose at the hearing. The respondent submits that, because he
entered into a recognizance under which he was not to drive from July 5,
2011, the date he was released on conditions, until October 4, 2013, the
date of his sentencing, he should be credited for that period. In the same way
as the conditions of pre‑trial detention, the length of a presentence
driving prohibition can be considered in analyzing the reasonableness of the
prohibition: R. v. Bilodeau, 2013 QCCA 980, at para. 75 (CanLII);
see also R. v. Williams, 2009 NBPC 16, 346 N.B.R. (2d) 164. 

[112]                     
The courts have seemed quite reluctant to grant
a credit where the release of the accused was subject to restrictions, given
that such restrictive release conditions are not equivalent to actually being
in custody (“bail is not jail”): R. v. Downes (2006), 79 O.R. (3d) 321
(C.A.); R. v. Ijam, 2007 ONCA 597, 87 O.R. (3d) 81, at para. 36;
R. v. Panday, 2007 ONCA 598, 87 O.R. (3d) 1.

[113]                     
In the instant case, the driving prohibition has
the same effect regardless of whether it was imposed before or after the
respondent was sentenced. In R. v. Sharma, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 814,
Lamer C.J., dissenting, explained that the accused had in fact begun
serving his sentence, given that the driving prohibition would have been
imposed as part of his sentence had he been tried and found guilty within a
reasonable time. In short, where a driving prohibition is not only one of the
release conditions imposed on an accused but also part of the sentence imposed
upon his or her conviction, the length of the presentence driving prohibition
must be subtracted from the prohibition imposed in the context of the sentence.

[114]                     
In my view, therefore, the driving prohibition
of four years and seven months imposed in this case is demonstrably unfit and
must be reduced to two years and four months to take account of the
recognizance entered into by the respondent under which he was to refrain from
driving from his release date until his sentencing date (two years and
three months).

F.            
Fresh Evidence

[115]                     
The criteria that apply to a court of appeal’s
decision whether to receive fresh evidence were articulated in Palmer v. The
Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759:

(1)       The
evidence should generally not be admit­ted if, by due diligence, it could have
been adduced at trial provided that this general principle will not be applied
as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases . . . .

(2)       The
evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon a decisive or
potentially decisive issue in the trial.

(3)       The
evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief,
and

(4)       It must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when
taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected
the result. [Citation omitted; p. 775.]

[116]                     
Although that case involved an appeal from a
verdict, this Court has confirmed that the same criteria apply under
s. 687(1)  of the Criminal Code  when a court of appeal determines
whether it thinks “fit” to receive fresh evidence to decide an appeal against a
sentence: R. v. Lévesque, 2000 SCC 47, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 487. As
Charron J. noted in R. v. Angelillo, 2006 SCC 55, [2006] 2 S.C.R.
728, “[w]hat must guide the court of appeal in assessing the admissibility of
fresh evidence [are] the interests of justice” (para. 12).

[117]                     
In the case at bar, only the
fourth criterion is problematic. The appellant submits that the evidence
of the respondent’s two breaches of his recognizances would have affected the
trial judge’s decision, since those breaches relate to the respondent’s
potential for rehabilitation. The respondent argues that the two breaches were
essentially minor and that the Court of Appeal was not wrong to find that the
evidence regarding them would have been unlikely to affect the final result.

[118]                     
In my opinion, the fresh evidence was relevant.
Although the two breaches in question are not actually related to the operation
of a motor vehicle, they are evidence of a lack of respect on the respondent’s
part for court orders and for the law, which relates directly to the conditions
for his rehabilitation. 

[119]                     
In Lees v. The Queen, [1979] 2 S.C.R.
749, McIntyre J. found that evidence of potential but untried charges was
admissible on the issue of “the appellant’s character, conduct, and attitude,
all proper factors to be taken into consideration on sentencing” (p. 754).
In the instant case, the respondent pleaded guilty to two counts of
failure to comply with a recognizance. If made earlier, those guilty pleas
would certainly have been included in the presentence report in accordance with
s. 721(3) (b) of the Criminal Code .

[120]                     
From this perspective, the evidence of the two
breaches of the recognizances could have affected the weight given to the
favourable presentence report and could therefore have affected the final
sentencing decision. In particular, the Court of Appeal might have reached a
different conclusion if it had admitted that evidence, which would have helped
it in assessing the fitness of the sentence that had been imposed at trial.

V.          
Disposition

[121]                     
For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and
restore the sentence imposed by the trial judge except as regards the driving prohibition,
which is reduced to two years and four months commencing at the end of the
respondent’s incarceration.

of the reasons of McLachlin C.J. and Gascon J. delivered by

                    Gascon
J. (dissenting) — 

I.         
Introduction 

[122]                     
I have read the reasons of Wagner J., and I
will defer to his summary of the facts and of the decisions rendered by the
courts below. With respect, however, I disagree with my colleague’s disposition
of the issues. I am fully aware of the devastating consequences of the offences
in question for the victims and their families, but I nonetheless believe that
the Quebec Court of Appeal was right to intervene in this case. Although that
court’s comments about the application of the sentencing ranges may, if considered
in isolation, suggest that it adopted an overly rigid approach, I am satisfied
from its reasons as a whole that it correctly stated the law on the criteria
for intervention in this regard. 

[123]                     
The degree of censure required to express
society’s condemnation of an offence is always subject to the principle that an
offender’s sentence must be equivalent to his or her moral culpability, and not
greater than it. In the instant case, the trial judge placed undue emphasis on
the factors related to the objectives of general deterrence and exemplarity
(i.e. the fact of making an example of an offender). This led him to err,
first, in disregarding this fundamental principle of proportionality and,
second, in imposing a sentence that represented a substantial and marked
departure from the sentences customarily imposed on similar offenders who have
committed similar offences in similar circumstances. By varying the sentence
from 78 to 48 months, the Court of Appeal reduced it by more than a third,
which was certainly a significant reduction. Insofar as the Court of Appeal
correctly stated the law and as its intervention was therefore warranted, this
Court should not interfere with its conclusions as to the sentence it imposed
on the respondent, which is in fact just and appropriate. 

[124]                     
On the other hand, I agree with my colleague
that the courts below erred in failing to take into account the length of the
respondent’s presentence driving prohibition. Indeed, the appellant conceded
this at the hearing in this Court. The driving prohibition imposed by the Court
of Appeal should therefore be varied accordingly. I would retain the
wording it used with respect to this prohibition, however.

[125]                     
Finally, the Court of Appeal held that fresh
evidence of breaches by the accused of two recognizances was not reasonably
capable of tipping the scales in favour of a harsher sentence for the purpose
of protecting society. On this point, too, it correctly applied the law. I see
no error that justifies this Court in interfering with that conclusion. 

[126]                     
Accordingly, I would have allowed the appeal for
the sole purpose of reducing the respondent’s driving prohibition to one year
and nine months, plus the period of 48 months to which he was sentenced to
imprisonment.

II.      
Analysis

A.      
Sentence 

(1)      Sentencing Principles and Objectives

[127]                     
Sentencing judges must take into consideration, inter alia,
the objectives of deterrence and rehabilitation, any relevant aggravating and
mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and the
principle that a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar
offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances: ss. 718 
and 718.2 (a) and (b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985,
c. C‑46  (“Cr. C.”). The reconciliation of these
different factors requires that the sentence be consistent with the fundamental
principle of sentencing, set out in s. 718.1  Cr. C., that
“[it] must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of
responsibility of the offender”: R. v. Nur, 2015 SCC 15, [2015] 1 S.C.R.
773, at para. 42; see also R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5, [2000] 1
S.C.R. 61, at para. 82; R. v. Gladue, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688.

[128]                     
The principle of proportionality has a long
history as a guiding principle in sentencing, and it has a constitutional dimension:
R. v. Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, at para. 41; R.
v. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 41. A person cannot be
made to suffer a disproportionate punishment simply to send a message to
discourage others from offending: Nur, at para. 45. As
Rosenberg J.A. wrote in R. v. Priest (1996), 30 O.R. (3d)
538 (C.A.), at pp. 546‑47:

                        The
principle of proportionality is rooted in notions of fairness and justice. For
the sentencing court to do justice to the particular offender, the sentence
imposed must reflect the seriousness of the offence, the degree of culpability
of the offender, and the harm occasioned by the offence. The court must have
regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors in the particular case.
Careful adherence to the proportionality principle ensures that this offender
is not unjustly dealt with for the sake of the common good. [Footnote omitted.]

Although a court can, in
pursuit of the objective of general deterrence, impose a harsher sentence in
order to send a message with a view to deterring others, the offender must
still deserve that sentence: R. v. Paré, 2011 QCCA 2047; G. Renaud,
The Sentencing Code of Canada: Principles and Objectives (2009), at
para. 3.13. If a judge fails to individualize a sentence and to consider
the relevant mitigating factors while placing undue emphasis on the
circumstances of the offence and the objectives of denunciation and deterrence,
all that is done is to punish the crime: R. v. R. (M.),
2010 QCCA 16, 73 C.R. (6th) 136. Proportionality requires that a sentence
not exceed what is just and appropriate in light of the moral
blameworthiness of the offender and the gravity of the offence. From this
perspective, it serves as a limiting principle: Nasogaluak, at
para. 42. 

[129]                     
My colleague states that the principle of
proportionality means that the more serious the crime and its consequences, or
the greater the offender’s degree of responsibility, the heavier the sentence
will be (para. 12). I would qualify this statement somewhat. In my view,
an offender’s degree of responsibility does not flow inevitably and solely from
the gravity of the offence. The gravity of the offence and the moral
blameworthiness of the offender are two separate factors, and the principle of
proportionality requires that full consideration be given to each of them: Proulx,
at para. 83. As s. 718.1 Cr. C. provides, “[a] sentence
must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of
responsibility of the offender.”

[130]                     
Whereas the gravity of the offence concerns the
harm caused by the offender to the victim as well as to society and its values,
the other aspect of the principle of proportionality involves factors that
relate to the offender’s moral culpability:

                        The “degree of responsibility of the offender”
as used in s. 718.1 certainly includes the mens rea level of intent,
recklessness or wilful blindness associated with the actus reus of the crime
committed. For this assessment, courts are able to draw extensively on criminal
justice principles. The greater the harm intended or the greater the degree of
recklessness or wilful blindness, the greater the moral culpability. However,
the reference in s. 718.1 is not simply to the “mens rea degree of
responsibility of the offender” at the time of commission of the crime.
Parliament evidently intended “degree of responsibility of the offender” to
include other factors affecting culpability. These might relate, for example,
to the offender’s personal circumstances, mental capacity or motive for
committing the crime. Where else does the Code provide for an offender’s
degree of responsibility generally to be taken into account? Here, too, the
answer takes us to s. 718.2 . 

                        Section 718.2  directs the sentencing
judge to take into consideration a number of principles. All are either
components of the proportionality principle or properly influence its
interpretation and application. Either way, all are relevant in determining a
just sanction that satisfies the proportionality principle. [Citation omitted.]

(R. v. J.L.M.A.,
2010 ABCA 363, 499 A.R. 1, at paras. 58‑59; see also Nasogaluak,
at para. 42; M. (C.A.), at para. 40.)

[131]                     
The application of the proportionality principle
may therefore cause the two factors to conflict, particularly where the gravity
of the offence points strongly to a sentence at one end of the range while the
moral culpability of the offender points in the other direction: R. v.
Hamilton (2004), 72 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), at para. 93, quoted in C. C.
Ruby, G. J. Chan and N. R. Hasan, Sentencing (8th ed. 2012),
at pp. 26‑27. In short, although it is true that the gravity of the
crime is a relevant factor, it must nevertheless be considered in conjunction
with the offender’s degree of responsibility, a factor that is unrelated to the
gravity of the offence.

[132]                     
I would also qualify my colleague’s statement
that the courts have “very few options other than imprisonment” (para. 6) for
meeting the objectives of general or specific deterrence and denunciation in
cases in which they must be emphasized. In my view, the courts should not
automatically assume that imprisonment is always the preferred sanction for the
purpose of meeting these objectives. To do so would be contrary to other
sentencing principles. Rather, a court must consider “all available sanctions, other
than imprisonment”, that are reasonable in the circumstances: s. 718.2 (e)
Cr. C.; Gladue, at para. 36.

[133]                     
The common law principle that even where a term
of imprisonment is necessary, it should be the lightest possible sanction in
the circumstances is codified in s. 718.2 (d) Cr. C.:
Ruby, Chan and Hasan, at p. 510. This Court has noted Parliament’s desire
to give increased prominence, for all offenders, to this principle of restraint
in the use of prison as a sanction: Proulx, at para. 17. A court
that emphasizes general deterrence must therefore always be mindful of both the
principle of restraint and that of proportionality: Ruby, Chan and Hasan, at
p. 15, citing R. v. Hawkins, 2011 NSCA 7, 298 N.S.R. (2d) 53, at
paras. 42 and 47; see also R. v. Wismayer (1997),
33 O.R. (3d) 225 (C.A.); R. v. Coffin, 2006 QCCA 471, 210 C.C.C. (3d)
227; F. Dadour, De la détermination de la peine: Principes et
applications (2007), at p. 8. 

[134]                     
Furthermore, [translation]
“the objective of general and even specific deterrence does not relate
exclusively to the severity of a sentence considered in the abstract.
Deterrence can work through conditions tailored to fit the offender or the
circumstances of the offender, as the . . . Court noted in Proulx”:
Dadour, at p. 8 (footnote omitted). This principle is even more important
in the case of a young person with no criminal record: Priest. As
Twaddle J.A. observed in R. v. Leask (1996), 113 Man. R. (2d) 265
(C.A.), at para. 3, “the transition from statutorily defined young person
to adult should not be marked by an immediate abandonment of rehabilitation as
the primary goal in cases where the prospect of successful rehabilitation is
real”. 

(2)     
Standard of Intervention Applicable to
Sentencing Decisions

[135]                     
My colleague states that this appeal affords the
Court an opportunity to clarify the standard on the basis of which an appellate
court may intervene in sentencing decisions (para. 10). In my opinion,
there is no reason to believe that this is necessary. The applicable standard
is well known, and when all is said and done, the appeal before us concerns
only how it should be applied in the circumstances of this case.

[136]                     
In Nasogaluak, this Court summarized the
applicable law as follows: “. . . a sentence [can] only be
interfered with if it [is] ‘demonstrably unfit’ or if it reflect[s] an
error in principle, the failure to consider a relevant factor, or the over‑emphasis
of a relevant factor” (para. 46 (emphasis added), citing M. (C.A.),
at para. 90). In Paré, a case that was referred to in the decisions
of the courts below, the Quebec Court of Appeal reiterated the principles
established in those cases and wrote the following:

                        [translation]  . . . a court
of appeal may intervene only in circumstances indicating an error in
principle, an overemphasis of an appropriate factor, or a failure to consider a
relevant factor, unless the sentence is quite simply demonstrably unfit
or, in other words, clearly unreasonable. Thus, appellate courts retain the
power to ensure that sentences are consistent with those imposed “for similar
offences committed in similar circumstances”; indeed, this is set out in
subsection 718.2 (b) Cr. C. [Emphasis added;
para. 38 (CanLII).]

[137]                     
If a party shows that the trial judge made an
error in principle, failed to consider a relevant factor or overemphasized
appropriate factors, I do not think it can be said that the judge acted within
the limits of his or her discretion in sentencing matters. In such cases, the
relevant decisions of this Court do not require that the sentence also be shown
to be demonstrably unfit before an appellate court can intervene. The effect of
such a requirement would be to raise the recognized standard of intervention. 

[138]                     
In my opinion, the current approach is neither
incongruous nor unfair. The highly deferential standard of appellate review
must be adhered to as long as the trial judge did not err in principle, fail to
consider a relevant factor or overemphasize appropriate factors: R. v. Stone,
[1999] 2 S.C.R. 290, at para. 230. Even if none of these three situations
exists, however, intervention may be necessary if the sentence is demonstrably
unfit. This other ground for intervention has been described in several ways: a
court of appeal can still vary a sentence if it is convinced that the sentence
is “not fit” or “clearly unreasonable” (R. v. Shropshire, [1995] 4
S.C.R. 227, at para. 46), that it is “[u]nreasonabl[e]” or “fall[s]
outside the ‘acceptable range’” (Shropshire, at para. 50), or that
it is “demonstrably unfit” (R. v. McDonnell, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948, at
para. 17; M. (C.A.), at para. 90). 

[139]                     
Therefore, where a reviewable error is shown in
the reasoning on which a sentence is based, it is appropriate for an appellate
court to be able to intervene and assess the fitness of the sentence. This does
not necessarily mean that the court will automatically vary the sentence. As
the passage from Paré quoted above indicates, the court’s role in
ensuring consistency in sentencing requires it before intervening to ascertain,
among other things, that the sentence represents a “substantial and marked
departure from the sentences customarily imposed for similar offenders
committing similar crimes”: M. (C.A.), at para. 92;
see also Stone, at para. 230. An error merely opens the door to
intervention and permits an appellate court to reopen the sentencing analysis.
Only by correctly repeating the analytical exercise can the court determine
whether the sanction imposed on the offender is just and appropriate or whether
it should be varied. In other words, the court can then impose the sentence it
considers appropriate without having to show deference: T. Desjardins, L’appel
en droit criminel et pénal (2nd ed. 2012), at p. 217, citing, inter alia,
R. v. Gallon, 2006 NBCA 31, 297 N.B.R. (2d) 317; R. v. Biancofiore
(1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 782 (C.A.), at p. 789; and R. v. Gagnon
(1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 194 (Que. C.A.), at p. 199. 

[140]                     
In this regard, it seems to me that this Court’s
decisions reflect a careful reading of s. 687  Cr. C. What
emerges from the Court’s remarks is that the fitness of a sentence is not
assessed in the abstract. There is no such thing as a uniform sentence for a
particular crime, and sentencing is an inherently individualized process: M. (C.A.),
at para. 92. A sentence must reflect a consideration of all the relevant
factors, and it is in this sense that the “process” of sentencing is important.
In the words of Dickson J. in R. v. Gardiner, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368,
“[i]f policy considerations are to enter the picture, as they often do, there
would appear to me to be every reason why this Court should remain available to
adjudicate upon difficult and important questions of law in the sentencing
process”: p. 404. The fitness of a sentence is determined on the basis of
several relevant principles, objectives and factors, and a sanction may be
unfit if there is a reviewable error in the thought process or reasoning on
which it is based. However, it is only by assessing that process or reasoning
that an appellate court can determine whether the identified errors make the
sentence unfit.

[141]                     
I note that my colleague seems to detect a
certain absoluteness in my words that is quite simply not there (paras. 42‑43).
I am not saying that a sentence cannot be fit if there is a reviewable error in
the reasoning process on which it is based. Rather, I am saying that a sanction
may be unfit in such a case, which is very different. The first of these
wordings would be absolute. The second depends on the appellate court’s
assessment of the sanction in question, which is in fact made in accordance
with the principles set out in my reasons.

[142]                     
Therefore, although I agree that, as
Hall J.A. stated in R. v. Orr, 2008 BCCA 76, 228 C.C.C. (3d) 432,
at para. 7, an appellate court should not vary a sentence that is fit, I
consider it imperative that that court retain its ability to rule on the trial
court’s analysis and to intervene where there is an error warranting its
intervention. 

[143]                     
Finally, I agree with my colleague that it is
accepted that the ranges established by appellate courts are in fact only
guidelines, and not hard and fast rules (para. 60). A judge can therefore
order a sentence outside the established range as long as it is in accordance
with the principles and objectives of sentencing. Regard must be had not only
to the circumstances of the offence and the needs of the community in which the
offence occurred, but also to the circumstances of the offender: Nasogaluak,
at para. 44. As a corollary, the mere fact that a sentence falls within the
range applicable to a certain type of crime does not necessarily make it fit,
since the judge may, in determining the sentence, have failed to take account
of the particular circumstances of the offender. It is by analyzing the trial
judge’s reasoning or thought process that an appellate court can determine
whether a sentence that falls within the proper range is tailored to fit the
circumstances of the offender and is therefore individualized and
proportionate.

(3)     
Intervention of the Court of Appeal

[144]                     
In light of the above, I find that the Court of
Appeal properly justified its intervention in this case. Although the comments
it made in para. 15 (CanLII) of its reasons might at first glance
suggest that it took an inflexible view of the sentencing ranges, I believe
that the substance of the court’s reasoning can instead be found at
paras. 16‑17: 2014 QCCA 1061. I do not agree with my colleague that
the Court of Appeal intervened solely because the trial judge had deviated from
the proper sentencing range (para. 11) or because the sentence fell
outside the accepted sentencing range (para. 16), or that it essentially
focused its analysis on the application of the sentencing range (para. 30)
or applied that range mechanically (para. 69). Rather, its reasons, read
as a whole, show that its analysis went much further than that. I think it will
be helpful to reproduce the entirety of paras. 15‑17, which I find
to be enlightening in this regard: 

                        [translation] 
By imposing a sentence of 77 months’ imprisonment (six years and six
months minus one month because of the time spent by the applicant in pre‑trial
custody), the trial judge unquestionably placed the sentence at the lower end
of the third category of sentences, the most severe ones. The respondent argued
at the hearing that the sentence was actually in the second category, increased
slightly because of the serious consequences of the offence, which had claimed
two victims. But that argument must be rejected, because “personal factors
of the accused” that are unfavourable to the accused are normally what justify
a move from the second to the third category. This can be seen from
the breakdown of sentences in recent cases.

                        However, such factors are almost non‑existent
in this case, as is clear from the report prepared by a probation officer for
sentencing purposes and from the testimony given by the psychologist and the
social worker who attended the applicant following the accident. The applicant
has strong support from his family. There is virtually no possibility of him
reoffending. It is likely that, once he has served his sentence, he will
be able to find a job in an autobody repair business owned by his mother. There
is no doubt that he is aware of the extreme seriousness of the consequences of
his wrongdoing: he was and still is tortured by remorse, so much so that
the professionals around him became concerned about possible suicidal
tendencies and took preventive action accordingly. 

                        In
light of the foregoing, the sentence imposed on October 4, 2013 is excessive
because it departs from the principle of proportionality. In
individualizing the sentence in this case, the judge should have given
greater consideration to the applicant’s potential for rehabilitation, which is
substantial, and reduced the emphasis he placed on exemplarity. A sentence
that is severe without being draconian will be more than sufficient for the
purposes of this last factor in the case of individuals who, like the
applicant, have no record (despite a few Highway Safety Code
offences in his case), are law‑abiding and are capable of
understanding the magnitude, for all those close to the victims, of a
tragedy like the one that occurred on June 17, 2011. [Emphasis added;
footnote omitted.] 

[145]                     
By justifying its intervention as it did, the
Court of Appeal complied with the principles laid down by this Court for such
cases. As it noted, and as I will explain in the next section, the sanction
imposed in this case was not consistent with the principles and objectives of
sentencing. The trial judge considered some aggravating factors that were not
really aggravating factors, rejected or failed to consider some relevant and
important mitigating factors, and placed undue emphasis on the objective of deterrence.
The sentence that resulted from his analysis was thus neither proportionate nor
individualized; it also represented a substantial and marked departure from the
sentences customarily imposed on similar offenders who have committed similar
crimes in similar circumstances. 

(4)     
Trial Judge’s Errors

(a)       Aggravating Factors That Were Not Really Aggravating Factors

[146]                     
In his analysis, the trial judge began by
identifying some aggravating factors that were not really aggravating factors:
2013 QCCQ 11960, at para. 32 (CanLII). In principle, s. 718.2  Cr. C.
lists a number of what are considered to be aggravating factors. An element
of the offence cannot in itself constitute such a factor. A judge who
characterizes an element of the offence as an aggravating factor thus makes an
error of law that opens the door to appellate intervention: R. v. Flight,
2014 ABCA 380, 584 A.R. 392, at para. 4; R. v. Stimson, 2011 ABCA
59, 499 A.R. 185, at para. 20; R. v. Dass, 2008 CanLII 13191 (Ont.
S.C.J.), at pp. 59-60; R. v. Dankyi (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 368
(Que. C.A.), at p. 372. 

[147]                     
In the instant case, the accused being
intoxicated was in itself already an element of the offence. Incidentally, the
record does not indicate what his blood alcohol level was. Similarly, the
consumption of alcohol or drugs before driving was already part of the offence,
so the fact that the accused drank alcohol cannot be an aggravating factor in
the absence of some more blameworthy conduct. Moreover, the parties agreed that
it was the alcohol alone that had impaired the ability of the accused to drive;
his consumption of cannabis had not contributed to the accident, and this is
confirmed by the record. The accused had consumed cannabis (taking three puffs
on a joint) at about 7:00 p.m., and the accident occurred shortly before
4:00 a.m. the next day: trial, at para. 2; R.F., at para. 7.
Finally, the impact on those close to the accused cannot be considered an
aggravating factor that would justify a harsher sentence for the accused:
s. 718.2  Cr. C.

(b)      Discounted Mitigating Factors

[148]                     
Next, the trial judge discounted some relevant
factors that are normally characterized as mitigating factors and that must be
considered in determining the appropriate sentence — namely the youth of the
accused and the facts that he had expressed remorse, that he had no criminal
record and that the presentence report was favourable to him. The Court of
Appeal discussed the last three of these factors at paras. 16‑17 of
its reasons. By contrast, although the trial judge listed them at
para. 33, he actually ended up discounting all of them except the
presentence report, which he simply failed to discuss. He even discounted
the youth of the accused to favour exemplarity and deterrence (para. 39),
despite the principle that “the general rule for most offences is that a
sentence should not be imposed on a youthful offender for the purpose of
general deterrence, but should rather be directed at rehabilitation”: Ruby, Chan
and Hasan, at p. 263.

(c)      Failure to Discuss an Important Mitigating Factor

[149]                     
Furthermore, the trial judge initially referred
to the favourable presentence report and the positive conclusions reached in
it: paras. 18‑19. After that, he mentioned that the report was one
of the relevant mitigating factors: para. 33. But he did not discuss this
important factor further in his analysis. As the Court of Appeal noted, he in
fact disregarded the report and the following findings:

                    [translation]  The applicant has strong
support from his family. There is virtually no possibility of him reoffending.
It is likely that, once he has served his sentence, he will be able to find a
job in an autobody repair business owned by his mother. There is no doubt that
he is aware of the extreme seriousness of the consequences of his wrongdoing:
he was and still is tortured by remorse, so much so that the professionals
around him became concerned about possible suicidal tendencies and took
preventive action accordingly. [para. 16] 

[150]                     
That report and those positive findings
represented a mitigating factor that was relevant to and important for the
determination of the appropriate sentence. Yet the trial judge referred only
very briefly to the rehabilitation of the accused in para. 92, in which he
merely said: [translation] “The
objective of separation implies that the sentence should not be so long as to
hamper the rehabilitation of the accused.” I must agree with the Court of
Appeal that this does not show that he really considered this important factor.
Instead, a review of his reasons as a whole leads to the opposite conclusion,
that is, that he conducted no analysis in respect of the objective of
rehabilitation and its impact on the circumstances of the case. Unlike my
colleague, I find that the trial judge’s reasons do not support a conclusion
that he considered the respondent’s prospects for rehabilitation
(para. 82). As the Court of Appeal found, the trial judge’s failure to
consider this factor constituted a failure to take the offender’s potential for
rehabilitation, which is significant, into account in the individualization of the
sentence. 

(d)     Disproportionate Emphasis on Exemplarity 

[151]                     
Finally, as the Court of Appeal noted, the trial
judge’s failure to consider certain mitigating factors that favoured the
potential for rehabilitation of the accused and the emphasis he placed on exemplarity
led him to impose an excessive sentence that departed from the principle of
proportionality. Although the Court of Appeal found that the trial judge had
gone too far in emphasizing exemplarity, it is true that it did not deal
specifically with the local situation factor. I agree with my colleague that it
would have been preferable for the court to do so (para. 87). In the
instant case, the local situation factor clearly magnified the exemplary focus
of the sentence with which the Court of Appeal took issue. I will just make
three comments about what my colleague says in this regard. 

[152]                     
First, the views expressed by the authors and
the courts do not seem to me to be so uniform on the question whether judges
can rely on their own perceptions of the frequency of particular crimes in
their regions in order to justify imposing harsher sentences. For instance, I
note the following remarks by Ruby, Chan and Hasan, at p. 124:

                        Since
the sentencing hearing is merely part of a criminal trial, there is no reason
for thinking that the doctrine of judicial notice would not apply in the
ordinary way. But the distinction between facts that are sufficiently certain
to notice judicially and those that are not is one that must be borne in mind,
as excessive reliance on matters not proved in evidence can be destructive
of the fairness of the sentencing process. The incidence of crime in a
jurisdiction is not a matter that can be the subject matter of judicial notice.
[Emphasis added; footnotes omitted.]

[153]                     
When considered in the sentencing context, the
frequency of a crime in a given region does not help paint a portrait of the
accused, but instead reflects external factors:

                    The contradiction inherent in such sentences
is that the exemplary sentence is imposed on a particular offender who becomes
the scapegoat for others who have committed similar crimes, but who have not
been caught or who have not been singled out for the calling of the requisite
evidence. This is utterly impermissible. This action requires reliance upon
a deterrence theory, which has little, if any, statistical base upon which to
stand, and is not self‑proving. It is, nevertheless, a popular theory.

                          The use of evidence of increased
prevalence of a particular crime in the community as a factor aggravating the
appropriate sentence for a particular offender must rest on the theory that
higher penalties will deter offenders from committing that particular kind of
offence. The truth of this theory is not self‑evident, and deterrence
theories in general have suffered from criticism, though deterrence remains a
principle of sentencing. [Emphasis added; footnotes omitted.] 

(Ruby, Chan and Hasan, at p. 256)

[154]                     
It is true that in M. (C.A.), Lamer C.J.
stated that the needs of and current conditions in the community are a factor
to be considered in sentencing. A sentencing judge normally has a strong sense
of the blend of sentencing goals that will be “just and appropriate” for the
protection of the community where he or she presides: M. (C.A.), at
para. 91. However, although these remarks do support the view that the
frequency of a crime in the community can be considered in the sentencing
process, it should be borne in mind that Lamer C.J. also stated that, the
community’s needs notwithstanding, it is always necessary to carefully balance
the societal goals of sentencing against the moral blameworthiness of the
offender and the circumstances of the offence: M. (C.A.), at
para. 91. Thus, whatever weight a judge may wish to accord to the needs of
the community and the objective of deterrence, the resulting sentence must
always be consistent with the fundamental principle of proportionality. The
degree of censure required to express society’s condemnation of the offence is
limited by the principle that an offender’s sentence must be equivalent to his
or her moral culpability: Nasogaluak, at paras. 40‑42. In the
case at bar, the Court of Appeal properly emphasized factors relating to the
accused himself that the trial judge had disregarded.

[155]                     
Second, the views expressed by the authors and
the courts also do not seem to me to be so uniform on the question whether it
is appropriate for a judge to take judicial notice of the frequency of a crime
in his or her community during sentencing.

[156]                     
This Court considered the application of the doctrine
of judicial notice in R. v. Spence, 2005 SCC 71, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 458.
Ultimately, the permissible scope of judicial notice should vary according to
the nature of the issue under consideration: Spence, at para. 60.
Thus, the closer a fact approaches the dispositive issue, the more stringent is
the test for its admissibility: Spence, at paras. 60‑61; P. Béliveau and M. Vauclair, Traité
général de preuve et de procédure pénales (22nd ed. 2015), at para. 2366. When a fact falls between an adjudicative fact (one that is at
the centre of the controversy between the parties) and a background fact (one
that is only at the periphery of the controversy, and that the court will
assume to be uncontroversial), the court must ask itself

                    whether such “fact” would be accepted by
reasonable people who have taken the trouble to inform themselves on the topic
as not being the subject of reasonable dispute for the particular purpose
for which it is to be used, keeping in mind that the need for reliability
and trustworthiness increases directly with the centrality of the “fact” to the
disposition of the controversy. [Emphasis in original.] 

(Spence, at para. 65)

This is why a court may
take judicial notice of a “fact” in one case but decline to do so in another
case in which the issue is dispositive: Spence, at para. 65.

[157]                     
My colleague refers to some cases in support of
the proposition that judges can take judicial notice of the conditions that
exist in a region. In only one of those cases did the sentencing judge take
judicial notice of the local situation: R. v. Valiquette, 2004 CanLII
20126 (Que. C.A.), at paras. 48‑50. In the other cases, the courts
of appeal did note that a trial judge could consider the local situation when
imposing a sentence, but there was no indication that they agreed that judicial
notice could be taken of such evidence. 

[158]                     
In the case at bar, the trial judge referred to
the situation in his district, but he also suggested that impaired driving is
trivialized there more than elsewhere (para. 72). However, the judicial
notice that judges can take of their communities is not without limits. In my
view, caution must be exercised in establishing its scope. According to my
colleague, judicial notice in this regard is not limited to the magnitude of
the problem observed by the judge in his region, but can also be extended to a
comparison of the local situation with situations in other places as well as to
information gathered from the hearing rolls of courts (paras. 95 and 98).
This seems to me to go much farther than judicial notice of the fact that a
city has a francophone majority or of recent unlawful conduct in a particular
community, to which reference was made in the cases cited by my colleague in
support of his remarks (para. 95; R. v. Z.Z., 2013 QCCA 1498, at
para. 68 (CanLII); R. v. Hernandez, 2009 BCCA 546, 277 B.C.A.C.
120, at para. 29). Being familiar with the local situation in one’s region
is one thing, but claiming to compare that situation with what happens
elsewhere in order to draw conclusions or inferences from it is something else.

[159]                     
Third, and finally, I agree that the sentencing
process differs considerably from a trial in that it is more informal. As
Dickson J. noted in Gardiner, “the strict rules which govern at
trial do not apply at a sentencing hearing and it would be undesirable to have
the formalities and technicalities characteristic of the normal adversary
proceeding prevail”: p. 414; see also R. v. Lévesque, 2000 SCC 47,
[2000] 2 S.C.R. 487, at para. 30. A court has wide latitude as to the
sources and types of evidence upon which to base the sentence to be imposed. It
can rely on counsel’s submissions and arguments, and mere assertions by counsel
may sometimes suffice to found factual decisions by the court: R. v. Witvoet,
2015 ABCA 152, 600 A.R. 200; see also R. v. Bartlett, 2005 NLCA 75, 252
Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 154; R. v. Joseph, 2012 BCCA 359, 326 B.C.A.C. 312,
at para. 32. 

[160]                     
Still, despite the latitude judges have in
sentencing hearings, they must never lose sight of the importance of procedural
fairness. Professor Davis explains this as follows:

                        The basic principle is that extra‑record
facts should be assumed whenever it is convenient to assume them, except that convenience
should always yield to the requirement of procedural fairness that parties
should have opportunity to meet in the appropriate fashion all facts that
influence the disposition of the case. [Emphasis added; emphasis in
original deleted.]

(K. C. Davis,
Administrative Law Text (3rd ed. 1972), at p. 314, quoted in
R. J. Delisle, D. Stuart and D. M. Tanovich, Evidence:
Principles and Problems (9th ed. 2010), at p. 357.)

[161]                     
One decision that illustrates this principle is R.
v. Provost, 2006 NLCA 30, 256 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 205, in which the Court
of Appeal stressed that arguments about the prevalence of a crime in a
community must be dealt with in ways that are consistent with the principles of
procedural fairness:

                         In para. 15 of his sentencing
decision, the Provincial Court Judge wrote:

                        . . .
considering the number of trafficking offences that are coming before the
courts, it is obvious that conditional periods of imprisonment have failed to
have a deterrent effect. Those who are involved in significant criminal
enterprises must be made to understand that their criminal activity will not be
tolerated and that if caught and convicted, they will receive significant
periods of incarceration.

                        It is good
when judges are mindful of developments in their communities and of patterns of
offences that come before the courts. That being said, such considerations need
to be dealt with in ways that maintain procedural fairness; as well, they must
not be used so as to detract from proper application of recognized principles
of sentencing. [Emphasis added; paras. 13‑14.]

[162]                     
In the instant case, it is true that the
prosecution referred to the number of impaired driving cases in the region, and
defence counsel did not dispute that fact. With this in mind, I agree with my
colleague that the judge cannot be criticized for his comments on the situation
in his region, such as his reference at para. 72 to [translation] “this scourge” in his
district. However, I find that the opposite is true for his question: “Might it
be that driving in such a state is trivialized here more than elsewhere?”
(para. 72). Sentencing has high stakes both for the individual and for society.
For the respondent, as for many accused — the vast majority of whom plead
guilty, as Dickson J. noted in Gardiner — the sentence is the most
important decision the criminal justice system will have to make about them.
Although judges should not be denied an opportunity to obtain relevant
information by requiring compliance with all the evidential rules common to a
trial, “the obtaining and weighing of such evidence should be fair. A
substantial liberty interest of the offender is involved and the information
obtained should be accurate and reliable”: Gardiner, at p. 414. In
exercising their discretion in conducting the proceedings to choose the
information on which they will rely in order to impose a just sentence, judges
must bear in mind the importance of the facts in question and the impact on the
offender of how they are dealt with: Ruby, Chan and Hasan, at
pp. 100‑101, citing R. v. Alarie (1980), 28 C.R. (3d) 73
(Que. Ct. Sess. P.).

[163]                     
In my opinion, there is no indication that the
trial judge in the case at bar was in a position to take judicial notice of the
fact that impaired driving is trivialized in the Beauce region more than
elsewhere. In this regard, knowing the impact on sentencing of that factor,
which he considered to be aggravating, and the particular weight he was going
to attach to it in imposing a more severe sanction, he should, in the interest
of procedural fairness, have informed the respondent of his concerns on this
point and requested submissions from him. But he did not do so, even though the
importance he attached to that aggravating factor ultimately led him to impose
a sentence that favoured exemplarity at the expense of proportionality. 

(5)     
Just and Appropriate Sentence

[164]                     
In light of all the above, I agree with the
Court of Appeal that the trial judge overemphasized the objectives of
exemplarity and deterrence while at the same time overlooking the principles of
similarity of sentences and individualization in sentencing. Having regard to
the sentencing judge’s failure to consider a relevant and important mitigating
factor, namely the favourable presentence report, and to the excessive emphasis
he placed on aggravating factors that were not really aggravating factors, I
believe the Court of Appeal was justified in intervening and reopening the
analytical process in order to determine whether the sentence was just and
appropriate. With respect, these were not non‑determinative errors by the
trial judge, nor did they amount to a mere failure to properly weigh the
aggravating or mitigating factors he analyzed. In my opinion, it was open to
the Court of Appeal to find, on the contrary, that they were reviewable errors
that, viewed as a whole and given their determinative impact on sentencing
principles, warranted its intervention.

[165]                     
On the one hand, in the name of deterrence and
exemplarity, the trial judge focused on the perceived prevalence of the crime
in the community and disregarded the individual and contextual factors, which
led him to impose a sentence that was excessive in the respondent’s case. It
can be seen from his reasons that he placed emphasis on deterrence, to the
detriment of other penological objectives. At paras. 76‑86, he
discussed several decisions in which reference had been made to the primacy of
the deterrence factor. However, in most of those decisions, the courts had
discussed deterrence as a factor in addition to other serious aggravating
circumstances that existed in the cases before them, which does not reflect the
situation in the case at bar.

[166]                     
For example, in R. v. Junkert, 2010 ONCA
549, 103 O.R. (3d) 284, the Ontario Court of Appeal acknowledged that a five‑year
sentence for impaired driving causing death was at the high end of the
sentences that are normally imposed. However, it upheld the sentence in light
of a number of aggravating factors, including a very high blood alcohol level
and the reckless way the accused had been driving. In R. v. Ruizfuentes,
2010 MBCA 90, 258 Man. R. (2d) 220, the Manitoba Court of Appeal referred to
the trend toward higher sentences in recent years and stressed the importance
of denunciation and deterrence. It nevertheless intervened to reduce the
sentence despite the fact that there were a number of aggravating factors. In R.
v. Lépine, 2007 QCCA 70, the Quebec Court of Appeal considered the
particular circumstances of the accused and stated that [translation] “the judge based his
decision on well‑supported reasons that led him to conclude that a term
of imprisonment was necessary both for general deterrence and for specific
deterrence”: para. 17 (CanLII) (emphasis added). The sentence imposed
on each of the two counts of impaired driving causing death was three years’
imprisonment. Finally, in R. v. Brutus, 2009 QCCA 1382, while the Quebec
Court of Appeal stressed the importance of denunciation and deterrence in
impaired driving cases, it added that [translation]
“[t]he sentence imposed in this case is not unreasonable in light of [the
objective of deterrence], nor is it unreasonable in light of all the
circumstances of the case”: para. 18 (CanLII) (emphasis added). In
that case, the court found that there were several aggravating factors,
including a high blood alcohol level, the fact that the accused had been
driving with a suspended driver’s licence and the fact that she had done nothing
concrete to turn her situation around. 

[167]                     
On the other hand, the trial judge’s errors also
had another consequence: the violation of the principle that sentences should
be similar to other sentences imposed in similar circumstances, which is the
corollary of the principle of proportionality (see G. Renaud, Principes
de la détermination de la peine (2004), at p. 37). He determined the
sentence by referring, inter alia, to the two victims, to the
importance of the local situation in this case, to the importance of the
objectives of denunciation and deterrence, and to Paré, which he
distinguished. Although the trial judge referred to several decisions in his
reasons, he provided little if any explanation for the sentence of
78 months’ imprisonment that he ultimately imposed on the respondent,
despite the fact that the severity of that sentence is not in any doubt. In my
view, however, a review of the cases concerning offenders who committed similar
crimes in similar circumstances does not bring any comparable case to light in
which so severe a sentence was imposed. This being so, I am of the opinion that
it was open to the Court of Appeal to intervene to reassess the fitness of the
sentence. In this regard, although it would also have been preferable for the Court
of Appeal to provide a more thorough explanation, the 48‑month sentence
it imposed seems much more consistent with what can be seen in comparable
decisions. I will focus my analysis on some recent cases that, like the
respondent’s case, involved two counts of impaired driving causing death.

[168]                     
In R. v. Charles, 2011 BCCA 68, 10 M.V.R.
(6th) 177, aff’g 2009 BCSC 1391, the British Columbia Court of Appeal upheld a
sentence of three years’ imprisonment on two counts of impaired driving
causing death for a 21‑year‑old Aboriginal accused with no criminal
record. His alcohol consumption had been excessive and, although he did have
family support, he had displayed a lack of remorse.

[169]                     
In R. v. McIlwrick, 2008 ABQB 724, 461
A.R. 16, the accused was convicted of two counts of impaired driving causing
death and two counts of impaired driving causing bodily harm. He had been
smoking marijuana while driving to work and had had a high level of THC in his
blood, which had caused his impairment. He had a criminal record (assault, drug
possession, possession for the purpose of trafficking). Although he had
expressed remorse, the judge and the probation officer had concluded that he
had failed to take full responsibility for his actions. The accused had
nonetheless been co‑operative with the police, had support from his
family and required medical care. The judge sentenced him to 48 months’
imprisonment.

[170]                     
In R. v. Olsen, 2011 ABCA 308, 515 A.R.
76, the accused pleaded guilty to two counts of impaired driving causing death;
the victims were the parents of five children. He had been 22 years old at
the time of the offence; his blood alcohol level had been
226 mg/100 mL, and he had been driving in excess of the speed limit.
He had a lengthy record of driving offences, including in particular
16 convictions in the five years before the incident, some of them for
speeding. His licence had been suspended four times. He had no criminal
record, and he had expressed remorse in a letter written to the victims’
children and family. He had the support of his family and was employed. The
Alberta Court of Appeal sentenced him to 42 months’ imprisonment. 

[171]                     
In R. v. Pelletier, 2009 QCCQ 6277, the
accused pleaded guilty to two counts: one of having operated a vehicle while
his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol and having caused the deaths of
two persons as a result, and the second of having, in the same circumstances,
caused bodily harm to a third person. He had a criminal record with convictions
for attempting to commit an indictable offence and breaking and entering with
intent, and for drug possession, but none involving the operation of a motor
vehicle. After drinking for several hours [translation]
“while visiting friends and also at a bar, he drove his vehicle from place to
place and, finally, still behind the wheel of his vehicle, headed for a
convenience store to buy beer”: para. 22 (CanLII). His blood alcohol level
was 182 mg/100 mL, and he was driving at 120 km/h in a
90 km/h zone at the time of the accident. The victims were 15 and 16 years
old. He had been convicted of three speeding offences under the Quebec Highway
Safety Code, CQLR, c. C‑24.2, between 2004 and 2007. The
mitigating factors identified by the court included his age and the facts that
he had pleaded guilty, had expressed remorse to the probation officer, had
developed an awareness, had obtained a new job, had a support network, had been
given a favourable presentence report and had complied with his release
conditions. The court imposed a sentence of 42 months’ imprisonment.

[172]                     
In R. v. Nottebrock, 2014 ABQB 662, 15
Alta. L.R. (6th) 114, the accused was convicted of two counts of criminal
negligence causing death and two counts of impaired driving causing death. She
had had a blood alcohol level between 222 and 227 mg/100 mL and had
been driving at between 135 and 145 km/h in an 80 km/h zone when
she ran a red light without even braking. She was 28 years old at the time
of her sentencing. She was extremely remorseful and took responsibility for her
actions. The risk of her reoffending was low. The court sentenced her to
54 months’ imprisonment. 

[173]                     
By comparison, the cases of impaired driving
causing death in which sentences of between six and nine years have been
imposed have involved significant aggravating circumstances that are not
present in the case at bar, such as a criminal record for similar offences
(impaired driving or driving with a blood alcohol level over the limit), a
larger number of victims, driving with children in the vehicle, refusal to
listen to other people’s warnings, driving without a licence or while
disqualified from driving or prohibited from consuming alcohol, an extremely
high blood alcohol level, an untreated alcohol dependence, a risk of
reoffending, or a negative presentence report: see, for example, R. v.
Cooper, 2007 NSSC 115, 255 N.S.R. (2d) 18; R. v. Kummer, 2011 ONCA
39, 103 O.R. (3d) 641; R. v. Cote, 2007 SKPC 100, 300 Sask. R. 194; R.
v. York, 2015 ABCA 129, 78 M.V.R. (6th) 4; R. v. Gravel, 2013 QCCQ
10482; R. v. Comeau, 2008 QCCQ 4804, aff’d 2009 QCCA 1175; R. v. Côté, 2002 CanLII 27228 (C.Q.); R. v. Morneau, 2009 QCCA 1496; R. v.
Bois, 2005 CanLII 10575 (C.Q.).

[174]                     
In particular, the three cases on which my
colleague relies at para. 70 in support of his conclusion that a term of
imprisonment of six years or more is clearly not excessive all involved
circumstances very different from those of the respondent. In two of the three
cases, there were three victims rather than two; this is a factor that creates
a significant disparity in the sentences in question. In R. v. Wood
(2005), 196 C.C.C. (3d) 155 (Ont. C.A.), for example, the accused, who had a
long criminal record, had killed three people while driving on the wrong side
of the road and without a licence, and while severely intoxicated: his blood
alcohol level had been more than twice the legal limit. In Kummer, too,
the appellant had caused the deaths of three people and bodily harm to
two others, and his blood alcohol level had been more than twice the legal
limit. In Morneau, the third case cited, the accused had three prior
convictions for impaired driving, he had done nothing to obtain treatment for
his drinking problem, his blood alcohol level had been three times the legal
limit and, despite the fact that he had pleaded guilty, he had shown [translation] “great immaturity” and
recklessness: 2009 QCCQ 1271, at para. 15 (CanLII). With respect, I do not
consider these to be proper parallels to justify the sentence the Court of
Appeal found to be excessive in the respondent’s circumstances.

[175]                     
In my view, this analysis leads to two
observations. First, the Court of Appeal did not intervene lightly: by varying
the sentence imposed by the trial judge from 78 to 48 months, the court
reduced it by more than a third. This significant reduction supports the Court
of Appeal’s finding that the sentence was excessive. Second, the sentence
imposed by the Court of Appeal does not itself represent a substantial and
marked departure from the sentences imposed on similar offenders who committed
similar crimes in similar circumstances. On the contrary, it is entirely
consistent with the sentences imposed on offenders with characteristics similar
to those of the respondent. Insofar as the Court of Appeal correctly stated the
law before intervening, I am of the opinion that it is not open to this Court
to substitute its view for that of the Court of Appeal on the sentence. The
Court of Appeal considered the relevant sentencing principles and took the
specific features of the case into account. Although sentences imposed by
provincial appellate courts are not entitled to the same level of deference as
is accorded to sentences imposed by trial judges, they are nonetheless entitled
to deference, since those courts hear appeals against sentence more often than
this Court, which rarely hears them: R. v. R.N.S., 2000 SCC 7, [2000] 1
S.C.R. 149, at para. 23; Proulx, at para. 2. 

B.       Driving Prohibition

[176]                     
Turning to the issue of the driving prohibition,
I agree with my colleague that the Court of Appeal and the trial judge both erred
in failing to take into account the length of the presentence driving
prohibition. In their defence, the issue was not raised until the hearing in
this Court, at which the appellant in fact agreed that it was a relevant
consideration. 

[177]                     
In R. v. Bilodeau, 2013 QCCA 980, I
expressed the opinion that [translation]
“[a]lthough the length of the presentence driving prohibition need not be
subtracted in equal measure, it is nonetheless a factor to be considered in
analyzing the reasonableness and appropriateness of the prohibition to be
imposed under section 259(3.3) (b) Cr. C.”: para. 75
(CanLII). The Ontario Court of Appeal had already expressed a similar view in R.
v. Pellicore, [1997] O.J. No. 226 (QL), at para. 1. The same
reasoning also applies under s. 259(2) (a.1) Cr. C. In
the instant case, I therefore consider it appropriate to reduce the length of
the driving prohibition as my colleague suggests, that is, by the entire period
during which the respondent was subject to a prohibition as part of his release
conditions before being sentenced.

[178]                     
Having said this, I believe that the wording
chosen by the Court of Appeal in determining the length of the prohibition is
consistent with that used by Parliament in s. 259(2) (a.1) Cr. C.
I would retain that wording. My colleague refers either to a period “commencing
at the time of the respondent’s release” (para. 110) or to one “commencing
at the end of the respondent’s incarceration” (para. 121). However, the
“time of the offender’s release” or “the end of the offender’s incarceration”
could sometimes be confusing and could also differ from the “period to which
[an] offender [was] sentenced to imprisonment”, which is the one specifically
referred to in the relevant provisions of the Cr. C. In my opinion,
it would be more prudent to stick to the words chosen by Parliament, as the
Court of Appeal did in its judgment.

[179]                     
In this case, the Court of Appeal [translation] “[prohibited the
respondent] from operating any motor vehicle in Canada for a period of four
years, plus the period to which he [had been] sentenced to imprisonment”:
para. 24. If the length of the presentence driving prohibition (two years
and three months) is taken into account in recalculating the prohibition, the
result is instead a period of one year and nine months (four years minus
two years and three months). This is what I would retain for this aspect of the
sentence.

C.       Fresh Evidence

[180]                     
Finally, I am of the view that the Court of
Appeal did not make an error warranting the intervention of this Court when it
declined to admit the fresh evidence of the respondent’s two breaches of his
recognizances. Those breaches were a failure on his part to be at his residence
as required between 9:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. on November 26,
2011, and the fact that he contacted the brother of one of the victims despite
being prohibited from doing so: para. 19. 

[181]                     
The Court of Appeal held that the evidence in
question did not satisfy the fourth condition from Lévesque and Palmer
v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, since, in the court’s estimation, it was
unlikely to affect the result: para. 19. It was appropriate for the Court
of Appeal to distinguish the circumstances of this case from those of Bilodeau.
In that case, the appellant had been convicted of two counts of dangerous driving
causing death, and the fresh evidence concerned a breach of a recognizance
according to which he was not to operate a motor vehicle. As the Court of
Appeal stated in its analysis, that evidence was capable of shedding light on
the risk of his reoffending. The two breaches identified in the case at bar are
very different.

[182]                     
Of course, no breach of a recognizance should be
taken lightly. However, the breaches that the Court of Appeal had to consider
in this case were, all in all, relatively minor, especially when all the
relevant factors are taken into account. It was open to the Court of Appeal to
conclude that the additional evidence was irrelevant in this context. Absent an
error of law or a palpable and overriding error of fact warranting intervention,
this Court should not reconsider the weight attached by the Court of Appeal to
those breaches and substitute its view of what would have been relevant.

III.   
Disposition

[183]                     
For these reasons, I would allow the appeal for
the sole purpose of reducing the respondent’s driving prohibition to one year
and nine months, plus the period of four years to which he was sentenced
to imprisonment.

                    Criminal
law — Offences — Elements of offence — Cheating at play
— Fraud — Accused attempted to rig horse races
by drugging horses — Whether horse race constituted a game for purposes of offence of
cheating at play — Whether
accused’s conduct constituted cheating at play or fraud — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46,
ss. 197(1)  “game”, 209, 380(1).

                    R
tried to rig two horse races. He was caught drugging one horse and trying to
sneak syringes with drugs into the track for the purpose of doing the same
thing to another. Bets in excess of $5,000 had been placed on both races. R was
charged with cheating while playing a game, defrauding the public, and
attempting to commit the same offences. At trial, he was acquitted. The Court
of Appeal allowed an appeal and set aside the acquittals. It ordered a new
trial on the cheating counts and entered convictions on the fraud counts. 

                    Held:
The appeal should be dismissed.

                    The
Court of Appeal was correct to order a new trial on the charges of cheating
while playing a game. “Game” is defined as “a game of chance or mixed chance and
skill” in s. 197(1)  of the Criminal Code . The Crown had to
establish that a horse race is a game with a systematic resort to chance to
determine outcomes. There was evidence that post position is determined at
random and that certain post positions are more advantageous than others. The
trial judge failed to consider this evidence upon which a trier of fact could
find that there was systematic resort to chance which made the race a game of
mixed chance and skill. Whether the evidence actually establishes this will be
for the trier of fact at the new trial to determine.

                    Fraud
consists of dishonest conduct that results in at least a risk of deprivation to
the victim. Fraudulent conduct for the purposes of a fraud prosecution is not
limited to deception, such as misrepresentations of fact. Rather, fraud
requires proof of deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means. The term “other
fraudulent means” encompasses all other means which can properly be stigmatized
as dishonest. Where the alleged fraudulent act is not in the nature of deceit
or falsehood, the causal link between the dishonest conduct and the deprivation
may not depend on showing that the victim relied on or was induced to act by
the fraudulent act. R’s conduct constituted other fraudulent means because it can
properly be stigmatized as dishonest conduct that caused a risk of deprivation
to the betting public. There is a direct causal relationship between R’s
conduct and a risk of financial deprivation to the betting public. The trial
judge erred in law by finding that the betting public was not put at risk of
deprivation and that any risk of deprivation was too remote.

                    The
trial judge made the necessary findings of fact to support the fraud convictions
entered by the Court of Appeal, including in relation to both required aspects
of the required mens rea of fraud. The trial judge found that R knew
that his acts were dishonest and, in the context of the cheating while playing
a game charges, that he knew that his dishonest conduct put bettors at risk of
deprivation. That, after all, is what cheating is.

judgment of the Court was delivered by

                    Cromwell J. — 

I.             
Introduction

[1]                             
This appeal was heard and dismissed, with
reasons to follow, on October 13, 2015. These are the reasons. 

[2]                             
The appellant, Mr. Riesberry, tried to rig two
horse races by drugging two horses. The question at the bottom of this appeal
is whether the provisions of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 ,
under which he was charged can apply to this conduct. 

[3]                             
Mr. Riesberry was a licensed trainer of
Standardbred horses. He was caught on video drugging one horse, and caught
trying to sneak syringes with drugs into the track for the purpose of doing the
same thing to another.  For the drugging caught on tape, he was charged with
cheating while playing a game (a horse race) with the intent to defraud the
public wagering money on its outcome (s. 209  of the Criminal Code ) and
with defrauding the public of money wagered on the outcome of a horse race (s.
380(1) ).  For trying to sneak the drugs into the track, he was charged with
attempting to commit the same offences. At trial, he was acquitted. However,
the Ontario Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal, set aside the
acquittals on all four counts, ordered a new trial on the cheating and
attempted cheating counts (“cheating counts”) and entered convictions on the
fraud and attempted fraud counts (“fraud counts”): 2014 ONCA 744, 122 O.R. (3d)
594. 

[4]                             
Mr. Riesberry appeals the fraud convictions as
of right and the order for a new trial by leave of the Court. There are four
main issues before us, two concern the cheating counts and two the fraud
counts. 

[5]                             
With respect to the cheating counts, the main
questions are (i) whether the trial judge made a legal error in his interpretation
of what constitutes a “game”; and (ii) whether there was any evidence that
could establish that a horse race is a “game” as defined in s. 197  of the Criminal
Code  for these offences.  I agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial
judge erred in this respect and that there was evidence that could establish
that a horse race is a game as defined for these offences.

[6]                             
The two issues in relation to the fraud
convictions are (i) whether the Court of Appeal was wrong to reverse the trial
judge’s finding that the betting public was not put at risk by his conduct; and
(ii) whether, even if the trial judge made that error, the Court of Appeal was
wrong to have entered convictions rather than ordering a new trial. I also
agree with the Court of Appeal’s disposition of these issues.

II.          
Analysis

A.          
Brief Overview of the Facts

[7]                             
At trial, the judge found that, before a race,
Mr. Riesberry injected a horse, “Everyone’s Fantasy”, with epinephrine and/or clenbuterol
for the purpose of enhancing the horse’s performance in the race. The horse
participated in the race and finished sixth. The trial judge also found that,
on a later occasion, Mr. Riesberry tried to bring a syringe loaded with prohibited
drugs onto raceway property at which another horse, “Good Long Life”, was to
race later that day. Mr. Riesberry was arrested and the horse was scratched
from the race. The trial judge found that Mr. Riesberry, as a licensed trainer,
was bound by rules barring possession of syringes and use of the drugs in
question in order to enhance performance: Ontario Racing Commission, Rules
of Standardbred Racing, 2008, r. 10.01(a) and (b). The trial judge also
found that, in both instances, Mr. Riesberry had breached those rules and
attempted to create an unfair advantage for the horses in the race.
Nonetheless, the trial judge acquitted on all charges.

[8]                             
It was undisputed on appeal that bets in excess
of $5,000 had been placed on both races and that the trial judge erred in
saying otherwise: Court of Appeal reasons, at para. 18.

B.           
The Cheating at Play Convictions

[9]                             
With respect to the cheating while playing a
game charges, the trial judge concluded that a horse race is not a game as
defined in the Criminal Code  and therefore the charges were not made
out. The first issue is whether the trial judge erred in law in his legal
interpretation of what constitutes a “game” for the purposes of this offence.


[10]                         
The charges against Mr. Riesberry arise under s.
209  of the Criminal Code  which provides that everyone is guilty of an
offence who, “with intent to defraud any person, cheats while playing a game”.
“Game” is defined as “a game of chance or mixed chance and skill”: s. 197(1) .
It follows that the Crown had to establish that a horse race is a game with at
least some element of chance. The trial judge relied on the U.S. case of Harless
v. United States, 1 Morris 169 (Iowa 1843), to conclude that a horse race
is a game of pure skill. 

[11]                         
It is somewhat unclear to what extent the trial
judge relied on this authority as stating the law in Canada. However, to the
extent that he did so, he made a legal error. The statute considered by the
U.S. court divided games into only two categories, games of chance and games of
skill. That case, therefore, did not address a point that must be addressed
under the Criminal Code . That point is whether horse racing is a game of
mixed chance and skill. The applicable Canadian law on this point is
found in Ross, Banks and Dyson v. The Queen, [1968] S.C.R. 786. There
must be a “systematic resort to chance” to determine outcomes, not merely the
“unpredictables that may occasionally defeat skill”: p. 791.

[12]                         
Even if we were to accept that the trial judge
was alive to this difference between the law as set out in Harless and
Canadian law, he nonetheless erred by failing to consider evidence in the
record upon which a trier of fact could find that there was systematic resort
to chance which made the race a game of mixed chance and skill.  I therefore
conclude that the trial judge erred in law on this aspect of the case.  

[13]                         
The Court of Appeal’s finding of a legal error
at trial does not, on its own, justify setting aside the acquittals and
ordering a new trial. A new trial may be ordered only if the Crown satisfies
the appellate court that the “error (or errors) of the trial judge might
reasonably be thought, in the concrete reality of the case at hand, to have had
a material bearing on the acquittal”: R. v. Graveline, 2006 SCC 16, [2006]
1 S.C.R. 609, at para. 14, per Fish J. for the majority. Whether the Crown has
satisfied this burden is the second issue. The answer depends in this case on
whether there is in the trial record any evidence which could support a finding
that horse racing has a sufficient element of chance to be considered a game of
mixed chance and skill. Mr. Riesberry claims that there is not while the Crown
says that there is.

[14]                         
I agree with the Court of Appeal that the record
at trial contains evidence upon which horse racing, in the present
circumstances, could be found to involve a systematic resort to chance. There
was evidence that post position is determined by a computerized random post
position generator and that certain post positions are more advantageous than
others: Court of Appeal reasons, at para. 41. It follows that the Court of
Appeal was correct to order a new trial on these charges. Of course, whether
the evidence actually establishes this will be for the trier of fact at the new
trial to determine.

[15]                         
Like the Court of Appeal, I would not address on
appeal the Crown’s highly fact-driven alternative position that Mr. Riesberry’s
conduct converted what would otherwise be a game of pure skill into one of
mixed chance and skill.

[16]                         
To conclude on the cheating counts, the Court of
Appeal correctly ordered a new trial on these charges.

C.           
The Fraud Charges

[17]                         
Fraud consists of dishonest conduct that results
in at least a risk of deprivation to the victim. The trial judge found that the
Crown had failed to prove that the betting public was at risk of deprivation
due to Mr. Riesberry’s conduct. The trial judge also found that, even if the
Crown had proved deprivation, there was no proof of any causal connection
between Mr. Riesberry’s actions and any risk of loss of the money wagered by the
betting public. 

[18]                         
The Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal
from the acquittals. On the fraud charges, the court identified a number of
legal errors such that the acquittals had to be set aside. The court also
concluded that if the trial judge had not made these legal errors, he would
have convicted Mr. Riesberry of both fraud counts.

[19]                         
Mr. Riesberry submits first that his conduct did
not put the betting public at risk of deprivation and that any risk of
deprivation was too remote. His second submission is that, even if the trial
judge was wrong about this, the Court of Appeal should not have entered
convictions on the fraud charges, but ought instead to have ordered a new
trial. I will address these points in turn.

(1)          
Did Mr. Riesberry’s Fraudulent Acts Cause a Risk
of Deprivation That Was Not Too Remote?

[20]                         
Like virtually all offences, fraud consists of
two main components, the prohibited act (actus reus) and the required
state of mind (mens rea). Mr. Riesberry’s submission focuses on one of
the two aspects of the actus reus. Those two aspects are: 

1.  . . . an act
of deceit, a falsehood or some other fraudulent means; and

 

2.   deprivation
caused by the prohibited act, which may consist in actual loss or the placing of
the victim’s pecuniary interests at risk. 

 

(R. v.
Théroux, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 5, at p. 20; R. v. Zlatic, [1993] 2 S.C.R.
29, at p. 43)

[21]                         
The issue here concerns the aspect of
deprivation. Mr. Riesberry contends that there was no evidence that his
fraudulent conduct caused any risk of deprivation or that at least any such
risk was too remote from his conduct. He submits that the Crown did not
establish that anyone betting on the race had been induced to bet by, or would
not have bet but for, his fraudulent conduct. 

[22]                         
I cannot accept this position. Contrary to Mr.
Riesberry’s contention, proof of fraud does not always depend on showing that
the alleged victim relied on the fraudulent conduct or was induced
by it to act to his or her detriment. What is required in all cases is proof
that there is a sufficient causal connection between the fraudulent act and the
victim’s risk of deprivation. In some cases, this causal link may be
established by showing that the victim of the fraud acted to his or her
detriment as a result of relying on or being induced to act by the accused’s
fraudulent conduct. But this is not the only way the causal link may be
established. 

[23]                         
We should first be clear about what Mr.
Riesberry’s fraudulent conduct was before turning to the question of whether it
caused a risk of deprivation. Fraudulent conduct for the purposes of a fraud
prosecution is not limited to deception, such as deception by
misrepresentations of fact. Rather, fraud requires proof of “deceit, falsehood
or other fraudulent means”: s. 380(1). The term “other fraudulent means”
encompasses “all other means which can properly be stigmatized as dishonest”: R.
v. Olan, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1175, at p. 1180. The House of Lords made the same
point in Scott v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner, [1975] A.C. 819, a
case approved by the Court in Olan (p. 1181). Fraud, according to
Viscount Dilhorne in Scott, may consist of depriving “a person
dishonestly of something which is his or of something to which he is or would
or might but for the perpetration of the fraud be entitled”: p. 839.  And as
Lord Diplock said, the fraudulent means “need not involve fraudulent
misrepresentation such as is needed to constitute the civil tort of deceit”: ibid.,
at p. 841. 

[24]                         
It follows that where the alleged fraudulent act
is not in the nature of deceit or falsehood, such as a misrepresentation of
fact, the causal link between the dishonest conduct and the deprivation may not
depend on showing that the victim relied on or was induced to act by the
fraudulent act. This is such a case. 

[25]                         
Mr. Riesberry injected and attempted to inject the
racehorses with performance-enhancing substances. The use of such drugs is
prohibited and trainers such as Mr. Riesberry are prohibited even from
possessing loaded syringes at a racetrack. This conduct constituted “other
fraudulent means” because in the highly regulated setting in which he acted,
that conduct can “properly be stigmatized as dishonest”: Olan, at
p. 1180. He carried out these dishonest acts for the purpose of affecting the
outcome of two horse races on which members of the public placed bets.  His
dishonest acts, therefore, were intended to and in one case actually did result
in the possibility that a horse that might otherwise have won would not. The
conduct therefore caused a risk of deprivation to the betting public: it
created the risk of betting on a horse that, but for Mr. Riesberry’s dishonest
acts, might have won and led to a payout to the persons betting on that horse.
To return to Viscount Dilhorne’s words in Scott, Mr. Riesberry’s
dishonest conduct created a risk that bettors would be deprived dishonestly of
something which, but for the dishonest act, they might have obtained. 

[26]                         
There is a direct causal relationship between
Mr. Riesberry’s dishonest acts and the risk of financial deprivation to the
betting public. Simply put, a rigged race creates a risk of prejudice to the
economic interests of bettors. Provided that a causal link exists, the absence
of inducement or reliance is irrelevant. I agree with the Court of Appeal that
Mr. Riesberry’s reliance on Vézina and
Côté v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 2, is misplaced.
That case made it clear that 

[f]raud
consists of being dishonest for the purpose of obtaining an advantage and which
results in prejudice or a risk of prejudice to someone’s “property, money or
valuable security”. There is no need to target a victim . . . and the victim
may not be ascertained. [p. 19] 

[27]                         
This statement covers what Mr. Riesberry did.

[28]                         
I conclude that the trial judge erred in law by
finding that the betting public was not put at risk of deprivation by Mr.
Riesberry’s dishonest acts and that any risk of deprivation was too remote.

(2)          
Was the Court of Appeal Wrong to Enter Convictions
Rather Than Order a New Trial?

[29]                         
Mr. Riesberry submits that the Court of Appeal
erred by entering convictions because the trial judge had not made all of the
necessary findings of fact to support those convictions: see R. v. Cassidy,
[1989] 2 S.C.R. 345, at pp. 354-55. These submissions focus on what Mr.
Riesberry contends is the absence of the necessary findings of fact in relation
to the mental element or mens rea of fraud. 

[30]                         
The mental element of fraud consists of two
states of mind: 

1.     
subjective knowledge of the prohibited act; and

 

2.   subjective knowledge that the prohibited act could have as a consequence
the deprivation of another (which deprivation may consist in knowledge that the
victim’s pecuniary interests are put at risk).

 

(Théroux,
at p. 20; Zlatic, at p. 43)

[31]                         
Mr. Riesberry’s position is that the trial judge,
having dismissed the fraud charges on the basis of no proof of the actus
reus, did not go on to make findings in relation to these two aspects of
the required mens rea. However, I agree with the Court of Appeal that
the trial judge in fact did make the necessary findings. 

[32]                         
There can be no doubt that the trial judge found
that Mr. Riesberry knew that his acts were dishonest, which is the first aspect
of the mens rea. The trial judge found that his conduct was for the
purpose of enhancing his horses’ performances, not for any legitimate medical
purpose. As for the second aspect, the trial judge held, in his analysis of the
same record in the context of the cheating while playing a game charges, that
Mr. Riesberry’s conduct amounted to cheating. In other words, he intended to
create an unfair advantage for his horses in their races. This is a finding of
fact that Mr. Riesberry knew that his dishonest conduct put bettors at risk of
deprivation.  That, after all, is what cheating is.

(3)          
Conclusion

[33]                         
In my view, Mr. Riesberry’s submissions in
relation to the fraud charges cannot be accepted.

III.

[34]

the appeal, the appeal is dismissed.

Basis for excluding possibility of accident adequately explained by trial

from a judgment of the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal (Welsh, Barry
and Hoegg JJ.A.), 2013 NLCA 51, 339 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 248, 1054 A.P.R. 248,

                    Iain R. W. Hollett, for the respondent.

 

                    The
judgment of the Court was delivered orally by

 

[1]               Abella J. — The critical issue at trial was whether Mr. Vokurka
intentionally inflicted the victim’s injuries. The majority in the Court of
Appeal found that the trial judge’s findings of fact, inferences drawn from
those facts, and the finding of guilt were reasonable.  

 

[2]               The
dissenting judge was of the view that the trial judge erred in failing to
adequately consider and explain why, in her view, the “equally plausible
explanation” supporting the defence of accident was not accepted.  We do not
agree, and agree instead with the majority that the trial judge adequately
explained why he rejected the possibility of accident and found that the charge
was proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  The trial judge set out the evidence of
the victim’s statements, a doctor’s expert evidence about the nature of the
wound, and the victim’s reaction to being cut, all of which led him clearly to
the view that there was no “equally plausible explanation” for the
cutting. He reviewed the relevant evidence and set out his reasons for
concluding beyond a reasonable doubt that the injuries were intentionally
inflicted. His inferences were reasonably supported by the evidence. Like the
majority in the Court of Appeal, we see no error on his approach. It was not
open to the dissenting judge, with respect, to reweigh the evidence by
substituting her own view of it. The
appeal is therefore dismissed.

on appeal from the court
of appeal for nova scotia

                    Criminal
law — Offences — Sexual assault — Consent — Complainant consenting to sexual
activity with male partner unaware that he had sabotaged condom — Whether
evidence establishing that there was no voluntary agreement of the complainant
to engage in the sexual activity in question or whether complainant’s apparent
consent was vitiated by fraud — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46,
ss. 265(3) (c), 273.1(1) .

                    The
complainant agreed to sexual activity with her partner, H, insisting that he
use a condom in order to prevent conception.  Unknown to her, H had poked holes
in the condom and the complainant became pregnant.  H was charged with
aggravated sexual assault.  The trial judge found that the complainant had not
consented to unprotected sex and convicted H of sexual assault.  On appeal, the
majority upheld the conviction on the basis that condom protection was an
“essential feature” of the sexual activity, and therefore the complainant did
not consent to the “sexual activity in question”.  The dissenting judge held
that there was consent to the “sexual activity in question”, but that a new
trial was required to determine whether consent was vitiated by fraud.

                    Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.

                    Per McLachlin C.J. and Rothstein, Cromwell and Wagner JJ.:  The
Criminal Code  sets out a two-step process for analyzing consent to
sexual activity. The first step is to determine whether the evidence
establishes that there was no “voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage
in the sexual activity in question” under s. 273.1(1)  and it requires
proof that the complainant did not voluntarily agree to the touching, its
sexual nature, or the identity of the partner. If the complainant consented, or
her conduct raises a reasonable doubt about the lack of voluntary agreement to
the sexual activity in question, the second step is to consider under ss. 265(3) 
and 273.1(2)  whether there are any circumstances that may vitiate the
complainant’s ostensible consent or participation.  In this case, the main
issue is whether condom sabotage resulted in there being no “voluntary
agreement by the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question”
under s. 273.1(1)  or whether the condom sabotage constituted fraud
under s. 265(3) (c), with the result that no consent was obtained. Resolving
this issue requires the Court to determine the meaning of the “sexual activity
in question” in s. 273.1(1) .

                    There
are essentially two approaches to determining the meaning of what constitutes
voluntary agreement to the sexual activity in question and the role of mistake
or deception in determining whether such agreement existed.  The first approach
defines the “sexual activity in question” as extending beyond the basic sexual
activity the complainant thought she was consenting to at the time to
conditions and qualities of the act or risks and consequences flowing from it,
provided these conditions are “essential features” of the sexual activity or go
to “how” the physical touching was carried out.  The second approach defines
“the sexual activity in question” more narrowly as the basic physical act
agreed to at the time, its sexual nature, and the identity of the partner.  If
the complainant subjectively agreed to the partner’s touching and its sexual
nature, voluntary agreement is established under s. 273.1(1) .  That
voluntary agreement, however, may not be legally effective. 

                    The
primary tools of statutory construction including the plain words of the
provisions, the scheme of the provisions and the legislative history support a
narrow interpretation of the basic definition of consent in s. 273.1(1) . The
jurisprudence and the provisions also support this interpretation. This Court
has interpreted the fraud provision in s. 265(3) (c) of the Criminal
Code  in the context of HIV non‑disclosure cases: Cuerrier; Mabior. 
The adoption of the “essential features”/“how the act was carried out” approach
would be inconsistent with the approach adopted in Cuerrier and Mabior
and would put the outcome in those cases in question.  Under the “essential
features”/“how the act was carried out” approach, mistakes — they need not be
deceptions — about conditions and qualities of the physical act will result in
a finding of no consent under s. 273.1(1)  even in the absence of risk of
harm.  For example, there would be no consent found under s. 273.1(1)  in
cases involving deception about HIV status, even where the accused had a low
viral load and condom protection was used.  Finally, adopting the “essential
features” or “how the physical act was carried out” approach would re-introduce
a vague and unclear test for consent, and could also criminalize conduct that
lacks the necessary reprehensible character, casting the net of the criminal
law too broadly. 

                    Properly
interpreted, voluntary agreement to the sexual activity in question in s. 273.1(1) 
means that the complainant must subjectively agree to the specific physical
act itself, its sexual nature and the specific identity of the partner. The
“sexual activity in question” does not include conditions or qualities of the
physical act, such as birth control measures or the presence of sexually
transmitted diseases.  Here, the “sexual activity in question” was sexual
intercourse and the complainant voluntarily agreed to it.  On the question of
whether her agreement to the “sexual activity in question” was vitiated by
fraud, the dishonesty is evident and admitted.  The only remaining issue is
whether there was a sufficient deprivation to establish fraud.  Where a
complainant has chosen not to become pregnant, deceptions that expose her to an
increased risk of becoming pregnant may constitute a sufficiently serious
deprivation to vitiate consent under s. 265(3) (c).  This application
of “fraud” under s. 265(3) (c) is consistent with Charter
values of equality and autonomy, while recognizing that not every deception
that induces consent should be criminalized. In this case, there was no consent
by reason of fraud, pursuant to s. 265(3) (c).

                    Per Abella, Moldaver and Karakatsanis JJ.:  At its core, this case
concerns the right recognized in R. v. Ewanchuk, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 330,
to determine how sexual activity will take place.  Society’s commitment to
protecting a person’s autonomy and dignity requires that individuals have the
right to determine who touches their body, and how the touching
will occur.  This protection underlies the definition of consent set out in
s. 273.1(1)  as “the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in
the sexual activity in question”.  Consent to the “sexual activity in question”
necessarily means the complainant’s voluntary agreement both to engage in
touching of a sexual nature and to the manner in which that touching is carried
out.  The starting point for the analysis of consent under the actus reus
of sexual assault is s. 273.1(1) .  When a complainant does not voluntarily
agree to the sexual activity which occurred, consent does not exist within the
meaning of s. 273.1(1) , and the inquiry for the purposes of the actus
reus of sexual assault is complete.  If there is no consent ab
initio, it is pointless to inquire whether there was fraud under s. 265(3) (c)
which would have vitiated the complainant’s consent.  In other words, without
voluntary agreement as to the “how” — the manner in which the sexual activity
in question occurred — there is no consent within the meaning of s. 273.1(1) .


                    Unlike
under s. 265(3) (c), which requires both a dishonest act and
a deprivation, consent under s. 273.1(1)  has never
required an analysis of the risks or consequences caused by unwanted sexual
touching.  It is the unwanted nature of non-consensual sexual activity that
violates the complainant’s sexual integrity and gives rise to culpability under
the criminal law, not just the risk of further harm that the sexual touching
may create.  Requiring an analysis of the risks or consequences of non-consensual
touching by applying s. 265(3) (c) whenever deception is later
discovered, adds a barrier to the simple ability to demonstrate whether the
activity which occurred was agreed to when it occurred.  It thereby
undermines the values of personal autonomy and physical integrity sought to be
protected by making sexual assault an offence.

                    It
does not follow that because a condom is a form of birth control, it is not
also part of the sexual activity.  Removing the use of a condom from the meaning of sexual activity in
s. 273.1(1)  because the condom may have been intended for contraceptive
purposes, means that an individual has no right to
require the use of a condom during intercourse where pregnancy is not at
issue.  All individuals must have an equal right to determine how they are
touched, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, reproductive capacity, or
the type of sexual activity they choose to engage in.  By any definition, when
someone uses a condom, it is part of the sexual activity.  It is therefore part
of what is — or is not — consented to.  When individuals agree to sexual
activity with a condom, they mean an intact condom.  They are not merely
agreeing to a sexual activity, they are agreeing to how it should take
place.  That is what s. 273.1(1)  was intended to protect. 

                    A
person consents to how she will be touched, and she is entitled
to decide what sexual activity she agrees to engage in for whatever reason she
wishes. The fact that some of the consequences of her motives are more serious
than others, such as pregnancy, does not in the slightest undermine her right
to decide how the sexual activity she chooses to engage in is carried out.  It
is neither her partner’s business nor the state’s.  The complainant’s voluntary
agreement to the manner in which the sexual touching is carried out, requires
the complainant’s consent to where on her body she was touched and with what. 
It does not, however, require consent to the consequences of that touching, or
the characteristics of the sexual partner, such as age, wealth, marital status,
or health.  These consequences or characteristics, while undoubtedly
potentially significant, are not part of the actual physical activity that is
agreed to.  

                    In
this case, the question is not whether consent was vitiated by fraud.  It is
whether there was consent to the sexual activity in the first place.  The
complainant agreed to engage in sexual activity in a certain manner, that is,
sexual intercourse with an intact condom.  H deliberately sabotaged the condom
without her knowledge or agreement.  The fact that she only learned of the
deliberate sabotaging after the sexual activity took place, is of no
relevance.  What is relevant is what sexual activity she agreed to engage in
with H and whether he stuck to the bargain.  In this case, he did not.  Since
the complainant did not agree to how she was touched at the time it occurred, consent
within the meaning of s. 273.1(1)  did not exist.

I.             
Introduction

[1]                             
Control over the sexual
activity one engages in lies at the core of human dignity and autonomy: R. v. Ewanchuk, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 330, at
para. 28. This principle underlies the offences of assault and sexual assault.
Sexual activity without consent is a crime under the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 . 

[2]                             
In this case, the complainant consented to
sexual activity with a condom to prevent conception.  Unknown to her at the
time, her partner, Mr. Hutchinson,   poked holes in the condom and the
complainant became pregnant.  Mr. Hutchinson was charged with aggravated sexual
assault. The complainant said that she did not consent to unprotected sex. The
trial judge agreed and convicted Mr. Hutchinson of sexual assault (2011 NSSC
361, 311 N.S.R. (2d) 1).  The majority of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, per
MacDonald C.J.N.S., upheld the conviction on the basis that condom protection
was an essential feature of the sexual activity, and therefore the complainant
did not consent to the “sexual activity in question”.  Farrar J.A., dissenting,
held that there was consent to the sexual activity, but that a new trial was
required to determine whether consent was vitiated by fraud (2013 NSCA 1, 325
N.S.R. (2d) 95). 

[3]                             
The immediate problem is how cases such as this
fall to be resolved under the provisions of the Criminal Code .  This is
an issue of statutory interpretation.  Underlying this is a broader question —
where should the line between criminality and non-criminality be drawn when
consent is the result of deception? 

[4]                             
The Criminal Code  sets out a two-step process for analyzing consent to sexual
activity. The first step is to determine whether the evidence establishes that
there was no “voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual
activity in question” under s. 273.1(1) . If the complainant consented, or her
conduct raises a reasonable doubt about the lack of consent, the second step is
to consider whether there are any circumstances that may vitiate her apparent
consent. Section 265(3)  defines a series of conditions under which the law
deems an absence of consent, notwithstanding the complainant’s ostensible consent
or participation: Ewanchuk, at para. 36. Section 273.1(2)  also lists
conditions under which no consent is obtained. For example, no consent is
obtained in circumstances of coercion (s. 265(3) (a) and (b)),
fraud (s. 265(3) (c)), or abuse of trust or authority (ss. 265(3) (d)
and 273.1(2) (c)).  

[5]                             
We conclude that the
first step requires proof that the complainant did not voluntarily agree to the
touching, its sexual nature, or the identity of the partner.   Mistakes on the
complainant’s part (however caused) in relation to other matters, such as
whether the partner is using effective birth control or has a sexually
transmitted disease, are not relevant at this stage. However, mistakes
resulting from deceptions in relation to other matters may negate consent at
the second stage of the analysis, under the fraud provision in s. 265(3) (c)
of the Criminal Code .

[6]                             
Applying this template to the facts in this case
leads us to conclude that, at the first step, the complainant voluntarily
agreed to the sexual activity in question at the time that it occurred.  The
question is whether that consent was vitiated because she had been deceived as
to the condition of the condom.  This question is addressed at the second
step.  The accused’s condom sabotage constituted fraud within s. 265(3) (c),
with the result that no consent was obtained.  We would therefore affirm the
conviction and dismiss the appeal.

II.          
The Provisions of the Criminal Code 

[7]                             
Section 265(1)  of the Criminal Code  establishes
the general offence of assault:

                              265. (1) A person commits an assault when

 

                              (a) without the consent of
another person, he applies force intentionally to that other person, directly
or indirectly;

 

                              (b) he attempts or threatens,
by an act or a gesture, to apply force to another person, if he has, or causes
that other person to believe on reasonable grounds that he has, present ability
to effect his purpose; or

 

                              (c) while openly wearing or
carrying a weapon or an imitation thereof, he accosts or impedes another person
or begs.

[8]                             
Section 265(2) states
that this section applies to all forms of assault, including sexual assault. 

[9]                             
The offence of sexual assault is created by s.
271 :

                              271. Everyone who commits a sexual assault is guilty of

 

                              (a) an indictable offence and
is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years and, if the
complainant is under the age of 16 years, to a minimum punishment of
imprisonment for a term of one year; or

 

                              (b) an offence punishable on
summary conviction and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 18
months and, if the complainant is under the age of 16 years, to a minimum
punishment of imprisonment for a term of 90 days.

[10]                         
Section 273.1(1)  defines “consent” as follows:

                             273.1 (1)
Subject to subsection (2) and subsection 265(3) , “consent” means, for the
purposes of sections 271 , 272  and 273 , the voluntary agreement of the
complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question.

[11]                         
These provisions define
the basic offence of sexual assault.  They are supplemented by two additional
sets of provisions which give a non-exhaustive list of circumstances in which no
consent is obtained.  Section 265(3) , which applies to all assaults, lists four
such situations involving the accused’s abuse of authority and use of force,
fear and fraud:

                             265. . . . 

 

                             (3)  For the purposes of this section,
no consent is obtained where the complainant submits or does not resist by
reason of

 

                              (a) the application of force to
the complainant or to a person other than the complainant;

 

                              (b) threats or fear of the
application of force to the complainant or to a person other than the complainant;

 

                              (c) fraud; or

 

                              (d) the exercise of authority.

[12]                         
Section 273.1(2) lists
five non-exhaustive situations where no consent is obtained for purposes of the
sexual assault offences:

                             273.1 . . .


 

                             (2) No consent is obtained, for the
purposes of sections 271 , 272  and 273 , where

 

                              (a) the agreement is
expressed by the words or conduct of a person other than the complainant;

 

                              (b) the complainant is
incapable of consenting to the activity;

 

                              (c) the accused induces the
complainant to engage in the activity by abusing a position of trust, power or
authority;

 

                              (d) the complainant
expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to engage in the activity;
or

 

                              (e) the complainant, having
consented to engage in sexual activity, expresses, by words or conduct, a lack
of agreement to continue to engage in the activity.

[13]                         
Section 273.1(1) makes
the definition of “consent” for the purposes of sexual assault “[s]ubject to”
subsection (2) and to s. 265(3) . Thus, s. 273.1(1) does not replace the
circumstances of no consent in ss. 273.1(2)  and 265(3) . Fraud, for example,
continues to negate consent to sexual assault, pursuant to s. 265(3) (c).


III.       
Issue

[14]                         
The main issue here is
whether the Crown proved that the complainant did not consent to the sexual
touching by the appellant. Did the condom sabotage, as the majority of the
Court of Appeal held, result in there being no “voluntary agreement of the
complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question” under s. 273.1(1)  of
the Criminal Code ? Or should the condom sabotage be analyzed, as the
dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal concluded, under the fraud provision in
s. 265(3) (c) of the Criminal Code ?  

[15]                         
Resolving this issue
requires this Court to determine the meaning of the “sexual activity in
question” in s. 273.1(1) . 

[16]                         
The basic rule of statutory interpretation is that “the words of an Act are to be read in their
entire context, in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the
scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament”: R.
Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (5th ed. 2008), at
 p. 1. The task is to determine the intent of Parliament, insofar as this
can be done, by looking at the words used and the scheme and object of the
provision.  Every part of a provision or set of provisions should be given
meaning if possible:  Sullivan, at p. 210.

IV.       
Analysis

A.          
Sexual Autonomy and the Criminal Law: Overview

[17]                         
The sexual assault offences invoke the criminal law to protect sexual autonomy. The Criminal
Code  and jurisprudence establish a high level of protection of the right to
choose whether to engage in sexual activity and with whom.  The absence of
consent to sexual activity, as part of the actus reus of the offence, is
judged subjectively from the complainant’s point of view: Ewanchuk, at
paras. 25-26. Consent cannot be implied, must coincide with the sexual
activity, and may be withdrawn at any time.  Additionally, no consent is
obtained if the apparent agreement to the sexual activity is obtained by
coercion, fraud or abuse of authority.  (We note that this is a case of
apparent agreement — the complainant subjectively agreed at the time sexual
intercourse occurred.  This is not a case where there was no such
agreement.  The question is whether, in spite of that agreement, no consent was
obtained in law because that agreement was obtained as a result of Mr.
Hutchinson’s deceit about the condition of the condom.)  Individually and
collectively, these features of sexual assault law protect Canadians’ sexual
autonomy. 

[18]                         
But the law has long recognized that there are
limits on how completely it may fulfil that objective through the blunt
instrument of the criminal law. As the most serious interference by the state
with peoples’ lives and liberties, the criminal law should be used with appropriate
restraint, to avoid over-criminalization.  It draws a line between conduct
deserving the harsh sanction of the criminal law, and conduct that is
undesirable or unethical but “lacks the reprehensible character of criminal
acts”: R. v. Cuerrier, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 371, at para. 133; A. Wertheimer,
Consent to Sexual Relations (2003).  The companion of restraint is certainty. 
The criminal law must provide fair notice of what is prohibited and clear
standards for enforcement: R. v. Mabior, 2012 SCC 47, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 584, at paras. 14 and 19. 

[19]                         
The need for restraint and certainty, which
sometimes work at cross-purposes to absolute protection of sexual autonomy, has
influenced the law’s approach to consent, particularly where consent has been
obtained by deception.

B.           
Interpreting the Provisions: Two Approaches 

[20]                         
There are essentially
two approaches to the question of what constitutes “voluntary agreement . . .
to . . . the sexual activity in question” and the role of mistake or deception
in determining whether such agreement existed.

[21]                         
The first approach,
which has many variants, defines the “sexual activity in question” as extending
beyond the basic sexual activity the complainant thought she was consenting to
at the time to conditions and qualities of the act or risks and consequences
flowing from it, provided these conditions are “essential features” of the
sexual activity (reasons of the majority of the Court of Appeal, at paras. 71
and 81) or go to “how” the physical touching was carried out (reasons of Abella
and Moldaver JJ.).  Under this approach, whether a complainant’s mistake
prevents voluntary agreement to the sexual activity under s. 273.1(1)  depends
on the nature of the mistake. The difficulty with this approach, as we shall
see, is that it provides no clear line between mistakes that result in no
consent under s. 273.1(1) , and mistakes that do not.  The result of this lack
of clarity may be inappropriate criminalization and uncertainty in the law. 

[22]                         
The second approach
defines the “sexual activity in question” more narrowly as the basic physical
act agreed to at the time, its sexual nature, and the identity of the partner. 
If the complainant subjectively agreed to the partner’s touching and its sexual
nature, voluntary agreement is established under s. 273.1(1)  of the Criminal
Code .  That voluntary agreement, however, may not be legally effective. The
Code also sets out a number of situations in which, notwithstanding
apparent agreement, no consent is obtained. In particular, deceptions may
negate consent if they meet the requirements for fraud under s. 265(3) (c).


[23]                         
The choice between these
approaches is a matter of statutory construction.  Which approach is correct
depends on (1) the wording, scheme and object of the provisions of the Criminal
Code ; (2) the jurisprudence on the provisions and their common law
predecessors; and (3) the underlying objectives of the criminal law.  We will
consider each of these in turn.

(1) The Wording,
Scheme and Object of the Legislation and the Scheme of the Provisions

[24]                         
The plain words of the provisions, read in their ordinary and natural sense, support a narrow
interpretation of the basic definition of “consent” in s.  273.1(1) . The
ordinary meaning of the “sexual activity in question” is the physical act
agreed to; there is nothing in the wording to suggest that it includes the
conditions or qualifications of the sexual act.   

[25]                         
The scheme of the provisions — a basic
definition of “consent” in s. 273.1(1) , coupled with circumstances vitiating
such agreement in s. 265(3)  and s. 273.1(2)  — also supports a narrow
interpretation of “voluntary agreement . . . to . . . the sexual activity in
question”.  

[26]                         
The “essential features”
approach of the Court of Appeal and the “how the physical act is carried out”
approach of Abella and Moldaver JJ. do not conform to this two-part scheme. The
fraud provision in s. 265(3) (c) deals with situations where consent to
the sexual activity has been given because of a deception by the accused. But
under these approaches, all deceptions about “essential features” of the sexual
activity or about “how” the sexual activity was carried out would result in a
finding of no consent to the “sexual activity in question” under s. 273.1(1) .
Many deceptions would be dealt with at the first step under s. 273.1(1) , rather
than where the scheme of the Criminal Code  suggests they should be dealt
with, under s. 265(3) (c). Section 273.1(1)  would do most of the work
that the fraud provision was intended to do, rendering the fraud provision in
s. 265(3) (c) redundant in many cases, contrary to the principle that
every word and provision in a statute has a meaning and a function.

[27]                         
Finally, the object of
s. 273.1, as revealed by its legislative history, does not support a broad
reading of the “sexual activity in question”.  The definition of “consent” in
s. 273.1 was part of a parcel of amendments added to the Criminal Code 
in 1992, intended to address Parliament’s concerns about sexual violence
against women and children and to promote and ensure the full protection of s.
7  and s. 15  Charter  rights (see the preamble to Bill C-49, containing
the 1992 Criminal Code  amendments, S.C. 1992, c. 38). The centerpiece of
the revisions was a new provision narrowing the defence of honest belief of
consent. An accused who chooses to rely on the defence of honest belief of
consent is required to take reasonable steps to ascertain that the complainant
was consenting. Parliament’s intention was to “overcome the apparent
unwillingness by some to let go of the debunked notion that unless a
complainant physically resisted or expressed verbal opposition to sexual
activity, an accused was entitled to assume that consent existed”: R. v.
Ewanchuk, 1998 ABCA 52, 57 Alta. L.R. (3d) 235, at para. 58.  Section 273.1
therefore signalled that the focus should be on whether the complainant
positively affirmed her consent to the “sexual activity in question”.  There
was no suggestion that Parliament intended to expand the notion of “sexual
activity” by including not only the sexual act for which consent is required,
but also potentially infinite collateral conditions, such as the state of the condom.

[28]                         
In summary, the primary
tools of statutory construction all point to a rejection of the broad
interpretation of the “sexual activity in question” under the “essential
features”/“how the act was carried out” approach. 

          (2) The Jurisprudence

[29]                         
This Court has
interpreted the fraud provision in s. 265(3) (c) of the Criminal Code 
in the context of HIV non-disclosure cases: Cuerrier; Mabior. In
our view, adoption of the “essential features”/“how the act was carried out”
approach would put the outcomes in those cases in question and replace the
clarity and restraint achieved by those decisions with confusion and
over-criminalization. 

[30]                         
Initially, the common
law of fraud in sexual relations focussed on the nature of the deceit and asked
whether it went to certain “essential” characteristics of the act. If the
deception went to the sexual nature of the act or the identity of the partner,
it was said to vitiate consent: R. v. Clarence (1888), 22 Q.B.D. 23 (Cr.
Cas. Res.).  This test was incorporated into Canada’s first Criminal Code  in
1892 (S.C. 1892, c. 29). Parliament restricted deceptions vitiating consent to
“false and fraudulent representations as to the nature and quality of the act”
(ss. 259(b) and 266).  The formulation, however, did little to bring
certainty or rationality to the law of consent to sexual activity.  The problem
was where and how to draw the line between those aspects of the sexual activity
that went to the “nature and quality of the act” and those that did not: A.
Hooper, “Fraud in Assault and Rape” (1968), 3 U.B.C. L. Rev. 117, at p.
121.  Simply put, the “nature and quality of the act” did not show courts where
to draw the line — or even help them to do so —  between deceptions that did
and did not vitiate consent.

[31]                         
In view of this unsatisfactory state of affairs,
the Criminal Code  in relation to sexual offences was overhauled in 1983.
In 1983, the language of the “nature and quality of the act” was dropped and
the language of the present s. 265(3) (c) was adopted so that “no consent
is obtained where the complainant submits or does not resist by reason of . . .
fraud” — without any specification of the nature of the deception (S.C.
1980-81-82-83, c. 125, s. 19).

[32]                         
While for a time
Canadian courts continued to apply a restrictive interpretation of fraud,
influenced by the earlier jurisprudence concerning the “false and fraudulent
representations as to the nature and quality of the act”, the law of fraud in
relation to sexual assault, as we shall see, had a new beginning in Canadian
law with the Court’s judgment in Cuerrier. 

[33]                         
Three aspects of Cuerrier are
particularly important. First, the majority held that the concept of fraud in
the new s. 265(3) (c) was not restricted to deceptions as to the nature
and quality of the act: para. 108. The former jurisprudence was rejected as
being too restrictive, but at the same time, the majority recognized that some
limitations on the concept of fraud are clearly necessary: para. 135.  

[34]                         
Second, the majority
introduced an analysis of fraud that required two elements to be present before
consent was vitiated by fraud: deceit and injury or, expressed differently,
dishonesty and deprivation or risk of deprivation: Cuerrier, at paras.
110-16. With only two narrow exceptions that we will discuss shortly, consent
will be vitiated by fraud only when consent is obtained by lies or
deliberate failure to disclose coupled with a significant risk of
serious bodily harm as a result of the sexual touching:  paras. 125-39. As Cory
J. wrote for the majority, at para. 135: 

The existence of fraud should not
vitiate consent unless there is a significant risk of serious harm.  Fraud
which leads to consent to a sexual act but which does not have that significant
risk might ground a civil action. However, it should not provide the foundation
for a conviction for sexual assault.  The fraud required to vitiate consent
for that offence must carry with it the risk of serious harm. [Emphasis
added.]

[35]                         
Third, the majority
accepted that the traditional notion of fraud in relation to the nature and
quality of the act and the identity of the partner would continue to vitiate
consent: Cuerrier, at para. 118. We understand this to mean that
deceptions in relation to the sexual nature of the act and the identity of the
partner (narrowly defined) vitiate consent without proof that the sexual
activity gave rise to the risk of serious bodily harm.

[36]                         
The basic architecture of this approach was very
recently approved by the Court in Mabior. The Court said: 

. . . the
Cuerrier approach is in principle valid.  It carves out an
appropriate area for the criminal law — one restricted to “significant risk of
serious bodily harm”.  It reflects the Charter  values of autonomy,
liberty and equality, and the evolution of the common law, appropriately
excluding the Clarence line of authority.  The test’s approach to
consent accepts the wisdom of the common law that not every deception that
leads to sexual intercourse should be criminalized, while still according
consent meaningful scope. [Emphasis added; para. 58.]

[37]                         
The Court in Mabior explained how the Cuerrier
test applies to deceptions about HIV status. The Court concluded that HIV
non-disclosure will not vitiate consent under s. 265(3) (c) if (1) the
accused’s viral load at the time of sexual relations was low; and (2) condom
protection was used. Notably, voluntary agreement to the sexual activity, under
s. 273.1(1)  was not in issue; the case proceeded on the basis that there had
been subjective consent to the sexual touching at the time it had occurred and
the only issue was whether fraud vitiated consent under s. 265(3) (c). 

[38]                         
An approach that asks
whether the deception went to an “essential feature” of the act or “how the
sexual act was carried out” is inconsistent with the Court’s approach in Cuerrier
and Mabior.  Consider two hypotheticals.  In the first, the accused lies
about the fact that the condom has holes in it so that the complainant who
insists that he uses a condom will consent to the sexual activity.  In the
second, the accused lies about his HIV status so that the complainant will
consent to have sex without a condom.  From a legal perspective, what is the
difference between, on one hand, deceiving the complainant about the condition
of the condom and creating a risk of pregnancy, and on the other hand,
deceiving the complainant about HIV status so that she will agree to
unprotected sex?  Since Cuerrier, it is clear that the latter situation
must be analyzed under the fraud provision in s. 265(3) (c) of the Criminal
Code .  Why then not the former? Consistency and certainty in the law
require that both situations be treated the same. 

[39]                         
Both the Court of Appeal majority’s approach and
the approach proposed by Abella and Moldaver JJ. are also fundamentally at odds
with the holdings in Cuerrier and Mabior that apparent consent is
vitiated by fraud only where there is both deception and deprivation. Under the
Court of Appeal’s approach and that of our colleagues, mistakes — they need not
be deceptions — about conditions and qualities of the physical act will result
in a finding of no consent under s. 273.1(1)  even in the absence of harm or
risk of harm. This is contrary to the fundamental point made in Cuerrier
and affirmed in Mabior: “The fraud required to vitiate consent for that
offence must carry with it the risk of serious harm” (Cuerrier, at
para. 135).

[40]                         
These inconsistencies
are not merely semantic — they may affect outcomes under the “essential
features”/“how the act was carried out” approach. HIV status may well be an
“essential feature” of the sexual activity under the Court of Appeal majority’s
approach. It could also be characterized as part of the “how” under Abella and
Moldaver JJ.’s approach. If the use of an intact condom goes to the manner in
which the sexual activity occurred, why not the exchange of diseased fluids?
Thus, under these approaches, deceptions about HIV status could result in a
finding of no consent under s. 273.1(1) , even where the accused had a
low viral load at the relevant time and condom protection was used. That
conclusion, however, would be in direct conflict with Cuerrier and Mabior.


[41]                         
In short, adopting the “essential features”/“how
the act was carried out” approaches would make the law inconsistent, highly
formalistic and unduly uncertain.  The law would be
inconsistent because there is no reason in principle to analyze a case of a lie
that obtains consent to unprotected sex and a lie as to the condition of a
condom differently.  It is highly formalistic because an error with respect to
any essential feature or “physical” element, presumably including whether a
condom is of a certain make or design, would vitiate consent while lies on
matters relating to the physical safety of the complainant would not, absent an
actual risk or harm.  It is uncertain because, as we shall see, it is difficult
to tell which matters form part of the “essential features” or the “how” and
which do not. 

(3)        Underlying Objectives of the Criminal Law: Restraint
and Certainty

[42]                         
Our jurisprudence has
consistently confirmed that in interpreting criminal law provisions, the twin
watchwords of restraint and clarity must inform the inquiry.  In Cuerrier
and Mabior, this Court narrowly limited the sorts of deceptions that
vitiate consent in order to create certainty in the law and limit criminal
liability to serious, reprehensible conduct. The Court held that deceptions
with respect to anything other than the sexual nature of the act or the
identity of the partner will only vitiate consent if there is dishonesty which
gives rise to a risk of physical harm, beyond the injury inherent in being lied
to in order to induce consent. This jurisprudence provides a clear line between
criminal and non-criminal conduct and avoids over-criminalization. Adopting the
“essential features” or “how the physical act was carried out” approach would
undercut the important objectives achieved by the Court’s jurisprudence.  These
approaches re-introduce a vague and unclear test for consent and broaden the
scope for criminalization, including for HIV non-disclosure, thus effectively
reversing this Court’s efforts to restrain and clarify the scope of
criminalization in those circumstances in Cuerrier and Mabior.


[43]                         
The Court of Appeal
majority’s “essential features” approach is inherently uncertain and prone to
over-criminalization.  Historically, such approaches have proven unworkable
because they are incapable of producing a sufficiently clear or restrained
standard for the purposes of defining the scope of criminal liability. 

[44]                         
The majority of the
Court of Appeal held that the “essential features” of the sexual activity are
determined by the complainant’s subjective conditions for consent to that
activity. There need be no deception or dishonesty on the part of the partner. 
It follows that the “essential features” of the sexual activity vary from
person to person. It would therefore be impossible to predict what a particular
person considers “essential”. It is also unclear how “essential” the feature
must be to the complainant. The majority of the Court of Appeal also held that
not all conditions for consent will be considered “essential features” of the
sexual activity; they drew the line between characteristics that merely affect
motive to engage in the sexual activity and characteristics that are
“components” of the sexual activity. But this line is blurry. We are told that
the use of an effective condom is a “component” of the sexual activity, not
part of the motive to engage in the sexual activity. Yet the elimination of the
risk of pregnancy may well be a motivation for agreeing to the sexual act.
Indeed, on the complainant’s evidence in this case, she would not have
consented to sex without a condom. 

[45]                         
Justices Abella and
Moldaver introduce a variation on this approach but one which, as we see it, is
equally uncertain. Under their approach, the “sexual activity in question”
extends to “how” the sexual touching occurs, but not to the consequences of the
sexual activity. But it is not clear what the “how” of the act includes, or
whether agreement is undermined by only deception or also by a complainant’s
unilateral mistake. Presumably, it extends to any physical aspect of the sexual
activity to which the complainant has not agreed in advance — a vast swath of
conduct indeed. And again, the line is blurry; many aspects of the sexual
activity can be characterized as both part of the “how” and part of the
consequences. This case provides an example. Abella and Moldaver JJ. hold that
a sabotaged condom is part of “how” the sexual touching occurred, but
sabotaging a condom also amounts to a deception about the potential
consequences of the physical act — namely, pregnancy. 

[46]                         
These approaches would
also result in the criminalization of acts that should not attract the heavy
hand of the criminal law. We have already noted the difficulty of seeing why
the presence of a sexually transmitted infection would not be a “component” of
the sexual activity or part of “how” the sexual touching occurs. Under the
Court of Appeal majority’s “essential features” test, a man who pierces a
condom may be found guilty of sexual assault; why would a woman who lies about
birth control measures not be equally guilty? Under Abella and Moldaver JJ.’s
test, the quality or effectiveness of a condom changes the sexual
activity that takes place; why would it not follow that an individual might be
prosecuted for using an expired condom or a particular brand of condom? 
Anomalies abound.  The “how the physical act was carried out” test appears not
to capture a woman who lies about taking birth control pills, but it might well
capture a woman who lies about using a diaphragm.  

[47]                         
Conversely, the “how the act was carried out”
approach would not capture conduct that is as equally reprehensible as Mr.
Hutchinson’s actions, like substituting a partner’s birth control pills with
sugar pills.  We do not see any principled basis for criminalizing the act of
sabotaging condoms, but not the act of sabotaging birth control pills.

[48]                         
This difficulty is
apparent on the facts of this case. The trial judge found that the complainant
did not voluntarily agree to sexual intercourse without contraception and that
Mr. Hutchinson knew this:  paras. 44 and 47. What was critical to her consent
was contraception and what she sought to mitigate was the risk of pregnancy. 
Yet on the approach adopted by our colleagues, her lack of voluntary agreement
would result from the use of sabotaged condoms, but not from a lie by Mr.
Hutchinson to the effect that he was sterile. These different results on the
issue of voluntary agreement respectfully lack rational justification in a case
such as this one in which the whole concern of the complainant was pregnancy —
a risked consequence of the sexual activity. Her consent did not turn on the
“how” of the sexual act, but on whether the risk of pregnancy was mitigated to
a degree which she thought sufficient.

[49]                         
Ultimately, these
approaches lead to empty semantic arguments incapable of furnishing a
principled and clear line between criminal and non-criminal conduct. This
conclusion is reinforced by the experience of other jurisdictions. 

[50]                         
We earlier referred to
the difficulties of line drawing inherent in the “nature and quality of the
act” test in Clarence and the Canadian Criminal Code until its
revision in 1983.  Courts experienced great difficulty in formulating
principled reasons for why a certain deception did or did not relate to the
nature and quality of the act and there was no principled basis upon which to
confine the test to serious deceptions meriting the ultimate force of the
criminal law:  see, e.g., Hooper; Cuerrier.  

[51]                         
A further example is the
distinction made in U.S. criminal and tort law between deceptions going to the
fact (“fraud in the factum”) which vitiate consent for the purposes of rape and
battery and other deceptions that act as inducements (“fraud in the
inducement”) which do not. As expressed by one leading text, the rule is that
“if the deception relates not to the thing done but merely to some collateral
matter” the consent is valid:  R. M. Perkins and R. N. Boyce, Criminal Law (3rd
ed. 1982), at p. 1079.  No matter how beguiling it appears at first, the
distinction has proved unworkable. It is not helpful in differentiating between
legally effective and ineffective consent and where it attempts to draw the
line has no basis in principle: see, e.g., P. J. Falk, “Rape by Fraud and Rape
by Coercion” (1998), 64 Brook. L. Rev. 39, at pp. 159-61; D. A. Fischer,
“Fraudulently Induced Consent to Intentional Torts” (1977), 46 U. Cin. L.
Rev. 71, at pp. 79, 87 and 98. As Peter Westen put it, “The
interchangeability of [fraud in the factum and fraud in the inducement] enables
courts and commentators to conceptualize any fraud that they regard as
sufficient to invalidate acquiescence as a fraud in the factum”: The Logic
of Consent (2004), at p. 198 (emphasis in original); see also, E. W.
Puttkammer, “Consent in Rape” (1924-1925), 19 Ill. L. Rev. 410, at p.
423; Wertheimer, at p. 206; J. Feinberg, “Victims’ Excuses: The Case of
Fraudulently Procured Consent” (1986), 96 Ethics 330.

[52]                         
What these lines of
authority have in common is that they, like the “essential features” or “how
the physical act is carried out” approach, attempt to draw a line between
deceptions that do and do not vitiate consent by adjectivally categorizing the
subject matter of the deception. Deceptions described as going to the “nature
and quality of the act” or the “fact” (as opposed to the “inducement”) vitiate
consent, while other types of deceptions do not.  But the attempted distinction
has proven to be too unclear, too easily manipulated, and too unconnected with
underlying policy rationales to provide a useful marker of liability.  

[53]                         
The lesson is clear.  Broad adjectival
approaches to the “sexual activity in question” produce not only uncertainty,
but also may criminalize conduct that lacks the necessary reprehensible
character, casting the net of the criminal law too broadly. There is no reason
to expect that attempting to categorize deceptions as to whether they go to the
“essential features” of the act or to “how the physical act is carried out”
will fare any better that did other adjectival approaches in the past.

C.           
The Correct Approach

[54]                         
We conclude that Farrar
J.A. was correct to interpret the “sexual activity in question” in s. 273.1(1) 
to refer simply to the physical sex act itself (for example, kissing, petting,
oral sex, intercourse, or the use of sex toys). The complainant must agree to
the specific physical sex act. For example, as our colleagues correctly
note, agreement to one form of penetration is not agreement to any or all forms
of penetration and agreement to sexual touching on one part of the body is not
agreement to all sexual touching.  

[55]                         
The “sexual activity in question” does not
include conditions or qualities of the physical act, such as birth control
measures or the presence of sexually transmitted diseases. Thus, at the first
stage of the consent analysis, the Crown must prove a lack of subjective
voluntary agreement to the specific physical sex act. Deceptions about
conditions or qualities of the physical act may vitiate consent under s.
265(3) (c) of the Criminal Code , if the elements for fraud are
met. 

[56]                         
This approach fits within the ordinary meaning of s. 273.1(1)  and the scheme of the Code,
and it does not pose problems of uncertainty, over-criminalization, or
inconsistency with Cuerrier and Mabior. 

[57]                         
In our view, “voluntary agreement . . . to . . . the
sexual activity in question” also encompasses both the sexual nature of the
activity (i.e., that the act was sexual in nature as opposed to being for a
different purpose, such as a medical examination) and the identity of the
partner (defined in the narrow sense of the specific identity of a partner who
is personally known to the complainant). While identity and the sexual nature
of the act were troublesome issues for the early cases, and while Cuerrier,
in obiter, suggests that they might be considered at the second stage of
the consent analysis under s. 265(3) (c), the better view is that
“voluntary agreement . . . to . . . the sexual activity in question” will not
exist under s. 273.1(1)  if the complainant did not subjectively agree to the
sexual nature of the act or the specific identity of the partner. As a result,
a complainant’s mistaken belief about the identity of the partner or the sexual
nature of the act — whether or not that mistake is the result of a deception —
will result in no consent under s. 273.1(1)  of the Criminal Code . 

[58]                         
The sexual nature of the act is
expressly included by the reference in s. 273.1(1)  to the “sexual
activity in question”. If one voluntarily agrees to a non-sexual activity (for
example, a medical examination), one is not voluntarily agreeing to a sexual
activity.  Similarly, in our view, the identity of the partner, in the narrow
sense, should be included in the “sexual activity in question” under s.
273.1(1) ; if a complainant agrees to sexual activity with A, who is a specific
individual known personally to her, she is not agreeing to sexual activity with
B.  

[59]                         
A number of early cases support this interpretation. For example, in R.
v. Flattery (1877), 2 Q.B.D. 410 (Cr. Cas. Res.), the court upheld a
conviction of rape where a man obtained sex from a girl on the pretext of
medical treatment. The court noted that the case was not a case where a man
induced consent to sex through fraud; rather, the victim consented to a surgical
operation — not to a sexual act. Thus, there was no consent to any sexual
activity. 

[60]                         
Similarly, R. v. Dee (1884), 14 L.R. Ir. 468 (Cr. Cas. Res.), the
court upheld a conviction of rape where a man pretended to be the victim’s
husband. May C.J. stated that “[t]he act she permitted cannot properly be
regarded as the real act which took place; therefore, the connexion was done,
in my opinion, without her consent, and the crime of rape was constituted” (p.
479). 

[61]                         
In Dee, Palles C.B. stated:

. . . an act done under the bona
fide belief that it is another act different in its essence is not
in law the act of the party. That is the present case — a case which it is
hardly necessary to point out is not that of consent in fact sought to be
avoided for fraud, but one in which that which took place never amounted to
consent. The person by whom the act was to be performed was part of its
essence. The consent of the intellect, the only consent known to the law, was
to the act of the husband only . . . . [Emphasis in original; p. 488.]

[62]                         
In Clarence, Stephen J. acknowledged that there is abundant
authority for the idea that frauds about identity or the sexual nature of the
act vitiate consent. However, he commented:

I should myself prefer to say that
consent in such cases does not exist at all, because the act consented to is
not the act done. Consent to a surgical operation or examination is not a
consent to sexual connection or indecent behaviour. Consent to connection with
a husband is not consent to adultery. [p. 44]

[63]                         
More recently, the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. G.C., 2010 ONCA 451, 266 O.A.C.
299, leave to appeal refused, [2010] 3 S.C.R. v, adopted this approach
and held that the complainant’s belief that the partner was her boyfriend when
it was in fact his identical twin resulted in no consent to the “sexual
activity in question” under s. 273.1  of the Criminal Code . (See also R.
v. O.A., 2013 ONCA 581, 310 O.A.C. 305.)

V.          
Application

[64]                         
The first question is
whether the complainant voluntarily agreed to the “sexual activity in
question”. On the approach we propose, the “sexual activity in question” was
the sexual intercourse that took place in this case. Effective condom use is a
method of contraception and protection against sexually transmitted disease; it
is not a sex act. 

[65]                         
There is no dispute that the complainant
subjectively consented to sexual intercourse with Mr. Hutchinson at the time
that it occurred. We conclude that the Crown did not prove that there was no
voluntary agreement to the “sexual activity in question” under s. 273.1(1)  of
the Criminal Code . 

[66]                         
The next question is whether any of the
circumstances in which voluntary agreement is not effective apply. These
circumstances are listed in s. 265(3)  and s. 273.1(2) . The only provision
argued is s. 265(3) (c). So the key issue is whether the complainant’s
agreement to the sexual activity in question was vitiated by fraud under s.
265(3) (c) of the Criminal Code . 

[67]                         
As we have seen, “fraud”
for the purposes of consent has two elements: (1) dishonesty, which can include
the non-disclosure of important facts; and (2) deprivation or risk of
deprivation in the form of serious bodily harm which results from the
dishonesty (Cuerrier). Did the Crown prove that no consent was obtained
by virtue of fraud?

[68]                         
The dishonesty in this
case is evident and admitted. Mr. Hutchinson obtained the complainant’s consent
to sexual intercourse only by failing to disclose the critical fact that he had
sabotaged the condoms and thereby compromised their contraceptive value. The
only remaining issue is whether there was a sufficient deprivation to establish
fraud.  

[69]                         
Mr. Hutchinson argues
that the universal threshold for deprivation under s. 265(3) (c) post-Cuerrier
is a “significant risk of serious bodily harm”, and that the Crown did not
establish that here.  The Crown argues that a new trial is required to
determine whether the risk of pregnancy caused by the sabotaged condoms
constituted a “significant risk of serious bodily harm”. These arguments
over-read Cuerrier.  The Court in Cuerrier was addressing the
specific risk of sexually transmitted diseases.  It did not foreclose the
possibility that other types of harm may amount to equally serious deprivations
and therefore suffice to establish the requirements of fraud under s. 265(3) (c).


[70]                         
The concept of “harm”
does not encompass only bodily harm in the traditional sense of that term; it
includes at least the sorts of profound changes in a woman’s body — changes
that may be welcomed or changes that a woman may choose not to accept —
resulting from pregnancy. Depriving a woman of the choice whether to become
pregnant or increasing the risk of pregnancy is equally serious as a
“significant risk of serious bodily harm” within the meaning of Cuerrier,
and therefore suffices to establish fraud vitiating consent under s. 265(3) (c).


[71]                         
We conclude that where a
complainant has chosen not to become pregnant, deceptions that deprive her of
the benefit of that choice by making her pregnant, or exposing her to an
increased risk of becoming pregnant by removing effective birth control, may
constitute a sufficiently serious deprivation for the purposes of fraud
vitiating consent under s. 265(3) (c). 

[72]                         
This application of “fraud” under s. 265(3) (c)
is consistent with Charter  values of equality and autonomy, while
recognizing that not every deception that induces consent should be
criminalized. To establish fraud, the dishonest act must result in a
deprivation that is equally serious as the deprivation recognized in
Cuerrier and in this case. For example, financial deprivations or mere
sadness or stress from being lied to will not be sufficient.

[73]                         
In this case, while the
Crown did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant’s
pregnancy was the result of the damaged condoms, Mr. Hutchinson exposed her to
an increased risk of becoming pregnant by using a faulty condom.  As the trial
judge found, a condom with a pinprick in it is no longer effective birth
control (para. 27).  This constituted a sufficient deprivation for fraud, within
the meaning established in Cuerrier.

[74]                         
We conclude that there
was no consent in this case by reason of fraud, pursuant to s. 265(3) (c)
of the Criminal Code .  Mr. Hutchinson is therefore guilty of
sexual assault.

VI.       
Disposition

[75]                         
We would dismiss the
appeal. 

                    The reasons of Abella,
Moldaver and Karakatsanis JJ. were delivered by

[76]                         
Abella and
Moldaver JJ. — This case involves a woman who agreed to sexual intercourse with a condom.  When a
woman agrees to have sexual intercourse with a condom, she is consenting to a
particular sexual activity.  It is a different sexual activity than sexual
intercourse without a condom.  Her reasons for requiring a condom as
part of the activity may be to prevent pregnancy, or they may be a matter of
personal preference.  But whatever her reasons, they are beyond the scope of
the criminal law.  What is within its scope is what she actually agreed
to, not why.  The deliberate and undisclosed thwarting of her agreement as to
how the intercourse is to take place turns the sexual activity into a
non-consensual act, regardless of its consequences.  This engages s. 273.1(1) 
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , whose purpose is to
ascertain whether there was consent to the activity in the first place.  This
is, first and foremost, a function of everyone’s right to decide whether and
how to engage in sexual activity.

[77]                         
The factual events which
gave rise to these proceedings are not in dispute.  The complainant agreed to
have sexual intercourse with Craig Hutchinson with a condom so that she would
not get pregnant. Condom use, therefore, clearly meant an intact condom.  Mr.
Hutchinson secretly poked holes in the condom and used it during sexual
intercourse.  The complainant only learned of this when he later told her what
he had done.  At trial, Mr. Hutchinson was convicted of sexual assault under s.
271  of the Criminal Code .

[78]                         
The issue before this
Court is which Criminal Code  provision applies in examining whether
there was consent.  The trial judge and a majority of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal
found that s. 273.1(1)  applied and concluded that under that provision, there
was no consent to the sexual activity in question.  The dissenting judge was of
the view that the complainant had consented to sexual intercourse generally and
that the condom was not part of the sexual activity.  He would have ordered a
new trial to determine whether the consent had been vitiated by fraud under s.
265(3) (c). 

[79]                         
We would dismiss the appeal.  The starting point
for the analysis is s. 273.1(1) .  The question is not whether consent was
vitiated by fraud, it is whether there was consent to the sexual activity in
the first place.  In our view, there was no such consent, making s. 273.1(1) 
the applicable provision.  The complainant in this case agreed to engage in sexual
activity in a certain manner, that is, sexual intercourse with a condom.  It
goes without saying that when someone agrees to sexual intercourse with a
condom, she is agreeing to sexual intercourse with an intact condom. 
The deliberate sabotaging of that condom without her knowledge or agreement
makes what happened different from what the complainant agreed to.      Since
the complainant never agreed to engage in sexual intercourse with a sabotaged
condom, there is therefore no consent under s. 273.1(1)  and the inquiry for the
purposes of the actus reus of sexual assault is complete.

Analysis

[80]                         
The relevant provisions,
s. 273.1(1)  and s. 265(3) (c), state:

     273.1 (1) Subject to subsection (2) and subsection 265(3) , “consent” means, for the purposes of
sections 271 , 272  and 273 , the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage
in the sexual activity in question.

 

265.
. . .

 

(3) For the purposes of this section, no consent is obtained where
the complainant submits or does not resist by reason of 

 

(a)
the application of force to the complainant or to a person other than the
complainant;

 

(b)
threats or fear of the application of force to the complainant or to a person
other than the complainant;

 

(c)
fraud; or

 

(d)
the exercise of authority.

[81]                         
In R. v. Ewanchuk, [1999] 1 S.C.R.
330, this Court set out the governing framework for
analyzing whether the elements of sexual assault are met in a given case.  The mens
rea for sexual assault requires the accused to have knowledge of, or be
willfully blind to, the complainant’s lack of consent.  The central focus of
the analysis of the actus reus of sexual assault, on the other hand, is
to determine what the complainant agreed to, and what in fact took place.  The actus
reus requires proof of three elements: “(i) touching, (ii) the sexual
nature of the contact, and (iii) the absence of consent” (para. 25).  While the
first two elements are determined objectively, the third — the absence of
consent — “is subjective and determined by reference to the complainant’s
subjective internal state of mind towards the touching, at the time it
occurred” (para. 26).  It is the third component of the actus reus that
we are concerned with in this appeal. 

[82]                         
In Ewanchuk, the foundational principles underlying the law of sexual assault were distilled by
Major J. as follows:

Society is committed to protecting the
personal integrity, both physical and psychological, of every individual.
Having control over who touches one’s body, and how, lies at the
core of human dignity and autonomy. The inclusion of assault and sexual assault
in the Code expresses society’s determination to protect the security of
the person from any non-consensual contact or threats of force. The common law
has recognized for centuries that the individual’s right to physical integrity
is a fundamental principle, “every man’s person being sacred, and no other
having a right to meddle with it, in any the slightest manner” . . . .  It
follows that any intentional but unwanted touching is criminal.  [Emphasis
added; para. 28.]

[83]                         
In other words,
society’s commitment to protecting a person’s autonomy and dignity requires
that individuals have the right to determine who touches their body, and
how the touching will occur.  The right to determine how sexual
touching is to occur clearly encompasses a person’s right to determine where
one’s body is touched and by what means.  At its core, this case
concerns the right recognized in Ewanchuk to determine how sexual
touching will take place.

[84]                         
This protection
underlies the definition of consent set out in s. 273.1(1)  as being “the
voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in
question”.  When it defined consent in s. 273.1(1)  in this way in 1992,
Parliament’s intent was to address the “fundamental” issue of giving full and
clear meaning to the concept of “consent” (Kim Campbell, Minister of Justice
and Attorney General of Canada, House of Commons Debates, vol. IX, 3rd
Sess., 34th Parl., June 15, 1992, at pp. 12027-28; see also pp. 12041 and
12043). As another parliamentarian explained:

     Consent is the crux of
sexual assault trials. If it has been established that consent has been given,
the woman’s claim of attack is rejected. It is imperative that the law be
absolutely clear on this matter, as must the partners involved in the sexual
activity.

 

     The bill states that
consent is the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual
activity in question. There is no need for lawyers to be present. All you need
are two people who understand each other’s needs . . . . 

 

(Shirley
Maheu, M.P. from Saint-Laurent—Cartierville, ibid., at p. 12045)

[85]                         
Since the protection of
personal integrity underlies the requirement for consent in s. 273.1(1) ,
consent to the “sexual activity in question” necessarily means the
complainant’s voluntary agreement both to engage in touching of a sexual nature
and to the manner in which that touching is carried out.  In other words,
without voluntary agreement as to the “how” — the manner in which the sexual
activity in question occurred — there is no consent within the meaning of s.
273.1(1) .

[86]                         
The dissenting judge in
the Court of Appeal, like McLachlin C.J. and Cromwell J., concluded that the
specific sexual activity in question here was “sexual intercourse”.  Since the
complainant consented to sexual intercourse, there was consent within the
meaning of s. 273.1(1) .  In the dissenting judge’s view, the term “sexual
activity” in s. 273.1(1)  has a narrow meaning, referring only to “actual
incidents of physical touching, whether oral sex, or intercourse, or another
‘category’ of activity, and not to the conditions of that touching” (para.
127 (emphasis in original)).  With respect, adverting to generic, categorical
labels of sexual activity obscures the purpose of the consent inquiry regarding
the actus reus of sexual assault.  The complainant must consent to the
sexual touching which actually took place (Ewanchuk, at
para. 26).  And this Court confirmed in R. v. J.A., [2011] 2
S.C.R. 440, that the relevant time for determining that consent is when the
activity occurred.  To interpret “sexual activity in question” in s. 273.1(1) 
without regard to the specific touching that occurs extinguishes the right of a
person to decide whether to give or withhold consent to the sexual activity
which is to take place.  

[87]                         
The dissenting judge’s
technical definition of “sexual activity in question” also suggests that once a
person consents to a “category” of sexual activity, the inquiry goes to s.
265(3)  to determine whether that general consent was vitiated.  This, with
respect, reads out the protection in Ewanchuk for the “how” of the
sexual touching.  A person who has consented to being touched over her clothing
above the waist, is not consenting to being touched under her clothing below
the waist. Both instances are “touching”, but only one was agreed to.  In the
same way, agreeing to “penetration” does not thereby mean consenting to any or
all forms or penetration. The notion that general consent is given under s.
273.1(1)  so long as the other person’s actions fall somewhere within the
generic category of what the complainant agreed to, such as touching or
penetration, is untenable.  It represents the triumph of terminology over
personal integrity and completely undermines Ewanchuk’s basic principle
that “any intentional but unwanted touching is criminal” by virtue of
the fact that it was unwanted (para. 28 (emphasis added)).

[88]                         
A person consents to how
she will be touched, and she is entitled to decide what sexual
activity she agrees to engage in for whatever reason she wishes. The fact that
some of the consequences of her motives are more serious than others, such as
pregnancy, does not in the slightest undermine her right to decide the manner
of the sexual activity she wants to engage in.  It is neither her partner’s
business nor the state’s.  The complainant’s voluntary agreement to the manner
in which the sexual touching was carried out, requires the complainant’s
consent to where on her body she was touched and with what.  It does
not, however, require consent to the consequences of that touching, or the
characteristics of the sexual partner, such as age, wealth, marital status, or
health.  These consequences or characteristics, while potentially significant,
are not part of the actual physical activity that is agreed to.  If we included
them in the meaning of the sexual activity in question under s. 273.1(1) , we
would be criminalizing activity that thwarts the motives of a
complainant, instead of focussing on the unwanted physical activity that
actually took place.  To state the proposition demonstrates its unacceptable
reach.  While it is true that the third element of the actus reus — the
complainant’s absence of consent to the touching —is a subjective inquiry, it
must nonetheless relate to the specific way in which he or she is touched, not
to why.  The avoidance or pursuit of pregnancy may well motivate why the
specific sexual activity is being agreed to, but the motivation for the sexual
activity is not the sexual activity itself.  

[89]                         
That is why we would not adopt the
“essential features” test proposed by the majority of the Nova Scotia Court of
Appeal, under which “if there is no consent to an essential feature of the
sexual act itself, there can be no consent to ‘the sexual activity in
question’” (para. 46).  By focussing on what is an “essential” feature of the
sexual activity to the complainant, there is a risk of capturing “features”
which are not a part of the how of the sexual activity.  In other words,
the language of “essential features” opens the door to a broader inquiry than
whether the complainant consented specifically to the sexual touching which
occurred.  To the extent that our colleagues have conflated our approach
with the “essential features” test, it does not, with respect, reflect our
reasons.

[90]                         
But neither do we agree
that the fraud provision in s. 265(3) (c) must be the framework for
analyzing consent in sexual assault cases whenever deception is involved.  When
a complainant does not voluntarily agree to the sexual activity which occurred,
consent does not exist within the meaning of s. 273.1(1) , and the inquiry for
the purposes of the actus reus of sexual assault is complete.  

[91]                         
Unlike under s. 265(3) (c), which
requires both a dishonest act and a deprivation, consent
under s. 273.1(1)  has never required an analysis of the risks or consequences
caused by unwanted sexual touching.  This Court has consistently affirmed that
it is the unwanted nature of non-consensual sexual touching that
violates the complainant’s sexual integrity and gives rise to culpability under
the criminal law, not just the risk of further harm that the sexual touching
may create.  Requiring an analysis of the risks or consequences of all
non-consensual sexual touching if deception is later discovered, adds a barrier
to the simple ability to demonstrate whether the activity which occurred was
agreed to when it occurred.  It thereby undermines the values of
personal autonomy and physical integrity sought to be protected by making
sexual assault an offence.  

[92]                         
Regardless of whether deception occurred in a
given case, the analysis under s. 273.1(1)  must link consent to the specific
sexual activity which occurred, including how the sexual touching was
physically carried out.  In other words, did the complainant consent to where
she was touched and by what?  We therefore think the following two-part
test for analyzing consent under the actus reus of sexual assault flows
inevitably from Ewanchuk:

Under s.
273.1(1), has the complainant consented to the identity of her sexual partner,
the sexual nature of the touching, and the manner in which the sexual touching
was carried out? 

If so, are
there any circumstances that vitiate the complainant’s consent under s.
265(3) ?  

[93]                         
This approach does not,
as our colleagues suggest, “do most of the work that the fraud provision was
intended to do”.  What it does do, is give meaning to the word
“consent”.  Indeed, as our colleagues themselves point out, there are many
situations in which a person’s deception does not change the manner in which
the sexual activity is actually carried out. Section 265(3) (c) may well
apply to those deceptions that do not fall under s. 273.1(1), either because
the deception does not go to the manner in which a person is touched, does not
involve the identity of one’s partner, or does not pertain to the sexual nature
of the touching.  If there was no consent ab initio to the sexual
activity, however, it is pointless to inquire under s. 265(3) (c) whether
consent was vitiated by fraud.  The two inquiries are conceptually distinct and
must remain so.  One goes to the manner in which the sexual touching is
carried out, the other to the consequences of the sexual touching.  The
fact that the violation of someone’s consent results in a deprivation does not
change the fact that there was no consent to begin with.  

[94]                         
In our view, both R. v. Cuerrier,
[1998] 2 S.C.R. 371, and R. v. Mabior, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 584, are
examples of cases that were properly decided under s. 265(3) (c).  In
those cases, this Court set out the applicable approach to sexual assault cases
under s. 265(3) (c) involving non-disclosure or deception as to the
existence of a disease.  The complainants had consented to the manner in
which the sexual activity had been carried out, the identity of their sexual
partner, and the sexual nature of that touching.  The complainants had
consented to sex with and, in some cases, without condoms, and the sexual
intercourse took place in accordance with that agreement.  The significant
issue before the Court was whether the complainants’ consent had been vitiated
by fraud because the accused had not disclosed that he was HIV-positive (Cuerrier,
at para. 77; Mabior, at para. 106).[1] 
As the risk of HIV transmission is a consequence of sexual activity, and the
complainants had consented to the manner in which the sexual activity occurred,
these cases were properly decided within the realm of s. 265(3) (c).  There are, moreover, important policy considerations that justify
deciding HIV non-disclosure cases under s. 265(3) (c).  Requiring a
“significant risk of serious bodily harm” in HIV non-disclosure cases ensures
that the criminal law does not further stigmatize and criminalize an already
vulnerable group.  

[95]                         
This approach was never intended to replace the
governing framework for analyzing consent in sexual assault cases set out in Ewanchuk.  
By further redefining the deprivation component of the fraud test affirmed in Mabior
only two years ago, our colleagues leave open the possibility that other
“equally serious deprivations” could establish deprivation in future cases. 
This makes the deprivation component a moving target, and generates uncertainty
in an already complex area.  

[96]                         
While the starting point
for the analysis is s. 273.1(1), unlike our colleagues, we see no legal danger
or uncertainty in recognizing that in a given case, lack of consent could
theoretically have been established under either provision. What is
fraught, however, is redefining the concept of consent in a way that
significantly limits the protective scope of s. 273.1(1) and erodes a person’s right, confirmed in Ewanchuk,
to decide what sexual activity will take place.  

[97]                         
The heart of our disagreement with McLachlin
C.J. and Cromwell J. turns on whether the use of a condom is included in the
manner in which the sexual activity is carried out.  According to our
colleagues, the use of a condom during sexual intercourse does not change the “specific
physical sex act” which occurs, but rather is merely a “collateral conditio[n]”
to the sexual activity.  In their view, so long as there is consent to “sexual
intercourse”, this general consent is not vitiated by a deception about condom
use unless it exposes the individual to a deprivation within the meaning of s.
265(3) (c), which they conclude in this case means depriving a woman of
the choice to become pregnant by “making her pregnant, or exposing her to an
increased risk of becoming pregnant”.

[98]                         
With respect, it does not follow that because a
condom is a form of birth control, it is not also part of the sexual activity. 
Removing the use of a condom from the ambit of what is consented to in the
sexual activity because in some cases it may be used for contraceptive
purposes, means that an individual is precluded from requiring a condom during
intercourse where pregnancy is not at issue.  That is, individuals who
engage in sexual activity that has no risk of pregnancy, either because of age,
fertility, or gender, for example, would have no legal right to insist upon the
use of a condom.  If one of those individuals has insisted upon the use of a
condom, and their partner has deliberately and knowingly ignored
those wishes — whether by not using a condom at all, removing it partway
through the sexual activity, or sabotaging it — that individual will
nonetheless be presumed to have consented under the approach suggested by our
colleagues.  In other words, because the person could not become pregnant, the
criminal law will not uphold his or her right to sexual autonomy and physical
integrity.  With respect, even aside from the problematic analogy between
pregnancy and bodily harm, this result does not reflect the fact that everyone
has a right to insist on a condom as part of the sexual activity — for whatever
reason.  All individuals must have an equal right to determine how they are
touched, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, reproductive capacity, or
the type of sexual activity they choose to engage in.  We fail to see how condoms
can be seen as anything but an aspect of how sexual touching occurs.  When
individuals agree to sexual activity with a condom, they are not merely
agreeing to a sexual activity, they are agreeing to how it should take
place.  That is what s. 273.1(1) was intended to protect.

[99]                         
It is worth remembering
that three decades ago, this Court overturned a decision of the New Brunswick
Court of Appeal, R. v. Chase (1984), 55 N.B.R. (2d) 97, that touching a
woman’s breast was an assault, but not a sexual one.  The Court of Appeal
concluded that a breast was only a “secondary” sexual characteristic and that
“sexual” should be given “its natural meaning as limited to the sexual organs
or genitalia”.   A man who had grabbed a woman’s breasts had therefore
committed an assault, but not a sexual assault, since

the contact was not with the
sexual organs of the victim but to the mammary gland, a secondary sexual
characteristic. 

 

. .
. to include as sexual an assault to the parts of a person’s body considered as
having secondary sexual characteristics may lead to absurd results if one
considers a man’s beard. Nor am I prepared to include those parts of the human
body considered erogenous zones lest a person be liable to conviction for
stealing a goodnight kiss. . . .  It seems to me that the word “sexual” as used
in the section ought to be given its natural meaning as limited to the sexual
organs or genitalia. [paras. 13-14]

In this Court, McIntyre
J., had “no difficulty” overturning the Court of Appeal’s decision, concluding
instead that a sexual assault had been committed by the accused ([1987] 2
S.C.R. 293, at p. 303). 

[100]                     
To say that condom use
is not part of the sexual activity in question under s. 273.1(1) but rather a
collateral condition, is reminiscent of the artificially narrow approach to the
word “sexual” taken by the Court of Appeal in Chase and rejected by this
Court. We must similarly take care not to adopt an interpretation of “sexual
activity in question” that unreasonably or arbitrarily excludes certain forms
of touching from the meaning of s. 273.1(1).  By any definition, when someone
uses a condom, it is part of the sexual activity.  It is therefore part of what
is — or is not — consented to.  And if what is consented to is sexual activity
with a condom, the condom is expected to be intact.  If it is not intact because
of its deliberate sabotaging, the activity that has been agreed to has been
unilaterally changed by the saboteur.  

[101]                     
What took place here was sexual intercourse with
a sabotaged condom, a sexual activity to which the complainant did not
consent.  The fact that she only learned of the deliberate sabotaging after
the sexual activity took place, is of no relevance.  What is relevant is what
sexual activity she agreed to engage in with Mr. Hutchinson and whether he
stuck to the bargain.  He did not.  Since the complainant did not agree at any
time to how she was touched, consent within the meaning of s. 273.1(1) did not
exist. 

[102]                     
Nor can we see why
requiring the consistent approach to consent in sexual assault set out in Ewanchuk
— and never abandoned by this Court — can now be said to lead to
“over-criminalization”.  Sexual assault is a crime.  What s. 273.1(1) does is
explain, clearly and simply, that the actus reus of sexual assault is
made out when someone does not agree to the manner of the sexual touching, that
is, when an individual engages in sexual touching in a way that is contrary to
the complainant’s wishes, thereby violating his or her bodily integrity. This
on its own, however, is half the story.  The mens rea for the offence of
sexual assault captures those who knowingly touch the complainant in a
way that he or she has not agreed to, thereby disregarding the complainant’s
right to determine how he or she is sexually touched.  While the criminal law
must remain sensitive to concerns about over-criminalization, those concerns
should not be used to generally undermine the hard-fought legislative protection
for someone’s right to determine how he or she is sexually touched.  It is also
worth remembering the Chief Justice’s comments in J.A. — with the
Court’s unanimous agreement on this point — where she observed that “even mild
non-consensual touching of a sexual nature can have profound implications for
the complainant” (paras. 63 and 121).

[103]                     
The complainant in this
case agreed to engage in sexual activity in a certain manner, that is, sexual
intercourse with an intact condom.  Mr. Hutchinson deliberately sabotaged the
condom without her knowledge or agreement.  It trivializes the seriousness of
the violation of the complainant’s integrity that occurred to analogize a
sabotaged condom, as our colleagues have done, to its brand or expiration
date.  Because of the deliberate deceit of her partner, the sexual activity was
not carried out in the manner that the complainant had agreed to.  Put simply,
the complainant did not consent to how she was touched, and thus she did not

on appeal from the court
of appeal for prince edward island 

 

                    Criminal
law — Evidence — Assessment — Burden of proof — Evidence at trial consisting
almost exclusively of diametrically opposed testimony of accused and
complainant — Trial judge finding accused not credible and rejecting all his
evidence — Accused convicted — Majority of Court of Appeal erred in holding
that conviction based on faulty application of burden of proof — Conviction
restored.

The
Chief Justice — We agree with the
conclusion reached by McQuaid J.A., dissenting in the Court of Appeal, that the
trial judge did not err in his application of the burden of proof, and there
was therefore no basis for appellate intervention.  The appeal is allowed and
the conviction restored.

                    APPEAL
from a judgment of the Alberta Court of Appeal (Conrad, Martin and Rowbotham JJ.A.),

                    Jolaine Antonio and Matt Dalidowicz, for the respondent.

 

                    The judgment
of the Court was delivered orally by 

[1]                             
The Chief
Justice — On this appeal as of
right, the appellant raises three questions of law on which a judge of the
Alberta Court of Appeal dissented.  Two of them can be dealt with summarily. 
First, the appellant submits that the trial judge was required as part of her
instructions on reasonable doubt to specifically direct the jury that they had
to acquit both accused if they could not decide which accused had committed the
murder.  Second, the appellant submits that the trial judge failed to properly
explain to the jury the relationship between the intoxication defence and the mens
rea required for aiding and abetting in second degree murder.  For the
reasons given by Rowbotham J.A. in the Court of Appeal, we would not give
effect to these grounds.

[2]                             
The third ground of appeal relates to certain
out-of-court statements made by the appellant’s co-accused and which the Crown
introduced into evidence against the co-accused as party admissions. The
appellant submits that the trial judge erred by failing to instruct the jury
that it could rely on those statements for their truth in determining their
verdict in relation to the appellant.

[3]                             
We would not give effect to this argument. The
general rule is that out‑of‑court statements by a party may be
adduced as evidence of their truth by an opposite party. But, as the trial
judge instructed the jury, statements admitted on that basis may in general be
used only in deciding the case of the accused who made the statements.  The
trial judge gave this standard instruction with the express agreement of trial
counsel. She did not err in doing so. The appellant’s counsel at trial did not
seek to adduce the co-accused’s out‑of‑court statements for their
truth as part of the appellant’s case under the principled approach to the
hearsay rule or on any other basis. 

[4]                             
There appears to be nothing that would have prevented the appellant from
attempting to have these statements considered for their truth under the
principled approach to the hearsay rule.  However, no such attempt was made
here.  There was, therefore, no basis raised for the judge to give the
instruction now sought.  We note that R. v. Edwards, 2004 BCCA 558, 205
B.C.A.C. 42, in which one accused adduced in evidence as part of his case an
inculpatory out-of-court statement by a co-accused, gives rise to different
issues which we do not have to address here.

[5]                             
While that is sufficient to address the legal issues on which the dissent in the
Court of Appeal was based, we also observe that the statements made by the
appellant and his co-accused were highly unreliable on their face and tended,
in any event, to incriminate both of them. There is no suggestion that defence
counsel not pursuing the admissibility of these statements as evidence of their
truth by virtue of the principled approach to hearsay or seeking a severance so
that the co-accused would be a compellable witness were anything other than
reasonable tactical decisions. No basis has been shown to permit the appellant
to revisit these matters on appeal: see R. v. J.F., 2013 SCC 12, [2013]
1 S.C.R. 565, at para. 68. 

[6]                             
For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed. 

                    Judgment
accordingly.

on appeal from the court of appeal for quebec 

                    Criminal
law — Stay of proceedings — Abuse of process — Accused charged with offences
related to firearms and importation, production and trafficking of
methamphetamine — Accused alleging Crown misconduct in obtaining medical
records, police collusion to mislead court, and Crown threats pressuring
accused to plead guilty — Trial judge staying proceedings — Whether stay of
proceedings necessary to protect integrity of justice system.

                    The
accused were charged with numerous firearms offences, as well as offences
related to the importation, production and trafficking of methamphetamine. 
During the course of the trial, the accused brought an application to stay the
proceedings for abuse of process.  They took issue with three forms of state
misconduct: attempts by the Crown to intimidate them into foregoing their right
to a trial by threatening them with additional charges should they choose to
plead not guilty, collusion on the part of two police officers to mislead the
court about the seizure of a firearm, and improper means used by the Crown in
obtaining the medical records of one of the accused.  The trial judge stayed
the proceedings.  The Court of Appeal set aside the stay and ordered a new
trial.

                    Held
(Abella J. dissenting):  The appeals should be dismissed.

                    Per
McLachlin C.J. and LeBel, Cromwell, Moldaver, Karakatsanis and
Wagner JJ.:  A stay of proceedings for an abuse of process will only be
warranted in the clearest of cases.  Two types of state conduct may warrant a
stay.  The first is conduct that compromises the fairness of an accused’s trial
(the “main” category).  The second is conduct that does not threaten trial
fairness but risks undermining the integrity of the judicial process (the
“residual” category).  The test for determining whether a stay of proceedings
is warranted is the same for both categories and consists of three
requirements:  (1) there must be prejudice to the accused’s right to a
fair trial or to the integrity of the justice system that will be manifested,
perpetuated or aggravated through the conduct of the trial, or by its outcome, (2) there
must be no alternative remedy capable of redressing the prejudice, and
(3) where there is still uncertainty over whether a stay is warranted after
steps 1 and 2, the court must balance the interests in favour of granting a
stay against the interest that society has in having a final decision on the
merits.  

                    When
the residual category is invoked, the first stage of the test is met when it is
established that the state has engaged in conduct that is offensive to societal
notions of fair play and decency, and that proceeding with a trial in the face
of that conduct would be harmful to the integrity of the justice system.  At
the second stage of the test, the focus is on whether an alternate remedy short
of a stay of proceedings will adequately dissociate the justice system from the
impugned state conduct going forward.  Finally, the court must decide whether
staying the proceedings or having a trial despite the impugned conduct better
protects the integrity of the justice system.  This inquiry necessarily demands
balancing.  The court must consider such things as the nature and seriousness
of the impugned conduct, whether the conduct is isolated or reflects a systemic
and ongoing problem, the circumstances of the accused, the charges he or she
faces, and the interests of society in having the charges disposed of on the
merits.  

                    In
the instant case, the three forms of state misconduct that are at issue fall
squarely within the residual category.  The trial judge erred in his assessment
of the impugned misconduct and in concluding that a stay of proceedings was
warranted.  As regards the medical records, the trial judge made a palpable and
overriding error in finding that the Crown’s conduct occasioned prejudice to
the integrity of the justice system.  With respect to the police collusion,
apart from its limited extent, the trial judge failed to consider the existence
of another remedy that would have overcome the threat posed to the integrity of
the justice system — namely, excluding the firearm from evidence in respect of
both accused.  As for the threats made by the Crown, while they were reprehensible
and should not be repeated, the trial judge failed to consider that they were
made more than a year before the trial began, and that the accused took no
steps for over a year to address the Crown’s conduct.  These factors shed light
on how seriously the accused took the threats.  The trial judge also failed to
consider that the Crown prosecutor who made the threats was removed from the
case months before the trial started.  Moreover, the trial judge failed to
balance the need for a stay against society’s interest in a trial on the
merits.  When the impugned misconduct is weighed against society’s interest in
a trial, this is not one of the clearest of cases where the exceptional remedy
of a stay of proceedings is warranted. 

                    Per
Abella J. (dissenting):  A stay of proceedings may be imposed when the
state conduct is so profoundly and disproportionately inconsistent with the
public perception of what a fair justice system requires, that proceeding with
a trial means condoning unforgiveable conduct.  A Crown who makes threats
intended to bully an accused into foregoing his or her right to a trial, takes
fatal aim at the heart of the public’s confidence in that integrity.

                    The
unjustifiable nature of the Crown’s conduct in this case was not mitigated by the
length of time between the threats and the trial.  Time is not a legal remedy
for a fundamental breach of the Crown’s role and the passage of time does not
attenuate her unpardonable conduct.  It was the mere fact that the threats were
made at all that was key, not when they were made.  

                    Moreover,
a further balancing exercise was not required in the circumstances.  The trial
judge was unequivocal in concluding that the conduct justified a stay, and
there was none of the uncertainty as to the propriety of a stay that is a
condition precedent to the need for a balancing exercise.  When a trial judge
has found that the conduct cannot be condoned because it is such an exceptional
assault on the public’s sense of justice, it is conceptually inconsistent to ask
the court to undermine its own conclusion by re-weighing the half of the scale
that contains the public’s interest in trials on the merits.  The public has an
interest not only in trials on the merits, it has an even greater interest in
knowing that when the state is involved in proceedings, particularly those that
can result in an individual’s loss of liberty, it will put fairness above
expedience.  Justice is not only about results, it is about how those results
are obtained.  When a Crown threatens an accused with additional offences if he
or she does not plead guilty, the public’s interest in the results of a trial
must yield to the transcendent interest in protecting the public’s confidence
in the integrity of the justice system.

I.             
Introduction

[1]                             
This appeal provides the Court with an
opportunity to revisit the law of abuse of process as it relates to state
conduct that impinges on the integrity of the justice system but does not affect
trial fairness — sometimes referred to as the “residual category” of cases for
which a judicial stay of proceedings may be ordered.  In particular, we are
tasked with clarifying the approach to be followed when determining whether a
stay of proceedings should be ordered where such conduct is uncovered.

[2]                             
As we shall see, the appellants, Antal Babos and
Sergio Piccirilli, complain about three forms of state misconduct:

(1)              
Attempts by the original provincial Crown
Attorney to intimidate them into foregoing their right to a trial by
threatening them with additional charges should they choose to plead not
guilty;

(2)              
Collusion on the part of two police officers to
mislead the court about the seizure of a firearm from Mr. Babos’s car; and

(3)              
Improper means used by a federal Crown Attorney
in obtaining Mr. Piccirilli’s medical records from the detention centre where
he was being detained pending trial.

[3]                             
Notably, the appellants do not argue that they
cannot receive a fair trial as a result of the alleged incidents of misconduct
— they accept that they can.  They submit instead that this is one of the
clearest of cases in which a stay of proceedings is necessary to preserve and
protect the integrity of the justice system.  Anything short of that would
amount to judicial condonation of egregious misconduct and erode the public’s
confidence in the administration of justice.

[4]                             
And that, the appellants say, is the basis upon
which the trial judge ordered a stay of proceedings in their case.  In doing
so, he made no error.  His decision was discretionary and entitled to
deference, and the Quebec Court of Appeal should not have interfered.  Hence,
the appellants seek to have the order of the trial judge reinstated. 

[5]                             
For the reasons that follow, I would not give
effect to the appellants’ submissions.  In my respectful view, the trial judge
committed errors in assessing all three forms of state misconduct.  As regards
Mr. Piccirilli’s medical records, he made a palpable and overriding error in
assessing the Crown’s conduct.  With respect to the police collusion, apart
from its limited extent, the trial judge failed to consider that excluding the
firearm found in Mr. Babos’s trunk would have overcome whatever threat it posed
to the integrity of the justice system.  As for the threats by the provincial
Crown, while they were reprehensible and should not be repeated, the trial
judge overstated their seriousness and failed to balance the need for a stay
against society’s interest in a trial on the merits.  

[6]                             
When the impugned misconduct is properly
considered and the correct legal framework is applied, a stay is unwarranted. 
Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeals.

II.          
Background Facts

[7]                             
On February 17, 2006, Mr. Babos was pulled over
by Constables Guy Brière and Marc Sénéchal.  The officers believed that Mr.
Babos was transporting guns.  Upon searching the trunk of his car, they found a
semi-automatic firearm.  Mr. Babos was arrested.  

[8]                             
On June 21, 2006, Mr. Piccirilli was arrested. 
Both he and Mr. Babos were ultimately charged with numerous firearms related
offences, as well as offences related to the importation, production and
trafficking of methamphetamine.

[9]                             
The instances of threatening conduct by Crown
counsel are said to have occurred between June 2006 and February 2007.
Specifically, the provincial prosecutor assigned to the case, Ms. Valérie
Tremblay, was accused of threatening Mr. Piccirilli on three separate occasions
with additional charges if he did not plead guilty.  

[10]                         
According to Mr. Patrice Duliot, Mr.
Piccirilli’s former lawyer, Ms. Tremblay told him, in the presence of Mr.
Piccirilli, that [translation] “if
your client doesn’t settle, he’s gonna be hit by a train” (A.R., vol. V, at p.
5).  Mr. Piccirilli claimed that on another occasion, either in June or
September 2006, Ms. Tremblay threatened him personally in the courtroom. 
According to Mr. Piccirilli, she said “if you proceed, we’ll bring other
charges against you” and that she would  “use section 577 ” and go “straight to
trial” (pp. 65 and 69).[1] 
Another of Mr. Piccirilli’s counsel, Ms. Guylaine Tardif, deposed in an
affidavit that in November 2006 or February 2007, Ms. Tremblay told her that
Mr. Piccirilli would be charged with money laundering and organized crime
offences if he did not plead guilty.  Ms. Tremblay asked Ms. Tardif to relay
this message to her client.  Although Mr. Babos was not threatened directly, no
issue is taken with the fact that the threats conveyed to Mr. Piccirilli would
have come to his attention.

[11]                         
The appellants’ trial began in April 2008. 
Notably, by February 2008, Ms. Tremblay was no longer on the file.  She had
been removed for health reasons and replaced by a federal prosecutor, Ms.
Kovacevich, when the charges against the appellants were joined in a single
indictment.  It was at this juncture that the appellants were charged with four
additional offences relating to organized crime, firearms and drug
trafficking.  The additional charges stemmed from evidence led at the
appellants’ preliminary hearings.  By this point, neither the appellants nor
their counsel had mentioned the alleged threats made by Ms. Tremblay.  Indeed,
the threats did not surface until they were brought to the attention of the
trial judge some six months into the trial and at least eighteen months after
they were made.

[12]                         
At the outset of the trial, Mr. Babos alleged
that the police had illegally searched the trunk of his car and he sought to
have the firearm they seized excluded from evidence under s. 24(2)  of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  On the s. 24(2)  application, a
key factual issue was whether Mr. Babos consented to the search and opened the
trunk himself.  Constables Brière and Sénéchal testified at the hearing.  Cst.
Brière testified that it was Mr. Babos who opened the trunk of the car.  This
testimony differed from the version of events he had given at the preliminary
inquiry.[2] 
When defence counsel confronted Cst. Brière with the change, Cst. Brière explained
that he had spoken to Cst. Sénéchal while they were waiting to testify, and
that Cst. Sénéchal had [translation]
“convinced” him that the new version of events was the truth. 

[13]                         
The trial judge concluded that the trunk had
been illegally searched and that Mr. Babos’s rights under s. 8  of the Charter 
had been violated.  He also found that the officers had colluded for the
purpose of misleading the court.  The firearm found in the trunk was excluded. 


[14]                         
In June 2008, during the continuation of the
trial, the Crown attempted to adduce the same firearm against Mr. Piccirilli. 
Mr. Piccirilli objected.  The Crown took the position that Mr. Piccirilli had
no standing to allege a violation of his s. 8  rights because the car
from which the firearm was seized belonged to Mr. Babos.  Again Cst. Brière
testified, and again his evidence was somewhat different than before.[3]  The trial judge ruled
in favour of the Crown on the issue of standing, but did so provisionally; he
reserved to Mr. Piccirilli the right to present another motion [translation] “in due course if
necessary” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 124).[4] 


[15]                         
On October 3, 2008, with the trial still
ongoing, Mr. Babos brought an application to stay the charges for unreasonable
delay under s. 11 (b) of the Charter .  That same week, on
October 7, 2008, Mr. Piccirilli had a heart attack and the trial was
adjourned.  Mr. Piccirilli applied for bail, alleging that the detention centre
in which he was being held was unable to adequately care for his health.  As
part of his application, Mr. Piccirilli undertook to provide the court with his
medical report and list of medications.  

[16]                         
Ms. Kovacevich contacted the detention centre
directly and spoke to Mr. Piccirilli’s doctor.  Ms. Kovacevich asked him to
provide an affidavit explaining whether medical staff at the detention centre
had followed up on Mr. Piccirilli’s health since his heart attack and whether
Mr. Piccirilli had been receiving his medication since his hospitalization.  On
October 23, 2008, Mr. Piccirilli’s doctor provided the Crown with medical
documents pertaining to Mr. Piccirilli.  Ms. Kovacevich immediately disclosed
these documents to Mr. Piccirilli’s counsel, but she initially refused to
divulge their source.  A few days later, in an affidavit dated October 30, 2008,
she explained that the medical records had been sent from the detention centre
by Mr. Piccirilli’s doctor.

[17]                         
When Mr. Babos’s s. 11 (b) application
resumed in late October, Mr. Babos’s former counsel (Mr. Duliot) testified.  It
was in the course of his testimony that Ms. Tremblay’s threatening conduct came
to light for the first time.  After hearing evidence regarding Ms. Tremblay’s
conduct, the trial judge asked Ms. Kovacevich if she wanted to call any
witnesses or have Ms. Tremblay prepare an affidavit.  Ms. Kovacevich declined. 
She explained that the only response she could make was that the state of Ms.
Tremblay’s health did not allow her to testify, that the alleged threats were
not admitted, and that no postponement was requested to have her testify.

[18]                         
Both appellants brought an application to stay
the proceedings for abuse of process shortly thereafter.  On November 14, 2008,
the trial judge granted the application and the charges against the appellants
were stayed.  

III.       
Judgments Below

A.          
The Quebec Court, 2008 QCCQ 11373 (CanLII)

[19]                         
Garneau J. stayed the proceedings against both
appellants.  He based his decision to do so on three instances of state
misconduct: (1) Ms. Tremblay’s threats to the appellants that they would face
additional charges if they did not plead guilty; (2) collusion on the part of
Constables Brière and Sénéchal to mislead the court; and (3) Ms. Kovacevich’s
improper conduct in securing Mr. Piccirilli’s medical records from the
detention centre without first obtaining his consent. 

[20]                         
Commencing with Ms. Tremblay’s threatening
conduct, the trial judge described the threats as [translation] “unacceptable, intolerable, unjustifiable,
illegal and, above all, undemocratic” (para. 59).  The trial judge was also
critical of the Crown attorney’s office for failing to take any steps to
address Ms. Tremblay’s conduct, noting that “nothing, absolutely nothing had
been done by the representative of the Attorney General to remedy or even try
to remedy the situation” (para. 66).  Instead, the Crown had “remained
entrenched in its position” (para. 66).  The trial judge found that the threats
had tarnished the reputation of the judicial system and impacted the fairness
of the accused’s trial.  Allowing the trial to continue in the face of these
threats would be “shocking and outrageous” (para. 78).  According to the trial
judge, Ms. Tremblay’s misconduct was sufficient in and of itself to warrant a
stay of proceedings.  

[21]                         
With respect to collusion, the trial judge made
a finding that Constables Brière and Sénéchal colluded in order to mislead the
court.  This finding was based on Cst. Brière’s admission that he had spoken to
Cst. Sénéchal before testifying, and that Cst. Sénéchal had [translation] “convinced” him that Mr.
Babos had opened the trunk of the car (para. 12).  The trial judge also found
that the Crown’s later attempt to lead the firearm seized from the trunk
against Mr. Piccirilli perpetuated the officers’ collusion. 

[22]                         
Finally, regarding Mr. Piccirilli’s medical
records, the trial judge concluded that the Crown should have taken the [translation] “necessary precautions” to
ensure that the confidentiality of Mr. Piccirilli’s records was respected
(para. 53).  The trial judge also found that there had been a “lack of
transparency” because the Crown had “always refused” to disclose the source of
the information once she had obtained it (para. 56). 

[23]                         
In the face of these three instances of
misconduct, but particularly Ms. Tremblay’s threats, the trial judge stayed the
proceedings against both appellants. 

B.           
The Quebec Court of Appeal, 2012 QCCA 471
(CanLII)

[24]                         
Doyon J.A., writing for a unanimous court, set
aside the stay of proceedings and ordered a new trial.  A stay of proceedings
was only to be granted in [translation] “extreme
cases” where no other remedy was possible (para. 56).  This was not such a
case.  

[25]                         
Acknowledging that Ms. Tremblay’s threats were [translation] “unacceptable” and
“outrageous”, Doyon J.A. noted that the impact of the threats was lessened by
the fact that they were made over a year before the trial began and that Ms.
Tremblay had long since been replaced as the prosecutor in charge of the case
(paras. 59 and 73).  

[26]                         
As for the trial judge’s finding that Constables
Brière and Sénéchal colluded to mislead the court, Doyon J.A. considered this
finding to be a palpable and overriding error.  Cst. Brière explained why his
testimony had changed.  The trial judge’s determination that the officers’
conduct amounted to collusion lacked an evidentiary foundation.

[27]                         
With respect to Ms. Kovacevich’s conduct in
securing Mr. Piccirilli’s medical records, Doyon J.A. concluded that there was
no misconduct and that the trial judge committed another palpable and
overriding error in finding otherwise.  Mr. Piccirilli put his medical
condition in issue and at least implicitly waived his right to invoke
confidentiality in the information.  The Crown was free to seek evidence to
contradict Mr. Piccirilli’s assertions for purposes of resisting his
application for interim release.

[28]                         
Having reassessed the facts, Doyon J.A. observed
that Ms. Tremblay’s threats remained the sole cause of concern.  In assessing
whether those threats warranted a stay, he noted that they were uttered months
before trial, by a Crown who was replaced before trial, and about whom the
appellants did not complain until after their trial had been in progress for at
least six months.  In his view, this did not amount to an extreme case that
required a stay of proceedings.

IV.       
Issues

[29]                         
The narrow issue on appeal is whether the trial
judge erred in granting a stay of proceedings.  More broadly, we are tasked
with clarifying the proper analysis to be undertaken when a stay of proceedings
is sought for prior state conduct that is said to impinge on the integrity of
the justice system.

V.          
Analysis

A.          
Abuse of Process and Stays of Proceedings

[30]                         
A stay of proceedings is the most drastic remedy
a criminal court can order (R. v. Regan, 2002 SCC 12, [2002] 1 S.C.R.
297, at para. 53).  It permanently halts the prosecution of an accused. 
In doing so, the truth-seeking function of the trial is frustrated and the
public is deprived of the opportunity to see justice done on the merits.  In
many cases, alleged victims of crime are deprived of their day in court.  

[31]                         
Nonetheless, this Court has recognized that
there are rare occasions —the “clearest of cases” — when a stay of proceedings
for an abuse of process will be warranted (R. v. O’Connor, [1995] 4
S.C.R. 411, at para. 68).  These cases generally fall into two categories: (1)
where state conduct compromises the fairness of an accused’s trial (the “main”
category); and (2) where state conduct creates no threat to trial fairness but
risks undermining the integrity of the judicial process (the “residual”
category) (O’Connor, at para. 73).  The impugned conduct in this case
does not implicate the main category.  Rather, it falls squarely within the
latter category.   

[32]                         
The test used to determine whether a stay of
proceedings is warranted is the same for both categories and consists of three
requirements: 

(1)              
There must be prejudice to the accused’s right
to a fair trial or the integrity of the justice system that “will be
manifested, perpetuated or aggravated through the conduct of the trial, or by
its outcome” (Regan, at para. 54);

(2)              
There must be no alternative remedy capable of
redressing the prejudice; and 

(3)              
Where there is still uncertainty over whether a
stay is warranted after steps (1) and (2), the court is required to balance the
interests in favour of granting a stay, such as denouncing misconduct and
preserving the integrity of the justice system, against “the interest that
society has in having a final decision on the merits” (ibid., at para.
57).

[33]                         
The test is the same for both categories because
concerns regarding trial fairness and the integrity of the justice system are
often linked and regularly arise in the same case.  Having one test for both
categories creates a coherent framework that avoids “schizophrenia” in the law
(O’Connor, at para. 71).  But while the framework is the same for both
categories, the test may — and often will — play out differently depending on
whether the “main” or “residual” category is invoked.  

[34]                         
Commencing with the first stage of the test,
when the main category is invoked, the question is whether the accused’s right
to a fair trial has been prejudiced and whether that prejudice will be carried
forward through the conduct of the trial; in other words, the concern is
whether there is ongoing unfairness to the accused.  

[35]                         
By contrast, when the residual category is
invoked, the question is whether the state has engaged in conduct that is
offensive to societal notions of fair play and decency and whether proceeding
with a trial in the face of that conduct would be harmful to the integrity of
the justice system.  To put it in simpler terms, there are limits on the type
of conduct society will tolerate in the prosecution of offences.  At times,
state conduct will be so troublesome that having a trial — even a fair one —
will leave the impression that the justice system condones conduct that offends
society’s sense of fair play and decency.  This harms the integrity of the
justice system.  In these kinds of cases, the first stage of the test is met.

[36]                         
In Canada (Minister of Citizenship and
Immigration) v. Tobiass, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 391, this Court described the
residual category in the following way:  

For a stay of proceedings to be
appropriate in a case falling into the residual category, it must appear that
the state misconduct is likely to continue in the future or that the carrying
forward of the prosecution will offend society’s sense of justice.  Ordinarily,
the latter condition will not be met unless the former is as well — society
will not take umbrage at the carrying forward of a prosecution unless it is likely
that some form of misconduct will continue.  There may be exceptional cases in
which the past misconduct is so egregious that the mere fact of going forward
in the light of it will be offensive.  But such cases should be relatively very
rare.  [para. 91] 

[37]                         
Two points of interest arise from this
description.  First, while it is generally true that the residual category will
be invoked as a result of state misconduct, this will not always be so. 
Circumstances may arise where the integrity of the justice system is implicated
in the absence of misconduct.  Repeatedly prosecuting an accused for the same
offence after successive juries have been unable to reach a verdict stands as
an example (see, e.g., R. v. Keyowski, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 657), as does
using the criminal courts to collect a civil debt (see, e.g., R. v. Waugh
(1985), 68 N.S.R. (2d) 247 (S.C., App. Div.)).

[38]                         
Second, in a residual category case, regardless
of the type of conduct complained of, the question to be answered at the first
stage of the test is the same: whether proceeding in light of the impugned
conduct would do further harm to the integrity of the justice system.  While I
do not question the distinction between ongoing and past misconduct, it does
not completely resolve the question of whether carrying on with a trial
occasions further harm to the justice system.  The court must still consider
whether proceeding would lend judicial condonation to the impugned conduct.  

[39]                         
At the second stage of the test, the question is
whether any other remedy short of a stay is capable of redressing the
prejudice.  Different remedies may apply depending on whether the prejudice
relates to the accused’s right to a fair trial (the main category) or whether
it relates to the integrity of the justice system (the residual category). 
Where the concern is trial fairness, the focus is on restoring an accused’s
right to a fair trial.  Here, procedural remedies, such as ordering a new
trial, are more likely to address the prejudice of ongoing unfairness.  Where
the residual category is invoked, however, and the prejudice complained of is
prejudice to the integrity of the justice system, remedies must be directed
towards that harm.  It must be remembered that for those cases which fall
solely within the residual category, the goal is not to provide redress
to an accused for a wrong that has been done to him or her in the past. 
Instead, the focus is on whether an alternate remedy short of a stay of
proceedings will adequately dissociate the justice system from the
impugned state conduct going forward.  

[40]                         
Finally, the balancing of interests that occurs
at the third stage of the test takes on added significance when the residual
category is invoked.  This Court has stated that the balancing need only be
undertaken where there is still uncertainty as to whether a stay is appropriate
after the first two parts of the test have been completed (Tobiass, at
para. 92).  When the main category is invoked, it will often be clear by the
time the balancing stage has been reached that trial fairness has not been
prejudiced or, if it has, that another remedy short of a stay is available to
address the concern.  In those cases, no balancing is required.  In rare cases,
it will be evident that state conduct has permanently prevented a fair trial
from taking place.  In these “clearest of cases”, the third and final balancing
step will often add little to the inquiry, as society has no interest in unfair
trials.

[41]                         
However, when the residual category is invoked,
the balancing stage takes on added importance.  Where prejudice to the
integrity of the justice system is alleged, the court is asked to decide which
of two options better protects the integrity of the system: staying the
proceedings, or having a trial despite the impugned conduct.  This inquiry
necessarily demands balancing.  The court must consider such things as the
nature and seriousness of the impugned conduct, whether the conduct is isolated
or reflects a systemic and ongoing problem, the circumstances of the accused,
the charges he or she faces, and the interests of society in having the charges
disposed of on the merits.[5] 
Clearly, the more egregious the state conduct, the greater the need for the
court to dissociate itself from it.  When the conduct in question shocks the
community’s conscience and/or offends its sense of fair play and decency, it
becomes less likely that society’s interest in a full trial on the merits will
prevail in the balancing process.  But in residual category cases, balance must
always be considered.  

[42]                         
This Court’s recent decision in R. v.
Bellusci, 2012 SCC 44, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 509, attests to the need for
balancing when the conduct in question falls solely within the residual
category.  In Bellusci, the accused was assaulted in the back of a van
by a prison guard while he was shackled and handcuffed.  The accused was
charged with assaulting the guard and intimidating a justice system
participant.  Fish J., writing for a unanimous Court, upheld the trial judge’s
decision to issue a stay of proceedings for state misconduct falling in the
residual category.  In doing so, he noted that the trial judge had 

appreciated the need to balance
the competing interests at play in contemplating a stay of proceedings. He
expressly took into account the difficult position of prison guards, the
importance to the justice system of ensuring their protection, the seriousness
of the charges against the accused, the integrity of the justice system, and
the nature and gravity of the violation of Mr. Bellusci’s rights. Only then did
he conclude that a stay was warranted.  [Emphasis added; para. 29.]  

[43]                         
The Ontario Court of Appeal has also recently
emphasized the importance of the balancing stage when the residual category is
in issue:  

In some sense, an accused who is
granted a stay under the residual category realizes a windfall.  Thus, it is
important to consider if the price of the stay of a charge against a particular
accused is worth the gain.  Does the advantage of
staying the charges against this accused outweigh the interest in having the
case decided on the merits?  In answering that question, a court will almost
inevitably have to engage in the type of balancing exercise that is referred to
in the third criterion.  [Emphasis added.]

(R. v. Zarinchang,
2010 ONCA 286, 99 O.R. (3d) 721, at para. 60)

[44]                         
Undoubtedly, the balancing of societal interests
that must take place and the “clearest of cases” threshold presents an accused
who seeks a stay under the residual category with an onerous burden.  Indeed,
in the residual category, cases warranting a stay of proceedings will be
“exceptional” and “very rare” (Tobiass, at para. 91).  But this is as it
should be.  It is only where the “affront to fair play and decency is
disproportionate to the societal interest in the effective prosecution of
criminal cases” that a stay of proceedings will be warranted (R. v. Conway,
[1989] 1 S.C.R. 1659, at p. 1667).  

[45]                         
To recapitulate, while the framework is the same
for both categories, the test may — and often will — play out differently
depending on whether the “main” or “residual” category is invoked.

[46]                         
The following hypothetical may serve as a useful
illustration.  Take a case where it is discovered, after trial, that the police
have tampered with the jury in order to secure the conviction of an accused.  Manifestly,
the police conduct would impinge on the accused’s right to a fair trial — but
it would also impinge on the integrity of the justice system.  

[47]                         
Ordering a new trial would probably redress the
unfairness of the original trial.  But the inquiry would not end there.  The
court would also have to decide whether ordering a new trial, or some other
remedy, would suffice to dissociate it from the prejudice occasioned to the
integrity of the justice system by the police misconduct.  If no remedy would suffice,
the court would have to engage in the balancing process and determine whether
the integrity of the justice system would be better served by a stay of
proceedings or a full trial on the merits.  Given the seriousness of the
misconduct — jury tampering strikes at the very heart of the criminal justice
system — the residual category might well necessitate a stay of proceedings to
redress the threat to the integrity of the justice system, even though the
unfairness that marred the first trial could be cured by a second trial. 

B.           
Whether a Stay of Proceedings Was Warranted in
the Instant Case

[48]                         
The standard of review for a remedy ordered
under s. 24(1)  of the Charter  is well established.  Appellate
intervention is warranted only where a trial judge misdirects him or herself in
law, commits a reviewable error of fact, or renders a decision that is “so
clearly wrong as to amount to an injustice” (Bellusci, at para. 19; Regan,
at para. 117; Tobiass, at para. 87; R. v. Bjelland, 2009
SCC 38, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 651, at paras. 15 and 51).  

[49]                         
In the instant case, the appellants acknowledge
that trial fairness is not in issue.  They accept that the trial judge viewed
the misconduct as coming within the residual category.  Approaching the matter
from that perspective, I am respectfully of the view that the trial judge erred
in assessing all three forms of alleged state misconduct.  

(1)        
The Medical Records

[50]                         
In order for the Crown’s conduct in securing Mr.
Piccirilli’s medical records to factor into a decision to stay proceedings, it
must pass the first stage of the test.  That is, the appellants must show that
Ms. Kovacevich’s conduct was prejudicial to the integrity of the justice
system.  The trial judge appears to have found that this requirement was met
when, after considering her conduct, he held that [translation] “[t]his conduct will be taken into
consideration in reviewing the abuse of process motion” (para. 57).

[51]                         
 The trial judge committed a palpable and
overriding error in reaching the conclusion that this conduct impinged on the
integrity of the justice system.  In the first place, he erred in concluding
that the Crown’s conduct was marked by a lack of transparency because the Crown
had [translation] “always refused
to disclose the source of the information” (para. 56).  In fact, the Crown
disclosed the source of the information within a matter of days.  In addition,
the trial judge failed to consider that Mr. Piccirilli had put his health in
issue in his application for interim release and had undertaken to provide the
court with his medical records.  The trial judge also failed to consider that
Ms. Kovacevich had asked the medical staff at the jail to provide an affidavit
explaining the medical care Mr. Piccirilli had received since his heart
attack.  It appears that Mr. Piccirilli’s doctor took it upon himself to
forward the appellant’s medical records to the Crown. 

[52]                         
In my view, when the Crown’s conduct is
considered free of the trial judge’s errors, it is clear that it occasioned no
prejudice to the integrity of the justice system.  Mr. Piccirilli had put the
state of his health in issue.  Ms. Kovacevich sought an affidavit from the jail
Mr. Piccirilli was being held in.  When she received more than she asked for —
Mr. Piccirilli’s confidential medical records — she immediately disclosed the
information to Mr. Piccirilli’s counsel.  Within a matter of days, she also
disclosed the source of the information.[6] 
Accordingly, the appellants’ argument fails at the first stage of the test.   

(2)        
The Police Collusion

[53]                         
The Court of Appeal disagreed with the trial
judge’s finding that Constables Brière and Sénéchal colluded to mislead
the court.  I too have serious reservations with the trial judge’s finding. 
Indeed, had I been the trial judge, I doubt that I would have reached the same
conclusion.  However, having seen the witnesses, the trial judge was in a
better position to assess the matter.  Accordingly, his finding is entitled to
deference.  

[54]                         
That said, at the first stage of the test, the
officers’ conduct must be looked at in context.  Cst. Brière changed his
testimony on a central issue: whether he or Mr. Babos opened the trunk of the
car.  He did so, however, after having testified at the preliminary inquiry. 
As an officer, he surely knew that this change would be the subject of questioning
by defence counsel.  Changes in an officer’s testimony are routinely exposed in
cross-examination.  And when Cst. Brière was predictably questioned about why
his story had changed, he immediately explained that he had spoken with Cst.
Sénéchal and had been [translation] “convinced”
of the true version of events.  There was no attempt by the officers to cover
up their discussions or to hide anything from the court.  To the extent this
amounts to collusion, it does so in the most technical sense.  Whatever threat
it poses to the integrity of the justice system must surely be slight.

[55]                         
However, given the trial judge’s finding, it is
necessary to proceed to the second stage of the test and ask whether there is
another remedy, short of a stay, capable of redressing the prejudice to the
integrity of the judicial system occasioned by the collusion.

[56]                         
Two concerns to the integrity of the justice
system arise out of the trial judge’s finding of collusion: (1) the impropriety
of police collusion designed to mislead the court, and (2) the Crown’s attempt
to introduce the firearm against Mr. Piccirilli in the wake of the trial
judge’s finding of collusion.  Manifestly, both are improper.  But there was
another remedy before the trial judge that would have addressed both, namely:
refusing to admit the firearm against Mr. Piccirilli even though he had no
standing under s. 8  of the Charter  to challenge its admissibility.  The
trial judge erred in failing to consider that alternative.

[57]                         
Excluding the firearm against Mr. Piccirilli
would serve to dissociate the court from the officers’ collusion and the
Crown’s misguided attempt, in the face of that finding, to introduce the
firearm against Mr. Piccirilli.  Both forms of misconduct were intended to
achieve the same end — admission of the firearm into evidence.  Excluding the
firearm against Mr. Piccirilli — even though it was likely admissible against
him — purges the problematic evidence from the trial, thereby dissociating the
court from the misconduct in question.  By doing so, it cannot be said that the
misconduct has a lingering effect on the integrity of the justice system.  In
my view, this remedy fully addresses any prejudice occasioned to the justice
system by the impugned conduct.  Hence, there is no need to go further in the
analysis.  

(3)        
The Crown’s Threatening Conduct

[58]                         
In the end, I view this case as turning on the
Crown’s threatening conduct.  

[59]                         
The distinction between the Crown’s conduct in
this case and legitimate plea bargaining practices should be made clear at the
outset.  It is perfectly proper for the Crown to indicate that it will drop
certain charges, grounded in the evidence, if the accused pleads guilty.  It is
also proper for a Crown to advise counsel that if evidence arises at the
preliminary inquiry that would support additional charges, they may be added to
the indictment under s. 574(1) (b) of the Criminal Code .[7]  Where discussions of
this sort occur with counsel after substantial disclosure has been provided,
the accused and his or her lawyer are able to make an informed decision as to
how to proceed and nothing improper has occurred.

[60]                         
The Crown’s conduct in this case was of a
different nature.  The impugned comments were made early on in the proceedings,
before the appellants and their counsel had sufficient disclosure to make an
informed decision as to how they wished to proceed.  Moreover, in at least one
instance, the comments occurred in the presence of one of the appellants, Mr.
Piccirilli.  And the Crown’s language was nothing short of threatening.  Mr.
Piccirilli was told, for example, that if he did not settle, he was going to be
[translation] “hit by a train”. 
Put simply, the Crown’s threats were intended to pressure the appellants into
foregoing their right to a trial.  

[61]                         
Without question, the bullying tactic to which
Ms. Tremblay resorted was reprehensible and unworthy of the dignity of her
office.  It should not be repeated by her or any other Crown.  In her capacity
as a Crown, Ms. Tremblay’s role was that of a quasi-judicial officer.  Her
function was to be “assistant to the Court in the furtherance of justice, and
not to act as counsel for any particular person or party” (Boucher v. The
Queen, [1955] S.C.R. 16, at p. 25).  In threatening to charge Mr.
Piccirilli with more offences if he did not plead guilty, Ms. Tremblay betrayed
her role as a Crown.  Manifestly it is the type of conduct the court should
dissociate itself from.

[62]                         
However, the threats must be considered in their
context.  With respect, the trial judge did not do so.  Here, there were
several factors which the trial judge failed to consider.  With respect, he
erred in this regard. 

[63]                         
The threats were made more than a year before
the trial began.  The 18-month long silence of the appellants and their counsel
sheds some light on how seriously they took the threats.  Had they been taken
seriously, one might have expected counsel to respond immediately.  Surely the
proper course of action was not to sit back for over a year before applying,
mid-trial, for a stay of proceedings.  Instead, counsel should have confronted
Ms. Tremblay and, failing an adequate response by her, brought the matter
immediately to the attention of a senior Crown or a judge.  That way, Ms.
Tremblay could have been removed from the file during the early stages of the
proceedings.  Be that as it may, as it turned out, she was removed from the
case months before the trial started — and it was not until six months after
the trial was underway that the threats first came to light.

[64]                         
As indicated, context is essential in
considering the seriousness of the threatening conduct.  By the time the
misconduct came to light, Ms. Tremblay had long since been removed
from the case and no longer played any part in it.  The trial judge
acknowledged this fact but did not consider it to be an attenuating factor
because the Crown’s office had taken no steps [translation]
“to remedy or even try to remedy the situation” once the threats were
revealed and had instead “remained entrenched in its position” (para. 66). 
With respect, this observation does not accurately reflect the facts.  At the
point when the threats first came to light, they were unproven and Ms.
Tremblay’s health did not allow her to testify.[8] 
The Crown’s office did not condone Ms. Tremblay’s actions, but simply left it to
the appellants to prove the threats.  Surely the Crown’s office cannot be
faulted for taking that approach, especially in the absence of any evidence
suggesting that Ms. Tremblay’s conduct was systemic.

[65]                         
Moreover, the trial judge did not consider the
passage of time between when the threats were made and when they were first
brought to light.  He made no mention of this in his reasons.  In this regard,
while I agree in general with Justice Abella that the passage of time itself
cannot  “retroactively cure intolerable state conduct” (para. 82), its
significance here is that it serves as a yardstick against which to measure
just how serious Ms. Tremblay’s conduct was perceived by the defence.  The fact
that defence counsel took no steps for over a year to raise concerns — and
then, almost by accident in the context of a s. 11 (b) delay motion —
sheds important light on this subject.  The trial judge erred in failing to
take this into account.

[66]                         
Manifestly, Ms. Tremblay’s misconduct was
serious enough to warrant proceeding to the second stage of the test.  That
said, in my respectful view, when the mitigating factors which the trial judge
failed to consider are taken into account, the trial judge’s conclusion that
the threats amounted to [translation] “an
abuse of the worst kind” is simply not borne out (para. 78). 

[67]                         
Turning to the second stage of the test, as no
argument was made that there was an alternate remedy capable of redressing the
particular harm caused to the integrity of the justice system by the threats, I
need not finally decide whether such a remedy was available.  Instead, I turn
to the third stage of the test, namely, whether Ms. Tremblay’s conduct was
sufficiently egregious to warrant a stay of proceedings.

[68]                         
The answer lies in the balancing process — an
exercise which the trial judge did not undertake.  The question at this stage
is whether the integrity of the justice system is better preserved by staying
the proceedings, or proceeding to a trial in the face of the Crown’s
threatening conduct.

[69]                         
This balancing requires weighing the seriousness
of the misconduct against the societal interest in having a trial.  At this
stage, the very serious nature of the charges facing the appellants — 22
charges concerning firearms, illegal drugs, and organized crime — looms large. 
Society has a profound interest in seeing justice done by having the guilt or
innocence of the appellants determined through a full trial on the merits. 
When the impugned misconduct — threats uttered more than a year before trial by
a Crown no longer on the case — is weighed against society’s interest in a
trial, I am satisfied that this is not one of the “clearest of cases” where the
exceptional remedy of a stay of proceedings is warranted.  

[70]                         
The appellants contend that this case is analogous
to United States of America v. Cobb, 2001 SCC 19, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 587, a
case in which this Court upheld a stay of proceedings.  In Cobb, the
accused were facing extradition proceedings from Canada to the United States. 
They were granted a stay after the American prosecutor on the file hinted to
the media that uncooperative fugitives would be subjected to rape in prison,
and the judge presiding over their trial in the United States commented that
uncooperative defendants would get the maximum jail sentence legally
available.  

[71]                         
This case is a far cry from Cobb.  In Cobb,
the American prosecutor had threatened the accused with sexual violence.  Here,
the Crown threatened to charge the accused with additional offences if they did
not plead guilty.  While that was improper, the threats related to something
she could have done legally under s. 574(1) (b) of the Criminal Code . 
Moreover, the decision to stay the proceedings in Cobb was motivated in
large part by the fact that the prosecutor who made the threats remained in
charge of the prosecutions.  This Court noted that extraditing the accused
would return them to an “ominous climate” in which the American prosecutor and
judge would play a “large, if not decisive role” in determining their “ultimate
fate” (Cobb, at para. 43).  Here, Ms. Tremblay was off the case long
before trial.  In my view, Cobb provides little or no assistance to the
appellants.    

VI.       
Conclusion

[72]                         
In deciding that a stay of proceedings is
unwarranted in this case, I have assessed the three forms of alleged misconduct
individually.  The Crown’s conduct in securing Mr. Piccirilli’s medical records
occasioned no prejudice to the integrity of the justice system.  The harm
caused by the finding of police collusion was curable through an alternate
remedy: excluding the firearm from evidence against both appellants.  And the
Crown’s threatening conduct, while reprehensible, did not approximate the type
of shocking conduct needed to justify a stay. 

[73]                         
This case lent itself to an individualistic approach. 
The three alleged instances of misconduct were separate and distinct, committed
at different times by different players.  There was no link between them.  And
in only one instance — the Crown’s threatening behaviour — was it necessary to
consider the third stage of the test and balance the Crown’s misconduct against
society’s interest in a trial on the merits.  That said, I should not be taken
as suggesting that an individualistic approach should always be followed. 
Indeed, a judge who is required to balance several instances of misconduct
against the societal interest in a trial will almost certainly wish to consider
the conduct cumulatively and in its full context.  As well, there may be cases
where the nature and number of incidents, though individually unworthy of a
stay, will require one when considered together.  But this is not such a case.

[74]                         
For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeals. 


                    The following are the reasons
delivered by

[75]                         
Abella J. (dissenting) — A stay should only be imposed
in the clearest of cases, as Justice Moldaver points out, since it has the
effect of precluding proceedings which determine the merits of a case,
something to which the public — and the parties — are entitled.  But the public
is also entitled to have confidence in the integrity of the justice system.  A
Crown who makes threats intended to bully an accused into foregoing his or her
right to a trial, takes fatal aim at the heart of the public’s confidence in
that integrity. 

Analysis

[76]                         
A stay may be justified for an abuse of process
under the residual category when the state’s conduct “contravenes fundamental
notions of justice and thus undermines the integrity of the judicial process” (R.
v. O’Connor, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, at para. 73). A stay may be
justified, in exceptional circumstances, when the conduct “is so egregious that
the mere fact of going forward [with the trial] in the light of it [would] be
offensive” (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Tobiass,
[1997] 3 S.C.R. 391, at para. 91). 

[77]                         
There are two public interests at play: “the
affront to fair play and decency” and “the effective prosecution of criminal
cases”.  Where the affront is “disproportionate”, the administration of justice
is “best served by staying the proceedings” (R. v. Conway, [1989] 1
S.C.R. 1659, at p. 1667).

[78]                         
In other words, when the conduct is so
profoundly and demonstrably inconsistent with the public perception of what a
fair justice system requires, proceeding with a trial means condoning
unforgivable conduct.

[79]                         
The Crown who is the focus of this appeal
threatened one of the co-accused, Sergio Piccirilli, on three separate
occasions. The threats were made twice to Mr. Piccirilli personally and once to
his lawyer. All were to the effect that if Mr. Piccirilli did not plead guilty,
he would be charged with additional, serious offences. By the time the trial
started several months after the last threat, the Crown was on medical leave
and a new Crown was assigned to the case.  New charges were in fact brought.  

[80]                         
The trial judge concluded that the Crown’s
conduct was in “bad faith”, “unacceptable”, “intolerable”, “unjustifiable”, and
was one of the “exceptional and rare cases” that justified a stay.

[81]                         
The Court of Appeal agreed that the threats were
“unacceptable” and “outrageous”, but found that the trial judge erred in
imposing a stay because he did not undertake a sufficient balancing or
sufficiently consider the context.  That context included the fact that the
threats were made more than a year before the trial began, that counsel did not
react immediately, and that the Crown was replaced for health reasons months
before the trial started.  In other words, the impact of the threats was
mitigated by the passage of time and the change in personnel.

[82]                         
With great respect, however, the passage of time
does not operate to attenuate what was unpardonable conduct. Time is not a
legal remedy for a fundamental breach of the Crown’s role, and cannot
retroactively cure intolerable state conduct.  The reason, therefore, that the
trial judge did not mention the passage of time in assessing the impact of the
threats on the public’s confidence in a fair justice system, is that it was not
relevant. It was the fact that the threats were made at all that was key, not
when they were made (United States of America v. Shulman, [2001]
1 S.C.R. 616).

[83]                         
Moreover, I am not persuaded that a balancing
exercise was required here. The trial judge was unequivocal in concluding that
the abuse justified a stay. There was none of the uncertainty as to the
propriety of a stay that this Court said was a condition precedent to the need
for a balancing exercise (Tobiass, at para. 92; R. v. Regan,
[2002] 1 S.C.R. 297, at para. 57).  

[84]                         
But in any event, it is not at all clear to me
how one goes about such a balancing. When a trial judge has concluded that
conduct is “so egregious that the mere fact of going forward in the light of it
will be offensive” (Tobiass, at para. 91), against what does one
balance that singularly egregious state conduct? When a trial judge has found
that the conduct cannot be condoned because it is such an exceptional assault
on the public’s sense of justice, it seems to me to be conceptually
inconsistent to nonetheless ask the court to undermine its own conclusion by
re-weighing the half of the scale that contains the public’s interest in trials
on the merits.  It is one thing to require that trial judges look at the
“competing interests at play” (R. v. Bellusci, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 509, at
para. 29) before concluding that the state conduct could not be condoned,
but how, having concluded that it could not be condoned, can such conduct be
subjected to yet another balancing of factors to determine whether it is
nonetheless pardonable? 

[85]                         
Of course the public has an interest in trials
on the merits, but it has an even greater interest in knowing that when the
state is involved in proceedings, particularly those that can result in an
individual’s loss of liberty, it will put fairness above expedience. Justice is
not only about results, it is about how those results are obtained. When a
Crown threatens an accused with additional offences if he or she does not plead
guilty, the public’s interest in the results of a trial must yield to the
transcendent interest in protecting the public’s confidence in the integrity of
the justice system.

[86]                         
In Bellusci, this Court cautioned
appellate courts to exercise restraint with respect to the findings of the
trial judge, intervening only if the trial judge “misdirects himself or if his
decision is so clearly wrong as to amount to an injustice” (para. 17; see also Regan,
at para. 117; Tobiass, at para. 87). There was no such misdirection or
injustice here. On the contrary, the trial judge concluded that a stay was
justified in order to prevent an injustice to the justice system
itself.  I agree.

[87]                         
I would allow the appeals.

“577” is a reference to s. 577  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985,
c. C-46 , which empowers a Crown to prefer a “direct indictment”, bypassing an
accused’s right to a preliminary inquiry.





[2]
At the preliminary inquiry, Cst. Brière testified that he had opened the trunk
of the car. 





[3]
Cst. Brière testified that Mr. Babos opened the trunk most of the way, and that
he opened the trunk [translation] “a
little bit” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 217). 

 





[4]
As matters turned out, the trial judge never did make a final ruling on the
admissibility of the firearm against Mr. Piccirilli.  Instead, he ended up
staying the proceedings against Mr. Piccirilli and in doing so, he took into
account the Crown’s attempt to introduce the firearm against him despite his
earlier finding of collusion on the part of the officers.





[5]
At this stage, whether the impugned conduct is a systemic and ongoing
problem or lies purely in the past may also become relevant.  Where the conduct
is ongoing and systemic, it may be more difficult for the court to dissociate
itself from it with anything less than a stay.





[6]
Admittedly, the Crown’s initial refusal to disclose the source of the
information was bizarre, but this refusal was short-lived.  





[7]
Section 574(1) (b) of the Criminal Code  allows the Crown to lay
additional charges, supported by the evidence that has been adduced at the
preliminary inquiry.

Fresh evidence was tendered before this Court in which Ms. Tremblay denies ever
having made the threats in question.  Given the disposition of the appeal, this
evidence is irrelevant and there is no need to consider the Crown’s motion to
adduce it.",2014-02-21 00:00:00,CA Supreme Court

                    Criminal
law — Evidence — Admissibility — Expert evidence — Curative proviso — Accused
charged with importation of cocaine and possession for purpose of trafficking —
Cocaine found in concealed compartment of truck accused was driving — Accused
denying knowledge of presence of cocaine — Police officer testifying he had
never encountered blind courier over course of his many investigations —
Whether trial judge erred in admitting and relying upon this expert evidence of
police officer — If so, whether curative proviso applicable — Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, s. 686(1) (b)(iii).

                    S
was convicted of importation and possession for the purposes of trafficking of
50 kg of cocaine.  The cocaine was seized by border officers who found it
hidden in a concealed compartment of a pickup truck S attempted to drive from
the United States into Canada.  The case against S was entirely circumstantial
and the only issue at trial was whether he knew of the cocaine in the truck.  S
claimed that an acquaintance had asked him to drive the truck and that he had
no knowledge of the cocaine.  The trial judge rejected S’s testimony in its
entirety.  The judge found that S knew of the cocaine based on:  its amount and
value; expert evidence from a police officer pertaining to the customs and
habits of drug couriers, including the fact that in his many years’ experience
he had never encountered a blind courier; and evidence that S had detached the
fob that controlled access to the secret compartment from his key chain before
handing the keys to the border officer.  The trial judge also relied on
additional items of circumstantial evidence that pointed towards S’s guilty
knowledge.  On appeal, S argued that the trial judge should not have admitted
or relied on the expert evidence of the police officer and in particular, that
portion of his evidence relating to his own experience with blind couriers.  A
majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal.

                    Held
(McLachlin C.J. and LeBel J. dissenting):  The appeal should be
dismissed.

                    Per
Abella, Rothstein, Moldaver, Karakatsanis and Wagner JJ.:  The police
officer’s evidence relating to his own experience with blind couriers was
inadmissible and the trial judge erred in relying upon it.  Admission of expert
evidence depends on the Mohan criteria of relevance, necessity in
assisting the trier of fact, absence of any exclusionary rule and a properly
qualified expert.  It is not enough for a trial judge to simply consider the Mohan
criteria at the outset of an expert’s testimony and make an initial ruling as
to the admissibility of the evidence.  The judge must do his or her best to
ensure that throughout, the expert’s testimony remains within the proper boundaries
of expert evidence.  This includes ensuring, so far as possible, that the
content of the evidence itself is properly the subject of expert evidence.  Where
mistakes are made and the testimony strays beyond the proper scope of expert
evidence, it is imperative that the trial judge not assign any weight to the
inadmissible parts.

                    In
this case, the fact that the police officer had never encountered a blind
courier in his many investigations was neither necessary nor relevant to the issue
facing the trial judge — whether S knew about the cocaine.  The officer’s
evidence was not necessary because determining whether S knew about the cocaine
was not beyond the knowledge and experience of the judge and was not technical
or scientific in nature.  Moreover, the guilt or innocence of accused persons
that the police officer had encountered in the past was not legally relevant to
S’s guilt or innocence. In other words, the officer’s testimony was of no
probative value in determining whether S knew about the cocaine and its lack of
relevance is sufficient to justify its exclusion.

                    The
inadmissible testimony, however, forms one sentence of a 16‑page judgment
that is otherwise flawless.  In the judgment, the judge provided a long list of
reasons for rejecting S’s testimony.  And apart from the one aspect of the
expert’s testimony that he should not have considered, the judge provided an
equally impressive list of reasons for concluding that S knew about the cocaine.

                    While
the trial judge’s error in this case is not harmless, the evidence of S’s guilt
is so overwhelming that a trier of fact would inevitably convict.  Hence, the
second branch of the curative proviso can be applied to sustain S’s
convictions.  The fob evidence on its own was devastating.  But it did not
stand alone; it was part of a web of circumstantial evidence pointing towards
S’s guilt.  When considering the second branch of the curative proviso in a
circumstantial case, it is necessary to look at the whole of the admissible
evidence in assessing the strength of the case.  It is not the task of an
appellate court to parse each item of evidence in search of a possible innocent
explanation.  If that were so, it would be impossible to ever satisfy the
second branch. 

                    Per
McLachlin C.J. and LeBel J. (dissenting):  The police officer’s
evidence that in his many investigations he had never encountered a blind
courier strayed from what would be admissible expert evidence.  His testimony
was equivalent to a statement that individuals in S’s position always know
about the drugs. It is a short step from such evidence to an inference that S
must have known about the cocaine.  The evidence effectively amounted to an
opinion that S possessed the mens rea for the offences with which he was
charged, which was the issue in this trial.  Whether it was admissible
therefore requires special scrutiny.

                    Applying
the Mohan criteria, the expert evidence should not have been admitted.  The
evidence was not necessary, as it was open to the judge to infer what S knew or
did not know.  Nor was it relevant.  The officer’s opinion invited the judge to
find that S knew about the cocaine on the basis that all people driving
vehicles containing hidden drugs know about the drugs.  In addition to usurping
the trial judge’s role in resolving the issue of guilt or innocence, the
opinion depended on an unacceptable and unfair inference. 

                    Given
the trial judge’s error was not a harmless one that would have no impact on the
verdict, this is not an appropriate case for application of the second branch
of the curative proviso.  The issue in applying the second branch is not
whether the trial judge could make the inference he did or whether that
inference was determinative of guilt, but whether it was the only rational
conclusion. In this case, it was not.

                    While
ordering a new trial places demands on judicial resources, this cannot override
S’s right to a fair trial based solely on admissible evidence.  The trial judge
relied on inadmissible evidence and this was a serious error.  If this Court
excludes evidence described by the trial judge as one of the foundations of his
conclusion that S was guilty, it cannot then hold that the evidence against S
was nonetheless overwhelming without engaging in pure speculation.  Such a
conclusion would contradict what the trial judge himself wrote and would rest
on an improper reweighing of the remaining evidence.  The curative proviso does
not permit this Court to deny a retrial in such circumstances.

I.             
Introduction

[1]                             
On January 25, 2005, the appellant, Ajitpal
Singh Sekhon, was charged with unlawfully importing cocaine and unlawfully
possessing cocaine for the purpose of trafficking.  He was arrested when he
attempted to cross the border from Washington State into British Columbia.  The
key issue at trial was whether Mr. Sekhon knew about the cocaine that was
secreted in the pickup truck he was driving.  The trial judge found that he
did.  He based his decision in part on the testimony of an expert police
witness who testified about the customs and practices of the drug trade.  One
aspect of the expert’s evidence strayed beyond the proper scope of expert
testimony.  As such, it was inadmissible and should not have been relied on by
the trial judge.

[2]                             
The flawed testimony upon which the trial judge
relied forms one sentence of a 16-page judgment that is otherwise flawless.  In
particular, the trial judge provided a long list of reasons for disbelieving
the appellant and rejecting his testimony as incredible.  And apart from the
one aspect of the expert’s evidence that he should not have considered, the
trial judge provided an equally impressive list of reasons for concluding that
the appellant was aware of the cocaine secreted in the pickup truck.

[3]                             
In the end, the only issue of concern is whether
the curative proviso in s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , can be applied to sustain the convictions.  I
believe it can.  While the error relating to the flawed expert testimony cannot
be swept aside as harmless, the evidence establishing the appellant’s guilty
knowledge — and thus his guilt — is overwhelming.  Hence, the second
branch of the curative proviso can safely be applied to sustain the
convictions. 

[4]                             
Because this case turns on the application of
the second branch of the curative proviso, I find it necessary to review the
evidence and the trial judge’s findings of fact in some detail.

II.          
Facts

[5]                             
On January 25, 2005, shortly after 4:30 p.m.,
Mr. Sekhon attempted to drive a pickup truck across the border from Washington
State into British Columbia.  He was the sole occupant of the truck.

[6]                             
The customs officer at the primary inspection
booth noted that Mr. Sekhon appeared tense and was gripping the steering
wheel.  When asked about the purpose of his trip, he told the customs officer
that he had been delivering cheques to workers at a farm.  He was unable to
produce any receipts or pay stubs to support his stated purpose for travel.

[7]                             
The customs officer referred Mr. Sekhon for a
secondary examination.  Mr. Sekhon was told to park the vehicle in a secondary
parking area and go to the customs office.

[8]                             
At the customs office, Mr. Sekhon was asked for
the keys to the pickup truck.  He complied and turned them over to the customs
officer. 

[9]                             
Mr. Sekhon began to pace nervously around the
customs office.  At one point, he attempted to leave the building but was
directed to return.  Meanwhile, customs officers undertook an inspection of the
truck.  This led to the discovery of packages of a white powdery substance,
believed to be cocaine, hidden in a concealed compartment. 

[10]                         
After the white powdery substance was
discovered, Mr. Sekhon was informed that he was being detained.  He was advised
of his rights and asked to empty his pockets.  Among the items produced were a
key fob on a chain, a cellular phone, and an envelope. 

[11]                         
The cellular phone began ringing and continued
to ring for the duration of the time that it was in the possession of the
customs officers. 

[12]                         
Mr. Sekhon indicated that the key fob was his
and that it was for the truck. 

[13]                         
The envelope bore the name “Westhall Properties
Ltd.”.  On the envelope were the following handwritten notations: “Combo lock
34-11-20, time enterphone 204, Parking 284, locker 185” (A.R., vol. V, at p.
82).

[14]                         
Mr. Sekhon was then arrested and escorted to a
detention cell in the customs building.  He was once again advised of his
rights and chose to speak to a lawyer over the phone.  After this phone call, a
customs officer went to check on Mr. Sekhon.  He noticed a wet, partially
chewed-up piece of green paper on the floor of Mr. Sekhon’s cell.  When asked
about the paper, Mr. Sekhon told the customs officer that he had retrieved it
from the commercial counter in the customs office.  Upon being confronted with
the fact that there was no green paper in that area, Mr. Sekhon said it had
come from the truck. 

[15]                         
Further examination of the hidden compartment of
the truck revealed the presence of 50 bricks of cocaine, each weighing one
kilogram.  The hidden compartment was equipped with a hydraulic jack mechanism
enabling the compartment to be opened and closed.  The key fob recovered from
Mr. Sekhon had been engineered to open and close the compartment if the correct
buttons were pressed in a particular sequence.

[16]                         
Mr. Sekhon was charged with unlawfully importing
cocaine into Canada contrary to s. 6(1)  of the Controlled Drugs and
Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19 , and with unlawfully possessing cocaine
for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of that Act.  

III.       
Proceedings Below

[17]                         
Judge Dohm, of the Provincial Court of British
Columbia, presided over Mr. Sekhon’s trial.  The sole issue at trial was
whether the Crown could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Sekhon had the
requisite mens rea for the two offences charged, that is, knowledge of
the cocaine. 

A.          
Crown Evidence

[18]                         
The Crown called a police officer, Sgt.
Arsenault, to give expert evidence regarding the customs and practices of the
drug trade.  Specifically, Sgt. Arsenault’s evidence was to focus on chains of
distribution, distribution routes, means of transportation, methods of
concealment, packaging, value, cost and profit margins.  Sgt. Arsenault had
been a police officer for 33 years and had been involved in approximately 1,000
cases involving the importation of cocaine.  His qualifications as an expert
witness were admitted.

[19]                         
Sgt. Arsenault testified at length about the
customs of the cocaine trade.  He valued the amount of cocaine found in the
pickup truck to be worth between $1,500,000 and $1,750,000 at the wholesale
level.  He explained that the recruitment of a drug courier takes time and that
an organization will not typically entrust a first-time courier with a large
shipment.  Instead, the courier’s reliability will be tested with smaller
shipments.  He testified that it was significant that Mr. Sekhon had been given
a fob that could open the hidden compartment; the fact that he “actually [ha]d
hands-on access to the shipment itself” showed that he had “a lot more trust .
. . within the group” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 151).

[20]                         
Towards the end of his examination-in-chief, the
following exchange occurred between Crown counsel and Sgt. Arsenault: 

Q  Officer, you described earlier that you’ve been involved in
approximately 1,000 investigations involving the importation of cocaine over
your 33-year career?

 

A  That is correct, Your Honour,
yes.[1]

 

Q  In approximately how many of those investigations were you able
to determine that the person importing the cocaine did not know about the
commodity that they were importing?

 

A  I have never encountered
it, personally. 

 

Q  Have you ever heard of a -- the use of a blind courier or a
courier who doesn’t know about the commodity that he is driving?

 

A  I -- I’ve certainly heard that argument being raised on -- on
occasion, primarily in court, not during my investigations.  [Footnote added;
A.R., vol. III, at p. 144.]

This brief exchange
contains the problematic evidence that is central to this appeal. It comprises
but a few lines of Sgt. Arsenault’s 34 pages of testimony. I shall refer to it
as the “Impugned Testimony”. 

B.           
Defence Evidence

[21]                         
The defence called two witnesses — Mr. Sekhon
himself and Mr. Sekhon’s nephew, Mr. Grewal. 

[22]                         
Mr. Sekhon presented the following version of
events.  On the day of his arrest, he said that he had been working on one of
his family farms in Abbotsford.  At some point in the afternoon, Mr. Grewal
came to pick him up.  Mr. Grewal asked Mr. Sekhon if he would accompany Mr.
Grewal to Washington State to deliver employee pay cheques and to check on some
pruning.  While in Washington State, Mr. Sekhon received a phone call from his
friend Chris, who was shopping at a nearby mall, and they agreed to meet at the
mall for lunch.  On the way to the mall, Mr. Grewal received a telephone call
asking him to return to one of the farms in Canada.  Mr. Grewal left Mr.
Sekhon at the mall because he knew that Mr. Sekhon would be able to get back to
Canada.  Over lunch, Chris told Mr. Sekhon that he had left his pickup truck in
the area the night before.  He had been drinking and received a ride home to
British Columbia with friends.  Since he had come back to the U.S. that day in
another vehicle, Chris asked Mr. Sekhon to drive his truck back to Canada for
him.  Mr. Sekhon agreed and Chris gave him a key attached to a fob.  Chris
showed Mr. Sekhon how to use the fob to lock and unlock the truck and activate
the truck alarm. 

[23]                         
Mr. Sekhon and Chris drove to the border
crossing in two separate vehicles.  Mr. Sekhon testified that after his release
from custody, he attempted to find Chris but was unsuccessful.  He maintained
that, even though he had known Chris for two years, he did not know Chris’s
last name and only had his cell phone number, which had been disconnected. 

[24]                         
Mr. Sekhon testified that he did not know that
there was cocaine in the truck, and that he had no reason to be suspicious of
Chris’s request. 

[25]                         
Mr. Grewal corroborated most of Mr. Sekhon’s
testimony up to the point of dropping Mr. Sekhon off at the mall. 

C.           
Reasons of the Trial Judge

(1)        
The Trial Judge’s View of Mr. Sekhon’s Evidence

[26]                         
The trial judge found numerous difficulties with
the version of events presented by Mr. Sekhon.  He discussed at length no less
than 12 deficiencies inherent in his story.  Some of the more glaring of these
are reviewed below. 

[27]                         
First, the trial judge found that it made “no
sense” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 18) that Chris would have left a vehicle containing
$1.5 million worth of cocaine parked overnight on a city street while he went
out drinking with friends.  Moreover, it would be “completely illogical” (p.
19) for Chris to drive to Washington State the following day without having a
firm plan, before leaving B.C., as to how the extra vehicle would be returned
to Canada.

[28]                         
Second, the trial judge observed that importing
50 kg of cocaine is clearly a risky venture and that Chris would logically want
to take steps to reduce the risk if in fact he had chosen to use a blind
courier.  Yet if Mr. Sekhon were asked at the border whether anyone had given
him anything to bring back into Canada — the question being a common one — the
truthful response would have been “the truck” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 20).  The
fact that Mr. Sekhon did not even know Chris’s last name would likely have
resulted in a referral for a secondary inspection and increased the risk that
the cocaine would be found.  The trial judge found it unlikely that Chris would
use Mr. Sekhon as a blind courier without providing him with more information
about the truck, including the name of its owner. 

[29]                         
Third, the trial judge noted that, according to
Mr. Sekhon’s testimony, when Chris gave the truck keys to Mr. Sekhon, they were
attached to the fob’s chain (A.R., vol. I, at p. 22).  The keys were connected
to this chain by a clasp that was not prone to open accidentally.  Manual
manipulation was required to separate the keys from the chain.  Significantly,
there was no fob attached to the keys that Mr. Sekhon provided to the customs
officer — the fob was only revealed later when Mr. Sekhon was asked to empty
his pockets.  The trial judge conducted a thorough review of the circumstances
surrounding the fob and concluded, based on all the evidence, that Mr. Sekhon
had manually separated the key from the fob after turning off the ignition in
the secondary inspection area.  Based on Mr. Sekhon’s version of the events,
there would have been no reason for doing so.  If, on the other hand, Mr.
Sekhon knew about the hidden compartment, he would logically want to distance
the fob, which controlled access to the hidden compartment, from the truck.

[30]                         
Fourth, the trial judge rejected Mr. Sekhon’s
explanation as to why, at the time of his arrest, he was in possession of the
envelope on which a lock combination was handwritten.  Mr. Sekhon testified
that the information related to a condominium unit he had been interested in
renting.  The trial judge found that it was “completely unbelievable” (A.R.,
vol. I, at p. 23) that information about the combination for a locker at that
unit would be provided to a person who had only expressed an interest in
renting.  The trial judge found it reasonable to conclude that the information
related to a storage locker, and noted that the cocaine would likely need to be
stored in Canada.  The trial judge also pointed out that the envelope was not
in Mr. Sekhon’s wallet, but in the pocket of his farm clothes.  On Mr. Sekhon’s
version of the events, there was no logical reason for having the envelope in
his possession at the time of his arrest.  It made no sense that he would have
put this envelope in his farm clothes; nor did it make any sense that he would
have been wearing his farm clothes when he viewed the condominium unit.

[31]                         
Fifth, the trial judge identified “glaring
inconsistencies” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 24) between what Mr. Sekhon told the
customs officers and what he testified to in court.  For example, when Mr.
Sekhon was initially asked by the customs officer whether he had any receipts
or pay stubs available to support his stated purpose of travel to the U.S., Mr.
Sekhon said he had given them to his accountant.  The trial judge pointed out
that “[i]n court, there was no mention of any accountant, nor could there be,
because it was Mr. Grewal and not the accused who dealt with the cheques and
the workers” (p. 25).  Another example highlighted by the trial judge was the
fact that Mr. Sekhon told a second customs officer that he took the cheques to
his friend’s uncle at the Arco gas station in Linden.  The trial judge noted
that “[t]he accused’s court testimony could not logically include a friend’s
uncle and there was no mention of any Arco gas station” (ibid.).  The
trial judge found that this was not simply an ordinary case of nerves that an
average person might experience at a border crossing.  He noted that some of
the inconsistent statements were made before the cocaine was found and that it
was “difficult to understand” how a true blind courier could be so nervous at
the border that he would misspeak to the extent of the inconsistencies in
question (ibid.).

[32]                         
Sixth, the trial judge addressed the fact that
Mr. Sekhon chewed up a piece of green paper while he was in the detention cell
at the immigration office.  He found that Mr. Sekhon’s explanation regarding
the origin of the paper was “simply unbelievable, as is the accused’s
suggestion that he chewed the paper because it was a habit he had at the time”
(A.R., vol. I, at p. 26).  On this point, the trial judge found that it was
“not unreasonable to conclude that he chewed it up because it contained some
potentially incriminating writing” (p. 33).

[33]                         
In the end, it is abundantly clear that the
trial judge disbelieved Mr. Sekhon’s explanation as to how he came to be
driving a truck, containing 50 kg of cocaine, across the border.  His reasons
are replete with observations that Mr. Sekhon’s version of events made “no
sense”, that it was “illogical”, “difficult to accept”, “difficult to
comprehend”, “incredible”, “not at all convincing”, “not credible”, “completely
unbelievable” and contained “glaring inconsistencies” (A.R., vol. I, at pp. 18,
19, 23, 24, 26 and 27).  As stated earlier, he pinpointed and discussed at
length no less than 12 problems with the evidence given by Mr. Sekhon.  He
concluded that there were “far too many coincidences in the accused’s evidence
to make his version of events plausible” (p. 27) and that “the likelihood that
all these coincidences happened within this limited time frame is so remote as
to render the accused’s evidence unbelievable.  These coincidences present as
created to fit the evidence” (p. 28).

(2)        
The Trial Judge’s View of the Crown’s Case

[34]                         
The trial judge completed his assessment of Mr.
Sekhon’s testimony as follows: 

   The net
effect of these difficulties is that I do not believe the evidence presented by
the accused, nor does it raise any reasonable doubt as to the accused’s guilt
on the two charges, and specifically his knowledge of the cocaine in the
truck’s hidden compartment. [A.R., vol. I, at p. 29]

[35]                         
The trial judge then went on to discuss the
Crown’s evidence.  He found three pieces of circumstantial evidence to be “very
significant” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 30).  First was the value of cocaine
involved.  He concluded, in accordance with Sgt. Arsenault’s testimony, that
the owners of such a significant amount of cocaine would want a trusted and
reliable individual handling the shipment, and “[w]ith that proven reliability
and trust naturally comes some knowledge” (ibid.).

[36]                         
The second significant piece of evidence also
came from Sgt. Arsenault’s testimony, as follows: 

I conclude [Sgt. Arsenault] was a fair,
unbiased witness. I accept his evidence. Included therein is his opinion that
individuals tasked with importing controlled substances in amounts of this size
would be part of a larger, closely-knit organization and they would know what
commodity they were importing, as that would be factored into the fee they had
negotiated.  Sgt. Arsenault also testified that in the thousand or more
cocaine-importing investigations he has been involved in he has never
encountered a blind courier, that being a person who does not know the nature
or existence of the commodity being moved from one location to another. 
[Emphasis added; A.R., vol. I, at pp. 30-31.]

The last sentence of this
passage references the Impugned Testimony. 

[37]                         
The third piece of evidence that the trial judge
found to be significant was the fob.  As mentioned earlier, the trial judge
made a finding of fact that the fob and the ignition key were connected by the
chain until Mr. Sekhon turned off the ignition in the secondary inspection
area.  Prior to this point, there was no opportunity and no rational reason for
separating them.  The trial judge concluded that Mr. Sekhon separated the two
in an attempt to distance the fob from the truck because he knew that the fob controlled
access to the hidden compartment.  Mr. Sekhon takes no issue with that finding.

[38]                         
In addition to these three significant pieces of
evidence, the trial judge noted other circumstantial evidence that also
supported his finding that Mr. Sekhon knew about the cocaine: the incessant
ringing of Mr. Sekhon’s cell phone at a time when others within the
organization would be wanting to know whether the drugs had crossed the border,
the writing on the envelope that Mr. Sekhon had in his possession at the time
he was arrested, Mr. Sekhon’s
excessively nervous behaviour in the customs office, the fact that Mr. Sekhon
chewed up the piece of green paper while in the detention cell, and the fact
that Mr. Sekhon told a number of lies to the customs officers.

[39]                         
In the result, Mr. Sekhon was convicted of
importing cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. 

D.          
British Columbia Court of Appeal, 2012 BCCA 512,
331 B.C.A.C. 170

[40]                         
On appeal, Mr. Sekhon took issue with Sgt.
Arsenault’s testimony.  He maintained that it was neither relevant nor
necessary and that its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value.  

[41]                         
The majority of the B.C. Court of Appeal
disagreed.  Newbury J.A., in dissent, viewed the matter differently.  While she
accepted that the bulk of Sgt. Arsenault’s evidence was properly admissible,
she found that the Impugned Testimony did not fall within this category.  In
her view, it was “purely anecdotal evidence, not amenable to cross-examination
in any real sense, from an officer who was not in a position to determine as a
matter of fact whether in all [of the approximately] 1,000 cases he had
investigated, the courier had been ‘blind’ or not” (para. 26).  Moreover, she
held that the evidence “provided no assistance to the Court as to whether the
accused had known what he was transporting”, but rather “tended to
short-circuit that inquiry” (ibid. (emphasis in original)).  She
provided strong words of caution in regards to such expert testimony:

I see little difference
between this situation and a police officer with experience in domestic
disputes being permitted to testify that in all his or her experience, no such
dispute has ever involved self-defence; or an officer experienced in
investigating murder being permitted to testify that in all the cases he or she
has investigated, the accused intended the death of his or her victim.

 

     Anecdotal
evidence of this kind is just that — anecdotal.  It does not speak to the
particular facts before the Court, but has the superficial attractiveness of seeming
to show that the probabilities are very much in the Crown’s favour, and of
coming from the mouth of an “expert”.  If it can be said to be relevant to the
case of a particular accused, it is also highly prejudicial.  [paras. 26-27]

Newbury J.A. concluded
that the Impugned Testimony “should not have been relied upon by the trial
judge in reaching his verdict” (para. 25).  She would have allowed the appeal
and ordered a new trial.

IV.       
Issues

[42]                         
At issue is whether the trial judge improperly
admitted and relied upon the Impugned Testimony.  If the trial judge so erred,
the remaining question is whether the curative proviso in s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code  can be applied to sustain the convictions. 

V.          
Analysis

A.          
Requirements for Expert Opinion Evidence

[43]                         
As set out R. v. Mohan, [1994] 2
S.C.R. 9, at pp. 20-25, and affirmed in R. v. J.-L.J., 2000 SCC 51,
[2000] 2 S.C.R. 600, and R. v. D.D., 2000 SCC 43, [2000] 2 S.C.R.
275, the admission of expert evidence depends on the following criteria: (1)
relevance; (2) necessity in assisting the trier of fact; (3) the absence of any
exclusionary rule; and (4) a properly qualified expert.

[44]                         
With respect to the “relevance” criterion, Mohan
states that the judge must conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine
“whether its value is worth what it costs” (p. 21, quoting McCormick on
Evidence (3rd ed. 1984), at p. 544).  The cost-benefit analysis requires
the judge to balance the probative value of the evidence against its
prejudicial effect (Mohan, at p. 21). 

[45]                         
As for the “necessity” criterion, Mohan
holds that “[i]f on the proven facts a judge or jury can form their own
conclusions without help, then the opinion of [an] expert is unnecessary” (p.
23, quoting Lawton L.J. in R. v. Turner, [1975] 1 Q.B. 834, at p. 841). 
The Court went on to note that the concern “inherent in the application of this
criterion [is] that experts not be permitted to usurp the functions of the
trier of fact” (p. 24).

[46]                         
Given the concerns about the impact expert
evidence can have on a trial — including the possibility that experts may usurp
the role of the trier of fact — trial judges must be vigilant in monitoring and
enforcing the proper scope of expert evidence.  While these concerns are
perhaps more pronounced in jury trials, all trial judges — including those in
judge-alone trials — have an ongoing duty to ensure that expert evidence
remains within its proper scope.  It is not enough to simply consider the Mohan
criteria at the outset of the expert’s testimony and make an initial ruling as
to the admissibility of the evidence.  The trial judge must do his or her best
to ensure that, throughout the expert’s testimony, the testimony remains within
the proper boundaries of expert evidence.  As noted by Doherty J.A. in R. v.
Abbey, 2009 ONCA 624, 97 O.R. (3d) 330, at para. 62:

        The admissibility inquiry is
not conducted in a vacuum.  Before deciding admissibility, a trial judge must
determine the nature and scope of the proposed expert evidence.  In doing so,
the trial judge sets not only the boundaries of the proposed expert evidence
but also, if necessary, the language in which the expert’s opinion may be
proffered so as to minimize any potential harm to the trial process.  A
cautious delineation of the scope of the proposed expert evidence and strict
adherence to those boundaries, if the evidence is admitted, are essential. 
The case law demonstrates that overreaching by expert witnesses is probably the
most common fault leading to reversals on appeal . . . .  [Emphasis added;
citations omitted.]

[47]                         
The trial judge must both ensure that an expert
stays within the proper bounds of his or her expertise and that the content of
the evidence itself is properly the subject of expert evidence. 

[48]                         
It is foreseeable that mistakes will be made and
that, as happened in the instant case, testimony that strays beyond the proper
scope of the expert evidence will be given.  It is also foreseeable that
defence counsel may fail to object to the testimony at the time the problematic
statements are made.  In a jury trial, once the statements have been made, it
may be somewhat more difficult to address the problem — but a remedial
instruction advising the jury to disabuse their minds of the inadmissible
evidence will generally suffice.  Judges, on the other hand, are accustomed to
disabusing their minds of inadmissible evidence.  It goes without saying that
where the expert evidence strays beyond its proper scope, it is imperative that
the trial judge not assign any weight to the inadmissible parts. 

B.           
Application to This Case

[49]                         
In my view, the trial judge erred in relying
upon the Impugned Testimony.  The fact that Sgt. Arsenault did not personally
encounter a blind courier over the course of his investigations is neither
relevant nor necessary, within the meaning ascribed to those terms by this
Court in Mohan, to the issue facing the trial judge — namely, whether
Mr. Sekhon himself had knowledge of the drugs.  The Impugned Testimony, though
perhaps logically relevant, was not legally relevant because the guilt or
innocence of accused persons that Sgt. Arsenault had encountered in the past is
legally irrelevant to the guilt or innocence of Mr. Sekhon (see Mohan,
at pp. 20-21).  In other words, the Impugned Testimony was of no probative
value in determining whether Mr. Sekhon knew about the cocaine in the
hidden compartment.  It is trite to say that a fundamental tenet of our
criminal justice system is that the guilt of an accused cannot be determined by
reference to the guilt of other, unrelated accused persons.  Moreover, the
Impugned Testimony was not necessary because determining whether Mr. Sekhon
knew about the drugs is not beyond the knowledge and experience of the judge,
and it is certainly not a matter that is technical or scientific in nature. 

[50]                         
The lack of relevance or probative value is, in
my view, sufficient to justify the exclusion of the Impugned Testimony. 
However, it is worth noting the prejudicial effect that such evidence may have
on a trial.  I agree with Newbury J.A. to the extent that she found little to
no difference between the Impugned Testimony in this case and a homicide
investigator being permitted to testify that in all of the cases she or he has
worked on, the accused intended the death of his or her victim.  Nor do I see a
difference between the Impugned Testimony and a stolen goods investigator
testifying that he or she has never seen a case of innocent possession of
stolen property, or an experienced fraud investigator testifying that he or she
has never seen a case where a senior manager was not aware of fraudulent
conduct occurring within the company (A.F., at para. 60).  The inherent danger
of admitting such evidence is obvious — as Newbury J.A. pointed out:

         Anecdotal evidence of this kind
is just that — anecdotal.  It does not speak to the particular facts before the
Court, but has the superficial attractiveness of seeming to show that the
probabilities are very much in the Crown’s favour, and of coming from the mouth
of an “expert”.  If it can be said to be relevant to the case of a particular
accused, it is also highly prejudicial.  [para. 27]

This type of anecdotal
evidence would appear to require the accused to somehow prove that, regardless
of a particular expert’s past experience, the accused’s situation is
different.  Such a result is contrary to another fundamental tenet of our
criminal justice system — that it is the Crown that bears the burden of
proving the mens rea of an offence beyond a reasonable doubt.  As the
appellant points out, “such evidence would logically trigger a defence need to
call evidence to refute such opinions, such as a retired investigator who did
experience an innocent person in similar circumstances, or a witness who could
testify that he or she was in the same circumstances of the accused and was
innocent” (A.F., at para. 61).  At that point, the trial would become a battle
of experts — and a completely irrelevant battle at that. 

[51]                         
For these reasons, I conclude that the Impugned
Testimony was inadmissible. 

C.           
The Curative Proviso Is Appropriate in These
Circumstances

[52]                         
Section 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code , known as the curative proviso, states:

   686. (1)  On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction or against a
verdict . . . the court of appeal

 

   (a)  may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that

. . .

 

(ii)
the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong
decision on a question of law, or

. . .

 

   (b)  may dismiss the appeal where

. . .

 

(iii)
notwithstanding that the court is of the opinion that on any ground mentioned
in subparagraph (a)(ii) the appeal might be decided in favour of the
appellant, it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has occurred; . . .

[53]                         
As this Court has repeatedly asserted, the
curative proviso can only be applied where there is no “reasonable possibility
that the verdict would have been different had the error . . . not been made” (R.
v. Bevan, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 599, at p. 617, aff’d in R. v. Khan, 2001
SCC 86, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 823, at para. 28).  Flowing from this principle, this
Court affirmed in Khan that there are two situations where the use of
s. 686(1) (b)(iii) is appropriate: (1) where the error is harmless
or trivial; or (2) where the evidence is so overwhelming that, notwithstanding
that the error is not minor, the trier of fact would inevitably convict (paras.
29-31).

[54]                         
In my view, this case falls squarely within the
latter category.  As the trial judge ably demonstrated, Mr. Sekhon’s evidence
is a contrivance from beginning to end and need not be considered.  With his
evidence off the table, had the Impugned Testimony been excluded, the remaining
admissible evidence pointing towards Mr. Sekhon’s guilt is overwhelming.  I
have reviewed this evidence earlier and need not repeat it.  Suffice it to say
that the circumstantial evidence bearing on Mr. Sekhon’s knowledge can lead to
only one rational conclusion — that Mr. Sekhon was aware of the cocaine
secreted in the truck. 

[55]                         
The fob evidence on its own was devastating.  As
noted earlier, Mr. Sekhon himself testified that when he was given the fob, it
was attached to the ignition key.  As the trial judge noted, correctly in my
view, “[t]he only logical conclusion to be drawn from [Mr. Sekhon’s deliberate
act of separating the fob from the keys] is that the accused did this to
distance the fob from the truck because he knew that the fob controlled access
to the hidden compartment which he would not want discovered” (A.R., vol. I, at
p. 31).  Standing alone, that finding was all but conclusive of Mr. Sekhon’s
guilt.

[56]                         
But of course, it does not stand alone.  It is
part of a web of circumstantial evidence enveloping Mr. Sekhon from which he
cannot escape.  In this regard, it is important to note that when considering
the second branch of the proviso in the context of a circumstantial case, it is
necessary to look at the whole of the admissible evidence in assessing the
strength of the case.  It is not the task of an appellate court to parse each
item of evidence in search of a possible innocent explanation.  If that were
so, it would be virtually impossible to ever satisfy the second branch of the
proviso in a circumstantial case. 

[57]                         
In conclusion, the thoughts expressed by Binnie
J. in R. v. Jolivet, 2000 SCC 29, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 751, at para. 46, and
restated in R. v. Sarrazin, 2011 SCC 54, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 505, at para.
24, are in my view, apposite to the case at hand:

Ordering a new trial raises significant
issues for the administration of justice and the proper allocation of resources. 
Where the evidence against an accused is powerful and there is no realistic
possibility that a new trial would produce a different verdict, it is
manifestly in the public interest to avoid the cost and delay of further
proceedings.  Parliament has so provided.  

VI.       
Disposition

[58]                         
For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal. 

                    The reasons of McLachlin C.J.
and LeBel J. were delivered by

                    LeBel J.  (dissenting) — 

I.             
Overview

[59]                         
Ajitpal Singh Sekhon appeals from convictions
for unlawfully importing cocaine into Canada and unlawfully possessing cocaine
for the purpose of trafficking. The appellant was stopped at a border crossing
between the United States and Canada, and the vehicle he was driving had a
hidden compartment in which 50 kg of cocaine was found. The sole issue at trial
was whether the appellant knew the cocaine was there. The appellant’s defence
was that he had been asked to drive the vehicle over the border for an
acquaintance and had not known about the cocaine. 

[60]                         
To rebut this defence, the Crown called an
experienced RCMP investigator to give expert evidence on the customs of the
drug trade. In his evidence, this officer stated that he had never encountered
a case involving a “blind courier”, that is, a person who transported cocaine
without knowing what it was, or that it existed (A.R., vol. III, at p. 144).

[61]                         
I agree with my colleague Moldaver J. that the
Crown’s expert witness should not have been permitted to give opinion evidence
concerning the guilt of other individuals he had investigated for drug
importation. And the trial judge should not have relied on the comments in
question in assessing the Crown’s case against the appellant. Given the nature
and the impact of these errors, I do not agree that this is an appropriate case
for applying the curative proviso: Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985,
c. C-46, s. 686(1) (b)(iii). The Crown’s case against the
appellant was circumstantial, the errors of law were very serious, and I do not
believe the evidence would inevitably have resulted in a verdict of guilt
despite these errors. I would order a new trial.

II.          
Background Facts

[62]                         
On January 25, 2005, the appellant drove a
pickup truck to the Aldergrove border crossing between British Columbia and
Washington State. A search of the truck by customs officers uncovered 50 kg of
cocaine hidden in a concealed compartment beneath the truck bed.

[63]                         
The appellant testified at trial that he had
driven to Washington earlier that day with his nephew Mike Grewal. Mr. Grewal
had to return to Canada, but the appellant stayed behind in Washington and met
with a school acquaintance from British Columbia named Chris. Chris told the
appellant he had left his truck in Washington the previous evening because he
was too drunk to drive it home and that he had now driven back to Washington to
retrieve it. According to the appellant, Chris asked him to drive the truck
back to Canada but did not tell him that there were drugs in it. Mr. Grewal
also testified and he corroborated the appellant’s evidence up to the point of
his own return to Canada.

[64]                         
The Crown called an RCMP officer,
Sgt. Vincent Joseph Arsenault. Sgt. Arsenault was qualified, with the
consent of defence counsel, as an expert on the importation of cocaine into the
Lower Mainland of British Columbia by vehicle and on foot, and on the
trafficking and possession of cocaine in that part of British Columbia,
including distribution routes, chain of distribution, means of transportation,
methods of concealment, packaging, values, cost and profit margins, usage
patterns and rates of consumption.

[65]                         
Sgt. Arsenault expressed the opinion that
individuals who imported controlled substances would be part of a close-knit
criminal organization and that they would negotiate a fee based on the volume
of drugs being transported. He stated that he had participated in over 1,000
investigations into cocaine importing and that none of them had involved a
“blind courier”.

[66]                         
The appellant was convicted. His appeal was
dismissed by the British Columbia Court of Appeal, with Newbury J.A.
dissenting. He appeals to this Court as of right.

III.       
Judgments

A.          
Provincial Court

[67]                         
The only issue at trial was whether the
appellant knew the cocaine was in the truck. Judge Dohm rejected the
appellant’s evidence and held that it did not raise a reasonable doubt.

[68]                         
The Crown’s case was circumstantial. After
finding that the appellant was not credible, Judge Dohm turned to the Crown’s
case, highlighting three key pieces of evidence: (i) the amount of cocaine
involved, which suggested that a known and trusted courier would have been
used; (ii) Sgt. Arsenault’s evidence that an individual trusted with large
amounts of cocaine would be part of a closely knit organization, that his or her
fee would be negotiated on the basis of the amount being transported, and that
in over 1,000 cases, he had never encountered a “blind courier”; and (iii) the
appellant’s possession of an electronic key fob that he must have detached from
the ignition key before handing the key to the customs officer, which suggested
that he knew the fob controlled access to the hidden compartment and did not
want the compartment to be discovered. The judge also found support for his
conclusions in some other pieces of evidence, including the fact that the
appellant’s cell phone rang at the time of his arrest, certain information
written on an envelope and his nervous behaviour in the customs office (A.R.,
vol. I, at pp. 31-32). Judge Dohm accordingly found the accused guilty.

B.           
Court of Appeal, 2012 BCCA 512, 331 B.C.A.C. 170

[69]                         
Lowry J.A., with Finch C.J.B.C. concurring,
dismissed the appeal. Lowry J.A. noted that Sgt. Arsenault had many years’
experience in the investigation of drug trafficking and had participated in
some 1,000 cocaine importing cases. He was qualified as an expert, and his
status as such had not been challenged.

[70]                         
On the admissibility of Sgt. Arsenault’s
evidence and the weight it should be given, Lowry J.A. noted that defence
counsel had not objected to it at trial. The evidence was necessary and
relevant to the issue of mens rea, and the trial judge’s reliance on it
was well reasoned and was not inconsistent with the purpose for which it had
been adduced without objection.

[71]                         
The appellant had also challenged Judge Dohm’s
reliance on the evidence with respect to the key fob, arguing that the judge
had placed too much weight on it and had engaged in speculative reasoning.
Lowry J.A. found no error in the trial judge’s reliance on this evidence. The
issue is not raised in this Court.

[72]                         
Newbury J.A., dissenting, found that Sgt.
Arsenault’s evidence should have been excluded. She noted that defence counsel
had conceded that Sgt. Arsenault’s evidence met the criteria laid down in R.
v. Mohan, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9, but had also stated that such evidence can
tend to become anecdotal and to stray into inference drawing. Newbury J.A.
concluded that the officer’s evidence that blind couriers are not used was
objectionable and should have been excluded or, at least, not relied on by the
trial judge in reaching his verdict. She stated that this was not “custom of the
trade” evidence, but was purely anecdotal and not amenable to cross-examination
in any meaningful sense (para. 26). Further, she noted that it “tended to
short-circuit” the mens rea inquiry and essentially allowed the Crown to
have its theory of the case come from the mouth of an expert witness (ibid.).

IV.       
Issues

A.          
Legitimate Scope of a Police Officer’s Expert
Evidence on the Drug Trade

[73]                         
In argument before us, the appellant did not
challenge the use of a police officer’s expert evidence as such. A substantial
body of case law supports the admission of evidence from experienced police
officers on such subjects as the organization of the illegal drug trade,
methods of transporting and selling drugs, methods for avoiding the detection
of drugs, and drug jargon: R. v. Joyal (1990), 55 C.C.C. (3d) 233 (Que.
C.A.); R. v. Ballony-Reeder, 2001 BCCA 293, 88 B.C.L.R. (3d) 237; R.
v. Klassen, 2003 MBQB 253, 179 Man. R. (2d) 115.

[74]                         
Although the admissibility of expert evidence
must be assessed by the trial judge on a case-by-case basis, I am satisfied
that Judge Dohm made no error in principle in finding that the expert evidence
of experienced drug investigators is capable of satisfying the criteria —
relevance, necessity, absence of any exclusionary rule, and a properly
qualified expert — identified in Mohan. The customs of the illegal drug
trade will generally be relevant to the matters at issue in drug trials. Such
customs are likely to be outside the knowledge of the trier of fact, so
evidence about them will be necessary to assist him or her in assessing the
other evidence that has been adduced. Moreover, it is open to a trial judge to
conclude that a police officer is qualified to give expert evidence on the
basis of the officer’s experience and training in the investigation of
drug-related crimes.

[75]                         
At the same time, this Court has repeatedly
cautioned that expert evidence must not be allowed to usurp the role of the
trier of fact. The trier of fact, whether a judge or a jury, is responsible for
deciding the questions in issue at trial. Judges must be especially cautious
where the testimony of police expert witnesses is concerned, as such evidence
could amount to nothing more than the Crown’s theory of the case cloaked with
an aura of expertise. The courts have clearly recognized the risk that expert
evidence could usurp the role of the trier of fact in the assessment of
credibility, and even in the decision on the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence.
I see no reason to believe that this danger is less real where the evidence is
given by a state agent like a police officer rather than by a scientific
expert.

[76]                         
The Mohan requirement of necessity is the
primary safeguard against the inappropriate proliferation of expert evidence.
But even where the expert’s evidence is broadly necessary, as in this case, it
should be assessed with special scrutiny as it approaches the “ultimate
issue”: Mohan, at p. 24; R. v. J.-L.J., 2000 SCC 51, [2000] 2
S.C.R. 600, at para. 37. The decision to qualify an expert witness does not end
the need for scrutiny of the expert’s evidence. A properly qualified expert
could stray into expressing inadmissible opinions about the guilt of an
accused, and the trial judge must ensure that the expert’s testimony stays
within the proper boundaries of such evidence and maintain the integrity and
independence of his or her own fact-finding function as regards the credibility
of witnesses and the guilt or innocence of the accused.

B.           
Application of These Principles to Sgt.
Arsenault’s Evidence

[77]                         
Sgt. Arsenault was qualified as an expert,
without being challenged, on the basis of his extensive experience and
training, and most of his evidence was unobjectionable. He described the
general background of cocaine importation schemes, including manufacturing
sources and distribution chains, the primary importation routes, and points of
entry into British Columbia from the United States. He noted that importers
commonly use off-road, four-wheel-drive vehicles to transport cocaine over land
and that the cocaine is usually packaged in one-kilogram bricks when brought
into Canada. He also explained typical methods of concealment, including the
use of sophisticated hidden compartments. He described common methods of
payment for cocaine shipments, the reasons why drug couriers are used, and
common practices in their recruitment. He talked about the instructions that
would typically be given to a drug courier, including the development of cover
stories, and stated that the courier’s fee is typically negotiated with
reference to the nature and size of the shipment. Sgt. Arsenault described the
risks associated with cross-border transportation of cocaine, and in particular
the risk of losing a shipment either because it is detected by the authorities
or because it is stolen by a rival group. The appellant’s trial counsel did not
object to any of this evidence, and it was not challenged on appeal.

[78]                         
At issue in this appeal is the following
exchange between Crown counsel and Sgt. Arsenault (A.R., vol. III, at p. 144):

Q  Officer, you described earlier that you’ve been involved in
approximately 1,000 investigations involving the importation of cocaine over
your 33-year career?

 

A  That is correct, Your
Honour, yes.

 

Q  In approximately how many of those investigations were you able
to determine that the person importing the cocaine did not know about the
commodity that they were importing?

 

A  I have never encountered
it, personally.

 

Q  Have you ever heard of a -- the use of a blind courier or a
courier who doesn’t know about the commodity that he is driving?

 

A  I -- I’ve certainly heard that argument being raised on -- on
occasion, primarily in court, not during my investigations.

[79]                         
In my view, Sgt. Arsenault’s evidence that he
had never, in over 1,000 investigations, personally encountered a blind courier
and that he had never heard of one outside of a courtroom strayed from what
would be admissible expert evidence. This testimony was equivalent to a
statement that individuals in the appellant’s position always know about the
drugs. It is a short step from such evidence to an inference that the appellant
must have known about the cocaine. Sgt. Arsenault’s evidence effectively
amounted to an opinion that the accused possessed the requisite mens rea
for the offence with which he was charged, which was the ultimate issue in this
trial. Whether it was admissible therefore requires special scrutiny.

[80]                         
Applying the Mohan criteria, I conclude
that this line of questioning should not have been permitted. The evidence was
not necessary, as it was open to the trier of fact to draw the necessary
inference concerning what the appellant knew or did not know. Nor was it
relevant. Sgt. Arsenault’s opinion invited the trier of fact to find that
the appellant knew about the cocaine on the basis that all people driving
vehicles containing hidden drugs know about the drugs. This appeared relevant
only because it depended on an improper inference. Sgt. Arsenault’s opinion
that other individuals he has encountered in his investigations knew they were
transporting illegal drugs does not logically establish that this accused
possessed the mens rea for the offences with which he was charged. In
addition to usurping the court’s role in resolving the issue of guilt or
innocence, the opinion depended on an unacceptable and unfair inference. 

C.           
Should the Curative Proviso Be Applied?

[81]                         
Sgt. Arsenault’s evidence concerning his lack of
personal experience with blind couriers should not have been admitted.
Regardless of the fact that counsel did not object to the questions, the trial
judge erred in law in admitting this evidence. He compounded this error by
expressly relying on it in convicting the appellant. He wrote this in his
reasons: 

Sgt. Arsenault also testified that in
the thousand or more cocaine-importing investigations he has been involved in
he has never encountered a blind courier, that being a person who does not know
the nature or existence of the commodity being moved from one location to
another. [A.R., vol. I, at pp. 30-31]

[82]                         
All that remains is to determine whether the
error occasioned a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, or whether
s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code , known as the
curative proviso, should be applied to affirm the appellant’s convictions:

686.
(1) On the hearing of an appeal against a
conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit to stand trial or
not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder, the court of appeal 

 

. . .

 

(b)
may dismiss the appeal where 

 

. . .

 

(iii)
notwithstanding that the court is of the opinion that on any ground mentioned
in subparagraph (a)(ii) the appeal might be decided in favour of the
appellant, it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
has occurred, . . . 

[83]                         
I respectfully disagree with my colleague’s
position. This is not an appropriate case for application of the proviso.

[84]                         
The proviso applies in two situations. The first
is where the error is so minor or harmless that it could not have had a serious
impact on the verdict. The second is where, although a serious error has been
made, the evidence is nevertheless so overwhelming that no other verdict would
have been possible (R. v. Sarrazin, 2011 SCC 54, [2011] 3 S.C.R.
505, at para. 25; R. v. Van, 2009 SCC 22, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 716, at
para. 34).

[85]                         
In the instant case, the Crown rightly concedes
that the error was not a harmless or minor one that would have no impact on the
verdict. The admission of improper evidence in this case cannot be considered
“an error that is harmless on its face or in its effect” (Van, at para.
35). Sgt. Arsenault’s evidence was a key piece of the Crown’s case, and his
statement that he had never encountered a blind courier was specifically relied
on by the trial judge in convicting the appellant (A.R., vol. I, at
pp. 30-31). The evidence of experts, like that of all witnesses, often
contains comments or observations that are inconsistent with the rules of
evidence. In this case, however, the impugned observations were not unprompted
or unanticipated. Crown counsel clearly directed Sgt. Arsenault’s evidence
toward this prejudicial and inadmissible topic. This could not have helped but
increase its impact, as the trial judge’s reasons show.

[86]                         
If the curative proviso is to be applied,
therefore, it can only be on the basis that “the case against the accused was
so overwhelming that a reasonable and properly instructed jury would inevitably
have convicted” (Van, at para. 36; see also P.
Béliveau and M. Vauclair, Traité général de preuve et de procédure
pénales (20th ed. 2013), at pp. 1294‑95; Sarrazin, at
para. 25). Where this criterion is met, denying the
accused the benefit of a retrial will be justified, because there is no
realistic possibility of any result other than conviction. The standard of this
branch of the test is a high one, as Deschamps J. explained in R. v. Trochym,
2007 SCC 6, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 239, at para. 82:

This standard should not be equated
with the ordinary standard in a criminal trial of proof beyond a reasonable
doubt. The application of the proviso to serious errors reflects a higher
standard appropriate to appellate review. The standard applied by an appellate
court, namely that the evidence against an accused is so overwhelming that
conviction is inevitable or would invariably result, is a substantially higher
one than the requirement that the Crown prove its case “beyond a reasonable
doubt” at trial. This higher standard reflects the fact that it is difficult
for an appellate court, in particular when considering a jury trial, since no
detailed findings of fact will have been made, to consider retroactively the
effect that, for example, excluding certain evidence could reasonably have had
on the outcome.

[87]                         
The Court has constantly refused to lower this
standard, even upon being invited to do so, as it was in Sarrazin. In
that case, it strongly reaffirmed the need to safeguard the integrity of the
criminal justice system (paras. 25-26). The language of the curative proviso
reflects Parliament’s concern to prevent the risk of a substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice. The high standard the Court has set reflects this
purpose.

[88]                         
The error in Trochym occurred in the
context of a jury trial, but even in a case involving a trial by judge alone,
an appellate court must acknowledge that it is difficult to speculate on what
effect exclusion of the evidence might have had on the judge’s findings of
fact. This is especially true in cases such as the one at bar in which the
evidence is circumstantial.   

[89]                         
I cannot say with certainty that the result in
this case would have been the same without Sgt. Arsenault’s evidence. Judge
Dohm rejected the appellant’s evidence in its entirety and found that it did
not raise a reasonable doubt. His reasons accordingly focused on whether the
Crown’s evidence was sufficient to prove the appellant’s guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt. This Court must do the same, applying the higher standard of
an inevitable verdict.

[90]                         
The trial judge in this case gave
well-articulated reasons. They underline the importance he attributed to Sgt.
Arsenault’s testimony. He referred to three “very significant pieces of
evidence” in his decision to convict the appellant (A.R., vol. I, at p. 30).
The first of these was the amount of cocaine involved. He found it unlikely
that the owners of the cocaine would have taken the risk of using a blind
courier to transport it into Canada. The second was Sgt. Arsenault’s evidence,
and in particular his testimony that he had never encountered a blind courier
in over 1,000 investigations involving cocaine importing (pp. 30-31). The third
key piece of evidence in the Crown’s case related to the appellant’s possession
of the key fob.

[91]                         
I have already concluded that the trial judge
erred in making use of the second of these pieces of evidence. As to the first
one, although the value of the cocaine might support an inference that the
drugs would not have been entrusted to a stranger, that is not the only
conclusion that could be drawn from it.

[92]                         
Turning to the third piece of evidence, when the
appellant was detained, he was in possession of the key fob. This fob was
identified at trial as a remote control for a “Clifford” alarm system installed
on the truck. According to the evidence of Det. Shawn Robson, it could be used
to lock and unlock the vehicle’s doors, and to arm and disarm the alarm system
(A.R., vol. III, at p. 122). If the buttons on the fob were pressed in a
specific sequence, the compartment between the bed and the frame of the truck
in which the cocaine was found would open.

[93]                         
When the appellant was initially detained, he
handed the ignition key over to the customs officers. He produced the fob only
when subsequently asked to empty his pockets. At that time, he immediately
admitted that it was for the truck. The trial judge found that the fob and the
ignition key “obviously go together” and that they had been attached by a chain
until the appellant detached them when he turned off the ignition in the
secondary inspection area (A.R., vol. I, at p. 31). He concluded that the
appellant detached the key from the fob at that time in an attempt to hide the
fob or conceal its connection with the truck, because he knew the fob opened
the compartment.

[94]                         
In the Court of Appeal, the appellant challenged
the trial judge’s use of the evidence about the fob, arguing that the judge had
placed too much weight on it and had engaged in speculative reasoning with
respect to it. The Court of Appeal dismissed this argument, and the point was
not raised in this Court. Moldaver J. finds that this inference was open to the
trial judge and that it was essentially conclusive of guilt (para. 55).

[95]                         
In my view, however, the issue in applying the
curative proviso is not whether the trial judge could make the inference he did
or whether that inference was determinative of guilt, but whether it was the
only rational conclusion. I agree that the trial judge did not err in using
this evidence as he did, but this was not the only conclusion supported by the
evidence with respect to the fob. The appellant testified that the key and the
fob had been attached when he received them from Chris, and the trial judge
found that he had detached the key from the fob moments before handing the key
over to the secondary inspection officer. But it does not inevitably follow
that the judge’s finding of guilt depended primarily on these additional
inferences as to when and how the fob came to be detached from the key. There
was no evidence on these points, and the trial judge could just as well have
drawn no inference from the fact that the appellant had not produced the fob
immediately. Moreover, it is simply not possible for an appellate court to say
that the judge’s assessment of this evidence was not affected by his reliance
on the inadmissible evidence that blind couriers are never used. I cannot
accept that the conclusion drawn by the trial judge was inevitable or that this
evidence was therefore determinative of the appellant’s guilt.

[96]                         
There was of course other evidence capable of
supporting a verdict of guilt, including a chewed-up piece of paper, the
envelope mentioned above and the appellant’s ringing cell phone. As with the
key fob, although the trial judge was entitled to draw the inferences he did
from each of these pieces of evidence, each such inference undeniably involved
some speculation. There was no evidence concerning the identity of the person
who called the appellant’s cell phone, nor was there evidence with respect to
the meaning of the information written on the envelope. Again, this evidence
was capable of supporting a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but in
my view it would not inevitably lead to such a finding.

[97]                         
At the same time, there was also evidence
favourable to the accused. For instance, he was not the registered owner of the
truck and there was no evidence that he had ever previously been in possession
of the truck. Furthermore, Sgt. Arsenault testified that drug couriers
typically do not have criminal records, but the appellant did in fact have a
prior conviction for dangerous driving.

[98]                         
I agree that ordering a new trial places demands
on judicial resources, but, with respect, this cannot override the appellant’s
right to a fair trial based solely on admissible evidence. The trial judge
relied expressly on inadmissible evidence, and I cannot untangle his other
inferences unfavourable to the appellant from his acceptance of that evidence,
as he attached great importance to it. As we have seen, this was a serious
error. If this Court excludes evidence described by the trial judge as one of
the foundations of his conclusion that the appellant was guilty, it cannot then
hold that the evidence against the appellant was nonetheless overwhelming without
engaging in pure speculation. Such a conclusion would contradict what the trial
judge himself wrote and would rest on an improper reweighing of the remaining
evidence. With respect, the curative proviso does not permit this Court to deny
a retrial in such circumstances.

V.          
Conclusion

[99]                         
For these reasons, I cannot agree that no
substantial injustice would result from affirming the convictions. I would
accordingly allow the appeal and order a new trial.

on appeal from the court
of appeal for alberta 

 

                    Criminal
law — Offences — Sexual assault — Mens rea — Consent —Accused charged with
sexual assault — Trial judge acquitting accused on grounds that he may have had
honest but mistaken belief as to complainant’s consent — Court of Appeal
setting aside acquittal and substituting conviction — No air of reality to
defence of mistaken belief in consent — Trial judge erring in finding that
accused took reasonable steps in ascertaining consent of complainant.

from a judgment of the Alberta Court of Appeal (Martin and Watson JJ.A. and
Sulatycky J. (ad hoc)), 2013 ABCA 219, 553 A.R. 282, 583 W.A.C. 282,
2013 CarswellAlta 990, [2013] A.J. No. 619 (QL), setting aside the accused’s
acquittal on a charge of sexual assault and entering a conviction.  Appeal
dismissed.  

 

                    Alain Hepner, Q.C., for the appellant.

 

                    Christine Rideout, for the respondent.

 

                    The judgment
of the Court was delivered orally by 

[1]                             
Moldaver J. — We agree with the
conclusion of the Court of Appeal.  In particular, taking the record at its
highest for the appellant, there was no evidence that the appellant took any
reasonable steps to ascertain whether the complainant was consenting to sexual
relations following her initial rejection of the appellant’s sexual advances.
With respect, the trial judge erred in law in finding that there was some
evidence that he had taken reasonable steps as required by s. 273.2 (b)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 .

[2]                             
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

                    Judgment

[2011] Q.J. No. 6103 (QL), 2011 CarswellQue 12285, SOQUIJ AZ-50757582.  Appeal

                    English version of the judgment of
the Court delivered orally by

[1]               The
Chief Justice — We all agree, essentially for the reasons given by Doyon
J.A. of the Quebec Court of Appeal, that this appeal should be dismissed. 
However, we would also like to stress the extraordinary and unique nature of
the circumstances faced by Brunton J. of the Superior Court as a result of the
proceedings brought against the accused by the Crown. 

[2]               The cumulative effects of those
circumstances justified Brunton J.’s significant intervention in matters
usually left to the discretion of the prosecution, namely the selection of the
charges and the prioritization of the order in which they would proceed.  The
direct indictment before the judge at first instance set out 29 counts
involving more than 150 accused.  It also contained a number of counts that
could not lawfully be included in it.  This direct indictment, as preferred by
the Crown, did not lend itself to a trial, and it gave rise to serious
challenges with respect to disclosure of the evidence to the accused. 
Furthermore, the prosecution did not have a realistic plan for taking those
charges to trial and conducting the trial within a reasonable time. 

[3]               As
Doyon J.A. mentioned at paragraph 60 of his reasons, Brunton J. had observed
that [translation] “the
prosecution had been making things up as it went along and had shown a flagrant
lack of preparation, analysis and foresight in managing the case” (2013 QCCA
671, [2013] R.J.Q. 608).  The unique nature of these extraordinary
circumstances satisfies us that the approach taken by the trial judge was the right
one in this case.  In light of these circumstances, and of the ones referred to
by Brunton J. in his reasons and by the majority of the Court of Appeal in
theirs, we agree with the latter that Brunton J. did not err in exercising his
discretion in this case.  He exercised it to protect the rights of the accused
guaranteed by the Charter , and to further the public’s interest in
avoiding the total collapse of the prosecution that could have been caused by
unreasonable delays.

                    Judgment
accordingly.

on appeal from the court of appeal
for british columbia

                    Criminal law — Offences — Sexual assault — Evidence
— Consent — Accused stating to police that complainant consented to sexual
relations — Statement not admitted into evidence and accused maintaining that
he had virtually no recollection of events — Accused acquitted but new trial
subsequently ordered — In assessing consent, trial judge could not rely on
police statement not forming part of record and should have taken into account
other circumstantial evidence.

                    APPEAL
from a judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal (Ryan, Smith and
Hinkson JJ.A.), 2013 BCCA 159, 336 B.C.A.C. 207, 574 W.A.C. 207, 297 C.C.C.
(3d) 106, [2013] B.C.J. No. 677 (QL), 2013 CarswellBC 856, setting aside the
acquittal entered by Romilly J., 2011 BCSC 612, 86 C.R. (6th) 107, [2011]
B.C.J. No. 879 (QL), 2011 CarswellBC 1129, and ordering a new trial.  Appeal
dismissed.

                    Christopher Darnay and Michelle
Poulsen, for
the appellant.

                    Margaret A. Mereigh, for the respondent.

                    The judgment
of the Court was delivered orally by

[1]               Moldaver J. — We agree with the majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal
that there must be a new trial in this matter. 

[2]               In
assessing the crucial issue of consent, the trial judge found that the
complainant was suffering from some sort of memory loss at the time the
appellant claims that “she gave him her consent for sexual relations”
(2011 BCSC 612, 86 C.R. (6th) 107, at para. 45).

[3]               With
respect, the appellant gave no such evidence of consent.  Only in his statement
to the police did he claim that the complainant consented.  But that statement
was not admitted into evidence and formed no part of the record.  At trial, the
appellant maintained that he had virtually no recollection of the events on
that evening due to alcohol and drug consumption.  He did not testify that the
complainant consented to sexual relations. 

[4]               In
our view, the trial judge’s reliance on evidence that did not form part of the
record may have coloured his thinking on the issue of consent, particularly in
assessing whether the complainant may have consented to sexual relations but
forgot that she had done so due to memory blackout, or, as she claimed, that
she was unconscious at all material times and never consented to sexual
relations.

[5]               In
addition to this error, in assessing the issue of consent, the trial judge
failed to take into account the several occasions throughout the evening when
the complainant made it known to the appellant that she was not interested in
having sexual relations with him.  Her evidence in this regard was confirmed in
part by an independent witness found by the trial judge to be credible. 
Similarly, the trial judge failed to consider the complainant’s distraught
condition a short time after the event when she reported the alleged sexual
assault to the police.

[6]               For
these reasons, we agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that a new
trial must be ordered.  Accordingly, we would dismiss the appeal.

                    Judgment accordingly.

The Crown has conceded and we agree with the Alberta Court of Appeal that the
trial judge made an error in allocating the burden of proof. But we agree with
Fraser C.J., in dissent, that this error may have tainted the evaluation of the
evidence as to whether excessive force had been used by a police officer. In
the circumstances of this case, the proviso of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , could not apply. For these
reasons, the appeal is allowed and the appellant’s conviction is quashed. As
the parties have requested in such an event, a new trial is ordered on the same
charges.

on appeal from the court of appeal for nova scotia

                    Constitutional
law — Charter of Rights  — Search and seizure — Police responding to noise
complaint at accused’s residence — Accused answering door while concealing
loaded restricted firearm — Police pushing door open further to ascertain
concealment — Whether officer’s conduct constituted search and if so, whether
search reasonable — Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, s. 8 .

                    Criminal
law — Offences — Elements of offence — Mens rea — Possession of loaded
restricted firearm — Police responding to noise complaint at accused’s
residence — Accused answering door while concealing loaded restricted firearm —
Accused’s licence to possess firearm in Alberta not extending to Nova Scotia,
but accused believing it did — Whether Crown
required to prove accused knew or was wilfully blind to fact that possession of
firearm was unauthorized — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985,
c. C‑46, s. 95 .

                    Police
responded to a noise complaint at M’s home in Halifax.  When M opened the door,
an officer observed that M had an object in his hand, hidden behind his leg.  The officer twice asked M what was in his hand.  Because M did not
answer, the officer pushed the door open a few inches further to see.  A struggle ensued and M was disarmed of a loaded handgun.  M was
licensed to possess and transport the handgun in Alberta, but not in Nova
Scotia as he believed he was.  At trial, the judge concluded that M’s
possession of the gun was unauthorized.  He also concluded that the officer’s
pushing the door open further did not breach M’s s. 8  Charter  right
to be free from unreasonable search.  The trial judge convicted M of careless
handling of a firearm (under s. 86  of the Criminal Code ),
possessing a weapon for a dangerous purpose (s. 88 ), and possessing a
loaded restricted firearm (s. 95 ).  The trial judge sentenced M to a three‑year
imprisonment and a ten‑year weapons prohibition.  A majority of the Court
of Appeal upheld the trial judge’s decision that the officer did not breach M’s
s. 8  Charter  right.  It upheld M’s ss. 86  and 88  Criminal
Code  convictions, but significantly reduced the sentences.  However, the
Court of Appeal allowed M’s appeal of his s. 95  conviction and substituted
an acquittal. 

                    Held:  The appeal of the s. 8  Charter  issue should be
dismissed and the Crown’s appeal of the s. 95  Criminal Code  acquittal
should be allowed.  The matter is remitted to the Court of Appeal for
sentencing.

                    Per
McLachlin C.J. and LeBel, Fish and Abella JJ.:  The officer’s action
of pushing the door open further constituted a “search” for purposes of s. 8 
of the Charter .  The action went beyond the implied licence to knock on
the door and constituted an invasion of M’s reasonable expectation of privacy
in his home.  Although the officer’s action constituted a search for s. 8 
purposes, that search was reasonable because both stages of the Waterfield
test were satisfied.  The first stage was satisfied because the warrantless search
falls within the scope of the common law police duty to protect life and safety
and the second, because the search constitutes a justifiable exercise of powers
associated with the duty. 

                    To
determine whether a safety search is reasonably necessary, and therefore
justifiable, a number of factors must be weighed to balance the police duty
against the liberty interest in question.  These factors include: the
importance of the duty to the public good; the necessity of the infringement
for the performance of the duty; and the extent of the infringement.  The duty
to protect life and safety is of the utmost importance to the public good, but
an infringement on individual liberty may be necessary when, for example, the
officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the individual is armed and
dangerous.  That infringement will be justified only to the extent that it is
necessary for the officer to search for weapons.  In
other words, and as this Court recognized in R. v. Mann, 2004 SCC 52, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 59, the powers of the police are limited.  Courts must consider not
only the extent of the infringement, but how it was carried out.  Restraints on
safety searches are particularly important in homes, where such searches can
often give the police access to a considerable amount of very sensitive
personal information. 

                    In
this case, the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that there was an
imminent threat to public and police safety and that the search was necessary
to eliminate that threat.  The manner in which he carried out the search was
also reasonable.  The trial judge found that the officer pushed the door open no
more than was necessary to find out what M had behind his leg.  The officer
twice asked M what he had in his hand but received no answer.  In these
circumstances, it is hard to imagine a less invasive way of determining whether
M was concealing a weapon and thereby eliminating any threat.  It follows that
M’s rights under s. 8  of the Charter  were not violated.  

                    As
for a s. 95  Criminal Code  conviction, the Court of Appeal erred in requiring
the Crown to prove that M knew that his possession and acquisition licence and
authorization to transport the firearm did not extend to his Halifax home.  That
requirement is inconsistent with the rule, codified in s. 19 of the Code,
that ignorance of the law is no excuse.  Section 95  is a mens rea
offence, but does not include knowledge of unauthorized possession.  Rather,
knowledge of possession, together with intention to possess in a particular
place, is enough. 

                    In
this case, M’s subjective belief that he could possess the firearm in his
Halifax home is a mistake of law and that mistake is no defence.  Therefore, M’s
s. 95  conviction must be restored and the matter remitted to the Court of
Appeal both for sentencing and for assessing the constitutional validity of the
mandatory minimum sentence under s. 95 . 

                    Per Rothstein, Moldaver and Wagner JJ.:
 The majority concludes that the officer’s conduct in this case was only
justified because he had reasonable grounds to believe that M was armed and
dangerous.  In doing so, they effectively overturn the “safety search” power
recognized in Mann and a decade of subsequent jurisprudence.  

                    This Court decided in Mann that officers may conduct
protective searches when they have reasonable grounds to suspect that an
individual is armed and dangerous.  And that is why the search was justified in
this case.  Five reasons support this conclusion. 

                    First,
the language of Mann makes clear that it recognized a protective search
power predicated on reasonable suspicion.  Second, Mann relies on the
U.S. Supreme Court’s seminal decision in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1
(1968), a decision which recognized a directly analogous protective search
power on a reasonable suspicion standard.  Third, subsequent judgments from
this Court and courts of appeal have affirmed that Mann employed the reasonable
suspicion standard.  Fourth, the logical consequences of a reasonable grounds
to believe standard make little sense in this context; if Mann required
reasonable grounds to believe for a pat‑down search, it would seem that
all that Mann achieves is a power to search when there are
already grounds to arrest.  Fifth, the facts of this case do not support
a finding that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that M was armed
and dangerous.

                    These
five reasons — the language of Mann, the history from which Mann
emerged, the consequences of interpreting Mann as requiring reasonable
grounds to believe, the jurisprudence that has interpreted Mann, and the
facts of this case — all lead to the same unavoidable conclusion: Mann
recognized a protective search power predicated on reasonable suspicion. 

                    This
case ought to have been resolved by extending the logic of Mann.  First,
the officer, while lawfully engaged in his duties, had a reasonable suspicion
that M was armed and dangerous.  Second, in response to that reasonable
suspicion, the officer’s conduct — pushing M’s door open a few more inches —
was no more intrusive of M’s privacy interests than was reasonably necessary to
address the threat.  Accordingly, the search was reasonable for s. 8 
purposes.

                    The
consequence of the majority’s decision is to deprive officers of the ability to conduct protective searches except in circumstances where they already have grounds to
arrest.  As of today, officers are empowered to detain individuals they suspect
are armed and dangerous for investigatory purposes, but they have no power
to conduct pat‑down searches to ensure their safety or the safety of the
public as they conduct these investigations.  However, a police officer in the
field, faced with a realistic risk of imminent harm, should be able to act
immediately and take reasonable steps, in the form of a minimally intrusive
safety search, to alleviate the risk.

I.    Introduction

[1]                             
This case requires us to consider the scope of
police search powers in the context of everyday interactions with private
citizens at the doorsteps of their homes.  The police in this case responded to
a noise complaint and, without warning, became engaged in a dangerous situation
that, in their opinion, put their safety, and the safety of others, in
jeopardy.  The charges laid as a result of this incident afford us an
opportunity to consider the operation of s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  in this context, the mens rea required for
conviction under s. 95(1)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 ,
and some corollary issues related to sentencing.

II.  Background Facts

[2]                             
In 2009, Mr. MacDonald was employed in the oil
and gas industry.  His employment required him to spend time in both Calgary
and Halifax.  On the evening of December 28, 2009, Mr. MacDonald entertained a
co-worker and his co-worker’s friend at his Halifax condominium (the “unit”). 
Some alcohol was consumed during the evening as Mr. MacDonald and his colleague
— who was about to replace him in Halifax — discussed work.

[3]                             
Later in the evening, the concierge of Mr.
MacDonald’s building, Mr. Sears, received a noise complaint regarding loud
music reverberating from the unit.  Mr. Sears went to the unit, heard the
loud music and knocked on the door.  He received no response.  Just as he was
about to leave, he saw Mr. MacDonald’s guests leaving the unit and saying good
night.  At this point, Mr. Sears asked Mr. MacDonald to turn down his
music.  Mr. MacDonald, swearing at him, refused to do so.

[4]                             
Mr. Sears contacted the Halifax Regional Police
and asked them to deal with the complaint about the noise issue.  Cst. Pierce
went to the building and, together with Mr. Sears, approached Mr. MacDonald’s
unit.  Cst. Pierce knocked on his door and asked him to turn his music down or
off.  Mr. MacDonald swore at her and slammed the door shut.

[5]                             
Cst. Pierce contacted her supervisor, Sgt. Boyd,
who arrived at the building approximately a half hour later.  Sgt. Boyd, Cst.
Pierce and Mr. Sears went to the unit.  Sgt. Boyd tried to get Mr.
MacDonald to answer the door by knocking on it and kicking it, and also shouted
that he was from the Halifax Regional Police.

[6]                             
About five minutes later, Mr. MacDonald opened
the door, but only about 16 inches — enough for the officers to see the
right side of his body and face.  Sgt. Boyd noticed something “black and
shiny” in Mr. MacDonald’s right hand that was in a shadow and was partially
hidden by his right leg (A.R., at p. 167).  He believed it might be a knife. 
He twice asked Mr. MacDonald what was behind his leg, gesturing toward his
right hand.  Mr. MacDonald did not respond.

[7]                             
Wanting to get a better look at what Mr.
MacDonald had in his hand, Sgt. Boyd pushed the door open a few inches
further.  The resulting light enabled him to identify it as a handgun.  He
yelled “gun!” and quickly forced his way into the unit.  After a brief
struggle, he was able to disarm Mr. MacDonald.

[8]                             
The gun that Mr. MacDonald was holding when he
opened the door was found to be a 9-mm Beretta — a restricted firearm.  It was
registered to him.  The gun was loaded.

[9]                             
Mr. MacDonald was charged with numerous
offences, three of which are relevant here:  handling a firearm in a careless manner
or without reasonable precautions for the safety of other persons, contrary to
s. 86(1) of the Code; unlawfully having in his possession a weapon for a
purpose dangerous to the public peace, contrary to s. 88(1); and possessing, in
a place, a loaded restricted firearm without being the holder of an
authorization or a licence under which he may possess the said firearm in that
place, contrary to s. 95(1) .

III. Judicial History

A.   
Nova Scotia Provincial Court

[10]                         
At trial, a voir dire was held to
determine whether Mr. MacDonald’s right to be secure against an unreasonable
search guaranteed by s. 8  of the Charter  had been violated when Sgt.
Boyd pushed the door to the unit open a few inches further to ascertain what he
was holding.  Judge Digby found that there is an exception that permits an
officer to enter a home to ensure his or her safety, particularly where, as
here, the intrusion is minor.  He concluded that “there is no Charter 
breach and the burden is on the accused to prove on a balance of probabilities
that there is a Charter  breach” (A.R., at p. 250).

[11]                         
After weighing all the circumstances, Judge
Digby found Mr. MacDonald guilty of the charges under ss. 86(1) and 88(1). 
Others could have been injured as a result of his conduct, which was out of
proportion to any threat, actual or reasonably perceived.  Before opening the
door, Mr. MacDonald knew the people there were police officers or people
claiming to be police officers.  He also knew that if they were in fact police
officers, they would react to his holding a handgun, and this would put his own
safety at risk as well as that of the officers themselves and of the public.

[12]                         
Judge Digby also found Mr. MacDonald guilty of
the charge under s. 95(1) .  In so finding, he noted that Mr. MacDonald and
the Crown agreed on the following facts:

. . . it is common ground that
Mr. MacDonald had a possession and acquisition license, that the Beretta
firearm was properly registered in Mr. MacDonald’s name and that he had a
right to possess it in his dwelling.  It was registered with the Canadian Firearms
Centre or another place approved for storage by the chief firearms officer.

 

. . .

 

It
is common ground that [Mr. MacDonald] had a loaded, restricted firearm in his
residence at Bishop’s Landing. . . . He had documentation which he submitted in
evidence from the Nova Scotia Rifle Association indicating that he was a member
and invited to use their facility.  I take it it is common ground, and
certainly the case has proceeded on the basis of common ground, that Nova
Scotia Rifle Association is an organization which falls under section 19(1) (a)
of the Firearms Act . [A.R., at pp. 19 and 21]

[13]                         
Mr. MacDonald had an authorization to transport
the firearm, but, the learned trial judge held, it entitled him to transport
the firearm only between his residence in Calgary and shooting ranges and
border crossings in Alberta.  He therefore had no right to take it to Halifax. 
Mr. MacDonald was guilty under s. 95(1)  because he had the firearm in the unit
without holding a licence which permitted him to possess it in that place.

[14]                         
Judge Digby sentenced Mr. MacDonald to three
years’ imprisonment.  He found that two years in a federal penitentiary was an
appropriate sentence for the offence under s. 86(1).  For the offence under s.
88(1), the proper sentence was three years in a federal penitentiary concurrent
with the first sentence.  As for the s. 95(1)  offence, he found that the
minimum sentence of three years in a federal penitentiary was appropriate and
ordered that it be served concurrently with the other two sentences.  Judge
Digby rejected Mr. MacDonald’s contention that the minimum three-year sentence
violated the right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment
guaranteed by s. 12  of the Charter , finding, despite the consequences
for him and despite certain hypothetical scenarios, that it was not grossly
disproportionate.  He ordered that the firearm be forfeited and prohibited Mr. MacDonald
from possessing any weapons for 10 years and any restricted weapons for life.

B.    
Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, 2012 NSCA 50,
317 N.S.R. (2d) 90

[15]                         
MacDonald C.J.N.S. (Saunders J.A. concurring)
found that no Charter  violation had occurred on the evening in
question.  He noted that warrantless entry into a home is prima facie
illegal and that the onus was therefore on the Crown to justify the entry. 
Relying on this Court’s decision in R. v. Mann, 2004 SCC 52, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 59, he concluded that there is a common law police power to search
without a warrant where the safety of the public or the police is at stake.  He
acknowledged, however, that this power is limited to situations in which, “in
addition to acting within the general scope of their authority, [the police]
have no other feasible less intrusive alternative”, and he added that “the
manner of carrying out the impugned activity must also be reasonable” (para.
31).  He found that Sgt. Boyd had exercised the power validly in the case at
bar.  The police were acting within the general scope of their authority by
going to Mr. MacDonald’s place of residence to deal with a noise complaint. 
Sgt. Boyd acted reasonably in the circumstances in pushing the door open
further to see what he was hiding.  Furthermore, no other action would have
been appropriate, as it was too late to simply retreat or issue a noise violation
ticket.

[16]                         
MacDonald C.J.N.S. upheld the convictions under
ss. 86  and 88 , but overturned the one under s. 95 .  On the latter conviction,
he acknowledged that pursuant to s. 17  of the Firearms Act, S.C. 1995,
c. 39 , Mr. MacDonald’s licence did not extend to his Halifax residence. 
However, he found that Mr. MacDonald should be acquitted on the basis of an
honest but mistaken belief that it did extend to the unit.  For the majority,
this belief was a mistake of fact which negated the mens rea of
the s. 95  offence.  The Crown had to prove that Mr. MacDonald knew or was
wilfully blind to the fact that his possession was unauthorized.  It had failed
to do so, as Mr. MacDonald genuinely believed that he was authorized to possess
the firearm in the unit.  MacDonald C.J.N.S. accordingly set aside the verdict
and substituted an acquittal on the s. 95  charge.

[17]                         
Finally, the majority reassessed the fitness of Mr.
MacDonald’s sentences for the convictions under ss. 86  and 88 .  The majority
found that a review of these sentences was warranted because, rather than
conducting an independent analysis for each offence, the trial judge had
considered the incident globally.  Because they had set aside the conviction
under s. 95 , they found it necessary to scrutinize the dispositions for the
other convictions.

[18]                         
MacDonald C.J.N.S. found the three-year sentence
for the conviction under s. 88  to be too harsh, since Mr. MacDonald’s actions
“did not involve the more typical scenario such as a highly volatile public
confrontation or a dangerous domestic dispute” and since “the gun was neither
fired, nor . . . intentionally pointed” (para. 117).  He reviewed a number of
cases which suggested that three years was outside the sentencing range for
this offence.  He found the sentence to be demonstrably unfit and concluded:

Considering
the principles of sentencing, the circumstances of this offence and Mr.
MacDonald’s individual circumstances, particularly his positive pre-sentence
report and his previous unblemished record, in my view a sentence of time
served would be appropriate.  This would represent 18 days in custody
(considering the 2 days following his arrest, his release on his own
recognizance and then the 16 days between his sentencing and his release on
bail pending appeal). [para. 123]

[19]                         
As for the sentence for the conviction under s.
86 , the majority found the imposition of the maximum two-year sentence to be
unduly harsh in comparison with other cases. They held this sentence to be
demonstrably unfit and imposed a sentence of 14 days concurrent with the
sentence imposed for the s. 88  offence.

[20]                         
Finally, MacDonald C.J.N.S. ordered a two-year
term of probation, a prohibition on possession of weapons for five years, and
forfeiture of the firearm.

[21]                         
Beveridge J.A., in dissent, held that Sgt. Boyd
had infringed Mr. MacDonald’s right under s. 8  of the Charter  by pushing
the door to the unit open further and extending his hand into Mr. MacDonald’s
home.  In Beveridge J.A.’s view, the authority of the police to enter an
individual’s home for the purpose of ensuring officer safety did not apply in
the circumstances of this case:

While I have no difficulty
with the premise that the officers were lawfully present and carrying out their
duties, they did not acquire any power to intrude into [Mr. MacDonald’s] home
as a result of Sgt. Boyd’s concern that [he] was concealing something. Sergeant
Boyd never suggested that he suspected, let alone had reasonable grounds to
believe, that it was a firearm. He said it was something black and shiny. At
best he said he “thought he might have a weapon in his hand”. In my view, this
is more akin to hunch or suspicion than reasonable grounds to believe. In fact,
the trial judge made no finding that reasonable grounds existed. Despite ample
opportunity to give evidence that he did, Sgt. Boyd said no such thing.

 

. . .

 

The
issue is not whether Sgt. Boyd acted reasonably in pushing open the door. The
issue is did he have lawful authority to do so. That would only materialize if
he had reasonable grounds to believe that his safety, or the safety of others,
was at risk and his search in pushing open the door was reasonably necessary in
the circumstances.

 

Absent
a new-found power to enter a private dwelling based on a suspicion that officer
safety concerns are triggered, the conclusion is inescapable that [Mr.
MacDonald’s] reasonable expectation of privacy protected by s. 8  of the Charter 
was infringed or denied. [paras. 156 and 173-74]

[22]                         
In light of all the circumstances, Beveridge
J.A. would have excluded the firearm as evidence at trial, because its
admission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  He would
accordingly have set aside the convictions and directed acquittals on all three
of the charges.

IV. Analysis

A.  Issues

[23]                         
This case raises three issues, which I will
discuss in turn:

1.         Was Mr. MacDonald’s right under s. 8  of the Charter 
to be free from unreasonable search and seizure violated and, if so, what is
the appropriate remedy?

2.         Does the mens rea of the offence provided for in
s. 95(1) of the Code include knowledge that one’s licence does not extend
to the place where the firearm is possessed?

3.         Should the sentences imposed by the Court of Appeal for
the convictions under ss. 86(1) and 88(1) be varied?

B.  Mr. MacDonald’s Charter 
Challenge

[24]                         
Mr. MacDonald’s central argument is that Sgt.
Boyd’s action of pushing the door open further constituted an unreasonable
search, contrary to s. 8  of the Charter .  He submits that the
evidence obtained by the police as a result of the search — namely the firearm
— ought to be excluded under s. 24(2)  of the Charter , as its admission
would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  I cannot accept this
argument.  As I will explain, although Sgt. Boyd’s action constituted a
“search” for the purposes of s. 8  of the Charter , that search was not
unreasonable.

      (1)     Did Sgt. Boyd’s
Action Constitute a Search?

[25]                         
R. v. Evans,
[1996] 1 S.C.R. 8, is a leading case on what constitutes a “search” for the
purposes of s. 8 .  The facts of that case were not dissimilar to those of the
instant case in that the search was carried out by police at the doorstep of
the accused person’s home.  Sopinka J. laid down the following test for
determining whether a police action constitutes a “search”:

. . . it is only where a person’s
reasonable expectations of privacy are somehow diminished by an investigatory
technique that s. 8  of the Charter  comes into play. As a result, not
every form of examination conducted by the government will constitute a
“search” for constitutional purposes. On the contrary, only where those
state examinations constitute an intrusion upon some reasonable privacy
interest of individuals does the government action in question constitute a
“search” within the meaning of s. 8 . [Emphasis added; para. 11.]

In other words, a s. 8  search “may
be defined as the state invasion of a reasonable expectation of privacy” (R.
v. A.M., 2008 SCC 19, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 569, at para. 8).

[26]                         
There is no question that individuals have a
reasonable, indeed a strong, expectation of privacy in their homes (R. v.
Godoy, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 311, at para. 19; R. v. Feeney, [1997] 2
S.C.R. 13; R. v. Silveira, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 297), as well as in the
approaches to their homes (Evans, at para. 21).  However, Evans
also established that the police have an implied licence to approach the door
of a residence and knock.  Doing so will not be considered an invasion of
privacy constituting a search if the purpose of the police is to communicate
with the occupant.  But “[w]here the conduct of the police . . . goes beyond
that which is permitted by the implied licence to knock, the implied
‘conditions’ of that licence have effectively been breached, and the person
carrying out the unauthorized activity approaches the dwelling as an intruder”
(Evans, at para. 15).  In such circumstances, the police action
constitutes a “search”.

[27]                         
Initially, Sgt. Boyd’s actions were compatible
with the implied licence to knock.  He approached Mr. MacDonald’s door, knocked
on it and kicked it for the purpose of communicating to the occupant that he
needed to turn his music down.  After Mr. MacDonald had opened the door,
however, Sgt. Boyd’s purpose in pushing it open further was to get a better
view of what was in his hand (A.R., at pp. 168-69).  Simply put, Mr.
MacDonald’s implied waiver of his privacy rights did not extend that far. 
Speaking or shouting through the door or knocking on it falls within the
waiver; pushing it open further does not. Sgt. Boyd’s action of pushing the
door open further constituted an intrusion upon Mr. MacDonald’s reasonable
privacy interest in his dwelling.

[28]                         
Having found that the police action constituted
a search of Mr. MacDonald’s home, I must now consider whether that search was
unreasonable, and therefore in violation of s. 8  of the Charter .  At
this stage, because the search was warrantless, the Crown has the burden of
showing that it was reasonable (R. v. Collins,
[1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p. 278).

      (2)     Was the Search
Unreasonable?

[29]                         
The framework for scrutinizing warrantless searches for Charter  compliance was
summarized by this Court in Mann:

[Warrantless] searches are presumed to
be unreasonable unless they can be justified, and hence found reasonable,
pursuant to the test established in R. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265. 
Under Collins, warrantless searches are deemed reasonable if (a) they
are authorized by law, (b) the law itself is reasonable, and (c) the manner in
which the search was carried out was also reasonable (p. 278). The Crown bears
the burden of demonstrating, on the balance of probabilities, that the
warrantless search was authorized by a reasonable law and carried out in a
reasonable manner: R. v. Buhay, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 631, 2003 SCC 30, at
para. 32. [para. 36]

[30]                         
Applying the Collins test to the facts of
the instant case, I find that the search carried out by Sgt. Boyd was
reasonable.

(a)            
The Search Was Authorized by Law and the Law Itself Is Reasonable

[31]                         
Where the first prong of the Collins test
is concerned, a search will be authorized by law if it is authorized by a valid
police power.  In Godoy, Lamer C.J. affirmed that the police have a
common law duty to protect life and safety.  Nevertheless, “[p]olice powers and
police duties are not necessarily correlative” (Mann, at para. 35).
Indeed, the police power to search is not unlimited.  This power is constrained
by a requirement of objectively verifiable necessity (para. 26). In Mann,
Iacobucci J. accepted the need for a general police power to conduct pat-down
searches, but solely in appropriate circumstances. He was mindful of the risks
of abuse of such a power, as he observed that “[s]uch a search power does not
exist as a matter of course: the officer must believe on reasonable grounds that
his or her own safety, or the safety of others, is at risk” (para. 40).

[32]                         
A search that is reasonably necessary to eliminate
threats to the safety of the public or the police — which I will term a “safety
search” — will generally be conducted by the police as a reactionary measure. 
In other words, although such searches may arise in a wide variety of contexts,
they will generally be unplanned, as they will be carried out in response to
dangerous situations created by individuals, to which the police must react “on
the sudden”.  Binnie J.’s observation in A.M. in relation to sniffer-dog
searches that “the police are generally required to take quick action guided by
on-the-spot observations” (at para. 90) is equally applicable to safety
searches.  Thus, safety searches will typically be warrantless, as the police
will generally not have sufficient time to obtain prior judicial authorization
for them. In a sense, such searches are driven by exigent circumstances.  Even
if exigent circumstances exist, however, “safety searches” must be authorized
by law. 

[33]                         
In arguing that Sgt. Boyd’s search was
authorized by law, the Crown relies on the test from R. v. Waterfield,
[1963] 3 All E.R. 659 (C.C.A.), as set out by this Court in Dedman v. The
Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 2.  It will be recalled that in Waterfield,
two police officers had attempted to detain personal property (a car)
belonging to the accused.  The court set down a two-part test to determine
whether the officers were acting in the execution of their duties when
they sought to stop the accused from removing his property.  As Professor P.
Healy notes, the Waterfield test served in Dedman, as in earlier
Canadian cases in which it had been applied (R. v. Stenning, [1970]
S.C.R. 631, and Knowlton v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 443), to mark “the
limits of liability when there [was] some question whether a police officer
[had] acted in the execution of his or her duty”:  “Investigative Detention in
Canada”, [2005] Crim. L.R. 98, at p. 102.  It was of assistance in the
determination of whether a police officer who had been assaulted was acting as
an officer at the time of the assault, in which case the accused would be
guilty of assaulting a police officer and not a regular citizen. Waterfield
is therefore an imperfect authority on the question whether police have a common
law power to search an individual in a safety search.

[34]                         
Instead, we must consider this Court’s
jurisprudence.  This Court has elaborated on and applied the two-step Waterfield
test in a variety of contexts comparable to safety searches in assessing
whether an action constituting prima facie infringement of an
individual’s liberty falls within an officer’s power (Dedman and Mann).


[35]                         
At the first stage of the Waterfield test,
the court must ask whether the action falls within the general scope of a
police duty imposed by statute or recognized at common law.  For safety
searches, the requirement at this first stage of the analysis is easily
satisfied.  In the case at bar, the police action falls within the general
scope of the common law police duty to protect life and safety that I mentioned
above.  This duty is well established (Mann, at para. 38; R. v.
Clayton, 2007 SCC 32, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 725, at paras. 20-21; Dedman).

[36]                         
At the second stage, if the answer at the first
is affirmative, as it is in this case, the court must inquire into whether the
action constitutes a justifiable exercise of powers associated with the duty. 
As this Court held in Dedman,

[t]he interference with liberty must be
necessary for the carrying out of the particular police duty and
it must be reasonable, having regard to the nature of the liberty
interfered with and the importance of the public purpose served by the
interference. [Emphasis added; p. 35.]

Thus, for the
infringement to be justified, the police action must be reasonably necessary
for the carrying out of the particular duty in light of all the
circumstances (Mann, at para. 39; Clayton, at paras. 21 and 29). 

[37]                         
To determine whether a safety search is
reasonably necessary, and therefore justifiable, a number of factors must be
weighed to balance the police duty against the liberty interest in question. 
These factors include: 

1.         the importance of the performance of the duty to the
public good (Mann, at para. 39); 

2.         the necessity of the interference with individual liberty
for the performance of the duty (Dedman, at p. 35; Clayton, at
paras. 21, 26 and 31); and

3.         the extent of the
interference with individual liberty (Dedman, at p. 35). 

If these three factors,
weighed together, lead to the conclusion that the police action was reasonably
necessary, then the action in question will not constitute an “unjustifiable
use” of police powers (Dedman, at p. 36).  If the requirements of
both stages of the Waterfield test are satisfied, the court will then be
able to conclude that the search in question was authorized by law.

[38]                         
As can be seen, the Dedman-Mann line of
cases does not stand for the proposition that all acts related to an officer’s
duties are authorized by law. Quite the opposite, only such acts as are
reasonably necessary for the performance of an officer’s duties can be
considered, in the appropriate circumstances, to be so authorized. The English
Court of Appeal was clear on this point in Waterfield, in a
passage quoted by this Court in Dedman: 

Thus, while it is no doubt right to say
in general terms that police constables have a duty to prevent crime and a
duty, when crime is committed, to bring the offender to justice, it is also
clear from the decided cases that when the execution of these general duties
involves interference with the person or property of a private person, the
powers of constables are not unlimited. [Emphasis added; p. 33.]

Likewise, Dickson J., in
a powerful dissent in the Wiretap Reference, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 697,
stressed the critical importance of a narrow reading of the Waterfield
test:

The fact
that police officers could be described as acting within the general scope of
their duties to investigate crime cannot empower them to violate the law
whenever such conduct could be justified by the public interest in law
enforcement. Any such principle would be nothing short of a fiat for illegality
on the part of the police whenever the benefit of police action appeared to
outweigh the infringement of an individual’s rights. [pp. 718-19] 

Such restraints on safety
searches are particularly important in the context of a search in a private
home, as in the case at bar, which concerns a serious invasion of Mr. MacDonald’s
privacy in his home. Moreover, safety searches can often give the police access
to a considerable amount of very sensitive personal information. 

[39]                         
With this clarification in mind, we must
sensitively weigh the factors of the second stage of the Dedman-Mann
test. The factors assist both in determining whether a police power exists and
in defining the limits of that power: 

1.         Importance of the duty:  No one can reasonably dispute
that the duty to protect life and safety is of the utmost importance to the
public good and that, in some circumstances, some interference with individual
liberty is necessary to carry out that duty.  

2.         Necessity of the infringement for the performance of the
duty:  When the performance of a police duty requires an officer to interact
with an individual who they have reasonable grounds to believe is armed and
dangerous, an infringement on individual liberty may be necessary.  

3.         Extent of the infringement:  The infringement on
individual liberty will be justified only to the extent that it is necessary to
search for weapons.  Although the specific manner (be it a pat-down, the
shining of a flashlight or, as in this case, the further opening of a door) in
which a safety search is conducted will vary from case to case, such a search
will be lawful only if all aspects of the search serve a protective function.
In other words, the authority for the search runs out at the point at which the
search for weapons is finished.  The premise of the Collins test — a
warrantless search is presumed to be unreasonable unless it can be justified —
must be borne in mind in determining whether the interference with individual
liberty involved in a safety search is reasonable. 

[40]                         
On balancing these factors, I am convinced that
the duty of police officers to protect life and safety may justify the power to
conduct a safety search in certain circumstances.  At the very least, where a
search is reasonably necessary to eliminate an imminent threat to the safety of
the public or the police, the police should have the power to conduct the
search. 

[41]                         
But although I acknowledge the importance of
safety searches, I must repeat that the power to carry one out is not
unbridled. In my view, the principles laid down in Mann and reaffirmed
in Clayton require the existence of circumstances establishing the
necessity of safety searches, reasonably and objectively considered, to address
an imminent threat to the safety of the public or the police. Given the high privacy
interests at stake in such searches, the search will be authorized by law only
if the police officer believes on reasonable grounds that his or her safety is
at stake and that, as a result, it is necessary to conduct a search (Mann,
at para. 40; see also para. 45). The legality of the search therefore turns
on its reasonable, objectively verifiable necessity in the circumstances of the
matter (see R. v. Tse, 2012 SCC 16, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 531,
at para. 33). As the Court stated in Mann, a search cannot be justified
on the basis of a vague concern for safety. Rather, for a safety search to be
lawful, the officer must act on “reasonable and specific inferences drawn from
the known facts of the situation” (Mann, at para. 41).

[42]                         
A safety search is a physical search that could
uncover a broad array of information about an individual.  In the instant case,
even though all Sgt. Boyd did was push the door open slightly further, this had
the potential to reveal to the officers any number of things about Mr.
MacDonald, as they could now see more of the interior of the unit. However,
because Sgt. Boyd had reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. MacDonald was
armed and dangerous, the further opening of the door was authorized by law.

[43]                         
As for the second prong of the Collins
test, it cannot be disputed that the lawful authority underlying safety
searches outlined above is reasonable.  Indeed, the execution of the police
duty to protect life and safety lies at the very core of the existence of the
police as a social entity. Further, the law will justify the exercise of this
police power only if exercising it is reasonably necessary in order for
the police to conduct the safety search in question (Clayton, at paras.
21, 26 and 31). As I explained above, it is only when police officers have
reasonable grounds to believe that there is an imminent threat to their safety
that it will be reasonably necessary to conduct such a search.  This limit
guarantees that the lawful police power is not excessively broad.  In so doing,
it ensures that the law itself is reasonable and can be reasonably delineated. 

[44]                         
This common law power to conduct searches for
safety purposes is the reasonable lawful authority for the search carried out
by Sgt. Boyd.  The power was engaged because Sgt. Boyd had reasonable grounds
to believe that there was an imminent threat to the safety of the public or the
police and that the search was necessary in order to eliminate that threat. 
More specifically, the trial judge found that Sgt. Boyd had observed the
following when Mr. MacDonald answered the door:

1.         Mr. MacDonald had his hand behind his leg and was clearly
holding an object;

2.         what he was holding was “black and shiny” and therefore
could have been a weapon; and

3.         when twice asked what he had behind his back, he refused
to answer or to provide any explanation.

[45]                         
In my opinion, the search conducted by Sgt. Boyd
was authorized by law and the law itself, in the form of a well-established
common law principle, is reasonable.  As I will explain below, the manner in which he carried out the search
was also reasonable.

(b)      The Manner in Which the
Search Was Carried Out Was Reasonable

[46]                         
Two aspects of this prong of the Collins
test must be addressed.  First, as we have seen, an officer must have
reasonable grounds to believe that there is an imminent threat to the safety of
the public or the police before a safety search will be deemed reasonable.  I
agree that Sgt. Boyd had such grounds in the circumstances of this case.

[47]                         
Second, the actions of the police in conducting
the search must be scrutinized to determine whether the search was carried out reasonably.  To a certain
extent, this analysis relates to the second stage of the Waterfield test.
If the extent of the infringement is greater than what is required to search
for weapons, the search will not be authorized by law. At this point, however,
the overall reasonableness of the search must be assessed in light of the
totality of the circumstances (Mann, at para. 44).  It is necessary to
consider not only the extent of the interference, but how it was
carried out. This inquiry turns on whether the search was minimally intrusive
on the privacy interest at stake.  In other words, the manner in which the
search was carried out must have been reasonably necessary
to eliminate any threat. 

[48]                         
In the instant case,
the trial judge found that Sgt. Boyd had, in pushing the door open further,
done no more than was necessary to find out what Mr. MacDonald had behind his
leg.  His action was therefore reasonably necessary in order to determine
what was behind Mr. MacDonald’s leg and in so doing eliminate any threat to the safety of the public or the police.  In fact, one
could go further and state that there was no less intrusive way to do so.  Sgt.
Boyd twice asked Mr. MacDonald what he had in his hand but received no answer. 
In these circumstances, it is hard to imagine a less invasive way of
determining whether Mr. MacDonald was concealing a weapon (and thereby
eliminating any threat in that regard).

[49]                         
Indeed, when the officer’s evidence is read as a
whole, it appears that he had reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. MacDonald
had a weapon in his hands. He simply was not sure what kind of weapon it was
(see, for example, A.R., at p. 180).

[50]                         
On this basis, Sgt. Boyd’s pushing the door to
the unit open further constituted a reasonable search.  It was authorized by a
reasonable law and was carried
out in a reasonable manner.  It follows that Mr.
MacDonald’s rights under s. 8  of the Charter  were not violated.  As a
result, I need not consider the issue of a remedy under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .

C.  Appeal of the Acquittal on the
Charge Under Section 95 of the Code

[51]                         
The Crown is appealing Mr. MacDonald’s acquittal
on the charge under s. 95 of the Code.  It submits that the Court of
Appeal erred in interpreting the mens rea requirement of the offence of
possession of a loaded restricted firearm provided for in s. 95  and imposed a
nearly insurmountable burden on the Crown which is inconsistent with the principle
that ignorance of the law is no excuse.  Mr. MacDonald takes the position that
the Court of Appeal correctly interpreted the mens rea requirement of
that offence and correctly held that the mens rea had not been made
out.  I agree with the Crown that the Court of Appeal made an error in
requiring the Crown to prove, in order to secure a conviction under s. 95 , that
the accused knew his possession and acquisition licence and authorization to
transport the firearm did not extend to the place where he unlawfully had it in
his possession.  As I will explain, such a requirement is inconsistent with the
rule, codified in s. 19 of the Code, that ignorance of the law is no
excuse.

[52]                         
Section 95(1) of the Code reads as
follows:

95. (1) Subject to subsection (3), every person commits an offence who,
in any place, possesses a loaded prohibited firearm or restricted
firearm, or an unloaded prohibited firearm or restricted firearm together
with readily accessible ammunition that is capable of being discharged in the
firearm, unless the person is the holder of

 

(a)   an
authorization or a licence under which the person may possess the firearm in
that place; and

 

(b)   the
registration certificate for the firearm. 

[53]                         
In this Court, Mr. MacDonald’s argument on his
conviction under s. 95  relates to the mens rea of the offence.  He does
not dispute that he possessed a loaded restricted firearm in the unit.  Nor
does Mr. MacDonald deny that he possessed the firearm there without being the
holder of an authorization or a licence that entitled him to possess it in that
place.  Rather, he argues that s. 95  is a mens rea offence and that, to
secure a conviction, the Crown must show that he knew his possession of the
firearm in the unit was unauthorized.  This, Mr. MacDonald says, the Crown
failed to do, whereas he testified at trial that he had a subjective belief
that the authorization he had obtained in Alberta extended to his condominium
in Halifax.

[54]                         
In my view, the offence provided for in s. 95  is
a mens rea offence.  As this Court recognized in Lévis (City) v.
Tétreault, 2006 SCC 12, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 420, at para. 16, classifying an
offence as either a mens rea offence, a strict liability offence or an
absolute liability offence is a question of statutory interpretation.  The
Crown agreed at the hearing of this case that the offence at issue is a mens
rea offence, and in any event, we may validly rely on the presumption that
an offence should be classified as a mens rea offence where, as here,
nothing in the statute indicates a contrary intention (The Queen v. Sault
Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, at pp. 1309-10; Beaver v. The Queen,
[1957] S.C.R. 531).

[55]                         
The mens rea the Crown is required to
prove under s. 95(1)  does not, however, include knowledge that possession in
the place in question is unauthorized.  Rather, knowledge that one
possesses a loaded restricted firearm, together with an intention to possess
the loaded firearm in that place, is enough.  An individual who knowingly
possesses a loaded restricted firearm in a particular place with an intention
to do so will be liable to punishment for the offence provided for in s. 95(1) 
unless he or she holds an authorization or a licence under which the firearm
may be possessed in that place.  Thus, a proper authorization or licence serves
to negate the actus reus of the offence, thereby allowing someone who
legitimately possesses a restricted firearm in a given place to avoid
liability.

[56]                         
With respect, the Court of Appeal erred in law
by improperly reading a defence of ignorance of the law into s. 95(1) .  In the
majority’s view, the Crown had to prove that Mr. MacDonald knew or was wilfully
blind to the fact that his possession was unauthorized.  Such a burden would
compel the Crown to prove that an accused knew the conditions of his or her
authorization or licence.  This amounts to requiring the Crown to prove that
the accused knew the law.

[57]                         
The following example illustrates the point that
an error made by an accused in interpreting his or her authorization or licence
is a mistake of law and not one of fact.  Suppose the Code provided that
restricted firearms could be possessed only in the province of Alberta, and
nowhere else in Canada.  Surely, if that were the case, there could be no
dispute that Mr. MacDonald’s possession of such a firearm in Halifax
contravened this rule, and any suggestion that he thought he could lawfully
possess it there would have to be considered a mistake of law and would
therefore afford no defence to a charge of unlawful possession.  For my part, I
find no distinction when such a rule is expanded to an individual’s
authorization and the applicable section of the Code merely refers to
such a document.  Mr. MacDonald’s subjective belief that he could possess the
firearm in Halifax is therefore nothing other than a mistake of law.

[58]                         
I therefore find that a requirement that an
accused knew or was wilfully blind to the fact that his possession was
unauthorized would be grounded on the acceptance of mistake of law as a defence
to a charge under s. 95(1) .  It is trite law that, except in the case of an
officially induced error, a mistake of law is no defence in our criminal
justice system.  Section 19 of the Code states:

19. Ignorance of the law by a person who commits an offence is not an
excuse for committing that offence.

[59]                         
In R. v. Forster, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 339,
Lamer C.J. accurately and succinctly explained this as follows:

It is a
principle of our criminal law that an honest but mistaken belief in respect of
the legal consequences of one’s deliberate actions does not furnish a defence
to a criminal charge, even when the mistake cannot be attributed to the
negligence of the accused: Molis v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 356. 
This Court recently reaffirmed in R. v. Docherty, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 941,
at p. 960, the principle that knowledge that one’s actions are contrary to the
law is not a component of the mens rea for an offence, and consequently
does not operate as a defence. [p. 346]

[60]                         
In sum, the Court of Appeal erred by treating Mr.
MacDonald’s mistake of law as a mistake of fact which exonerated him of the
charge resulting from his actions.  I would allow the Crown’s appeal on this
issue and restore the conviction under s. 95(1) .

[61]                         
Although I am of the view that the conviction
must be restored, I nevertheless appreciate the Court of Appeal’s concern that Mr.
MacDonald may as a result of this conviction be sentenced to a mandatory
three-year term of imprisonment despite the fact that, in ordinary
circumstances, his mistake of law would be a mitigating factor to be considered
in fashioning a sentence that is proportionate to his crime (C. C. Ruby, G. J.
Chan and N. R. Hasan, Sentencing (8th ed. 2012), at pp. 319-21). 
Whether the mandatory minimum three-year term of imprisonment provided for in
s. 95(2)(a)(i) is constitutional will now be a matter for the Court of
Appeal to decide.

D.  Appeal Against the Sentence
Imposed by the Court of Appeal

[62]                         
Having restored Mr. MacDonald’s conviction under
s. 95(1) , this Court is not in a position to consider the Crown’s appeal
against the sentences imposed by the Court of Appeal on the charges under ss.
86(1) and 88(1).  Because the Court of Appeal acquitted Mr. MacDonald on the
charge under s. 95(1) , it did not consider his argument that the mandatory
minimum three-year sentence provided for in s. 95(2)(a)(i) is
unconstitutional.  Given the decision to restore Mr. MacDonald’s conviction on
this count, the matter should be remitted to the Court of Appeal for
consideration of this argument.  Because of the close factual tie between the
sentences imposed for the convictions under ss. 86  and 88  and the one imposed
for the conviction under s. 95 , the Court of Appeal should reconsider all the sentences
together after deciding whether s. 95(2)(a)(i) is constitutionally
valid.

V.  Disposition

[63]                         
For the reasons set out above, I would dismiss Mr.
MacDonald’s appeal on the s. 8  issue and allow the Crown’s appeal on the charge
under s. 95(1) .  Mr. MacDonald’s acquittal on that charge is set aside, and his
conviction is restored.  This matter will be remitted to the Court of Appeal
for sentencing, and it will be necessary for that court to determine whether
the mandatory minimum sentence applicable under s. 95(2)(a)(i) of the Code
is constitutionally valid.  

                    The reasons of Rothstein, Moldaver and
Wagner JJ. were delivered by

[64]                         
Moldaver and
Wagner JJ. — Every day, throughout this country, police
officers put their lives and safety at risk in order to preserve and protect
the lives and safety of others.  In return, they are entitled to know that when
potentially dangerous situations arise, the law permits them to conduct
minimally intrusive safety searches to alleviate the risks they face.  That is
the fundamental bargain we, as a society, have struck with the police — and it
is a fundamental commitment upon which the police are entitled to rely.  

[65]                         
The commitment of which we speak was
acknowledged by this Court in R. v. Mann, 2004 SCC 52, [2004] 3 S.C.R.
59.  Mann recognized a limited police power to search without a warrant
solely for protective purposes where a police officer has reasonable grounds to
suspect a threat to his or her safety or the safety of others.  The majority in
this case purports to apply Mann.  Respectfully, however, it does not. 
Instead, it renders Mann redundant, depriving police officers of the
limited search powers they need to protect themselves and the public in fluid
and often unpredictable situations of potential danger. 

[66]                         
In the instant case, while we agree with the
majority on all three issues in this case, including Mr. MacDonald’s claim
under s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , we part
company with our colleagues on the proper interpretation of Mann.  Our
colleagues assert, relying on Mann, that officers are only empowered to
conduct “safety searches” where they have reasonable grounds to believe an
individual is armed and dangerous (paras. 39 and 44).  With respect, we do not
agree with that conclusion.  In our view, Mann decided that officers may
conduct safety searches when they have reasonable grounds to suspect an
individual is armed and dangerous.  The balance of these reasons will focus on
explaining why.  

[67]                         
The case law reveals that the rationale
justifying the police power to perform protective searches is the protection of
public or officer safety. It seems to us that such a power is a necessary
corollary of the duties imposed on the police, two of which include the duty to
preserve the peace and to protect life and property.  Police officers cannot be
asked to intervene in dangerous or fluid situations and, at the same time, be
denied the authority to take protective measures when they reasonably suspect
their own safety is at risk, especially when there is a suspicion weapons are
present.

[68]                         
Mann affirmed as
much.  Our starting point then is the language of the case itself: 

. . . where a police officer has
reasonable grounds to believe that his or her safety or that of others
is at risk, the officer may engage in a protective pat-down search of
the detained individual.  [Emphasis added; para. 45.]

[69]                         
Read in isolation, the “reasonable grounds to
believe” language connotes the “reasonable and probable grounds” standard. See Baron
v. Canada, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 416, at p. 447.  But one cannot stop reading
there, because the concept of being “at risk” inherently builds in the concept
of possibility.  See, e.g., the Oxford English Dictionary (online), sub
verbo “risk” (“the possibility of loss, injury, or other adverse or
unwelcome circumstance; a chance or situation involving such a possibility”
(emphasis added)). 

[70]                         
The language of Mann thus appears to
stack a probability on top of a possibility — a chance upon a
chance.  In other words, Mann says a safety search is justified if it is
probable that something might happen, not that it is probable that
something will happen.  As this Court only recently explained, the
former is the language of “reasonable suspicion” (R. v. MacKenzie,
2013 SCC 50, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 250, at para. 74).  The latter is the language of
“reasonable and probable grounds”. 

[71]                         
Admittedly, the language of Mann could
have been clearer.  Indeed, the ambiguity in the key paragraph of Mann has
led at least one authority in this field to suggest that the Court simply
“misspoke”:  J. Stribopoulos, “The Limits of Judicially Created Police Powers:
Investigative Detention after Mann” (2007), 52 Crim. L.Q. 299, at
p. 311.  While it would have been helpful if the Court in Mann had
simply said either “reasonable grounds to believe an individual
is armed and dangerous” or “reasonable grounds to suspect an
individual is armed and dangerous”, the fact is that it did not.  Fortunately,
however, we are able to resolve any lingering doubt about the meaning of Mann
with the tools available to us.  As we will explain, each of these tools points
away from the majority’s interpretation.  

[72]                         
Since legal terms of art are not always
self-defining, we begin with how the Mann Court actually described the
standard it was adopting.  A close reading leaves no doubt it was describing
reasonable suspicion.  For example, Mann held that “[t]he search must be
grounded in objectively discernible facts to prevent ‘fishing
expeditions’ on the basis of irrelevant or discriminatory factors”
(para. 43 (emphasis added)).  As we recently held in R. v. Chehil, 2013
SCC 49, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 220, reasonable suspicion must be grounded in “objectively
discernible facts, and . . . prevents the indiscriminate and discriminatory
exercise of police power” (para. 3 (emphasis added)).  Similarly, Mann spoke
of a “logical possibility that the [suspect] . . . was in
possession of break-and-enter tools, which could be used as weapons” (para. 48
(emphasis added)).  Again, Chehil makes clear that “reasonable suspicion
. . . engages [a] reasonable possibility, rather than
probability” (para. 27 (emphasis added)). Finally, Mann required that an
officer “not be acting solely on a hunch” (para. 41 (emphasis added)). 
And again, Chehil cautioned “hunches . . . will [not] suffice”
(para. 47 (emphasis added)).  We know of no case that has described the
reasonable and probable grounds standard using this language.

[73]                         
To look at the matter another way, had Mann intended
to adopt a reasonable and probable grounds standard, these detailed
elaborations would have been unnecessary since reasonable and probable grounds
was at the time a well-known standard.  Indeed, it was and remains the presumptive
standard under the Charter  (see Hunter v. Southam Inc.,
[1984] 2 S.C.R. 145).  In contrast, Mann represented one of the first
attempts by this Court to define the standard of reasonable suspicion (see also
R. v. Kang-Brown, 2008 SCC 18, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 456; R. v. A.M.,
2008 SCC 19, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 569; Chehil; MacKenzie).

[74]                         
Second, we look at the history from which Mann
emerged.  In recognizing a power of investigative detention and a related
power to search for protective purposes incidental to that detention, Mann explicitly
relied on the U.S. Supreme Court’s seminal decision in Terry v. Ohio,
392 U.S. 1 (1968).  Significant for present purposes, Mann quoted the
following passage from Terry (at p. 27) when articulating the
standard upon which an officer safety search must be measured:

     . . . there must be a narrowly
drawn authority to permit a reasonable search for weapons for the protection of
the police officer, where he has reason to believe that he is dealing
with an armed and dangerous individual, regardless of whether he has
probable cause to arrest the individual for a crime.  [Emphasis added;
para. 41.]

[75]                         
As the excerpt makes clear, Chief Justice Warren
clearly distinguished the Terry standard from the “probable cause”
standard — the equivalent of our reasonable and probable grounds — traditionally
used for arrests.  And though there has never been any serious debate about
what Terry meant, in speaking of a “reason to believe”, the language of Terry
risked being “confusing and contradictory” because “it is precisely the
language the [U.S. Supreme] Court has used time and again to define the
probable cause requisite for arrest” (W. R. LaFave, Search and Seizure:  A
Treatise on the Fourth Amendment (5th ed. 2012), vol. 4, at §9.6(a)).  As
our American colleagues only recently affirmed, however, under Terry,
“the police must harbor reasonable suspicion that the person . . . is
armed and dangerous” (Arizona v. Johnson, 129 S. Ct. 781 (2009), at p.
784 (emphasis added)).  It is surely ironic, then, that in borrowing from Terry’s
diction, Mann inadvertently imported the same confusion and
contradiction into Canada.  

[76]                         
That brings us to our third point.  Until today,
it was thought that the subsequent interpretation and application of Mann by
this Court and others had put that confusion to rest.  Most significantly, in R.
v. Clayton, 2007 SCC 32, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 725, as Abella J. explained, the
two accused were detained because the police had a “reasonable suspicion” they
were in possession of firearms and “as a result, the lives of the police
officers and of the public were at risk” (para. 46).  Those very safety
concerns — without more — justified searches of the accused incidental to their
detention (para. 48).  In other words, the officers were entitled to conduct a
minimally intrusive search for safety purposes because they had reason to
suspect that the accused were armed and dangerous.

[77]                         
Beyond Clayton, this Court has on at
least three distinct occasions expressed, albeit in obiter, that Mann
authorized a protective search incidental to investigative detention on the
basis of reasonable suspicion.  First, Binnie J., writing for himself and the
Chief Justice in Kang-Brown, referred to “the Court’s decision in Mann
to lower the bar from reasonable and probable cause to reasonable suspicion
in the context of a warrantless search” (para. 62 (emphasis added)).  In
R. v. Aucoin, 2012 SCC 66, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 408, at para. 44, n.
3, the majority expressly declined to endorse the minority’s assertion that Mann
required a reasonable and probable grounds standard for pat-down searches. 
And, lastly, only a few months ago — in an opinion joined by every member of
today’s majority — we noted that Mann authorized “limited searches
accompanying investigative detentions” on the basis of “reasonable suspicion” (Chehil,
at para. 22, n. 1).  With respect, the majority does not explain why these
comments were mistaken. 

[78]                         
Beyond our own cases, lower courts have relied
on this Court’s jurisprudence and have, unsurprisingly, concluded that Mann
adopted a reasonable suspicion standard.  For example, in R. v. Crocker,
2009 BCCA 388, 275 B.C.A.C. 190, leave to appeal refused, [2010] 1 S.C.R. viii,
the court held that “[a] lawful protective safety search . . . need only meet
the legal standard of reasonable suspicions . . . required by Mann”
(para. 72 (emphasis added)).  Just a few months ago, the same conclusion was
reached in R. v. Atkins, 2013 ONCA 586, 310 O.A.C. 397:  “The pat-down search
that followed the detention was justified on officer safety grounds” because
“[t]he officers reasonably suspected that the appellant was in
possession of a weapon” (para. 15 (emphasis added)).  

[79]                         
Fourth, the logical consequences of a reasonable
and probable grounds standard in the context of Mann make little sense. 
Had the officer possessed reasonable grounds to believe that the accused in Mann
was armed and dangerous, he could have arrested him.  See, e.g., Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 88  (possession of a weapon for a purpose
dangerous to the public peace).  In other words, if Mann required
reasonable and probable grounds for a pat-down search, it would seem all that Mann
achieves is a power to search when there are already grounds to arrest. 
See also Stribopoulos, at p. 311.  Manifestly, this is an anomalous result.  

[80]                         
An officer who has reasonable grounds to believe
an individual is armed and dangerous will always have an immediate need to
assert control over that person.  That need will inevitably entail arresting
the individual, and, as soon as it is safe to do so, subjecting that person to
a search incident to arrest, predicated on a lower standard (see R. v.
Caslake, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 51, at para. 25).  Indeed, it defies common sense
to suggest that an officer confronted with an individual who is reasonably
believed to be armed and dangerous would forgo the lawful option of arresting
the individual in favour of a mere pat-down search.  Notably, a search incident
to arrest is far more intrusive than the minimally intrusive search recognized
under Mann.  A search incident to arrest would include a search
of the person, but could also include a search of his or her belongings or
automobile (see Caslake, at para. 15). 

[81]                         
Against that background, it is worth recalling
that each time this Court has asked itself whether it should recognize a new
common law police power, it has been “because of perceived gaps in the
law” (Kang-Brown, at para. 6, per LeBel J. (emphasis
added)).  The identification of such gaps has quite rightly been a prerequisite
to doing so given this Court’s reluctance to take upon itself the task of
creating new police powers under the common law.  We fail to understand then
why the Court in Mann would recognize a protective search power on a
standard that renders the power unnecessary.  Put simply, on the majority’s
interpretation, Mann fills no gap.  With respect, that result
cannot be what Mann intended.  

[82]                         
Fifth, and turning to the facts of this case, the majority’s conclusion that Sgt. Boyd
had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that Mr. MacDonald was armed and
dangerous does not conform with the evidence.  Of greater concern, the
majority’s approach appears to appreciably lower the standard for what
constitutes reasonable and probable grounds. 

[83]                         
To be sure, on the
facts as found by the trial judge, Sgt. Boyd’s suspicion that Mr.
MacDonald was armed and dangerous was reasonable.  The
context of the encounter with him indicates a degree of hostility toward the
building staff and police.  To begin, Mr. MacDonald dismissed the building
concierge’s attempts to turn down the music in what the trial judge
diplomatically characterized as an “undiplomatic manner” (trial reasons,
MacDonald’s A.R., at p. 5).  He showed “some evidence of intoxication” (ibid.). 
When Cst. Pierce attended on the scene, Mr. MacDonald “proceeded to shut the
door requiring the constable to remove her foot from the threshold, telling the
constable to fuck off or words to that effect” (p. 6).  The trial judge
accepted that Sgt. Boyd saw a “black and shiny” object in Mr. MacDonald’s hand
(voir dire reasons, MacDonald’s A.R., at p. 248).  Significantly, “[i]t
was concealed behind [his] right leg” (ibid.).  Moreover, Sgt.
Boyd thought “it might be a knife” (p. 249).  In these circumstances, Sgt. Boyd
had reason to suspect that Mr. MacDonald, who had been acting in a hostile and
aggressive fashion, was armed and dangerous — but he surely did not have
reasonable grounds to believe that he was armed and dangerous.  

[84]                         
Our colleagues do not give effect to the
officer’s clear evidence and find instead that Sgt. Boyd had reasonable grounds
to believe that Mr. MacDonald was armed and dangerous.  With respect, we
cannot accept this conclusion.  This is the first time such a finding has been
made.  The trial judge made no such finding, nor did any justice of the Court
of Appeal reach this conclusion.  Second, no party before this Court advances
such a claim.  Indeed, the Crown submits that a reasonable and probable
grounds standard is “completely unrealistic” in this context (R.F., at para.
46).

[85]                         
Overstating Sgt. Boyd’s evidence is not just
inconsistent with the evidence in this case; it also significantly lowers the
reasonable grounds to believe threshold by eliminating the subjective
requirement that the standard demands (R. v. Storrey, [1990] 1 S.C.R.
241, at pp. 250-51).  The law is clear that an officer must subjectively believe
he has reasonable and probable grounds; it is not enough that he objectively
did.  In this case, however, Sgt. Boyd’s testimony of his “concern” that Mr.
MacDonald “might” have had a weapon does not fit with the majority’s conclusion
that Sgt. Boyd himself believed he had reasonable and probable grounds.  Sgt.
Boyd believed in a possibility, not a probability.[1]  In other words, he
subjectively suspected that Mr. MacDonald had a weapon, and this
suspicion was objectively reasonable.  

[86]                         
These five reasons — the language of Mann,
the history from which Mann emerged, the logical consequences of
interpreting Mann as requiring reasonable grounds to believe, the
jurisprudence that has interpreted Mann, and the facts of this case —
all lead to the same unavoidable conclusion:  Mann recognized a
protective search power predicated on reasonable suspicion.  

[87]                         
This case could have been — and ought to have
been — resolved by extending the logic of Mann.  First, Sgt. Boyd, while
lawfully engaged in his duties, had a reasonable suspicion that Mr. MacDonald
was armed and dangerous.  Second, in response to that reasonable suspicion,
Sgt. Boyd’s conduct — pushing Mr. MacDonald’s door open a few more inches — was
“no more intrusive of liberty interests than [was] reasonably necessary to
address the risk” (Aucoin, at para. 36, quoting Clayton, at para.
31).  Accordingly, the search was reasonable for purposes of s. 8 .

[88]                         
It must be stressed that in cases such as the
one at hand, the “Mann standard” for protective searches, as properly
understood, does not empower an officer to engage in random searches based on a
whim or a hunch.  Rather, the officer’s suspicion that the individual is armed
and dangerous must be reasonable having regard to the totality of the
circumstances.  As this Court said recently in Chehil, the belief must
be derived from “objectively discernible facts, which can then be subjected to
independent judicial scrutiny” (para. 26). 

[89]                         
Nor is the proposition of a reasonable suspicion
standard — even where it authorizes entry into a home — unfaithful to the Charter . 
Though Hunter established a presumption of reasonable and probable
grounds, Dickson J. (as he then was) was careful to observe that in some
circumstances “the relevant standard might well be a different one” (p. 168). 
That is to say, the purpose of a search matters.  While the general rule is
that a warrant secured on reasonable and probable grounds is required for entry
into a home to effect an arrest (R. v. Feeney, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 13), the Criminal
Code  provides for warrantless entry in “exigent circumstances” where there
are “reasonable grounds to suspect that entry into the dwelling-house is
necessary to prevent imminent bodily harm or death to any person” (see, e.g.,
ss. 487.11  and 529.3(2) ).  Moreover, this Court has recognized that warrantless
entry into a home is authorized by a 911 distress call, as it reveals a
potential threat to life (see R. v. Godoy, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 311). 
Similarly, in R. v. Golub (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 743, leave to appeal
refused, [1998] 1 S.C.R. ix, the Ontario Court of Appeal recognized a power to
search a home without a warrant incidental to arrest on the basis of “a
reasonable suspicion” that a threat to safety existed (pp. 758-59).

[90]                         
In the end, this case illustrates the danger of
leaving police powers to be developed in a piecemeal fashion by the courts. 
Today, our colleagues impose a standard requiring that an officer have
reasonable grounds to believe an individual is armed and dangerous before a
“safety search” is authorized, effectively overturning the search power
recognized in Mann and a decade of subsequent jurisprudence in the
process.  

[91]                         
We should be clear about the consequences of the
majority’s decision:  officers are deprived of the ability to conduct protective
searches except in circumstances where they already have grounds to arrest.  As
of today, officers are empowered to detain individuals they suspect are
armed and dangerous for investigatory purposes, but they have no power to
conduct pat-down searches to ensure their safety or the safety of the public as
they conduct these investigations.  In our view, a police officer in the field,
faced with a realistic risk of imminent harm, should be able to act immediately
and take reasonable steps, in the form of a minimally intrusive safety search,
to alleviate the risk.

Cases Cited

                    Referred to:  R. v. Yumnu, 2012
SCC 73, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 777.

                    APPEAL
from a judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal (O’Connor A.C.J. and MacPherson
and Cronk JJ.A.), 2012 ONCA 776, [2012] O.J. No. 5309 (QL), 2012 CarswellOnt
14252, affirming the conviction of the accused for sexual assault, sexual touching
and invitation to sexual touching entered by Scott J.  Appeal dismissed.

 

                    Michael A. Crystal and Heather Cross, for the appellant.

 

                    Holly Loubert, for the respondent.

 

                    The judgment
of the Court was delivered orally by 

[1]               Moldaver J. — The sole issue in this appeal is whether the appellant’s trial
counsel provided him with ineffective assistance, thereby resulting in a
miscarriage of justice.  The appellant challenges the competence of his trial
counsel on a number of grounds, the most serious being that she prevented him
from testifying at trial.

[2]               The Court of Appeal
rejected the appellant’s submissions (2012 ONCA 776 (CanLII)).  While the court
did not specifically address all of the appellant’s many, and continually
growing list of ineffective assistance claims, it found that they either lacked
an evidentiary foundation or did not result in prejudice.  In so concluding,
the court carefully considered the record at trial, along with the fresh
evidence filed on the appeal, and applied the correct legal principles.  It
made findings of fact based on this record.  In making these findings, the
Court of Appeal acted as a court of first instance.  Its findings, like those
of a trial judge, are entitled to deference (see R. v. Yumnu, 2012 SCC
73, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 777, at para. 17).

[3]               The Court of
Appeal’s findings are supported by the record.  Contrary to the appellant’s
submissions, the court found that he had agreed with counsel that he would not
testify.  The court also rejected the appellant’s argument that trial counsel
had acted incompetently by failing to prepare him to testify.  The court noted
that the appellant could have been granted an adjournment had there been any
suggestion he wanted to testify, and that extensive preparation was
unnecessary.  Moreover, the court found that trial counsel had not acted
ineffectively in failing to call the father of one of the complainants as a
witness because there was no evidence before the court, other than the
appellant’s assertion, indicating what this witness would say or how he could
be located.  Finally, the Court of Appeal found that while counsel’s
cross-examination of one of the complainants was “perhaps not stellar” (at
para. 24), it did not fall outside the realm of reasonable professional
assistance.

[4]               In
sum, we see no error in the Court of Appeal’s analysis or conclusion.  For
these reasons, we would dismiss the appeal.

                    Judgment
accordingly.

on appeal from the court
of appeal for alberta

                    Criminal law — Appeals — Powers of Court of Appeal —
Accused charged with possession of cocaine and possession of currency obtained
by crime — Court of Appeal raising new issues on appeal — Whether appeal court
erred in ordering new trial on basis of improper cross-examination — Whether
appeal court erred in raising new issue on appeal.

                    Constitutional
law — Charter of Rights  — Right to be informed of reasons for arrest — Right to
counsel — Accused charged with possession of cocaine and possession of currency
obtained by crime — Police delaying in advising accused of reasons for arrest
and of his rights to retain and instruct counsel — Whether trial judge erred in
law in concluding that police infringed accused’s right to be informed of
reasons for arrest and his right to counsel — Whether trial judge erred in law
in excluding evidence — Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, ss. 10 , 24(2) .

                    The
accused was charged with possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking
and possession of currency obtained by the commission of an offence.  The trial
judge determined that the accused’s rights under s. 10 (a) and (b)
of the Charter  were breached because the constables waited 22 minutes to
inform him of the reasons for his arrest and an extra 2 to 5 minutes to inform
him of his right to retain and instruct counsel.  The trial judge noted that
defence counsel cross-examined the detective who instructed constables to
arrest and search the accused.  During this cross-examination, defence counsel
confronted the detective about the testimony of another Crown witness, which
differed from the detective’s concerning the grounds to arrest and search the
accused.  Ultimately, all evidence was excluded and the accused was acquitted. 
The Crown appealed.  After the Crown and defence counsel filed their written
submissions, the Court of Appeal provided the parties with a list of cases and
called their attention to two issues for comment during oral argument:  (1) what
is a question of law on an appeal from an acquittal; and (2) the limits of
cross-examination and consequences of exceeding the limits.  During the oral
hearing, both counsel made submissions on whether the defence had conducted an
improper examination of the detective by asking him to comment on the veracity
of another officer’s testimony.  The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on the
basis that the trial judge erred in law by relying on the impermissible cross-examination
of the police detective.  The acquittals were set aside and a new trial
ordered.

                    Held:  The appeal should be allowed and the acquittals
restored.

                    An
appellate court has the jurisdiction to raise new issues and invite submissions
on an issue neither party has raised.  An issue is new when it raises a new
basis for potentially finding error in the decision under appeal beyond the
grounds of appeal as framed by the parties.  Issues that are rooted in or are
components of an existing issue are not new issues nor are issues that form the
backdrop of appellate litigation.  Furthermore, not all questions asked by an
appeal court will constitute a new issue.  Questions raised during the oral
hearing may properly touch on a broad range of issues, which may be components
of the grounds of appeal put forward by the parties, or may go outside of those
grounds in an aim to understand the context, statutory background or larger
implications.  Absent any concerns about bias, questions raised during the oral
hearing, whether linked directly or by extension to the grounds of appeal or
not, are not improper. 

                    While
appellate courts have the discretion to raise a new issue, this discretion
should be exercised only in rare circumstances.  An appellate court should only
raise a new issue when failing to do so would risk an injustice.  At all times
the discretion is limited by the requirement that raising the new issue cannot
suggest bias or partiality on the part of the court.  Courts cannot be seen to
go in search of a wrong to right.  Where there is good reason to believe that
the result would realistically have differed had the error not been made, this
risk of injustice warrants the court of appeal’s intervention.  The standard of
“good reason to believe” that a failure to raise a new issue “would risk an
injustice” is a significant threshold which is necessary in this context in
order to strike an appropriate balance between the role of appellate courts as
independent and impartial arbiters with the need to ensure that justice is
done.  In order to raise a new issue, the court should also consider whether it
has the jurisdiction to consider the issue, whether there is a sufficient
record on which to raise the issue and whether raising the issue would result
in procedural prejudice to any party.

                    When
an appellate court raises a new issue, there must be notification and
opportunity to respond.  The court of appeal must make the parties aware that
it has discerned a potential issue and ensure that they are sufficiently
informed so they may prepare and respond.  Requiring that strict procedural
standards be followed would fail to recognize that the issue may arise in
different circumstances in different cases.  The court should raise the issue
as soon as is practically possible after the issue crystallizes so as to avoid
any undue delay in the proceedings.  However, notification of the new issue may
occur before the oral hearing, or the issue may be raised during the oral
hearing.  The notification should not contain too much detail, or indicate that
the court of appeal has already formed an opinion, however it must contain
enough information to allow the parties to respond to the new issue.  The
requirements for the response will depend on the particular issue raised by the
court.  Counsel may wish to simply address the issue orally, file further
written argument, or both.  The underlying concern should be ensuring that the
court receives full submissions on the issue.  If a party asks to file written
submissions before or after the oral hearing, there should be a presumption in
favour of granting the request.  Recusal of a judge or panel should be rare and
should be governed by the overriding consideration of whether the new issue or
the way in which it was raised could lead to a reasonable apprehension of bias.

                    In
this case, the Court of Appeal erred in raising the new issue of improper cross-examination. 
The impugned question on cross-examination did not impact the trial judge’s
decision.  The error was not material and the result would not have been
different had the trial judge not allowed the impugned cross-examination.  Even
if the trial judge had relied on the impugned question, it had no material
bearing on the outcome so as to raise a realistic risk of an injustice.  It is
also significant that the improper question was put to a Crown witness, rather
than the accused.  Furthermore, the Crown neither objected to the impermissible
question nor raised it as an issue on appeal which suggests that the question
did not have a serious effect on the outcome of the voir dire.  As not
raising the issue of the impugned cross-examination would not have risked an
injustice, it follows that the Court of Appeal erred in raising the issue.

                    There
is also no basis to overturn the trial judge’s conclusion that the accused’s s.
10  Charter  rights were breached.  The trial judge found as a fact that
there was insufficient evidence to support the assertion that immediate
compliance with s. 10  of the Charter  would have compromised the ongoing
investigation.  As Crown appeals from acquittals are restricted to questions of
law, findings of fact can only be undermined in limited situations, not
applicable in this case.  There were no exceptional circumstances to justify
the delay by the police in complying with their s. 10  informational duties and
therefore no reason to disturb the trial judge’s conclusion that s. 10 (a)
and (b) of the Charter  were infringed.  Furthermore, in view of
the deferential standard of review on appeal and because the Crown’s arguments
with respect to the trial judge’s s. 24(2)  findings amount to an attack on the trial
judge’s findings of fact, the trial judge’s order to exclude the evidence under
s. 24(2)  of the Charter  should also not be interfered with.

Overview

[1]                             
The primary question on this appeal centres on
the issue of an appellate court’s ability to raise new grounds of appeal and
the considerations which should guide the court in doing so. At the heart of
this appeal are two potentially competing tensions: (1) the adversarial system,
which relies on the parties to frame the issues on appeal, and reserves the
role of neutral arbiter for the courts; and (2) the need for an appellate court
to intervene in order to prevent an injustice. The question on this appeal is
at what point can an appellate court disrupt the adversarial system and raise a
ground of appeal of its own? 

[2]                             
This appeal arose in the context of a voir
dire to exclude evidence. The secondary issue therefore concerns the trial
judge’s findings with respect to infringements under s. 10 (a) and (b)
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and the exclusion
of evidence under s. 24(2) .

II.          
Facts

A.          
The Chelmick Investigation

[3]                             
This case began with an investigation by the
Edmonton Police Service into a number of homicides and attempted homicides in
the city of Edmonton. Under the leadership of Detective Werth (then Constable
Werth), the investigation team obtained a wiretap authorization allowing them
to intercept the private communications of one of their principal targets,
Robin Flynn Chelmick. 

[4]                             
Between the night of January 5, 2009 and the
afternoon of January 6, 2009, the police intercepted calls from Chelmick’s line
related to a drug transaction for the purchase of a half a kilogram of cocaine.
Chelmick was acting as the middle man for an unidentified supplier for a
transaction scheduled to occur at 4:30 p.m. at Duke’s Bar and Grill. 

[5]                             
Visual surveillance of Chelmick on January 6,
2009 revealed interactions between Chelmick and the driver of a rented grey
Chevrolet Malibu in the parking lot of Duke’s Bar. The driver of the Malibu was
believed by Detective Werth to be the supplier of the cocaine. The driver was
later identified as the appellant, Mohammad Mian.

[6]                             
Three separate meetings took place between
Chelmick and the driver of the Malibu. Intercepted communications revealed that
the buyer of the cocaine was dissatisfied with the quality of the first
delivery of cocaine. After the third meeting which took place in the parking
lot of Duke’s Bar, the Malibu drove away and headed south. 

B.           
The Arrest and Search

[7]                             
While the surveillance of Chelmick was ongoing,
Detective Werth contacted two officers not connected with the homicide
investigation, Constables McGill and Dalziel. At a meeting at police
headquarters, Detective Werth advised Constables McGill and Dalziel that
surveillance was in place with respect to an individual involved in a drug
transaction who was believed to have drugs in his vehicle. Constables McGill
and Dalziel were provided with a surveillance radio so that they could listen
to surveillance reports and Detective Werth advised that at some point he would
instruct them to stop the target vehicle, the grey Chevrolet Malibu.

[8]                             
Constables McGill and Dalziel were instructed by
Detective Werth to make a routine traffic stop of the Malibu. Detective Werth
instructed Constables McGill and Dalziel that, once they were instructed to
stop the vehicle, they were to use every effort to find appropriate grounds to
search the Malibu without having to rely on the information provided by
Detective Werth so that the ongoing homicide investigation would not be
compromised. Nonetheless, the constables were told that there were already
grounds to arrest the driver which could be relied upon if other grounds could
not be found. 

[9]                             
After the meeting with Detective Werth,
Constables McGill and Dalziel went to the area of Duke’s Bar. As the Malibu
left Duke’s, it was followed by a surveillance vehicle, with Constables McGill
and Dalziel following behind in a police vehicle. At Detective Werth’s
instructions, at approximately 7:40 p.m. the overhead lights of the police
vehicle were activated and the Malibu was pulled over to the side of the road
with the police vehicle stopped about 40 feet behind. When the constables
approached the Malibu, Constable McGill recognized the driver as Mohammad Mian
from prior dealings with the police. 

[10]                         
As the pretence of the routine traffic stop was
underway, Detective Werth listened to reports from Constable Drynan, a member
of the surveillance team, who reported his observations that the driver of the
Malibu was reaching over the front passenger seat area and doing something with
his hands. At the voir dire, Constable McGill testified that he also
noticed Mr. Mian reaching in this way and that he had officer safety concerns
when he saw this. After hearing the reports from Constable Drynan, Detective
Werth then telephoned Constable Dalziel and informed Constable Dalziel that Mr.
Mian was reaching under the seats of the vehicle and that the officers should
go to the vehicle, remove Mr. Mian and arrest him. 

[11]                         
Constables McGill and Dalziel removed Mr. Mian
from the vehicle. Mr. Mian had a cell phone in his hand, which Constable McGill
removed. A pat-down search of Mr. Mian revealed $2,710 in cash on his person.
After Mr. Mian was placed in the back of the police vehicle, searches of the
Malibu led to the discovery of a large amount of cocaine and a smaller baggie
of cocaine, an additional $1,340 in cash, another cell phone and Mr. Mian’s
wallet.  Following the searches, a call was made for a tow truck to attend and
seize the Malibu.

[12]                         
Twenty-two minutes passed between the time when
the officers pulled over the Malibu and when Mr. Mian was advised that he was
being arrested for the possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. A
further two to five minutes passed before Mr. Mian was advised of his Charter 
rights to retain and instruct counsel. 

[13]                         
Mr. Mian was charged with possession of cocaine
for the purpose of trafficking and possession of currency obtained by the
commission of an offence. He applied to exclude all evidence on the basis that
he was arbitrarily detained and arrested by the police contrary to s. 9  of the Charter ,
that the police performed an unreasonable search and seizure contrary to s. 8 ,
and that the police failed to advise Mr. Mian of the reason for his detention
and his right to counsel contrary to s. 10 (a) and (b). Mr. Mian
asserted that the admission of the evidence seized would bring the
administration of justice into disrepute and should therefore be excluded
pursuant to s. 24(2)  of the Charter . 

III.       
Judicial History

A.          
Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench, 2011 ABQB 290,
516 A.R. 368

[14]                         
In his decision on the Charter voir dire to
exclude the evidence, Macklin J. found Constable Drynan to be a credible
witness and accepted his evidence that he did not indicate a concern about
officer safety, but simply reported his observations to the investigative team.


[15]                         
Macklin J. did not accept the evidence of either
Detective Werth or Constable McGill that there was a concern for officer safety
in the context of the search, detention or arrest caused by Mr. Mian reaching
under the seat of the Malibu. He found that Detective Werth gave his evidence
in a “very cavalier fashion and in a manner intended to justify a direction he
gave for the purpose of providing McGill and Dalziel with grounds to search the
Malibu while disguising the true purpose for stopping and searching the vehicle
in the first place” (para. 68). Macklin J. held that Detective Werth was
“intentionally misleading the Court with a view to justifying his instructions
to Dalziel” (para. 68). Macklin J. noted that when defence counsel confronted
Detective Werth about Constable Drynan’s testimony with respect to Mr. Mian’s
movements in the vehicle, Detective Werth responded that he did not care what
Constable Drynan said and that Constable Drynan was mistaken. 

[16]                         
However, although Macklin J. did not accept that
officer safety concerns could be relied on as grounds for Mr. Mian’s search and
arrest, he did find that there were other valid grounds based on Detective
Werth’s belief that the Malibu contained a significant quantity of cocaine. 

[17]                         
After determining that Mr. Mian’s ss. 8  and 9  Charter 
rights had not been breached in the course of the search and arrest,
Macklin J. turned to whether Mr. Mian’s s. 10 (a) Charter  right on
detention to be informed promptly of the reasons therefor and s. 10 (b)
right on arrest or detention to be informed of his right to retain and instruct
counsel without delay had been breached. Macklin J. noted that there must be
exceptional circumstances to justify suspending the rights protected under s. 10 (a)
and (b). There was no satisfactory reason for not advising Mr. Mian of
these rights immediately upon arrest. Macklin J. held that, in waiting 22
minutes to inform Mr. Mian of the reason for his arrest and his right to retain
and instruct counsel, Constables Dalziel and McGill breached Mr. Mian’s rights
under s. 10 (a) and (b). 

[18]                         
Macklin J. then went on to consider whether the
evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2)  of the Charter  pursuant to
the analysis as set out by this Court in R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32,
[2009] 2 S.C.R. 353. Under the first Grant factor, Macklin J. found that
the breaches were serious and deliberate, and thereby egregious. This factor
weighed in favour of excluding the evidence. Under the second factor, Macklin
J. held that there was a lack of causal connection between the Charter 
breaches and the obtaining of the evidence. As such, the breaches did not have
a significant impact on Mr. Mian’s privacy interests, which weighed in favour
of inclusion of the evidence. Finally, under the third Grant factor,
Macklin J. determined that, while the offence was serious and the evidence
highly reliable and probative, the Charter  breaches were also serious.
In addition, Detective Werth’s and Constable McGill’s continued reliance on
alleged officer safety concerns was an attempt to undermine the truth-seeking
function of the criminal trial process. Constable McGill’s questioning of Mr. Mian
in the back of the police vehicle prior to Mr. Mian being advised of the reason
for his detention and arrest was a further aggravating factor.  Macklin J. concluded
that this factor favoured excluding the evidence. 

[19]                         
Ultimately, Macklin J. held that, on balance,
the Grant factors favoured exclusion of the evidence. 

[20]                         
Mr. Mian was acquitted.

B.           
Alberta Court of Appeal, 2012 ABCA 302, 536 A.R.
308

[21]                         
The Crown appealed Mr. Mian’s acquittal,
advancing two grounds of appeal: (1) that “[t]he trial judge erred in law by
failing to find [that] exceptional circumstances justified the suspension of
[Mr. Mian’s] s. 10  Charter  rights”; and (2) that “[t]he trial judge
erred in law by excluding ‘essential and reliable evidence on account of Charter 
violations that had no causal connection with the discovery of the evidence,
were not otherwise egregious, and had no significant impact on Mr. Mian’s Charter -protected
interests’” (C.A. reasons, para. 27).

[22]                         
After the Crown and defence counsel filed their
written submissions, the Court of Appeal provided the parties with a list of
cases and called their attention to two issues for comment during oral
argument: (1) what is a question of law on an appeal from an acquittal; and (2)
the limits of cross-examination and consequences of exceeding the limits.

[23]                         
During the oral hearing, both counsel made
submissions on whether the defence had conducted an improper cross-examination
of Detective Werth by asking him to comment on the veracity of Constable
Drynan’s testimony. Following the hearing, defence counsel asked to file
further written submissions on the improper cross-examination issue. The Court
of Appeal allowed this request, and both parties submitted supplemental written
submissions in accordance with the timelines set out by the court. Defence
counsel was required to file written submissions before the Crown. 

[24]                         
The Court of Appeal held that a review of a
trial judge’s decision under s. 24(2)  of the Charter  requires deference
and is generally subject to a standard of palpable and overriding error.
However, the Court of Appeal was satisfied that the appeal should be allowed
“on the basis that the trial judge erred in law by relying on the impermissible
cross-examination of Detective Werth” (para. 32).

[25]                         
The impugned cross-examination occurred when
Detective Werth was questioned about the veracity of evidence given by Constable
Drynan:

Q.  All right. Now, I know you set out - - I’m going to use your
words, I don’t care what Drynan said about - - about the vehicle. I’m going to
tell you now what Drynan said. Okay? Under oath in these proceedings. Is that
he never - - never communication to anyone, anyone, to go and arrest the
subject of the roadside stop as a result of those observations that - - that
is, the reaching under the seat. I’m going to tell you he took it further, and
he said under oath that he never told or communicated to anyone to go and
extract the person from the motor vehicle at the roadside. He never told anyone
to do anything as a result of his observations.

 

A. 
I don’t agree with that. You just suggested to me that he didn’t tell me. My
evidence is that he did tell me, and I will not change that. I don’t care what
he said. I know what happened.

 

Q. So Drynan is . . . is he wrong, or is he lying?

 

A.  I think possibly he forgot.

 

Q.  So you don’t care what he says. He called you.

 

A. 
I’ll go back to my evidence, because I remember it quite clearly. I said one of
the members of surveillance - - and I still believe that it was Drynan. I still
believe that. If he can’t remember it, that’s fair. But you can tell me what he
said and what I said, but don’t tell me he didn’t say it because you weren’t
there.

 

(C.A.
reasons, at para. 33, quoting from trial transcript (emphasis added by Court of
Appeal).)

[26]                         
On appeal, defence counsel conceded that this
questioning was impermissible and offended the rule against cross-examining on
the veracity of another witness. The Court of Appeal found that the trial judge
erred in law by admitting and considering irrelevant and inadmissible evidence.
In particular, the Court of Appeal held that, in rejecting Detective Werth’s
testimony, the trial judge appeared to have relied upon the impugned
cross-examination. This resulted in a failure by the trial judge to give due
consideration to all the evidence relevant to the s. 24(2)  issue. The Court of
Appeal concluded that the trial judge’s mistake was material and that the
verdict would not necessarily have been the same if the trial judge had not
allowed the impugned cross-examination and admitted the evidence. The Court of
Appeal ordered a new trial on this basis. The Court of Appeal did not analyze
the grounds of appeal advanced by the Crown.

IV.       
Issues

[27]                         
This appeal raises the following issues:

(1)              
Did the Alberta Court of Appeal err in raising a
new ground of appeal? 

(2)              
Did the Alberta Court of Appeal err in ordering
a new trial on the basis of the improper cross-examination issue?

(3)              
Did the trial judge err in law in concluding
that the police infringed the rights of the accused under s. 10 (a) and (b)
of the Charter ?

(4)              
Did the trial judge err in law in excluding the
evidence under s. 24(2)  of the Charter ?

V.          
Analysis

A.          
When Can an Appellate Court Raise a New Issue?

[28]                         
It is not disputed that an appellate court has
the jurisdiction to invite submissions on an issue neither party has raised.
This appeal raises the questions of how broad this jurisdiction is, when it
should be exercised, and what procedures should be followed when it is invoked.


(1)        
What Is a “New Issue”?

[29]                         
This case turns on whether and how an appellate
court can raise a new issue on appeal. It is therefore important to first
define what a “new issue” is. 

[30]                         
An issue is new when it raises a new basis for
potentially finding error in the decision under appeal beyond the grounds of
appeal as framed by the parties. Genuinely new issues are legally and factually
distinct from the grounds of appeal raised by the parties (see Quan v.
Cusson, 2009 SCC 62, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 712, at para. 39) and cannot
reasonably be said to stem from the issues as framed by the parties. It follows
from this definition that a new issue will require notifying the parties in
advance so that they are able to address it adequately.

[31]                         
In defining what a new issue is, it is important
to recognize what will not constitute a new issue raised on appeal. First, not
all questions asked by an appeal court will constitute a new issue. The
jurisdiction of appellate courts to ask questions during the oral hearing is
well established. This jurisdiction is broad and is limited only by the
requirement that questions not be “raised in a manner which suggests bias or
partiality on the part of the appeal court” (R. v. W. (G.), [1999] 3
S.C.R. 597, at para. 17, per Lamer C.J.). Nothing in these reasons
should be construed as limiting the ability of appellate judges to ask any
question in the course of the oral hearing. 

[32]                         
 Questions raised during the oral hearing may
properly touch on a broad range of issues, which may be components of the
grounds of appeal put forward by the parties, or may go outside of those
grounds in an aim to understand the context, statutory background or larger
implications. For example, an appellate court may pose questions as to the
practical workings of a statutory regime. Absent any concerns about bias,
questions raised during the oral hearing, whether linked directly or by
extension to the grounds of appeal or not, are not improper (see W. (G.),
at para. 17). Such questions may be necessary for the court to gain a more
complete understanding of the issues at hand. 

[33]                         
Second, issues that are rooted in or are
components of an existing issue are also not “new issues”. Appellate courts may
draw counsel’s attention to issues that must be addressed in order to properly
analyze the issues raised by the parties. For example, in a case involving a
claim of self-defence, the parties may argue exclusively over whether the
accused’s belief that his life was in danger was reasonable, but it may be
necessary for the court to first analyze the issue of whether the accused
subjectively believed that he was at risk of death. This is not a “new issue”,
but a component of the overall analysis of the grounds as raised by the
parties. However, where appropriate, the court may have to be prepared to grant
even a brief adjournment to allow the parties to consider and canvass the
issue. 

[34]                         
Finally, issues that form the backdrop of
appellate litigation, such as jurisdiction, whether a given error requires a
remedy and what the appropriate remedy is, or as discussed below, the standard
of review, are not new issues and parties should not require notice to address
them. 

[35]                         
In summary, an appellate court will be found to
have raised a new issue when the issue was not raised by the parties, cannot
reasonably be said to stem from the issues as framed by the parties, and
therefore would require that the parties be given notice of the issue in order to
make informed submissions. Issues that form the backdrop of appellate
litigation will typically not be “new issues” under this definition. Exercising
the jurisdiction to ask questions during the oral hearing will not constitute
raising a new issue, unless, in doing so, the appellate court provides a new
basis for reviewing the decision under appeal for error. 

(2)        
What Considerations Should Guide an Appellate
Court in Determining Whether to Raise a New Issue on Appeal?

[36]                         
The parties do not dispute that appellate courts
have the jurisdiction to raise new issues. Indeed, this jurisdiction is an
extension of the power of appellate courts to ask questions of the parties (see
W. (G.), at para. 17). The issue on this appeal is not whether appellate
courts can raise new issues, but when and in what circumstances will it be
appropriate for an appellate court to do so.  

[37]                         
There are two potentially competing
considerations at the heart of the issue in this case. First, the adversarial
system, which is a fundamental tenet of our legal system. Second, the role of
the courts to ensure that justice is done. 

[38]                         
Our adversarial system of determining legal
disputes is a procedural system “involving active and unhindered parties
contesting with each other to put forth a case before an independent
decision-maker” (Black’s Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009), sub verbo “adversary
system”). An important component of this system is the principle of party
presentation, under which courts “rely on the parties to frame the issues for
decision and assign to courts the role of neutral arbiter of matters the
parties present” (Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U.S. 237 (2008), at p. 243,
per Ginsburg J.).

[39]                         
A fundamental reason for maintaining this system
is to ensure that judicial decision-makers remain independent and impartial and
are seen to remain independent and impartial. When a judge or appellate panel
of judges intervenes in a case and departs from the principle of party
presentation, the risk is that the intervention could create an apprehension of
bias. This kind of departure from the usual conduct of an appeal could lead the
court to be seen to be intervening on behalf of one of the parties, thus
impugning the impartiality of the court. As this Court has said, “[it] is of
fundamental importance that justice should not only be done, but should
manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” (Brouillard v. The Queen,
[1985] 1 S.C.R. 39, at p. 43, citing R. v. Sussex Justices, Ex parte
McCarthy, [1924] 1 K.B. 256, at p. 259). It is for this reason that an
important tenet of our appellate system is for the court to respect the
strategic choices made by parties in framing the issues (see W. (G.), at
paras. 17-18).  

[40]                         
On the other hand, courts also have the role of
ensuring that justice is done. As Lord Denning explained in the context of
trial judges in the United Kingdom: “. . . a judge is not a mere
umpire to answer the question ‘How’s that?’ His object above all is to find out
the truth, and to do justice according to law . . .” (Jones
v. National Coal Board, [1957] 2 All E.R. 155 (C.A.), at p. 159 (emphasis
added)). This proposition is no less true of appellate judges. Meaningful
appellate review assesses the correctness of a lower court decision, both on
errors of law and palpable overriding errors of fact (see R. v. Sheppard,
2002 SCC 26, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, at paras. 25 and 28; and Housen v.
Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at paras. 1 and 4). I accept
the submission of the intervener the Attorney General of Alberta that “for
‘justice in fact to be done,’ judges must sometimes ‘intervene in the
adversarial debate’” (I.F., at para. 16, citing Brouillard, at p. 44). 

[41]                         
The question then is how to strike the
appropriate balance between these competing principles.  Appellate courts
should have the discretion to raise a new issue, but this discretion should be
exercised only in rare circumstances. An appellate court should only raise a
new issue when failing to do so would risk an injustice. The court should also
consider whether there is a sufficient record on which to raise the issue and
whether raising the issue would result in procedural prejudice to any party. 
This test is sufficiently flexible while also providing for an appropriate
level of restraint to address the tensions inherent in the role of an appellate
court. 

[42]                         
At all times this discretion is limited by the
requirement that raising the new issue cannot suggest bias or partiality on the
part of the court. Of essence here is that courts cannot be seen to go in
search of a wrong to right. This jurisdiction should be exercised with caution.
Appellate courts have the discretion to raise a new issue where justice
requires it, but this discretion is restrained in order to maintain the
impartiality of the decision-maker as required by our adversarial system.

(a)         
Whether Failing to Raise the Issue Would Risk an
Injustice

[43]                         
The fundamental consideration for an appellate
court in determining whether to raise a new issue is whether the failure to do
so would risk an injustice. 

[44]                         
There are some situations where the potential
for injustice will be more self-evident. As Mr. Song, counsel for Mr. Mian
submits, there are a number of situations where it will be appropriate for an
appellate court to raise an issue in order to prevent or rectify an injustice.
Indeed, the parties to this appeal agree that appellate courts can intervene to
assist self-represented litigants to ensure that the proceedings are fair (see W.
(G.), at para. 18), although this assistance has neutrality-based
limits and a judge “must exercise great care not to descend from the bench and
become a spectre at the accused’s counsel table, placing himself ‘in the
impossible position of being both advocate and impartial arbiter’” (R. v.
Phillips, 2003 ABCA 4, 320 A.R. 172, at para. 24, per Fruman J.A.,
aff’d 2003 SCC 57, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 623, citing R. v. Taubler (1987), 20
O.A.C. 64, at para. 30). In the criminal context, other examples may include
where a miscarriage of justice may have occurred (see R. v. E.M.W., 2011
SCC 31, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 542, at paras. 4-5) or where a verdict or sentence
appears to be clearly unreasonable (see W. (G.), at para. 19). It should be noted, however, that while these
examples generally apply, they are inapplicable to this case, which was a Crown
appeal from an acquittal.

[45]                         
However, attempting to precisely define the
situations which “would risk an injustice” would unduly limit the ability of
appellate courts to intervene to ensure that justice is in fact done. Where
there is good reason to believe that the result would realistically have
differed had the error not been made, this risk of injustice warrants the court
of appeal’s intervention.  

[46]                         
The determination of whether there is good
reason to believe that a failure to raise a new issue “would risk an
injustice” requires performing a preliminary assessment of the issue. The
standard of “good reason to believe” that a failure to raise a new issue “would
risk an injustice” is a significant threshold which is necessary in this
context in order to strike an appropriate balance between the role of appellate
courts as independent and impartial arbiters with the need to ensure that
justice is done.  

[47]                         
At this stage, the merits of the issue will not
yet have been argued or decided. As such, the assessment of the issue is not a
“full-fledged review”, but rather is preliminary (W. (G.), at para. 20).
In all cases where an appellate court is considering whether to raise a new
issue, it would be inappropriate for the court to engage in any in-depth
assessment of the merits of an issue at a stage where the parties remain
ignorant of the issue.  However, a court’s failure to raise a new issue will
not risk an injustice in the absence of a preliminary indication that there is
good reason to believe that an identified potential error would have affected
the result. 

[48]                         
It is likely that issues identified by appellate
courts will often fail to meet this “risk an injustice” factor. This will
particularly be so where both parties are represented by counsel. It will only
be in rare cases that counsel on both sides will have failed to identify an
issue that would realistically have affected the result.

(b)        
Other Considerations

[49]                         
Although consideration of whether the failure to
raise a new issue in a given case would risk an injustice is left to the discretion
of appellate courts, this discretion is not unlimited. 

[50]                         
First, it should go without saying that an
appellate court cannot raise a new issue unless the court has the jurisdiction
to consider the issue. Courts of appeal are statutory bodies and there is no
inherent jurisdiction in any appeal court (see Kourtessis v. M.N.R.,
[1993] 2 S.C.R. 53, at p. 69, per La Forest J.; and W. (G.), at
para. 8). For example, an appellate court’s jurisdiction on Crown appeals from
acquittals is restricted to consideration of questions of law (Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, ss. 676(1) (a) and 686(4) ). If an appellate court
would not have the jurisdiction to consider an issue raised by one of the
parties, then the court cannot raise the issue as a new issue on appeal.

[51]                         
Second, in order to raise a new issue, an
appellate court must be satisfied that there is a sufficient basis in the
record on which to resolve the issue.  “[T]here is always the very real danger
that the appellate record will not contain all of the relevant facts, or the
trial judge’s view on some critical factual issue, or that an explanation that
might have been offered in testimony by a party or one or more of its witnesses
was never elicited” (Performance Industries Ltd. v. Sylvan Lake Golf &
Tennis Club Ltd., 2002 SCC 19, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 678,
at para. 32). The new issue must be “manageable on the evidentiary record”
(para. 33). 

[52]                         
Finally, an appellate court should consider
whether there would be any procedural prejudice to either party. The procedures
which should be followed when an appellate court exercises its discretion to
raise a new issue are detailed further below. At this stage, it suffices to say
that it will often be possible for appellate courts to ensure procedural
fairness by adjusting the course of the appellate process, including granting
an adjournment when an issue is identified at or in advance of a hearing or
providing an opportunity for the parties to file written submissions. However,
if the issue is raised in a way or at a stage that could result in procedural
prejudice to either party, and such prejudice cannot be addressed through
adjustments to the process, the appellate court cannot raise the issue. 

(3)        
What Procedures Should Be Followed When an
Appellate Court Exercises Its Discretion to Raise a New Issue?

[53]                         
The risk of appellate courts appearing biased or
partial will be reduced by the cautious exercise of the discretion to raise new
issues, particularly when coupled with appropriate procedural safeguards.
Requiring such safeguards ensures that there is no unfairness to the parties
and no appearance of judicial partiality.

[54]                         
The Crown submits that when an appellate court
raises a new issue, there must be notification and opportunity to respond. I
agree. With respect to notification, the court of appeal must make the parties
aware that it has discerned a potential issue and ensure that they are
sufficiently informed so they may prepare and respond. It goes without saying
that all parties should be provided with proper notice. With respect to the
response, there is no single model. As the Crown submitted, “the nature of the
judicial issue and its relationship to the issues raised by the parties will
determine whether counsel wishes to file further written argument, address the
issue orally, or both” (R.F., para. 60).

[55]                         
This approach is practical and recognizes that
the appropriate procedure will vary depending on the context and the
circumstances in a given case. For example, appellate courts may become aware
of potential new issues at different points in time throughout the appeal
process, including before, during or after the oral hearing. Requiring that
strict procedural standards be followed would fail to recognize that the issue
may arise in different circumstances in different cases.

[56]                         
In my view, the following guidelines should be
used to assist an appellate court in determining what the appropriate procedure
should be on a case-by-case basis.

[57]                         
First, notification of the new issue may occur before the oral hearing,
or the issue may be raised during the oral hearing. If the issue is raised
during the oral hearing, it may be necessary to grant an adjournment to ensure
a full and fair hearing (E.M.W., at para. 4). If the issue is
raised prior to the oral hearing, the parties may request an adjournment of the
hearing and an extension of the filing deadlines for further written argument. 
At all times, the court should raise the issue as soon as is practically
possible after the issue crystallizes so as to avoid any undue delay in the
proceedings. 

[58]                         
Second, I agree with the submission of the Crown that the notification
should not contain too much detail, or indicate that the court of appeal has
already formed an opinion; however, it must contain enough information to allow
the parties to respond to the new issue. Ultimately, the adequate content of
notice will have to be determined on a case-by-case basis. It will be dependent
on a number of factors, including the complexity of the issue and the
obviousness of the issue on the face of the record.

[59]                         
Finally, I agree with the submission of the
Crown that the requirements for the response will depend on the particular
issue raised by the court. Counsel may wish to simply address the issue orally,
file further written argument, or both. As the Crown in this case says, this
determination is properly in the hands of both the court and the parties. In my
view, the underlying concern should be ensuring that the court receives full
submissions on the new issue. If a party asks to file written submissions before
or after the oral hearing, in my view, there should be a presumption in favour
of granting the request. The overriding consideration is that natural justice
and the rule of audi alteram partem will have to be preserved. Both
sides will have to have their responses considered. 

[60]                         
The intervener the Attorney General of Alberta
argues that, where a new issue is raised, the judge or panel that raised the
new issue should recuse itself and the panel should be reconstituted as
necessary. I cannot agree. Requiring recusal in all cases would be an onerous
procedural requirement that would result in significant delay and would not be
economical for the parties or the courts. Recusal is not necessary in every
case and the need for a new judge or reconstituted panel should be determined
on a case-by-case basis. Recusal should be rare and should be governed by the
overriding consideration of whether the new issue or the way in which it was
raised could lead to a reasonable apprehension of bias. 

(4)        
Did the Court of Appeal Err in Raising a New
Issue in This Case?

[61]                         
In this case, the Court of Appeal raised a new
issue on the question of improper cross-examination. This was a new issue on
appeal because it was not raised by the parties, required notice of the issue
in order to make informed submissions and was a new basis for potentially
finding error in the decision under appeal. The Court of Appeal also invited
comment on whether the grounds of appeal exposed an error of law enabling the
Crown to appeal the acquittal. As Mr. Mian concedes, the question of
jurisdiction was not a new issue because it went to the issue of the appellate
court’s jurisdiction and it was therefore properly raised. As discussed above,
issues of jurisdiction form the backdrop of appellate litigation and will never
constitute a new issue. The Court of Appeal did not comment on the “error of
law” issue in its decision and dealt with the appeal entirely on the basis of
the improper cross-examination issue. 

[62]                         
I conclude that the Court of Appeal erred in
raising the new issue of improper cross-examination. Although appellate courts
have the jurisdiction to raise new issues, the Court of Appeal did not
appropriately raise the issue of improper cross-examination in this case.

[63]                         
The raising of the new issue in this case fails
at the second step: whether failing to raise the new issue would risk an
injustice. I do not agree with the Court of Appeal that the impugned question
on cross-examination impacted the trial judge’s decision. The error was not
material and the result would not have been different had the trial judge not
allowed the impugned cross-examination. The basis for the issue was one
question asked in the course of the cross-examination of Detective Werth. The
impugned exchange comprised two lines in the trial transcript. The question was
not objected to at trial.

[64]                         
First, there is nothing to indicate that the
improper cross-examination factored into the decision-making process at all.
Detective Werth’s answer to the impugned question is not found in the trial
judge’s reasons. The trial judge’s assessment of Detective Werth’s credibility
was based on several factors, including his “very cavalier” demeanour and the
trial judge’s impression that Detective Werth gave his evidence “in a manner
intended to justify a direction he gave for the purpose of providing McGill and
Dalziel with grounds to search the Malibu while disguising the true purpose for
stopping and searching the vehicle in the first place” (para. 68). 

[65]                         
Second, even if the trial judge had relied on
the impugned question, I am not convinced that this had any material bearing on
the outcome so as to raise a realistic risk of an injustice. It is significant
that the improper question was put to a Crown witness, rather than Mr. Mian. As
he argues, this was not a case where an accused was asked to testify before a
jury as to the veracity of another witness’s evidence, thus undermining the
presumption of innocence. It is difficult to see how this single question put
to a Crown witness created a realistic risk of injustice. 

[66]                         
Finally, the question was not objected to at the
time. As the Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in R. v. Kociuk, 2011 MBCA
85, 270 Man. R. (2d) 170, per Chartier J.A. (as he then was):

. . . the fact that experienced
counsel at trial, and on appeal, were of the view that it was not sufficiently
important to warrant an objection at trial or to be a ground on appeal is not
an irrelevant consideration. Not only does it speak to the overall
satisfactoriness of the jury charge on this issue, it also says something about
the gravity of any omissions in the eyes of defence counsel . . . .
[para. 86]

In the present case, the
fact that the Crown neither objected to the impermissible question nor raised
it as an issue on appeal suggests that the question did not have a serious
effect on the outcome of the voir dire. 

[67]                         
As not raising the issue of the impugned
cross-examination would not have risked an injustice, it follows that the Court
of Appeal erred in raising the issue. 

[68]                         
As the Court of Appeal erred in raising the new
issue, it is not necessary to go on to determine whether the procedure it
followed was unfair. However, as Mr. Mian argued the issue of procedural
fairness before this Court, a few comments are warranted. 

[69]                         
Mr. Mian bases his argument on the fact that the
Court of Appeal required Mr. Mian, the respondent in the appeal, to file his
supplementary factum on the new issues before the Crown, the appellant.
Although in the usual course, the appellant will be required to file
submissions first, I am of the view that the procedure adopted by the Court of
Appeal was fair. The parties were notified of the issues in advance of the oral
hearing and the notice called the parties’ attention to the issues and provided
a list of authorities for comment. Both parties had the opportunity to address
the issues and neither sought to adjourn the oral hearing. When counsel for Mr.
Mian requested the opportunity to file written submissions on the issues raised
by the Court of Appeal, the request was granted. Counsel for Mr. Mian did not
complain about the filing requirements set out by the Court of Appeal. 

[70]                         
Having the respondent file submissions first was
unorthodox, particularly in view of the fact that the Crown had the burden to
show a legal error that had a material bearing on the acquittal. I would not
endorse this approach. However, it is difficult to say that prejudice resulted.
The Court of Appeal received full submissions from both parties, both orally
and in writing. The procedure adopted, while not perfect, was fair (see Canada
(Citizenship and Immigration) v. Harkat, 2014 SCC 37, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 33,
at para. 43; and Ruby v. Canada (Solicitor General), 2002 SCC 75, [2002]
4 S.C.R. 3, at para. 46). 

B.           
The Exclusion of Evidence

[71]                         
As the Court of Appeal erred in allowing the
appeal against acquittal and ordering a new trial on the basis of one of the
new issues raised by the court, it must be determined whether there should be a
new trial on the grounds of appeal advanced by the Crown before the Court of
Appeal — namely, that the trial judge erred in finding violations of s. 10 (a)
and (b) of the Charter  and that the trial judge erred in his s.
24(2)  Charter  analysis and ultimate decision to exclude the evidence. 

(1)        
Were Mr. Mian’s Section 10  Rights Breached?

[72]                         
In my view, there is no basis to overturn the
trial judge’s conclusion that Mr. Mian’s s. 10  Charter  rights were
breached.

[73]                         
The Crown argues that the police officers’
22-minute delay in complying with the informational duties under s. 10  of the Charter 
was justified by exceptional circumstances. Specifically, the Crown submits
that a more transparent drug arrest would have compromised the integrity of the
separate ongoing wiretap investigation into gang violence. 

[74]                         
The Crown concedes that to accept this argument
would constitute an extension of the circumstances in which s. 10  rights may be
suspended. As the Crown in this case recognizes, “[n]one of the jurisprudence
has considered the precise situation presented here” (R.F., at para. 81).  I
accept that the jurisprudence does recognize that compliance with the s. 10 (b)
informational rights may be suspended in exceptional circumstances (see R.
v. Manninen, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1233, at p. 1244; and R. v. Strachan,
[1988] 2 S.C.R. 980, at pp. 998-99). However, it is not necessary to decide in
this case whether the need to protect the integrity of a separate, ongoing
investigation is an exceptional circumstance which may justify the suspension
of the s. 10 (b) rights. Nor is it necessary to determine whether
exceptional circumstances can delay the implementation of s. 10 (a)
rights. Even if they could, exceptional circumstances do not arise on the facts
as found by the trial judge in this case.  

[75]                         
The trial judge found as a fact that there was
insufficient evidence to support the assertion that immediate compliance with
s. 10  of the Charter  would have compromised the broader investigation.
The trial judge acknowledged that Detective Werth testified that the delay was
due to concerns about compromising the ongoing investigation. However, the
judge went on to find that there was no evidence about why simply advising Mr.
Mian of the reason for his arrest or informing him of his right to counsel
would have frustrated the ongoing investigation of Chelmick and other gang
members. Ultimately, the trial judge found that there was no evidence of a
“real and present danger that the operation would be frustrated or compromised”
(para. 86). The Crown has not established a legal basis for assailing these
factual findings. Crown appeals from acquittals are restricted to questions of
law. Findings of fact can only be undermined in limited situations, not
applicable in this case, where the trial judge’s alleged shortcomings in
assessing the evidence give rise to an error of law (see Criminal Code,
s. 676(1) (a); and R. v. J.M.H., 2011 SCC 45, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 197,
at paras. 24-39, per Cromwell J.).

[76]                         
Accordingly, there were no exceptional
circumstances to justify the delay by the police in complying with their s. 10 
informational duties. There is no reason to disturb the trial judge’s
conclusion that s. 10 (a) and (b) of the Charter  were
infringed. 

(2)        
Did the Trial Judge Err in Excluding the
Evidence Under Section 24(2)?

[77]                         
It is well established that the determinations
of trial judges as to what would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute having regard to all of the circumstances will be reviewed
deferentially: “Where a trial judge has considered the proper factors and has
not made any unreasonable finding, his or her determination is owed
considerable deference on appellate review” (R. v. Côté, 2011 SCC 46,
[2011] 3 S.C.R. 215, at para. 44, per Cromwell J.). Applying that
standard in this case, there is no basis for overturning the trial judge’s
decision to exclude the evidence under s. 24(2)  of the Charter . Although
the Crown argues that the trial judge committed serious legal errors in his s.
24(2)  analysis, the Crown’s arguments amount to attacks on the trial judge’s
findings of fact and his ultimate assessment under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .
It is significant that this case involved a Crown appeal from an acquittal,
which limits the Crown’s challenge to the decision of the trial judge to
questions of law.

(a)         
The Grant Test for Exclusion of Evidence Under
Section 24(2)

[78]                         
Under s. 24(2) of the Charter , evidence
obtained in a manner that infringed or denied Charter  rights will be
excluded if it is established that, having regard to all of the circumstances,
the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute. In Grant, this Court held that a s. 24(2)  analysis requires
the court to assess and balance the following factors: (1) the seriousness of
the Charter  breach; (2) the impact of the breach on the protected
interests of the accused; and (3) society’s interest in the adjudication of the
case on its merits (para. 71). The trial judge applied this test and, as
detailed below, did not make any unreasonable findings. 

(i)          
The Seriousness of the Charter  Breach

[79]                         
The Crown argues that the seriousness of the
breach was lessened because of the extenuating circumstances of an ongoing
investigation. The Crown argues that the police delayed informing Mr. Mian of
the reason for his arrest and his right to counsel in order to avoid
compromising an investigation, thus mitigating the seriousness of the Charter 
breach. 

[80]                         
The Crown emphasizes the fact that the delay was
“only 22 minutes” and describes this delay as “minor” (R.F., at para. 99). 
Although 22 minutes may be “minor” in some circumstances, in the context of
this case it was significant.  In this case, there was evidence that Mr. Mian
was questioned while in the police vehicle at a point in time at which his s.
10  rights still had not been complied with (voir dire reasons, at para.
98). Although the Crown did not seek to introduce any statements that Mr. Mian
may have made at that time, the questioning of Mr. Mian indicates the
seriousness of the delay. The significance of the passage of time is heightened
in the circumstances of this case, where the trial judge found that there was
no valid reason for the delay and that there were numerous opportunities for
the police officers to advise Mr. Mian of the reason for his detention and his
right to retain and instruct counsel (ibid., at para. 94).

[81]                         
This does not mean that the seriousness of a
delay will never be mitigated by extenuating circumstances. Indeed, in an
appropriate case, where a Charter  breach has been found, a delay of more
than 22 minutes may well be justified. In this case, however, these arguments
are impermissible attempts to undermine the factual findings of the trial
judge. 

[82]                         
First, in Grant, this Court recognized
that “[e]xtenuating circumstances, such as the need to prevent the
disappearance of evidence, may attenuate the seriousness of police conduct that
results in a Charter  breach” (para. 75). However, in this case, the
trial judge found that once Mr. Mian was out of his vehicle, there could not
have been any concern for the destruction or loss of any evidence in the
vehicle. Second, the trial judge found that Detective Werth had instructed
Constables McGill and Dalziel that if they could not establish their own
grounds to arrest the driver of the Malibu, there were already grounds to
arrest the driver which they could rely upon. Finally, the trial judge found as
a fact that “[t]here was no evidence of a real and present danger that the
operation would be frustrated or compromised if Mian was immediately advised of
the reason for his arrest” or of “his right to retain and instruct counsel”
(para. 86). In view of these factual findings which were open to the trial
judge, I am unable to accept the Crown’s argument that the extenuating
circumstances of the ongoing investigation were sufficiently significant to
lessen the seriousness of the breach.

[83]                         
The Crown further submits that the breach was
not serious because there was a lack of a causal connection between the
breach and the discovery of the evidence. However, a causal connection
or lack thereof is not determinative.  This Court has confirmed that a causal
connection is not necessary in order to engage s. 24(2)  of the Charter  (Strachan,
at pp. 1000-1002). Indeed, the Crown concedes that a temporal connection
is in theory sufficient to engage s. 24(2) .  Moreover, the first line of
inquiry in the Grant analysis is concerned with the police conduct, and
is not focused on the connection or lack thereof between the police conduct and
the evidence (Grant, at paras. 72-73; see also Côté, at para.
71).  

[84]                         
At the stage of assessing the seriousness of the
breach, deliberate and egregious state conduct favours the exclusion of the
evidence: “In order to determine the effect of admission of the evidence on
public confidence in the justice system, the court on a s. 24(2)  application
must consider the seriousness of the violation, viewed in terms of the
gravity of the offending conduct by state authorities whom the rule of law
requires to uphold the rights guaranteed by the Charter ” (Grant,
at para. 73 (emphasis added)). In this case, the trial judge found that the Charter 
breaches were “extremely serious and deliberate” (para. 96) due to the “number
of opportunities” (para. 94) that Constables McGill and Dalziel had to advise
Mr. Mian of the reason for his detention and because “[t]here was no evidence
. . . as to how simply providing Mian with this information would
have created a real and present danger of compromising the ongoing
investigation” (para. 96).  These were findings of fact, entitled to
deference.  

[85]                         
In my view, the trial judge did not consider
improper factors, or ignore proper factors, at the first stage of the Grant
analysis.  There is no reason to disturb his findings that this first stage of
the analysis weighs in favour of excluding the evidence.

(ii)        
The Impact of the Breach on the Protected Rights
of the Accused

[86]                         
The Crown argues that “the trial judge erred by
overstating the impact of the breach on the Charter -protected interests
of the accused” (R.F., at para. 100). The basis for this argument is that Mr.
Mian “had to wait for constitutionally required advice for 22 minutes, not
several hours. He was not subjected to any lengthy interrogation” (R.F., at
para. 103). 

[87]                         
However, as explained above, the trial judge’s
assessment of the Grant factors in light of the facts of the case is to
be afforded considerable deference by an appellate court. The Crown’s arguments
are an attack on the judge’s assessment of the facts and do not point to an
error of law. In addition, while the trial judge found that the impact on Mr.
Mian’s rights with respect to the failure to advise him of the reason for his
detention or of his right to counsel would have weighed in favour of excluding
any statements that the Crown may have tried to introduce, the Crown did not
seek to introduce such evidence. Moreover, with respect to non-bodily physical
evidence, the trial judge found that the s. 10  Charter  violations had
little impact on Mr. Mian’s privacy interest in the contents of his car, in
part because of the lack of causal connection between the breach and the
evidence. It was appropriate to consider the causal connection at this stage (Grant,
at para. 122). In this context, it is difficult to see how the trial judge
could be said to have overstated the impact of the breach on Mr. Mian’s Charter -protected
interests. I do not see any reason to disturb the trial judge’s findings with
respect to the second Grant factor.

(iii)       Society’s Interest in the Adjudication of the Case on Its Merits

[88]                         
The Crown argues that the trial judge erred by
concluding that the reliability and importance of the evidence were offset by
Detective Werth’s attempt to mislead the court. I agree that misleading police
testimony is properly considered under the first Grant factor. However,
the Grant test is a flexible and imprecise balancing exercise (see Grant,
at paras. 85-86). The question is whether the trial judge considered the proper
factors. In this case, the trial judge did exactly that. The trial judge held
that the lack of a causal connection between the breach and the evidence, the
minimal impact of the breach on Mr. Mian’s privacy rights, the reliability of
the evidence, and the seriousness of the offence favoured admission of the
evidence. He also held that the egregious and deliberate state conduct, the
lack of a valid reason for the Charter  breach, and the misleading state
conduct favoured exclusion of the evidence. On balance, the judge concluded
that society’s interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits was
outweighed by the wilful and flagrant state conduct and the attempts to mislead
the court. This conclusion was not unreasonable.

(b)        
Conclusion on the Admissibility of the Evidence

[89]                         
In view of the deferential standard of review on
appeal and because the Crown’s arguments with respect to the trial judge’s s.
24(2)  findings amount to an attack on the trial judge’s findings of fact, this
Court cannot interfere with the trial judge’s s. 24(2)  analysis. 

VI.       
Conclusion

[90]                         
The appeal is allowed and the trial judge’s
verdict acquitting Mr. Mian is restored.

on appeal from the court
of appeal for alberta

                    Criminal
Law — Evidence — Admissibility — Confessions — “Mr. Big” confessions — Charge
to jury — Accused confessing to murdering his roommate during Mr. Big operation
— Whether accused’s confessions should be excluded under s. 24(2) of Charter —
If not, whether trial judge’s jury charge adequate on evidentiary concerns of Mr.
Big confessions — Whether trial judge’s jury charge also adequate on reliability
of Crown witness’ testimony — Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, s. 24(2) .

                    After
a murder victim was reported missing, the police received information that his
roommate M had confessed to killing him and initiated an investigation. The
investigation had two components:  a Mr. Big operation and a wiretap
authorization to intercept M’s phone calls. During the Mr. Big operation, M
twice admitted to undercover police officers that he shot the victim and burned
his body. That information led police to conduct a search of a firepit where
they located fragments of bones and teeth later identified as belonging to the
victim, and shell casings later determined to have been fired from a gun seized
from M’s apartment. M was arrested and charged with first degree murder. At the
time of M’s arrest, the Mr. Big operation had been in progress for four months
and M had participated in 30 “scenarios” with undercover officers. He had been
paid approximately $5,000 for his work, plus expenses. At trial, the Crown
conceded that its wiretap authorization did not comply with the Criminal
Code  and therefore, violated s. 8  of the Charter . As a result of
this violation, the Crown did not adduce any of M’s calls, but did adduce his
two confessions to the undercover police officers during the Mr. Big operation.
However, M argued that the wiretap authorization was so intertwined with the Mr.
Big operation that the illegality of the authorization necessitated excluding
his confessions under s. 24(2)  of the Charter . The trial judge rejected
this argument and determined that s. 24(2)  was not engaged. The trial judge
provided instructions to the jury in relation to the evidence arising from the Mr.
Big operation. He also cautioned the jury about the testimony of the Crown’s
principal witness and provided a Vetrovec warning in relation to his
evidence. The jury found M guilty of first degree murder and his appeal from
conviction was dismissed by the Court of Appeal.

                    Held: 
The appeal should be dismissed.

                    Section
24(2)  of the Charter  was not engaged because M’s confessions to the
undercover officers were not obtained in a manner that infringed M’s rights.
Whether evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed an accused’s rights depends
on the nature of the connection between the infringement and the evidence
obtained. While a causal connection is not required, the nature and extent of the
connection remains an important factor for the trial judge’s consideration. In
this case, M confessed to the undercover officers while the illegal wiretap was
in place. Although the trial judge found a temporal connection between M’s confessions
and the wiretap, its significance was undermined by a tenuous causal connection.
That finding was open to the trial judge and there is no basis for interfering
with it.

                    Neither
the courts below nor the parties had the benefit of this Court’s decision in R.
v. Hart, 2014 SCC 52, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 544, under which framework a Mr. Big
confession will be excluded where its prejudicial effect outweighs its
probative value, or where it is the product of an abuse of process. This poses
no difficulty, however, as M’s confessions would clearly be admissible under
that framework. 

                    The
probative value of M’s confessions was high because there was an abundance of
evidence that was potentially confirmatory. First, M’s purported confessions to
his acquaintances A and L describe the same motive for killing the victim as
M’s confessions to the undercover officers. They also made reference to burning
the victim’s body. Second, immediately after confessing to one of the
undercover officers, M led him to the firepit in which the victim’s remains lay
undiscovered. And third, shell casings fired from a gun found in M’s apartment
were found in the same firepit. On the other hand, the confessions’ prejudicial
effect was limited. The operation did not reveal unsavoury facts about M’s
history, nor did M participate in any scenarios that involved violence. 

                    Nor
did the undercover officers engage in any improper conduct that could ground an
application for abuse of process. M was not presented with overwhelming
inducements. He had prospects for legitimate work that would have paid even
more than the undercover officers were offering. Nor did the officers threaten
M with violence if he would not confess. The most that can be said is that the
officers created an air of intimidation by referring to violent acts committed
by members of the organization. M, however, was not coerced into confessing.

                    While
the Hart framework was intended to respond to the evidentiary concerns
raised by Mr. Big confessions, it does not erase them. Rather, it falls to the
trial judge to adequately instruct the jury on how to approach these
confessions. The nature and extent of the instructions required will vary from
case to case. However, there is some guidance — short of a prescriptive formula
— that can be provided. The trial judge should tell the jury that the
reliability of the accused’s confession is a question for them. The trial judge
should then review with the jury the factors relevant to the confession and the
evidence surrounding it. For example, the trial judge should alert the jury to the
length of the operation, the number of interactions between the police and the
accused, the nature of the relationship between the undercover officers and the
accused, the nature and extent of the inducements offered, the presence of any
threats, the conduct of the interrogation itself, and the personality of the
accused. Moreover, the trial judge should discuss the fact that the confession
itself may contain markers of reliability (or unreliability). Jurors should be
told to consider the level of detail in the confession, whether it led to the
discovery of additional evidence, whether it identified any elements of the
crime that had not been made public, or whether it accurately described mundane
details of the crime the accused would not likely have known had he not
committed it. 

                    With
respect to the bad character evidence, the challenge is a more familiar one.
The trial judge must instruct the jury that this sort of evidence has been
admitted for the limited purpose of providing context for the confession. The
jury should be instructed that it cannot rely on that evidence in determining
whether the accused is guilty. Moreover, the trial judge should remind the jury
that the simulated criminal activity was fabricated and encouraged by agents of
the state.

                    In
this case, the trial judge instructed the jury adequately and no error has been
shown. The trial judge told the jury that it had to “carefully consider whether
the themes of violence and the level of inducements may reasonably have compromised
the reliability” of M’s confessions. He specifically instructed the jury that
it had to “assess the environment, the themes of easy money, violence, the
importance of honesty and integrity, any offers of exit points, and any threats
or intimidation”. Ultimately, the trial judge left the final assessment of the
reliability of M’s confessions to the jury. With respect to the bad character
evidence, although the trial judge did not address it specifically, he provided
the jury with a standard limiting instruction on the use that could be made of
any evidence that bore on M’s character. Undoubtedly, the trial judge could
have said more, but this does not mean his instructions were deficient.     

                    Finally,
the trial judge conveyed to the jury the reliability concerns with the evidence
of A, the Crown’s principal witness. He reminded the jury that the defence
position was that A was the killer. He told them that M’s knowledge of the
murder could have come from A. He brought up A’s apparent lie to the police and
cautioned the jury that it left open the question of whether they could rely on
anything he said. And he told the jury that it would be dangerous to accept A’s
evidence in the absence of confirmatory evidence. Nothing more was required.

I.             
Introduction

[1]                             
A jury convicted the appellant of the first
degree murder of his roommate, Robert Levoir.  His appeal from conviction was
dismissed by the Alberta Court of Appeal.  He now appeals to this Court, with
leave, seeking to have his conviction overturned and a new trial ordered.  This
appeal was heard in conjunction with R. v. Hart, 2014 SCC 52, [2014] 2
S.C.R. 544.

[2]                             
The appellant advances three grounds of appeal. 
First, he contends that the trial judge should have excluded the confessions he
made to undercover officers during a Mr. Big operation.  Second, if the
confessions were admissible, he argues that the trial judge did not adequately
instruct the jury on the dangers associated with them.  Third, he submits that
the trial judge failed to properly instruct the jury on the dangers associated
with the evidence of a central Crown witness, Michael Argueta.

[3]                             
For reasons that follow, I would not give effect
to any of these grounds and would dismiss the appeal. 

II.          
Background Facts

A.          
The Police Investigation into the Death of
Robert Levoir

[4]                             
Mr. Levoir went missing in November 2002.  At
the time of his disappearance, he was living with the appellant in Fort
McMurray, Alberta.  

[5]                             
About a month after Mr. Levoir’s disappearance,
the police received a call from Jay Love, a friend of the appellant. Mr. Love
told the police that the appellant had confessed to killing Mr. Levoir and
burning his body. Acting on Mr. Love’s tip, the police began investigating the
appellant to determine if he was responsible for Mr. Levoir’s disappearance. 
The investigation had two components: a Mr. Big operation, and a wiretap
authorization to intercept the appellant’s phone calls.

[6]                             
The Mr. Big operation commenced in January 2004,
approximately one year after the police received the call from Mr. Love. An
undercover officer, whom I will refer to as Ben,[1]
was introduced to the appellant at a nightclub in Fort McMurray.  The appellant
was working at the club as a D.J.  

[7]                             
A week after their introduction, Ben asked the
appellant to help him repossess a vehicle.  The appellant did so and was paid
$200.  During a conversation with Ben a few days later, the appellant mentioned
his missing roommate. He told Ben that Mr. Levoir was a “crack head” and a
“drug addict”, and accused him of stealing from his son’s piggy bank.  He added
that “[a]s far as he was concerned”, Mr. Levoir was “pushing up daisies”.  

[8]                             
Early on in the Mr. Big operation, the appellant
began to suspect that Ben was involved in criminal activity.  Ben told the
appellant that he worked for an organization headed up by a man named Liam who
“had his fingers into a lot of things”.  Throughout January and February 2004,
the appellant did several more “jobs” for the organization.  In early February,
for example, the appellant was asked to pick up a package from a bus depot in
Edmonton.  When he returned to his hotel room where Ben was waiting, Ben opened
the package and it contained $30,000 in cash.  

[9]                             
Later in February 2004, during a conversation
between the appellant and Ben, Ben mentioned that he had once been attacked by
two men while working for the organization.  Ben told the appellant that Liam
had “looked after [the] two guys” in what Ben called the “weekend of
reckoning”.  Ben then asked the appellant if he had ever “beat[en]” anyone. The
appellant replied that there were two occasions, once when he was in a fist
fight, and another time that he could not talk about.  Ben expressed his hope
that the appellant would one day tell him about his “secre[t]”.  

[10]                         
Ben brought up the appellant’s secret again in
early March.  He suggested that the person the appellant was talking about
“[wasn’t] walking anymore”.  The appellant nodded his head in agreement and
added that “every man has a breaking point”.  

[11]                         
In mid-March, the appellant drove to Vancouver
at Ben’s behest to have a meeting with Liam.  The appellant and Liam met at an
apartment in the city.  Liam brought up the appellant’s missing roommate and
attempted to question him about the disappearance.  The appellant asked Liam if
he could “decline” to speak about the matter.  Liam told the appellant that it
was his choice, but that refusing to speak meant he would remain on the
organization’s “third line”.  The only way to advance to the “first line” was
by talking about his roommate and revealing his secret.  The appellant again
refused, explaining that “loose lips sink ships”.  

[12]                         
After the appellant’s meeting with Liam, three
weeks went by before Ben and the appellant met again in person.  On April 9,
2004, Ben asked the appellant if he wanted to work.  The appellant said that he
did, and that he would “do what it took”.  Ben asked the appellant if he would
be willing to sit down with Liam to talk about how his roommate had been
killed. The appellant agreed to do so.  Ben then asked the appellant why he
killed Mr. Levoir, and the appellant responded that his former roommate had
been “a liar, a thief, and a piece of shit drug dealer”.  The appellant told
Ben that he shot Mr. Levoir five times — four times in the chest and once in
the back — with a .223 rifle.  The appellant also said that there was “nothing
left” of Mr. Levoir because he had burned his body.  

[13]                         
The appellant initially offered to show Ben
where Mr. Levoir’s body had been burned.  However, he quickly backtracked,
telling Ben that “everything” he had just said was “bullshit” and that he had
been “lying”.  Ben replied that he “really hope[d]” the appellant had been
telling the truth.  In response, the appellant changed his mind and took Ben
out to a firepit on his father’s property.  The appellant told Ben that he had
taken the ashes out of the firepit and that there was “nothing left” of Mr.
Levoir.  

[14]                         
A few days later, the appellant was flown to
Edmonton for a second meeting with Liam.  That meeting took place on April 15,
2004.  At the outset, the appellant described Mr. Levoir as a “crack head” and
accused him of stealing from his son’s piggy bank.  When Liam asked the
appellant how he had killed Mr. Levoir, the appellant replied that he shot him
five times with a .223 rifle — four times in the chest and once in the back. 
He added that there had been a “big fire” at his dad’s place, and that there
was “nothing left” of Mr. Levoir.  

[15]                         
The next week, on April 21, 2004, the appellant
was arrested and charged with first degree murder.  The police searched his
father’s property, and Mr. Levoir’s remains were found in the firepit that the
appellant had pointed out to Ben.  Shell casings fired by a rifle found in the
appellant’s apartment were also discovered in the firepit. 

[16]                         
At the time of his arrest, the Mr. Big operation
had been in progress for four months and the appellant had participated in 30
“scenarios” with undercover officers.  He had been paid approximately $5,000
for his work with the organization, plus expenses. 

B.           
The Evidence of Jay Love 

[17]                         
Jay Love, the man who initially brought the
appellant to the attention of the police, testified as a witness for the Crown
and recounted the appellant’s December 2002 confession.  Mr. Love testified
that he and the appellant went to a bar with another man named Michael Argueta
on December 21, 2002.  The appellant told Mr. Love that he was his best friend,
and he asked Mr. Love if he could trust him.  The appellant was intoxicated at
the time.  Mr. Love testified that the appellant was unhappy with Mr. Levoir
because the appellant thought Mr. Levoir had stolen from his son’s piggy bank,
that he was taking drugs in the house, and that he was using the appellant’s
phone without permission. 

[18]                         
The appellant then told Mr. Love that “Robbie”
was dead.  Mr. Love asked if the appellant had “outsource[d]” the killing, and
the appellant replied “no, I did it myself”.  The appellant also added that he
burned Mr. Levoir’s body.  

C.           
The Evidence of Michael Argueta

[19]                         
Michael Argueta was also called as a Crown
witness. Mr. Argueta was a friend of the appellant and he too testified that
the appellant had confessed to him about killing Mr. Levoir.  This confession
was said to have occurred at a bar in Edmonton, where the appellant told Mr.
Argueta that he had “gotten rid” of Mr. Levoir.

[20]                         
Mr. Argueta and the appellant did not talk again
until they were driving home to Fort McMurray the next day.  Mr. Argueta
testified that, during the drive, the appellant told him he shot Mr. Levoir. 
Mr. Argueta did not believe the appellant, and the appellant added that he
burned Mr. Levoir’s body on his father’s property.  Mr. Argueta also testified
that the appellant had been “[v]ery agitated” by Mr. Levoir because Mr. Levoir
owed the appellant money, had stolen from his son’s piggy bank, and had used
his phone without permission.  

[21]                         
Mr. Argueta’s credibility was a central issue at
trial.  Prior to testifying, he had been interviewed by the police a
number of times and he had never mentioned the appellant’s second confession
during the car ride home.  Indeed, in a statement given to
police under oath, Mr. Argueta expressly denied talking to the appellant about
Mr. Levoir’s disappearance during the drive home to Fort McMurray.   In his
testimony, Mr. Argueta admitted knowing that drug dealers from Vancouver had
put a “price on Robbie Levoir’s head” back in 2002, before he disappeared. 
Ultimately, the defence took the position that Mr. Argueta had killed Mr.
Levoir in order to collect on this bounty. 

D.          
The Appellant’s Evidence 

[22]                         
The appellant testified and denied killing Mr.
Levoir.  According to the appellant, he and Mr. Argueta had plans to go hunting
on November 6, 2002.    They invited Mr. Levoir to come along, and he did.  The
three men drove to the property owned by the appellant’s father, intending to
hunt on his land.

[23]                         
The appellant testified that after the group
arrived at his father’s property, Mr. Levoir and Mr. Argueta separated from
him.  Several minutes later, the appellant heard a series of gun shots.  He
returned to the road and encountered Mr. Argueta.  According to the appellant,
he asked “[w]here’s Robbie?”, and Mr. Argueta responded “[t]hat’s what you get
for the price on his head for pissing off the big boys”.  The appellant then
looked over and saw Mr. Levoir’s body lying in the grass.  Mr. Argueta then
told the appellant to “[j]ust shut up, and don’t worry about it”, stating that
he would “come back and look after it”.  The appellant also claimed that Mr.
Argueta told him, in a conversation at a bar approximately one month later,
that he had burned the body for two days in a firepit at the same property.

[24]                         
As for his purported confession to Jay Love, the
appellant claimed that Mr. Love had misheard him at the bar on December 21,
2002.  He said that what Mr. Love had heard as a confession was actually an
attempt on his part to tell Mr. Love that Mr. Argueta had killed the deceased. 
With respect to Mr. Argueta’s evidence, the appellant said it was untrue.  And
while he admitted to making admissions to the undercover officers, he explained
that he made those statements out of a desire for money, protection, a belief
that the confessions were necessary for self-preservation, and to “sound big
and tough and bad like them”.  

[25]                         
The appellant also called two other witnesses
who testified that, on separate occasions, Mr. Argueta made statements in which
he suggested he was involved in Mr. Levoir’s death.   

III.       
The Courts Below

A.          
Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta, 2007 ABQB
182, 458 A.R. 52

[26]                         
At the appellant’s trial, the Crown conceded
that the wiretap authorization it had obtained to intercept the appellant’s
phone calls did not comply with the requirements of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , and had therefore been obtained in violation of s. 8  of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .[2]  As a result of this
violation, the Crown did not adduce any of the conversations that had been
intercepted pursuant to the wiretap authorization.  Nonetheless, the appellant
moved to have all of the statements he made during the Mr. Big operation — none
of which were recorded on the wiretaps — excluded as well.  The appellant
argued that the illegal wiretap was being used to design the undercover
operation and that the operation would not have been conducted without it.  As
a result, the wiretap authorization was so intertwined with the Mr. Big
operation that the illegality of the authorization necessitated excluding his
statements to the undercover officers under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .  

[27]                         
The trial judge, Mr. Justice Hillier, rejected
this argument.  He concluded that s. 24(2)  of the Charter  was not
engaged because the appellant’s incriminating statements to undercover officers
had not been “obtained in a manner” that violated any of his rights under the Charter 
(para. 187).  Although the appellant made his incriminating statements to
the undercover officers while the illegal wiretap was in place, there was no
causal connection between the existence of the illegal wiretap and the
appellant’s confessions to the undercover officers (para. 184).  The most that
could be said was that the wiretaps were “helpful” to the undercover officers
during the Mr. Big operation, because they provided the officers with
assurances that their “cover” had not been “blown” (para. 175).  The trial
judge did not accept that the wiretaps were used to design and carry out the
Mr. Big operation.

B.           
Alberta Court of Appeal (Côté, McFadyen and
O’Brien JJ.A.), 2012 ABCA 42, 66 Alta. L.R. (5th) 377

[28]                         
On appeal, the appellant submitted that the
trial judge erred in concluding that s. 24(2)  of the Charter  was not
engaged, and that his instructions to the jury in relation to the evidence
arising from the Mr. Big operation and Mr. Argueta’s credibility were
deficient. 

[29]                         
The Court of Appeal rejected these arguments. 
It noted that a trial judge’s decision under s. 24(2)  of the Charter  is
entitled to deference, and it could see no basis for interfering with the trial
judge’s determination that the s. 8  violation and the accused’s statements to
the undercover officers were not sufficiently related to trigger s. 24(2) .  In
relation to the Mr. Big operation, the trial judge instructed the jury against
engaging in propensity reasoning and pointed out the reliability concerns
raised by the operation.  In the Court of Appeal’s view, nothing further was
required.  Similarly, regarding Mr. Argueta’s testimony, the Court of Appeal
observed that the trial judge had reminded the jury of the defence position
that Mr. Argueta was the killer, and he had warned them of the reliability
dangers associated with Mr. Argueta’s evidence.  Here, too, the Court of Appeal
could find no error. 

IV.       
Issues

[30]                         
The appellant raises three issues on appeal:

(a)         Did the trial judge err
in concluding that s. 24(2)  of the Charter  was not engaged?

(b)         Did the trial judge err
in his instructions to the jury on the Mr. Big confessions? 

(c)         Did the trial judge err
in his instructions to the jury relating to Mr. Argueta’s testimony? 

V.          
Analysis

A.          
Did the Trial Judge Err in Concluding That
Section 24(2) of the Charter  Was Not Engaged?

[31]                         
At the outset, it bears
mentioning that the appellant’s only challenge to the admissibility of the
confessions he made to undercover officers during the Mr. Big operation came
under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .  The appellant did not have the benefit
of this Court’s decision in Hart, in which a two-pronged framework for
assessing the admissibility of Mr. Big confessions was set out.  Under the Hart
framework, a Mr. Big confession will be excluded where its prejudicial
effect outweighs its probative value, or where it is the product of an abuse of
process.  In this context, the confession’s probative value is a function of
its reliability.  Its prejudicial effect stems from the harmful character
evidence that necessarily accompanies its admission (see Hart, at paras.
84-86).  

[32]                         
Neither the courts
below nor the parties before this Court have considered whether the appellant’s
confessions would be admissible under the two-pronged framework set out in Hart. 
In my view, however, this poses no difficulty as these confessions would clearly
be admissible under that framework.[3] 


[33]                         
To begin with, the
probative value of the appellant’s confessions is high.  The inducements
provided by the undercover officers were modest — the appellant was paid
approximately $5,000 over a four-month period, at a time when well-paying,
legitimate work was readily available to him.  He was not threatened by the
officers.  And he was told, in his first meeting with Liam, that he could
decline to say anything and remain on the organization’s “third line” — an option
he initially accepted.

[34]                         
Moreover, there was an
abundance of evidence that was potentially confirmatory.  First, the
appellant’s purported confessions to Mr. Argueta and Mr. Love described the
same motive for killing Mr. Levoir as his confessions to the undercover
officers.  They also made reference to burning Mr. Levoir’s body.  Second,
immediately after confessing to Ben, the appellant led him to the firepit in
which Mr. Levoir’s remains lay undiscovered.  And third, shell casings fired
from a gun found in the appellant’s apartment were found in the same firepit.  All of this made for a confession that was highly probative.

[35]                         
On the other hand,
while the confessions were accompanied by bad character evidence, the prejudice
was limited.  The appellant was not involved in any scenarios that involved
violence, nor did the operation reveal prejudicial facts about the appellant’s
past history.  The appellant’s involvement with the organization was primarily
limited to assisting with repossessing vehicles and delivering packages.  In my
view, any prejudicial effect arising from the Mr. Big confessions is easily
outweighed by their probative value.

[36]                         
Nor did the undercover
officers engage in any improper conduct which could ground an application for
abuse of process.  The appellant was not presented with overwhelming
inducements.  He had prospects for legitimate work that would have paid even
more than the undercover officers were offering.  Nor did the officers threaten
the appellant with violence if he would not confess.  The most that can be said
is that the officers created an air of intimidation by referring to violent
acts committed by members of the organization.  But the appellant was not
coerced into confessing.  This much is evidenced by the appellant’s initial
refusal to speak with Ben and Liam about Mr. Levoir’s disappearance.  Indeed,
the undercover officers explicitly made clear to the appellant that he did not
have to speak with them about Mr. Levoir, and that he could remain in his
current role within the organization.  None of the undercover officers’ conduct
approaches abuse.  

[37]                         
These comments aside, I
return to the appellant’s attack on the admissibility of his confessions under
s. 24(2)  of the Charter .  Under s. 24(2), evidence will be
excluded where: (1) the evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed or
denied any of the rights or freedoms guaranteed by the Charter ; and (2)
admitting the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute
(R. v. Wittwer, 2008 SCC 33, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 19).

[38]                         
Whether evidence was “obtained in a manner” that
infringed an accused’s rights under the Charter depends on the nature of
the connection between the Charter  violation and the evidence that was
ultimately obtained.  The courts have adopted a purposive approach to this
inquiry.  Establishing a strict causal relationship between the breach and the
subsequent discovery of evidence is unnecessary.  Evidence will be tainted if
the breach and the discovery of the impugned evidence are part of the same
transaction or course of conduct.  The required connection between the breach
and the subsequent statement may be temporal, contextual, causal, or a
combination of the three.  A “remote” or “tenuous” connection between the
breach and the impugned evidence will not suffice (Wittwer, at para.
21).

[39]                         
The strength of the connection between a piece
of evidence and a Charter  breach is a question of fact (see R. v.
Goldhart, [1996] 2 S.C.R 463, at para. 40).  A trial judge’s decision under
s. 24(2)  of the Charter  is entitled to considerable deference on
appeal.  Such a decision will only be interfered with where the trial judge has
failed to consider the proper factors or has made an unreasonable finding (R.
v. Côté, 2011 SCC 46, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 215, at para. 44, and R. v. Grant,
2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, at para. 86).  

[40]                         
The appellant submits that the trial judge erred
in concluding that the statements he made to undercover officers were not
“obtained in a manner” that violated his Charter  rights.  According to
the appellant, the trial judge applied too stringent a test in reaching this
conclusion.  In particular, the trial judge mistakenly believed that a causal
relationship between the breach and the acquisition of the evidence was
required in order to engage s. 24(2)  of the Charter . 

[41]                         
This ground of appeal is fact-driven and I would
not give effect to it.  Distilled to its essence, the appellant is effectively
inviting the Court to reweigh the factors the trial judge considered in
deciding that s. 24(2)  was not engaged.  The trial judge was aware that a
causal relationship between the Charter  breach and the acquisition of
the evidence was not required.  He noted that “the entire relationship” between
the breach and the impugned evidence had to be considered, and that causation
was not the “sole touchstone” of the analysis (para. 182).  The trial judge
acknowledged that there was a temporal relationship between the s. 8  breach and
the appellant’s statements to the undercover officers.  He went on to consider
the causal relationship between the wiretap authorization and the appellant’s
statements to undercover officers, and found that it was “so remote as to be
insignificant” (para. 185).  When he considered the temporal and causal
relationships together, he was of the view that the statements had not been
obtained in a manner that infringed the Charter .

[42]                         
While it is true that the lack of a causal
relationship played an important role in the trial judge’s analysis, this can
only carry the appellant’s argument so far.  A causal relationship is not
required to support a finding that evidence was obtained in a manner that
violated the Charter , but the nature and extent of the causal
relationship remains an important factor for the trial judge’s consideration. 
In the trial judge’s view, the tenuous causal connection between the breach and
the statements undermined the significance of the temporal relationship.  That
finding was open to him, and I see no basis for interfering with it.

B.           
Did the Trial Judge Err in his Instructions to
the Jury on the Mr. Big Confessions?

[43]                         
In Hart, this Court identified two
evidentiary concerns with confessions that are the product of a Mr. Big
operation.  The first is that the confessions may be unreliable.  Mr. Big
operations are intended to induce confessions, and the inducements offered to a
suspect may incentivize the suspect to falsely confess.  Second, Mr. Big
confessions are invariably accompanied by bad character evidence in which the
accused has shown a willingness to commit crimes to gain entry into a criminal
organization (see Hart, at paras. 68-77). 

[44]                         
The common law rule of evidence that was set out
in Hart was intended to respond to the evidentiary concerns raised by
Mr. Big operations.  However, while this rule responds to these two evidentiary
concerns, it does not erase them.  The focus of the rule is to determine
whether a Mr. Big confession should be admitted into evidence.  It does not
decide the ultimate question of whether the confession is reliable, nor does it
eliminate the prejudicial character evidence that accompanies its admission. 
Thus, even in cases where Mr. Big confessions are admitted into evidence,
concerns with their reliability and prejudice will persist.  It then falls to
the trial judge to adequately instruct the jury on how to approach these
confessions in light of these concerns.  

[45]                         
The appellant agrees that reliability and
prejudice are the two evidentiary concerns that must be addressed in a trial
judge’s charge to the jury.  With respect to reliability, the appellant submits
that a “very strict” caution must be given about “danger” presented by Mr. Big
confessions (A.F., at para. 95).  The appellant points to the jury charge
delivered in R. v. Bonisteel, 2008 BCCA 344, 259 B.C.A.C. 114, and
argues that a similar instruction should be given in “most, if not all” cases
involving Mr. Big confessions (A.F., at para. 96).  In Bonisteel, the
trial judge provided a strong caution regarding the reliability concerns raised
by Mr. Big confessions.  The jury was told that people sometimes “confess to
[crimes] they have not committed” (para. 66 (emphasis deleted)).  Moreover, the
jury was told that “confessions produced by an undercover operation such as
this are viewed as inherently unreliable” (ibid.).  Without independent
confirmation, the trial judge described the Mr. Big confessions as “highly
suspect” (ibid.). 

[46]                         
As for the bad character evidence that is
admitted, the appellant submits that trial judges must provide a “strong and
specific” limiting instruction that includes “specific directions” focused
on the “significant efforts [the] police employed to cause and encourage” the
accused’s participation in misconduct (A.F., at paras. 102-103 (emphasis in
original)).  

[47]                         
With those considerations in mind, the appellant
submits that the trial judge’s charge in this case — which addressed the
concerns with reliability and prejudice — was deficient because it did not go
far enough in warning the jury about the dangers inherent in this evidence and
the need to proceed with extreme caution in relying upon it to convict.

[48]                         
With respect, I disagree.  The instructions
given to the jury were, in my view, adequate in the circumstances.  In so
concluding, it bears repeating what this Court has said on numerous occasions:
an accused is entitled to a jury that is properly — not perfectly — instructed
(R. v. Jacquard, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at para. 2).  In reviewing the
trial judge’s charge, what counts is its substance, not its adherence to or
departure from prescriptive formulas (R. v. Luciano, 2011 ONCA
89, 273 O.A.C. 273, at para. 69).  The order of the charge and the words
chosen by the trial judge are within his or her discretion (R. v. Daley,
2007 SCC 53, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 523, at para. 30).

[49]                         
The functional approach to reviewing jury
charges that this Court has repeatedly endorsed cuts against the appellant’s
contention that trial judges must, in all Mr. Big cases, give the jury a Bonisteel
instruction.  Indeed, the British Columbia Court of Appeal has rejected
such an approach, preferring instead to subject these instructions to a
contextual, case-by-case review (see, e.g., R. v. Terrico, 2005
BCCA 361, 214 B.C.A.C. 135, at paras. 42-43, and R. v. Fry, 2011 BCCA
381, 311 B.C.A.C. 90, at paras. 82-83 and 87).  

[50]                         
I agree with the approach of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal.  In my view, there is no magical incantation that
must be read to juries by trial judges in all Mr. Big cases.  Instead, trial
judges are required to provide juries with the tools they need to address the
concerns about reliability and prejudice that arise from these confessions. 
The nature and extent of the instructions required will vary from case to
case.    

[51]                         
However, there is some guidance — short of a
prescriptive formula — that can be provided to trial judges who must instruct
juries in cases where a Mr. Big confession has been admitted into evidence.  

[52]                         
With respect to the reliability concerns raised
by a Mr. Big confession, the trial judge should tell the jury that the
reliability of the accused’s confession is a question for them. The trial judge
should then review with the jury the factors relevant to the confessions and
the evidence surrounding it.  As explained in Hart, the reliability of a
Mr. Big confession is affected by the circumstances in which the confession was
made and by the details contained in the confession itself.  Thus, the trial
judge should alert the jury to “the length of the operation, the number of
interactions between the police and the accused, the nature of the relationship
between the undercover officers and the accused, the nature and extent of the
inducements offered, the presence of any threats, the conduct of the
interrogation itself, and the personality of the accused” — all of which play a
role in assessing the confession’s reliability (see Hart, at para. 102).

[53]                         
Moreover, the trial judge should discuss the
fact that the confession itself may contain markers of reliability (or
unreliability).  Jurors should be told to consider the level of detail in the
confession, whether it led to the discovery of additional evidence, whether it
identified any elements of the crime that had not been made public, or whether
it accurately described mundane details of the crime the accused would not
likely have known had he not committed it (see Hart, at para.
105).  

[54]                         
This is not to suggest that trial judges are
required to provide a detailed catalogue of every piece of evidence that might
bear on the reliability of the confession.  The task is simply to alert the
jury to the concern about the reliability of the confession, and to highlight
the factors relevant to assessing it.

[55]                         
With respect to the bad character evidence that
accompanies a Mr. Big confession, the challenge is a more familiar one.  The
trial judge must instruct the jury that this sort of evidence has been admitted
for the limited purpose of providing context for the confession.  The jury
should be instructed that it cannot rely on that evidence in determining
whether the accused is guilty.  Moreover, the trial judge should remind the
jury that the simulated criminal activity — even that which the accused may
have eagerly participated in — was fabricated and encouraged by agents of the
state.

[56]                         
In this case, the trial judge addressed the
concerns about reliability and prejudice in his charge to the jury.  The trial
judge told the jury that it had to “carefully consider whether the themes of
violence and the level of inducement may reasonably have compromised the
reliability” of the appellant’s confessions.  He specifically instructed the jury
that it had to “assess the environment, the themes of easy money, violence, the
importance of honesty and integrity, any offers of exit points, and any threats
or intimidation”.  Ultimately, the trial judge left the final assessment of the
reliability of the appellant’s confessions to the jury:

Overall, it’s your
responsibility to decide whether the statements attributed to Mr. Mack are
reliable in whole or in part, bearing in mind Mr. Mack’s testimony that he was
given pep talks every day . . . that he felt indebted . . . and very insecure,
especially after he heard about the day of reckoning for the ice pick attack. 
Also that Mr. Mack felt out of his league, and whenever he started a story he
felt pushed in a direction that he had done it.

 

When a statement may have
arisen partly out of fear and partly from an inducement to easy money, it’s
important to assess carefully how reliable it is, if at all.  You need to
assess that against all of the evidence in order to decide not only what was
said, but whether what was said was truthful. 
[Emphasis added.]

[57]                         
With respect to the bad character evidence that
was admitted along with the Mr. Big confessions, although the trial judge did
not address it specifically, he provided the jury with a standard limiting instruction
on the use that could be made of any evidence that bore on the accused’s
character: 

You’ll recall in my opening
remarks I alerted you that we would likely hear evidence that does not reflect
Mr. Mack in a positive light, including views and conducts which are
unfavourable to him. You have now heard some evidence of that type, and I
remind you not to rely upon or use that evidence to conclude that Mr. Mack is
guilty or even that he is more likely to be guilty of the crime with which he
is charged based on that evidence.

 

In Canada people are not
prosecuted or judged as guilty because they have certain beliefs or values. Evidence
about things Mr. Mack may have said or acts he may have committed which you
find objectionable, it has been provided to you for the very limited purpose of
ensuring that you know the context for the other things that are said or done
that relate directly to the offence with which he is charged. Background
evidence, which we sometimes refer to as the narrative, is provided to you so
you understand more accurately the overall circumstances and can then better
assess what and whom to believe.

 

So I also repeat that you’re
not to decide this case based on your personal views of what you might consider
to be Mr. Mack’s value system or his opinions or even whether he might have
committed some other wrongful acts or offences. We are concerned with only
one charge: the murder of Robert Levoir.  [Emphasis added.]

[58]                         
When these instructions regarding reliability
and bad character evidence are viewed through a functional lens, I am satisfied
that they reveal no error.  The trial judge plainly addressed the two concerns
raised by the appellant’s confessions to undercover officers.  He directed the
jury to “assess carefully” how reliable the appellant’s confessions were, and
pointed specifically to the police deception, the level of inducements, the
“themes of easy money”, and the presence of any threats or intimidation. 
During the trial and in his final instructions, the trial judge directed the
jury to disregard the prejudicial character evidence that had been admitted in
reaching a verdict.

[59]                         
Undoubtedly, more could have been said by the
trial judge in his discussion of the reliability of the Mr. Big confession. 
The trial judge, for example, could have specifically reviewed the payments
received by the appellant during the operation, or the encouragements to
confess that were provided by Ben and Liam.  Equally, however, the trial judge
could have detailed the evidence that was capable of supporting the reliability
of the appellant’s confessions, including the fact that the appellant had
gainful employment available to him at the time the cash inducements were
offered to him, that he correctly pointed out the location of Mr. Levoir’s
remains during his confession to Ben, and that shell casings fired by a rifle
found in the appellant’s apartment were discovered in the firepit.  The trial
judge did not do so, but this does not mean his charge was deficient.  A
failure to say all that could have been said does not amount to a legal error:

. . . I cannot emphasize
enough that the right of an accused to a properly instructed jury does not
equate with the right to a perfectly instructed jury. An accused is entitled to
a jury that understands how the evidence relates to the legal issues. This
demands a functional approach to the instructions that were given, not an
idealized approach to those instructions that might have been given.

 

(Jacquard,
at para. 32, per Lamer C.J.)

[60]                         
It must also be mentioned that trial counsel was
provided a draft of the trial judge’s charge in advance of it being delivered
to the jury, and no objection was taken to the trial judge’s handling of the
Mr. Big confessions.  While it is the trial judge’s job to ensure that the jury
is properly instructed, trial counsel are expected to “assist the trial judge
and identify what in [his or her] opinion is problematic with the judge’s
instructions to the jury” (Daley, at para. 58).  A failure to object at
trial “may be indicative of the seriousness of the alleged violation” (ibid.). 
Here, although not determinative, trial counsel’s failure to object supports my
conclusion that the instructions on reliability and bad character evidence were
adequate in the circumstances.

[61]                         
In my view, the trial judge’s charge left the
jury equipped to deal with the concerns of reliability and prejudice that
emerged from the Mr. Big confessions.  No error has been shown.  Accordingly, I would reject this ground of appeal.

C.           
Did the Trial Judge Err in his Instructions to
the Jury Relating to Mr. Argueta’s Testimony?

[62]                         
In his charge, the trial judge instructed the
jury to consider Mr. Argueta’s evidence in light of the defence position that
it was Mr. Argueta who killed Mr. Levoir.  The trial judge referred to the possibility
that the appellant’s knowledge of the murder may have come from Mr. Argueta. 
In addition, he pointed out to the jury that even on Mr. Argueta’s own account,
he had lied to the police under oath when he told them that he and the
appellant had not discussed Mr. Levoir’s death on the drive back to Fort
McMurray from Edmonton.  The trial judge noted that Mr. Argueta had provided
“no explanation” for this lie and that he appeared “quite unapologetic” about
it.   He cautioned the jury that Mr. Argueta’s apparent lack of concern for the
seriousness of the oath “leaves open the question of whether you may rely on
anything he says”.

[63]                         
Because of these concerns, the trial judge
provided a Vetrovec[4]
warning in relation to Mr. Argueta’s evidence, instructing the jury that
it would be “dangerous” for them to accept his testimony in the absence of
other evidence that confirmed his account.  The trial judge provided two
examples of evidence that might be capable of supporting Mr. Argueta’s
evidence.  The first was Mr. Argueta’s testimony that the appellant was angry
with Mr. Levoir because he suspected Mr. Levoir had stolen from his son’s piggy
bank and had “run up telephone bills at [the appellant’s] place”.  The second
was that the appellant “separately testified to what he knew about the price on
[Mr.] Levoir’s head”, which was “similar to what Mr. Argueta said on that
matter, but was not attributed as having come to [the appellant] from Mr.
Argueta”.  

[64]                         
The appellant contends that these instructions
were deficient.  In particular, he submits that the trial judge’s instructions
on the importance of Mr. Argueta’s admitted lie to the police under oath was
confusing, because the appellant’s position at trial was that Mr. Argueta’s statement
to police was truthful and his testimony was a lie.  Moreover, the appellant
contends that the Vetrovec caution and the related instruction to seek
out confirmatory evidence before relying on Mr. Argueta’s evidence was
misplaced, because if Mr. Argueta provided information about the murder that
turned out to be true, this did not bolster the Crown’s theory that the
appellant was guilty of murder. Rather, it supported the defence position that
Mr. Argueta, and not the appellant, had killed Mr. Levoir.  

[65]                         
I would not give effect to the appellant’s
submissions.  In my view, the trial judge’s warning about Mr. Argueta’s
admitted lie to the police was not confusing.  The appellant’s submission to
the contrary flows from a technical reading of the instruction.  Read fairly
and in context, the impugned instruction conveyed to the jury that, even on Mr.
Argueta’s own account, he had lied under oath without explanation.  Thus, it
was questionable whether the jury could rely on anything he said.  When this
instruction is read in conjunction with the trial judge’s warning that it would
be dangerous to rely on Mr. Argueta’s evidence in the absence of confirmatory
evidence, it cannot be understood as having endorsed Mr. Argueta’s testimony
over the previous version of events he gave to the police.  The trial judge was
merely conveying to the jury that Mr. Argueta’s evidence was highly suspect and
that it would be dangerous to use it to convict in the absence of confirmatory
evidence.  Had he not given such an instruction, his failure to do so would most
assuredly have formed a ground of appeal.

[66]                         
Second, I cannot accept the contention that the
trial judge erred by instructing the jury to search for confirmatory evidence
before relying on Mr. Argueta’s testimony.  Admittedly, the trial judge
provided an example of evidence that was not capable of confirming Mr.
Argueta’s evidence.  The appellant did not separately testify that he knew
about the price on Mr. Levoir’s head, as stated by the trial judge in his
charge.  Rather, he testified that he heard about the price on Mr. Levoir’s
head from Mr. Argueta.  It is possible the trial judge simply misspoke, and
meant to refer to the fact that both Mr. Argueta and the appellant testified
that they knew the deceased was involved in the drug trade in British Columbia. 
No matter, the ultimate message left with the jury was clear, namely that it
would be dangerous to rely on Mr. Argueta’s evidence without confirmation. 
Importantly, the jury was told that it was for them to decide whether there was
any evidence capable of confirming his testimony.  The jury would clearly have
understood that in order to acquit the appellant, it did not have to believe
that Mr. Argueta was the killer; rather, it had to be satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that the appellant was the killer and that if they had a
reasonable doubt, they must acquit.

[67]                         
Putting aside the appellant’s specific qualms,
this ground of appeal can also be resolved with the help of common sense.  The
problems with Mr. Argueta’s evidence were clear and obvious.  The defence
position was that Mr. Argueta was the killer and that he was lying in order to
frame the appellant.  There was evidence he had a motive to kill Mr. Levoir. 
And even taking his testimony at its highest, Mr. Argueta had committed
perjury.

[68]                         
At the end of the day, these were the problems
the trial judge had to convey to the jury in his charge.  In my view, that is
exactly what he did.  He reminded the jury that the defence position was that
Mr. Argueta was the killer.  He told them that the appellant’s knowledge of the
murder could have come from Mr. Argueta.  He brought up Mr. Argueta’s apparent
lie to the police, and cautioned the jury that his lack of concern for the oath
left open the question of whether they could rely on anything he said.  And he told
the jury that it would be dangerous to accept Mr. Argueta’s evidence in the
absence of confirmatory evidence.  Nothing more was required.  Trial counsel
was apparently of the same view.  He made no objection to the trial judge’s
instructions regarding Mr. Argueta’s testimony.  In my view, given that Mr. Argueta was, apart from the
appellant, the most critical witness from the perspective of the defence, trial
counsel’s failure to object to the charge reinforces my conclusion that the
trial judge adequately addressed the concerns raised by Mr. Argueta’s
testimony.

[1]   The officer’s name is protected by a publication ban, and he is
referred to as “Undercover Officer #2” in the record. 





[2]   Specifically, the Crown conceded that “investigative necessity”
could not be established.  A Part VI authorization is only available where
“other investigative procedures have been tried and have failed, other
investigative procedures are unlikely to succeed or the urgency of the matter
is such that it would be impractical to carry out the investigation of the
offence using only other investigative procedures” (s. 186(1)(b)).  In
the Crown’s view, this requirement could not be met in the face of an ongoing
Mr. Big operation.





[3]   The appellant has had ample time since the release of this
Court’s decision in Hart to have the appeal reopened, with a view to
contesting the admissibility of his confessions under the Hart framework.
 He has made no attempt to do so.

                    C was charged with sexual assault.  When he
appeared in court, he was in a psychotic state and was declared unfit to stand
trial.  Crown counsel recommended a treatment order.  The Crown stated that a
bed would be available in a facility at one hospital six days after the
hearing.  The hearing judge issued a “forthwith” treatment order, specifying C
be treated at a second hospital or its “designate” (preferably the facility at
the first hospital).  Court services delivered C to the first hospital and left
him in a hallway.  The hospitals appealed this decision.  The Court of Appeal
held that the hearing judge erred by acting on the basis that the consent
requirement of the Criminal Code  provision relating to treatment had
been satisfied.  The Court of Appeal also determined that the applicable
provisions of the Criminal Code  (ss. 672.58  and 672.62(1) (a))
engage the rights to liberty and security of the person guaranteed under s. 7 
of the Charter , but do not violate the principles of fundamental
justice. 

                    Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.

                    Per LeBel, Abella, Rothstein, Cromwell and Gascon JJ.: Consent is
required for the disposition order in its entirety, not simply to the treatment
aspect of it.  A court may not make a disposition order directing that
treatment begin immediately if the hospital or treating physician does not
consent to that disposition unless the situation is a rare
case in which a delay in treatment would breach the accused’s rights under the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and an order for immediate treatment is an
appropriate and just remedy for that breach.

                    The
hospital or person in charge of treatment must consent to all the terms of a
disposition ordering treatment and, if there is no consent, the order cannot be
made.  The starting point is the text of the provisions in their grammatical
and ordinary sense according to the modern principle of statutory
interpretation.  The Criminal Code  provides that no court shall make a “disposition”
under s. 672.58  without the consent of the hospital or person in charge of
treatment.  “Disposition” is a technical term, used throughout Part XX.1.  While
a disposition ordering treatment may be referred to as a “treatment order” in
colloquial language, there is no such thing provided for in the Criminal
Code .  It is clear that a “disposition” under s. 672.58  necessarily
has a temporal aspect both as to its beginning and its ending and may include
other conditions that the court considers it appropriate to impose.  Thus
consent is required to the disposition which the court makes under s. 672.58 ,
not simply to certain aspects of it.  This is supported by the meaning of the
word “consent” and the context in which it is used in these provisions. Where
the Criminal Code  intends to differentiate between consent to treatment
and consent to a disposition order, it does so expressly.

                    An
order under s. 672.58  is extraordinary in that it directs that treatment
of an accused be carried out without the accused’s consent and by necessary
implication, it authorizes medical personnel to carry out that treatment
against the accused’s wishes.  The provisions recognize the importance of the
treatment provider’s clinical judgment, not only as to the particular treatment
but as to the location at which it is to be carried out.  This broad
understanding of the scope of the required consent is reinforced by the practical
realities of providing involuntary treatment to potentially dangerous
individuals.  The timing of a treatment order for an accused who has been found
unfit to stand trial must be an element of the hospital’s consent because, from
the hospital’s perspective, the time at which treatment is to be provided is
inextricably linked to the hospital’s ability to provide treatment safely and
effectively.  The ability of the hospital to administer the suitable treatment
is inextricably linked to whether it has the facilities and personnel available
to do so.  Timing is therefore an essential element of suitability and not
distinct from it.  Consent under s. 672.62(1) of the Code must
therefore include timing. 

                    The
consent requirement does not deprive the accused of procedural fairness and is
not unconstitutionally vague or arbitrary.  Any potential violation of s. 7 
rights would result from the exercise of the hospital’s discretion to withhold
consent in a particular case, and is not inherent in the section itself.  No
such breach was established in this case.  That said, a judge proposing to make
a disposition is entitled to consider, in an appropriate case, whether a
refusal of consent will have the effect of unconstitutionally limiting the
accused’s rights to life, liberty or security of the person in a fashion that
does not accord with the principles of fundamental justice.  If so persuaded,
the judge would be entitled to consider whether ordering an immediate admission
would constitute an appropriate and just remedy for that breach.

                    Per McLachlin C.J. and Moldaver, Karakatsanis and Wagner JJ.:  The
treatment order regime in Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code  is intended to
bring mentally ill accused persons to the cognitive threshold required to
proceed to trial.  A court’s discretion under s. 672.58  to order treatment
to render an individual fit for trial is subject to stringent safeguards and
timelines.  Given the potential for involuntary medical treatment, one such
safeguard is the requirement for hospital consent set out in s. 672.62(1) (a). 
However, when the consent requirement is read in its proper statutory context,
it is clear that hospital consent is not required to all the terms and
conditions of the treatment order.  The hospital’s consent is required only to
the treatment itself.  Bed shortages and patient wait lists do not permit a
hospital to refuse, or defer, consent.  Consent may be withheld only for
medical reasons and cannot be withheld on the basis of efficient management of
hospital resources.  

                    Treatment
orders seek to render the accused fit to stand trial, in order to protect the
rights to a timely trial and procedural fairness, as well as to safeguard the
public interest in accused persons standing trial.  They also serve to ensure
that the accused’s liberty is minimally impaired.  While the medical and legal
interests of accused persons are both at stake, the ultimate purpose of
treatment orders is to protect the legal interests of the accused. 

                    Interpreting
the provisions in light of (1) the purposes of Part XX.1, the
treatment order regime and the consent requirement, (2) the scheme of
strict judicial control and oversight with strict timelines, and (3) the
appeal and automatic stay provisions, the requirement for hospital consent
relates only to a hospital’s willingness to deliver a particular treatment.  Requiring
hospital consent to all terms of a treatment “disposition” would effectively
give them a broad veto over whether a treatment order could be issued, without
regard to the accused’s legal interests.  If hospitals may refuse consent, or
dictate the timing of a treatment order, for any reason, including its internal
operations and wait lists, it would be a significant derogation from Part XX.1’s
comprehensive scheme of judicial controls and tight timelines.  Only judges
will be able to assess the risks that would flow from failing to immediately
treat an unfit accused because many of the greatest dangers will result not
from the “medical urgency” of this treatment as seen by hospitals, but rather
from the risks that such an accused would face in jail.  Furthermore, the
automatic stay of a treatment order upon appeal by the institution would be
meaningless if the treatment order could not be issued absent hospital consent
to all its terms and conditions.  Rather, the scheme provides a stay and
contemplates a hospital appeal precisely because certain “conditions” of the
treatment order ― including the timing ― are decided by the court. 


                    Thus
while bed shortages are not a basis for the hospital to refuse consent, they
are part of the circumstances in which the judge exercises her discretion in
deciding the start date of a treatment order.  If the hospital is concerned
about bed unavailability, or its ability to safely carry out the treatment
immediately, the discussion about triage can take place before the judge. In
setting the start date for treatment, the judge will consider bed shortages,
but she does so along with the liberty, security and procedural fairness
interests of the accused, as well as assessing the impact on the accused of
waiting in jail and the delays to the trial.  If the court attaches what the
hospital considers to be unreasonable conditions to a treatment order, the
hospital may exercise its statutory right of appeal, and benefit from the
automatic stay.

                    The
Court of Appeal was correct in deciding that the “forthwith” order in this case
should not have been issued; however, this is not because the trial judge
lacked jurisdiction to issue a treatment order.  Rather, the hearing judge’s
decision regarding the timing of the treatment order was not reasonable.

                     Rothstein and Cromwell
JJ. — 

I.         
Introduction

[1]                             
When an accused person has been found unfit to
stand trial and the other statutory requirements have been met, the court may
make a disposition order directing that treatment be carried out for a
specified period not exceeding 60 days and on such conditions as the judge
considers appropriate for the purpose of making the accused fit to stand trial.
The disposition order may not be made, however, without the consent of either
the person in charge of the hospital where the accused is to be treated or the
person to whom responsibility for the treatment of the accused has been
assigned. (For ease of reference, we will refer to this as the hospital’s
consent.)

[2]                             
The main issue on appeal is whether, as the
appellant contends, the court may make a disposition order directing that
treatment begin immediately even though the hospital or treating physician does
not consent to that disposition.  In our view, the answer to this question is
“no” in all but the rare case in which a delay in treatment would breach the
accused’s rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and
an order for immediate treatment is an appropriate and just remedy for that
breach. 

[3]                             
Thus, while we would dismiss the appeal, we
respectfully disagree with our colleague Karakatsanis J. that the hospital’s
consent relates only to the treatment ordered in the disposition and not to the
disposition order itself. As we see it, that reading of the relevant provisions
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , cannot be reconciled
with its unambiguous text. The Code specifically distinguishes between
consent to treatment and consent to the disposition and explicitly requires
that a disposition may not be made without the hospital’s consent. The hospital
consent is required for the disposition order in its entirety, not simply to
the treatment aspect of it. Read any other way, the appeal provisions relating
to dispositions are incoherent. Moreover, the interpretation that we favour is
consistent with the purpose of the scheme and the broader context in which it
exists.

[4]                             
The specific provisions of the Criminal Code 
dealing with UST accused that are relevant to this appeal are ss. 672.58  and
672.62 . As we shall see, these provisions make clear that while the court may
not make a disposition — which may include not only the treatment, but also the
period of treatment and other conditions which the court considers appropriate
— without the hospital’s consent, the accused’s consent is dispensed with in
relation only to the treatment to “be carried out pursuant to a
disposition”.

      672.58 [Treatment disposition] Where a verdict of unfit to stand
trial is rendered and the court has not made a disposition under section 672.54
in respect of an accused, the court may, on application by the prosecutor, by
order, direct that treatment of the accused be carried out for a specified
period not exceeding sixty days, subject to such conditions as the court
considers appropriate and, where the accused is not detained in custody,
direct that the accused submit to that treatment by the person or at the
hospital specified.

 

      672.62 (1) [Consent of hospital required for treatment] No court shall
make a disposition under section 672.58  without the consent of

 

(a)
the person in charge of the hospital where the accused is to be treated; or

 

(b)
the person to whom responsibility for the treatment of the accused is assigned
by the court.

 

      (2)
[Consent of accused not required for treatment] The court may direct that
treatment of an accused be carried out pursuant to a disposition made under
section 672.58  without the consent of the accused . . . .

Other relevant provisions
referred to in these reasons are set out in the Appendix. 

II.      
Facts, Proceedings and Issues

[5]                             
The appellant was charged with sexual assault. 
When he appeared in court, he was in a psychotic state and was declared unfit
to stand trial (“UST”).  Crown counsel recommended a treatment order.  When
asked about security concerns, a psychiatrist testified that treatment at Oak
Ridge, a facility at the Mental Health Centre Penetanguishene (“MHCP”), would
make more sense than the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (“CAMH”),
another hospital with which he had experience.  The Crown stated that a bed
would be available at Oak Ridge no later than the 19th of April which was six
days after the date of the hearing. The hearing judge, Hogan J., issued a
“forthwith” treatment order pursuant to s. 672.58  of the Criminal Code  directing
that the appellant shall be treated at “CAMH or designate (preferably Oakridge
[sic]”, he shall remain in custody at “CAMH or designate”, and he shall
“be taken directly from court to the designated hospital and from hospital
directly back to court” and not to “a jail or correctional facility under any
circumstances” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 2).

[6]                             
Reasons for judgment were not issued but during
the proceedings, the hearing judge said:

When I
made a determination that as of today this individual needs to have a treatment
order[,] I have based that on expert psychiatric opinion.  I would be negligent
and derelict in my duty and my responsibilities [i]f I were to say, well it is
okay, he has — you know he is the subject of a treatment order which I consider
to be an extreme measure . . . .

 

. .
.

 

      . . .
I make orders that people [are] against sometimes, not always, but essentially
against their will have drugs administered to them. That is extraordinarily
serious and we do that because we feel it is absolutely necessary and that
means now, not a week from now and I understand that, as I said, and I do not
do it lightly when I do things like this, but I understand it does create
disruption. But, you know, it would probably be better if he is in a bed in the
hall of a psychiatric hospital than if he is in the medical unit not getting
what I have been told is absolutely necessary treatment for, you know, a week. 

 

. . .

 

      . .
. if it is okay to have him wait a week then we should not be asking for
treatment orders today and I should not be making them; it is not okay.

 

. .
.

 

      . . .
if we are prepared to do something as serious as make treatment orders and then
say, but it is okay they can sit in a jail bed.  That is not appropriate.  We
have a mental health system here that is supposed to treat people and you know
ordering treatment orders is one of the most serious things we can do in terms
of the mental health system and yet we cannot seem to provide a bed for them to
get treated in and that is totally unacceptable.  And I understand the argument
but it is not an argument that carries any weight with
me . . . .

I am prepared to be flexible where he goes as long as it is a hospital.  I know
Oak Ridge is preferable but in these circumstances I can be flexible about
that. 

 

      . . . so if I say CAMH or
designate; I will ask that the order say preferably Oak Ridge, but I think
getting him to a hospital at least, initially, is probably the most important
thing . . . . [A.R., vol. I, at pp. 7-11]

[7]                             
Court services delivered the appellant to the
Mental Health Centre Penetanguishene and left him in a hallway.

[8]                             
The respondent hospitals appealed the timing
aspect of the disposition under s. 672.72(1) which provides for appeals
“against a disposition . . . by a court”.  (We note that if
the appellant is right that a “disposition” does not include timing, there
would be no right of appeal of the timing aspect of the disposition order under
this provision. No one has ever taken this position.) Notwithstanding that the
appellant thereafter was treated, eventually returned to court, and the charge was
stayed by the time the appeal began, the Court of Appeal proceeded to determine
that ss. 672.58  and 672.62(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  engage the
rights to liberty and security of the person guaranteed under s. 7  of the Charter ,
but do not violate principles of fundamental justice. 

[9]                             
The Court of Appeal held that Hogan J. erred by
acting on the basis that the consent requirement had been satisfied.  It held
that there was never any doubt that CAMH or its designate, MHCP, would admit
the appellant. It noted that a memorandum of understanding between CAMH and 102
Mental Health Court provided a form of general consent to the placement and
treatment of accused persons.  It held that this memorandum implicitly provided
that hospitals would have the necessary facilities, personnel, and resources
for effective and safe treatment.  It held that this implied that admission
would be withheld when a bed was not available for safety reasons. It held that
consent to treat a patient when a bed becomes available is not consent to
accept a patient forthwith.

[10]                         
The Court of Appeal accepted that a mentally
unfit accused person’s right to liberty and security of the person is engaged but that the consent requirement in s. 672.62(1) (a)
does not violate the principle of fundamental justice requiring procedural
fairness because the consent requirement responds to a general reluctance in
law to compel a medical practitioner or hospital authorities to administer
treatment; it responds to the common law’s unwillingness to compel someone to
submit involuntarily to medical treatment by assuring that “the treatment order
process is initiated and . . . likely to produce positive
results” (para. 52); it responds to the significant risks to patients and
to medical personnel, hospital staff and others when potentially violent
psychotic patients are detained in settings where proper facilities are not
available; and it permits Ontario’s forensic psychiatric facilities to
co-operate in triaging the needs of UST and NCR accused, matters not within the
knowledge of the courts. The Court of Appeal concluded that it is not unreasonable that
a UST accused may have to wait on some occasions for a short period of time
until a bed becomes available in a designated psychiatric facility and there
was no evidence that a six-day delay in starting treatment might impair the
likelihood of the appellant becoming fit to stand trial. 

[11]                         
The Court of Appeal also held that s. 672.62(1) (a)
is not void for vagueness or arbitrariness.

[12]                         
On the further appeal to this Court, the
appellant raises two main questions concerning the scope of the hospital’s
required consent:

1.           
Does the consent requirement relate to the
timing of carrying out the order or just to the treatment itself?

2.           
If the consent requirement relates to the timing
of carrying out the order, does the s. 672.58  order violate s. 7  of the Charter ?


III.    Analysis

A.       Does the Consent Requirement Relate to Timing?

(1)        
The Approach to Statutory Interpretation

[13]                         
In our view, the meaning of the relevant
provisions, supported by an understanding of their full context, leads to the
conclusion that the hospital or person in charge of treatment must consent to
all the terms of a disposition ordering treatment and, if there is no consent,
the order cannot be made. The terms of the order include when it is to be
carried out and therefore consent relates to timing.

[14]                         
This issue raises a question of statutory
interpretation which must be resolved according to the modern principle of
statutory interpretation: “the words of an Act are to be read in their entire
context, in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme
of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament” (R.
Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (5th ed. 2008), at p.
1, citing E. A. Driedger, The Construction of Statutes (1974), at
p. 67). We underline that the starting point is the text of the provisions
in their grammatical and ordinary sense. This is especially the case where, as
here, the key term “disposition” is expressly defined in the statute. In our
view, the appellant fails to do this.

(2)        
Statutory Context and Statutory Text

[15]                         
It is helpful to begin by putting the most
relevant provisions in their wider statutory context. The relevant provisions
are found within Part XX.1 of the Code which deals with mental disorder.
The twin purposes of this Part of the Code are protection of the public
and fair treatment, in the sense of procedural fairness, of the accused:  Winko
v. British Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric Institute), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 625,
at paras. 20, 21 and 44; see also Mazzei v. British Columbia (Director of
Adult Forensic Psychiatric Services), 2006 SCC 7, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 326, at
para. 27. 

[16]                         
The Code provides that no court shall
make a “disposition” under s. 672.58  without the consent of the hospital
or person in charge of treatment. The provisions respecting “dispositions” are
central to the legislative scheme set out in Part XX.1 of the Code. Several
provisions give both a court and a Review Board the authority to make various
dispositions in relation to persons falling within the ambit of Part XX.1. 
Under the scheme, courts reach a “verdict” (respecting fitness to stand trial
and criminal responsibility), both courts and Review Boards make a
“disposition” (in relation to persons found UST and not criminally responsible)
and Review Boards make a “placement decision” (with respect to a “dual status
offender”, that is, a person who is both serving a sentence of imprisonment and
is subject to a custodial disposition under Part XX.1). 

[17]                         
The key point is that “disposition” is a
technical term, used throughout Part XX.1. While a disposition ordering
treatment may be referred to as a “treatment order” in colloquial language,
there is no such thing provided for in the Code.  “Disposition” is a
defined term.  In the context of dispositions made by courts, a “disposition”
is defined by s. 672.1 as meaning “an order made by a court” under
s. 672.54  or s. 672.58 , the latter being the provision that concerns us
here.  

[18]                         
As s. 672.58 makes clear, a “disposition”
ordering treatment under that section necessarily includes aspects relating to
timing:  it must set out a “specified period not exceeding sixty days”
and it may be made “subject to such conditions as the court considers
appropriate”, including presumably conditions related to timing.  Moreover, a
disposition comes into force on the day on which it is made or on any later day
that the court specifies: s. 672.63.  

[19]                         
All of this makes it clear that a “disposition”
under s. 672.58 necessarily has a temporal aspect both as to its beginning and
its ending and may include other conditions that the court considers it
appropriate to impose. 

[20]                         
The Code provides that “[n]o court shall make a
disposition under section 672.58 without the consent of (a) the
person in charge of the hospital where the accused is to be treated; or (b)
the person to whom responsibility for the treatment of the accused is assigned
by the court”: s. 672.62. At paragraph 109, our colleague suggests that s.
672.62 provides for hospital consent with respect to only the “treatment”
aspect of the disposition, and not the “disposition” generally. With respect,
this is not how we read s. 672.62. If “[n]o court shall make a disposition
. . . without . . . consent”, then the consent relates to
the disposition. Further, as just discussed, a “disposition under section
672.58” necessarily has a temporal element. The hospital must consent to the
“disposition”; there is nothing in the text to suggest that this requirement
should be given anything other than its defined meaning in the Code.
Consent is required to a “disposition” and “disposition” is defined to mean “an
order made by a court under section 672.58”: s. 672.1. Thus the hospital’s
consent is required to the disposition which the court makes under s. 672.58,
not simply to certain aspects of it.

[21]                         
This conclusion is supported by the meaning of
the word “consent” and the context in which it is used in these provisions.

[22]                         
The ordinary meaning of the word “consent” in
the context of medical treatment is understood to be voluntary agreement to a
medical course of action made with an appreciation of all material information
and risks. The starting date of treatment is a material fact, going to the
availability of the necessary bed and staff ready to execute the treatment
order safely.

[23]                         
The context in which the word “consent” is used
in this scheme supports this broad understanding of the term.  Where the Code
intends to differentiate between consent to treatment and consent to a
disposition order, it does so expressly.  For example, in s. 672.62 , subsection
1  deals with the hospital’s consent to “a disposition” whereas subsection 2
deals with the accused’s consent to “treatment . . . pursuant to a
disposition”.  Had the intention been to simply require the hospital’s consent
to the proposed treatment, language similar to that used in subsection 2, which
links consent only to the treatment, could have made that intent clear. 
Instead, subsection 1 links the hospital’s consent to the “disposition” not
merely to the “treatment of an accused . . . carried out pursuant to
a disposition” as in subsection 2. This demonstrates that Parliament, which
took care to define the term “disposition”, used the term in its defined sense
— as it did in relation to hospital consent under s. 672.62(1)  — and used
different language to refer only to the treatment component of a disposition —
as it did in relation to the accused’s consent in s. 672.62(2). 

[24]                         
Given that “disposition” is a defined term
meaning the “order made by a court under section 672.58” and the Code
explicitly requires the hospital’s consent to a disposition under that section,
we see no possible ambiguity in the text of these provisions. Any possible
doubt is dispelled by the clear distinction in s. 672.62 between, on the one
hand, the hospital’s consent to the “disposition” which is required under s.
672.62(1)  and, on the other hand, the accused’s consent to “treatment
. . . carried out pursuant to a disposition” which is not required.
We do not see how Parliament could have more clearly expressed its intent that
the hospital’s consent in s. 672.62(1)  relates to all the provisions of the
disposition, including when treatment will begin as well as what is to be done.


[25]                         
Our colleague Karakatsanis J. reads the appeal
provisions in Part XX.1 as supporting the appellant’s view that consent to a
disposition order does not require consent to the timing aspects of the
disposition order. We respectfully disagree.  As we see it, the interpretation
that we propose is reinforced, not weakened, by the
appeal provisions in Part XX.1. Under s. 672.72(1), “[a]ny party may appeal
against a disposition made by a court . . . on any ground of appeal
that raises a question of law or fact alone or of mixed law and fact.”  This,
of course, is the provision that allowed the hospital in this case to appeal
the judge’s “forthwith” disposition order.  However, the appellant contends
that the “disposition” under s. 672.58 does not include the timing of the
treatment which is ordered. It follows that, on the appellant’s reading of the Code,
the term “disposition” means something different in ss. 672.58 and 672.62 than
it does in s. 672.72.  If, as the appellant contends, consent to a
“disposition” as required by s. 672.62 does not require consent as to timing of
treatment, it must follow that an appeal under s. 672.72 from a “disposition”
cannot relate to the timing of the treatment either. Respectfully, this simply
cannot be the case. “Disposition” is a defined term: it means an “order made by
a court under section 672.58”.  The term “disposition” must bear this meaning
everywhere it is used in Part XX.1 of the Code. The appellant offers no
explanation as to why the express definition of the term applies in the appeal
provisions but not in the treatment disposition provisions even though both the
consent requirement and the right of appeal relate to a disposition under s.
672.58. 

[26]                         
We also, respectfully, cannot agree that if the
hospital’s consent were required to the timing aspect of a disposition, there
would be no point in providing the hospital with a right of appeal as it could
simply refuse to consent. This case shows that this line of argument is
incorrect. The appeal process under Part XX.1 permitted
the judge’s forthwith order in this case to be appealed and her legal error in
making it to be corrected on appeal.   

[27]                         
The appellant argues that consent in relation to
a s. 672.58 disposition order must not include timing because the institutions
do not have any right to refuse to accept immediately patients on other
court-ordered placements as, for example, under s. 672.11 (psychiatric
assessments) and s. 672.54(c) and s. 672.46(2)  (transfers to a
psychiatric institution or to a hospital). In effect, the appellant urges us to
infer from the fact that hospital consent to timing is not required in these
situations that it similarly should not be required under s. 672.62. We cannot
agree.  

[28]                         
Section 672.58 is unique in that it requires an
accused to be subject to treatment and authorizes medical personnel to
administer it without the accused’s consent. The section is not concerned
simply with admission but with treatment upon admission. Thus, the provision
deals with distinct situations and this argues against drawing any inference
from distinct and different provisions about the meaning of this one. Moreover,
any potential inference that might otherwise be drawn from the absence of a
consent requirement in these other provisions is negated by the language in s.
672.62. It expressly makes the hospital’s consent relate to the disposition
order itself, not simply to the treatment to be carried out pursuant to it.

(3)        
The Broader Context

[29]                         
The interpretation that we arrive at looking at
the text of the provisions in their statutory context is reinforced by other,
broader contextual considerations. We will refer to the purpose of the scheme
and the artificiality of separating “treatment” from “timing” in this context.

[30]                         
We agree with the respondent Attorney General of
Ontario that the purposes of this scheme point to a broad understanding of the
requirement for hospital consent.

[31]                         
An order under s. 672.58 is extraordinary in at
least two respects. First, it directs that treatment of an accused be carried
out without the accused’s consent. The exceptional nature of this power was
noted by the then Justice Minister Kim Campbell when she introduced the
legislation in 1991:

At
present, there is no power to order a person detained pursuant to a
Lieutenant-Governor’s warrant to submit to treatment involuntarily.  Apart from
emergency, there is no power to treat an accused without obtaining consent. We
have concluded that the general rule preventing the involuntary treatment of
mentally disordered accused ought to be preserved.  However, subject to
stringent safeguards, the bill permits a court to order involuntary
treatment to make the accused fit to stand trial, thereby avoiding a
potentially lengthy period of detention. [Emphasis added.] 

 

(House
of Commons Debates, vol. 3, 3rd Sess., 34th Parl., October 4, 1991, at pp.
3297-98)

[32]                         
The Code establishes a number of special
protections that highlight the unusual nature of this power. As provided for in
s. 672.59, the order may only be made if the court is satisfied on the basis of
testimony from a medical practitioner that a specific treatment should be
administered for the purpose of making the accused fit to stand trial. That testimony
must fulfill the detailed criteria set out in s. 672.59(2), including that the
treatment is the least restrictive and least intrusive that could be specified
for the purpose and that the risk of harm to the accused is not
disproportionate to its anticipated benefit.  The accused has important
procedural rights including notice, and the right to challenge the application
and certain treatments including the performance of psychosurgery or
electro-convulsive therapy are not permitted: ss. 672.6 and 672.61.

[33]                         
Second, by necessary implication, it authorizes
medical personnel to carry out that treatment against the accused’s wishes.
This is a remarkable provision, given that informed consent of the patient is
generally the sine qua non of medical treatment. However, s. 672.62, by
requiring consent of the hospital or the person responsible for the accused’s
treatment, makes it clear that this provision does not oblige them to carry out
the court’s disposition order without their consent.  As the Court noted in Mazzei,
doing so “would constitute interference with the authority and responsibility
of hospital authorities to provide medical services to persons in their custody
according to their view of what is appropriate and effective”: para. 34
(emphasis in original).

[34]                         
That understanding serves the purpose of
safeguarding the accused; hospital consent is one of the “stringent safeguards”
referred to by Minister Campbell and is designed to ensure that the order can
be carried out safely, both with regard to the accused, other patients and
medical personnel. Parliament also intended to respect the important role of
the treatment provider and to acknowledge how intrusive these provisions are,
not only in relation to the accused but in relation to the institutions and personnel
who are called on to administer treatment against the patient’s will.  The
provisions recognize the importance of the treatment provider’s clinical
judgment, not only as to the particular treatment but as to the location, among
those designated by the Minister of Health, at which it is to be carried out.

[35]                         
This broad understanding of the scope of the
required consent is reinforced by the practical realities of providing
involuntary treatment to potentially dangerous individuals. The timing of a
treatment order for UST accused must be an element of the hospital’s consent
because, from the hospital’s perspective, the time at which treatment is to be
provided is inextricably linked to the hospital’s ability to provide treatment
safely and effectively. The context of the involuntary treatment of a UST
accused involves a number of safety considerations. Special precautions must be
made when treating these individuals in order to protect the accused, other
patients, staff and the public at large. These measures include all rooms being
designed for single occupancy only, double air locking doors, furniture
specially designed so it cannot be used as a weapon, specially trained staff,
perimeter security, sally ports and specialized automated locking doors. If these
facilities are not available at a given time, these safety concerns cannot be
adequately met and the treatment cannot be provided safely. 

[36]                         
The appellant would have us draw a line between
“suitability of treatment” — that is, whether a specific UST accused will
benefit from the type of treatment recommended to which the hospital must
consent — and “timing of treatment” as to which its consent is not required.
However, this is an artificial distinction in the real world of involuntary
hospital treatment. It ignores the fact that the ability of the hospital to
administer the suitable treatment is inextricably linked to whether it has the
facilities and personnel available to do so. A treatment is not suitable if it
cannot be administered. 

[37]                         
The artificiality of the distinction between
“suitability” and “timing” can be seen by looking at the difference between a
hospital that does not have the facilities at all and a hospital that does not
have the facilities available “forthwith”. Not all hospitals are equipped to
handle the most dangerous offenders; they simply do not have the appropriate
facilities. Surely, a hospital can refuse to consent to treat a very dangerous
offender if it does not have the appropriate facilities to handle him or her.
This would not be considered a question of timing. Similarly, a hospital can
acknowledge that a UST accused needs specific treatment, but recognize it does
not have the proper facilities to treat him or her immediately. In both these
cases, the hospital would be unable to provide safe treatment and therefore
would be entitled to withhold consent under s. 672.62(1)  because the hospital
is not suited to safely treat the UST accused at that time. Timing is therefore
an essential element of suitability and not distinct from it. Consent under s.
672.62(1) of the Code must therefore include timing.

[38]                         
Interpreting consent to exclude the element of
timing, as the appellant would have us do, leaves allocation of scarce medical
and hospital resources to those needing treatment squarely in the hands of the
courts. This undermines the ability of hospitals to make medical triage
decisions, which could not have been the intent of Parliament in enacting s.
672.62(1) of the Code. In making a “forthwith” treatment order, judges
are necessarily deciding who will not get treatment forthwith just as
they are deciding who will.  Judges would be deciding who should get medical
treatment first, but without any overall sense of the needs and priorities of
others who their “forthwith” orders are displacing. Judges would, in effect, be
making medical triage decisions but without the benefit of being informed about
the other patients awaiting attention. 

[39]                         
This scheme requires a co-operative and mutually
respectful approach if it is to function, and we encourage that approach.
However, our colleague’s suggestion at paras. 118 and 122 of her reasons that
judges should routinely inquire into matters of bed availability or the
hospital’s ability to safely carry out treatment immediately cannot have been
Parliament’s intent in enacting the hospital consent provision. It does not
strike us as likely that this scheme intended that the scarce resources of both
the courts and the health care system should be devoted to judges micromanaging
medical triage decisions and health care providers defending their triage
decisions in court. Moreover, a judge’s decision to overrule the hospital on
these matters may well affect the important rights and interests of other
people needing treatment.  Quite apart from the impracticality of seeing the
judge’s role in this way, it also undermines rather than furthers the broader
objectives of protecting the rights of the accused as well as those of others
needing treatment and the broader public. We do not think, with respect, that
these are matters that Parliament intended should routinely be decided by
judges making disposition orders under s. 672.58  of the Criminal Code .  

(4)        
Conclusion 

[40]                         
We conclude that the text, context and purpose
of the provisions show that the hospital’s consent is required in relation to
all the aspects of the disposition order made under s. 672.58  and, absent that
consent, the court may not make the order.  This conclusion is subject only to
what we will say in the next section of our reasons in relation to circumstances
in which a judge is convinced that the hospital’s refusal of consent breaches
the accused’s Charter  rights and that an order for immediate treatment
is an appropriate and just remedy for that breach.

B.       The Consent Requirement and Section 7  of the Charter 

[41]                         
We agree with the Court of Appeal that the
consent requirement does not deprive the accused of procedural fairness and
that it is not unconstitutionally vague or arbitrary. To the extent that it has
any potential to infringe the accused’s s. 7  rights, we agree with the
respondent CAMH that any potential violation of s. 7  rights results from the
exercise of the hospital’s discretion to withhold consent conferred in s.
672.62(1)  in a particular case, and is not inherent in the section itself.

[42]                         
No such breach was established. As the Court of
Appeal pointed out, there is no evidence that a six-day delay in starting
treatment might impair the likelihood of the appellant becoming fit to stand
trial within the 60-day statutory window provided in s. 672.59(2), and there is
no suggestion that the six-day delay in any other respect infringed the
appellant’s right to life, liberty or security of the person. There is,
accordingly, no basis on which to find that the hospital’s exercise of
discretion not to consent to immediate admission for treatment had any
unconstitutional effects on the appellant. 

[43]                         
That said, although we think it would be
exceedingly rare, we would not rule out this possibility in other cases. A
judge proposing to make a disposition is entitled to consider, in an
appropriate case, whether a refusal of consent will have the effect of
unconstitutionally limiting the accused’s rights to life, liberty or security
of the person in a fashion that does not accord with the principles of
fundamental justice. If so persuaded, the judge would also be entitled to
consider whether ordering an immediate admission would constitute an
appropriate and just remedy for that breach. While we think the circumstances
under which this inquiry is appropriate will be rare, the Charter 
assures that judges and not the person in charge of the hospital where the
accused is to be treated will have the last word in terms of the disposition
order where the accused’s Charter  rights would otherwise be
compromised.  That, however, is not this case.

IV.    Disposition

[44]                         
We would dismiss the appeal without costs. 

                    The
reasons of McLachlin C.J. and Moldaver, Karakatsanis and Wagner JJ. were
delivered by

                     Karakatsanis J.  — 

I.         
Overview 

[45]                         
When an accused person is found unfit to stand
trial under Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , the
court may order involuntary treatment to render that person fit for trial,
provided that the hospital administering the treatment consents.  Often, the
hospital withholds its consent until mental health beds become available. 
Consequently, treatment cannot always start immediately.

[46]                         
As a result, the unfit accused waits in line
― typically in jail ― for a bed to become free, and both treatment
and the trial are delayed.  Bed shortages in mental health hospitals thus
create an ongoing tension between medical resource constraints and the
accused’s medical, legal and liberty interests.

[47]                         
In this case, the accused was found unfit to
stand trial.  The hospital indicated that it would not have a bed available for
six days, but the hearing judge nonetheless issued a treatment order directing
that the accused be taken to hospital “forthwith”.  The hospital appealed, and
the Court of Appeal concluded that since the hospital had not consented to the
start date of the order, the judge did not have the jurisdiction to issue the
treatment order.  Further, the Court of Appeal found that the consent
provisions did not violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

[48]                         
The issue in this case is whether it is the
court or the hospital that has the final say about when treatment shall
commence when faced with bed shortages.  Can a valid treatment order issue,
absent hospital consent as to the timing of the order?  The answer depends on
the scope of hospital consent required before a treatment order can be made
under Part XX.1 of the Code.

[49]                         
The respondents, the Centre for Addiction and
Mental Health (CAMH), the Mental Health Centre Penetanguishene (MHCP), and the
Attorney General of Ontario, say that the hospital’s right to consent means
that it must agree to all the terms and conditions of the treatment order
before it can be issued.  When there are bed shortages, hospitals have
the right to determine when treatment will commence.  Orders for treatment to
start “forthwith” can result in overcrowding, compromising the safety of
patients and staff, and the priority of other patients.  Hospitals are in the
best position to triage patients, and they can withhold consent on that basis.

[50]                         
The appellant, Mr. Conception, says that the
judge must have the final say as to when treatment will commence.  The hospital
would only be able to assess the medical interests of the accused, in relation
to other (waiting) patients, whereas the judge is able to consider all the
interests at stake, including the alternative detention or release arrangements
for the accused.

[51]                         
For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the
hospital’s consent is not required to all the terms and conditions of the treatment
order.  When the consent requirement is read in its proper statutory context,
it is clear that hospital consent is required for the specified treatment.  The
hospital must be willing, on medical grounds, to administer the particular
treatment.

[52]                         
Bed shortages and patient wait lists ― the
need to manage general resource pressures ― do not permit a hospital to
refuse, or defer, consent.  It is the judge who will consider bed availability,
along with the accused’s liberty and security interests and the need for
procedural fairness, in determining the timing of the treatment order.  The
hospital can advise the judge of any concerns about its ability to safely carry
out the treatment on the date specified by the judge, even if it were to give
the accused priority.  Should the hospital consider the timing unreasonable, it
may appeal the judge’s decision and the treatment order will be automatically
stayed.

[53]                         
I agree with the Court of Appeal that the order
in this case should not have been issued.  However, while the Court of Appeal
reasoned that consent is an “umbrella” term, requiring agreement with all
aspects of the treatment order, including timing, I conclude that consent is
focussed only on the specified treatment.  Because of my conclusions on the meaning
of “consent”, I need not consider the parties’ arguments regarding the Charter .

II.          
History of the Proceedings

[54]                         
Mr. Conception was arrested on a charge of
sexual assault after grabbing the breast of a staff
member at the CAMH while receiving treatment there.  He appeared in court on
April 13, 2010, the day after his arrest, and Hogan J. found him unfit to stand
trial.  Following the testimony of the CAMH forensic psychiatrist and the
recommendation of Crown counsel, the judge decided to issue a treatment order.

[55]                         
Crown counsel raised the issues of bed
availability and safety.  The psychiatrist testified that treatment would be
more appropriate at MHCP because the accused’s charge related to a staff member
at CAMH.  Crown counsel then relayed the information, received from CAMH’s bed
coordinator, that a bed would be available at MHCP within six days.[1]

[56]                         
The judge asked why she should leave it to
hospital administrators to determine priority.  Crown counsel submitted that
the result of ordering that the accused receive a bed today would be to
displace someone else on the waiting list.  Not persuaded, the judge noted:

. . . I make
orders that people against . . . their will have drugs administered to them. 
That is extraordinarily serious and we do that because we feel it is absolutely
necessary and that means now, not a week from now and I understand that, as I
said, and I do not do it lightly when I do things like this, but I understand
it does create disruption.  But, you know, it would probably be better if he is
in a bed in the hall of a psychiatric hospital than if he is in the medical
unit [of a jail] not getting what I have been told is absolutely necessary
treatment for, you know, a week.  [A.R., vol. I, at pp. 8-9]

[57]                         
The judge issued a treatment order which directed
that Mr. Conception “be taken directly from court to the designated hospital
and from hospital directly back to court.  Accused is not to be taken to a jail
or correctional facility under any circumstances.”[2]  Court Services
personnel delivered the appellant to MHCP and left him in a hallway.

[58]                         
The hospitals, CAMH and MHCP, appealed the
treatment order pursuant to s. 672.72 of the Code.  The order was
automatically stayed when the appeal was launched, pursuant to s. 672.75 of the
Code.  The appellant was eventually treated starting April 26, 2010, and
his charges were stayed in June 2011.[3] 
While the validity of the treatment order is now moot, all parties agreed that
the underlying issues require resolution.

[59]                         
In May 2012, the Ontario Court of Appeal allowed
the appeal and set aside the treatment order.[4] 
The court concluded that the judge did not have the jurisdiction to issue the
treatment order without the consent of the hospital and that the hospital had
the right to withhold consent to any term and condition including the
commencement of the treatment period.

III.       
The Statutory Regime

A.          
Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code 

[60]                         
Part XX.1 of the Code deals with persons
in the criminal justice system who are experiencing a mental health disorder. 
It authorizes courts to order assessments of accused persons who may be unfit
to stand trial, or not criminally responsible for an offence, and to make appropriate
dispositions in each case.  It gives courts or Review Boards oversight of
mentally ill accused who have been conditionally released or detained.

B.           
Unfit to Stand Trial Regime

[61]                         
The cognitive threshold for fitness to stand
trial is very low.  A person could be ill enough to require civil commitment,
but still be considered fit.[5] 
The treatment order regime in Part XX.1 is intended only to bring mentally ill
accused persons to the cognitive threshold required to proceed to trial.

[62]                         
The issue of fitness may arise at any stage of
the proceedings if the court has reasonable grounds to believe the accused is
unfit to stand trial.  The court may order an assessment (ss. 672.11 and
672.12) to determine whether the accused is unfit to stand trial; subject to
some exceptions, the assessment must be completed within five days (s.
672.14).  Subsequent to the assessment, the court may direct a trial of the
accused’s fitness (s. 672.23).

[63]                         
When an accused is found to be unfit to stand
trial, the court may make a treatment order under s. 672.58  to render the
accused fit for trial.

C.           
Treatment Order Regime

[64]                         
A court’s discretion under s. 672.58  to order
treatment to render an individual fit for trial is subject to stringent
safeguards and timelines.

[65]                         
Given the potential for involuntary medical
treatment, one such safeguard is the requirement for hospital consent set out
in s. 672.62(1) (a).  Relevant provisions are as follows:

672.58 [Treatment disposition] Where a
verdict of unfit to stand trial is rendered and the court has not made a
disposition under section 672.54 in respect of an accused, the court may, on
application by the prosecutor, by order, direct that treatment of the accused
be carried out for a specified period not exceeding sixty days, subject to such
conditions as the court considers appropriate and, where the accused is not
detained in custody, direct that the accused submit to that treatment by the
person or at the hospital specified.

 

. . .

 

672.62 (1) [Consent of hospital required
for treatment] No court shall make a disposition under section 672.58  without
the consent of

 

(a) the person in charge of the hospital where the accused is
to be treated; or

 

(b) the person to whom responsibility for the treatment of
the accused is assigned by the court.

 

(2) [Consent of accused not required for treatment] The court may
direct that treatment of an accused be carried out pursuant to a disposition
made under section 672.58  without the consent of the accused or a person who,
according to the laws of the province where the disposition is made, is
authorized to consent for the accused.

 

672.63 [Effective date of disposition] A
disposition shall come into force on the day on which it is made or on any
later day that the court or Review Board specifies in it, and shall remain in
force until the Review Board holds a hearing to review the disposition and
makes another disposition.

[66]                         
Pursuant to s. 672.1, both the person in charge of
the affected hospital and the accused are “party” to s. 672.58  treatment orders,
and may therefore appeal against a treatment order to the Court of Appeal (ss.
672.1 and 672.72).  Filing of such an appeal automatically suspends the
application of the order pending the determination of the appeal (s. 672.75).

IV.       
The Broader Factual Context

A.          
The 102 Court-CAMH System

[67]                         
The 102 Court is a specialized Mental Health
Court in Toronto.  It applies the provisions of Part XX.1 of the Criminal
Code  to mentally disordered accused persons.

[68]                         
Most unfit accused suffer from a psychotic
illness.  The treatment required to make an individual fit to stand trial is
generally antipsychotic medications provided in a safe context.[6]

[69]                         
Toronto’s CAMH works cooperatively with 102
Court to admit and treat accused persons subject to treatment orders.  A
psychiatrist from CAMH attends 102 Court five afternoons per week to conduct
on-site assessments of mentally ill accused persons’ fitness to stand trial.  A
provincial forensic bed registry tracks the availability of beds and is
available to Crown counsel and the hospitals.  CAMH’s Court Liaison is usually
present in 102 Court to assist with locating bed placements and predicting wait
times,[7]
and has the delegated authority to give the hospital’s consent to the treatment
order, typically by stating the estimated day that the hospital will be able to
admit the person.[8]

[70]                         
Concerned about mentally ill accused waiting in
jail until a treatment bed became available, some 102 Court judges began
issuing “forthwith” orders, ordering that the accused be sent to hospital
immediately without a stop-over in jail.[9]

[71]                         
Despite substantial increases in the number of
forensic beds and reductions in wait times, bed shortages mean that the
hospitals are not always able to accommodate the needs of the criminal justice
system on the timelines expected by the courts.

B.           
Current Consent Protocols

[72]                         
CAMH’s Statement of Principles and Practices for
Admission Prioritization was introduced in October 2010, several months after
Mr. Conception’s treatment order was issued.[10]  It applies to all
admissions and is a response to the constraints of waitlists and frequent
over-capacity of inpatient units.

[73]                         
The first Principle is “[n]o one waits who
cannot”.[11] 
This is explained: “If the accused is acutely mentally unwell and requires
immediate hospitalisation, or if the accused is subject to Court orders or
Dispositions of the [Ontario Review Board] which do not permit other placements,
admission is arranged expeditiously” (emphasis added).[12]  Under Principle 2,
“less seriously unwell persons” are generally admitted according to the date of
the order or request, “while allowing flexibility for clinical need”.[13]

[74]                         
With respect to Principle 4, the Statement
says:  “It will be presumed by the court that [the hospitals] will consent to
treat (s.672.62) all accused who have been found ‘unfit to stand trial’” where
the criteria specified in the Code (under s. 672.59) are met.  Dr.
Simpson, the Person in Charge of CAMH, testified that this presumption of
consent is qualified, subject to bed availability.[14]

[75]                         
However, Dr. Simpson also emphasized that
“clinical emergency trumps all other things”[15]
and “[n]o one waits who cannot”.[16] 
If there is no bed available for a clinical emergency, CAMH may use one of its
seclusion rooms, provided doing so does not endanger other patients.[17]

C.           
Consequences of Delay:  Waiting in Jail

[76]                         
In the 102 Court-CAMH system, where a forensic
bed is unavailable or is being held for another patient, unfit accused persons
awaiting treatment are usually remanded to wait in jail.[18]

[77]                         
Mentally disordered patients do not typically
fare well as inmates.  They are frequently victims of intimidation and violence
and are more likely than the general prison population to attempt suicide,
self-harm, or self-destructive behaviour.  An experienced correctional officer
testified in this case that the mental health care needs of mentally ill
accused persons in provincial jail are frequently neglected due to lack of
special units and trained personnel.[19] 
Fewer than one-third of Ontario provincial jails have special units for inmates
with mental illness or developmental disability.[20]  Where there is no
special unit, or where the unit is full, mentally ill accused persons are
typically held in segregation cells.[21]

V.          
Analysis

A.          
Overview

[78]                         
No court shall make a treatment order without
the consent of the treating hospital: s. 672.62(1) .  The dispute in this case
centers on the scope of that consent requirement.  In particular, which aspects
of a treatment order require hospital consent?  Can a valid treatment order be
issued absent hospital agreement to the specified start date?

[79]                         
The respondent hospitals, as well as the
Attorneys General, say that the hospital’s consent is required for all aspects
of the treatment order.  For the order to be valid, the hospital must agree not
only to perform the treatment, but also to the timing and any other conditions
of the “disposition”.  A treatment order cannot issue without the hospital’s
agreement to all aspects of the order.

[80]                         
The appellant says that the hospital’s consent
need only extend to its willingness to administer the specified treatment.  The
hospital cannot use the consent requirement to control the timing or other
conditions of treatment, particularly based on bed shortages and waiting lists.

[81]                         
In my view, the hospital’s consent is required
only to the treatment itself, and cannot be withheld on the basis of efficient
management of hospital resources.  The hospital consent requirement must be
read in the context of Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code .  A contextual
reading makes clear that the consent provisions do not permit the hospitals to
make decisions about the timing of the treatment (and by extension, the timing
of the trial and the interim detention conditions of the accused) based on the
medical priority of an accused against other patients on the waiting list for a
bed.  In setting the start date for treatment, the judge will consider bed
shortages, but she does so along with the liberty, security and procedural
fairness interests of the accused, as well as assessing the impact of waiting
in jail and the delays to the trial.

[82]                         
Before a judge can make a treatment order, the
consent provision under s. 672.62(1)  requires that a hospital indicate it
is willing to administer the treatment.  The hospital may only refuse consent
if it objects to the specified treatment on medical grounds.  In exceptional
circumstances, the lack of a bed, or other alternative, may mean that the
hospital is not able to safely carry out the treatment ― even if the
hospital gives the accused priority for the date chosen by the judge.  In such
cases, if the hospital believes that the judge has acted unreasonably in
setting the date, it can appeal and the decision can be reviewed.

[83]                         
I will first explain why, in my view, the scope
of the consent requirement is limited to the treatment itself, and consent is
not required to the associated timing and conditions.  I will then discuss how
bed shortages are relevant to the treatment order.  Finally, I will outline an
efficient process for dealing with concerns about the timing of the treatment
order.

B.           
The Scope of Consent

[84]                         
The respondents say that because s. 672.62(1) 
directs that “[n]o court shall make a disposition under section 672.58 
without the consent of (a) the person in charge of the hospital where
the accused is to be treated”, and because the “disposition” under s. 672.58 
permits an order directing that “treatment of the accused be carried out for a
specified period not exceeding sixty days, subject to such conditions as the
court considers appropriate”, hospital agreement to all aspects of the
treatment order is required.  The hospital must agree not only to perform the
treatment, but also to the timing, duration, and any other conditions of the
“disposition”.

[85]                         
The appellant says that the treatment order
provisions separate the medical appropriateness of the treatment from its
timing.  Consent is required only with respect to the treatment.  While s.
672.58 refers to the court making an order directing that “treatment . . . be
carried out for a specified period” (this is the “disposition”), s. 672.63
separately directs that “[a] disposition shall come into force on the day on
which it is made or on any later day that the court or Review Board specifies
in it”.  Thus, the disposition itself ― which requires hospital consent,
according to s. 672.62(1) (a) ― may be separate from the date that
it comes into force, or commences, which s. 672.63 authorizes the court to
specify.

[86]                         
There is no doubt that s. 672.62(1)  makes
hospital consent a prerequisite to any treatment disposition.  However, the
issue remains: to what does the consent relate?  Is consent required to all
terms and conditions of the “disposition”?  Or is consent merely required to the
specified treatment?

[87]                         
I do not find the respondents’ submissions on
the language of s. 672.62 determinative.  Section 672.62(1)  does not provide
that the consent is required for all aspects of the disposition; rather, it
says that the disposition under s. 672.58 cannot be made without the consent of
the hospital or person treating the accused.  Further, the judge may fix the
timing of the disposition pursuant to s. 672.63.  The disposition under s.
672.58 is an order directing the treatment of the accused for a specified
period (a maximum duration of 60 days), together with any conditions the judge
considers appropriate.  Obviously, if consent to the treatment is not provided,
there can be no disposition ordering such treatment.

[88]                         
In my view, the language of these provisions,
read in isolation, does not provide a clear answer to the scope of a hospital’s
discretion to withhold consent.  However, the modern rule of statutory
interpretation requires that “the words of an Act are to be read in their
entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with
the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament”:
E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87. 
Here, interpreting the provisions in light of (1) the purposes of Part XX.1,
the treatment order regime and the consent requirement, (2) the scheme of
strict judicial control and oversight with strict timelines, and (3) the appeal
and automatic stay provisions, leads to the conclusion that the requirement for
hospital consent relates only to a hospital’s willingness to deliver a
particular treatment.  It does not provide the hospital with a veto over the
terms and conditions of the treatment order, nor one that can be exercised for
any reason.

(1)     
Legislative Purpose

(a)      
Purpose of the Part XX.1 Regime; Protecting the
Interests at Stake

[89]                         
This Court identified the purposes of Part XX.1
in Mazzei v. British Columbia (Director of Adult Forensic Psychiatric
Services), 2006 SCC 7, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 326:

. . . the
new legislative scheme retains the former’s overall purpose and its emphasis on
the medical treatment of the NCR [not criminally responsible] accused as merely
an effect or an incident of Parliament’s primary objective of protecting the
public and managing an accused’s safety risk, pursuant to its criminal law
power.  The new element added in Part XX.1 is an assurance of procedural
fairness and dignity for the NCR accused, and a commitment to ensure that
the NCR accused’s liberty interests are to be infringed as minimally as
possible.  [Emphasis added; para. 27.]

[90]                         
Consideration of the significant Charter -protected
s. 7  liberty interests at stake in the regime is “built into the [Part XX.1]
statutory framework” at “every step of the process”:  Penetanguishene Mental
Health Centre v. Ontario (Attorney General), 2004 SCC 20, [2004] 1 S.C.R.
498, at para. 53.  See also Winko v. British Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric
Institute), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 625, at paras. 16 and 42.

[91]                         
When the Bill enacting Part XX.1 was under
discussion in the House of Commons, the Minister of Justice, Kim Campbell, in
describing the treatment order power, stated that “subject to stringent
safeguards, the bill permits a court to order involuntary treatment to
make the accused fit to stand trial, thereby avoiding a potentially lengthy
period of detention”.[22]

[92]                         
Treatment orders serve at least two purposes. 
First, they seek to render the accused fit to stand trial, in order to protect
the rights to a timely trial and procedural fairness, as well as to safeguard
the public interest in accused persons standing trial.  Second, they serve to
ensure that the accused’s liberty is minimally impaired.  While the medical and
legal interests of accused persons are both at stake, the ultimate purpose of treatment
orders is to protect the legal interests of the accused.

[93]                         
The timing of a treatment order directly impacts
the timing of the trial.  And since the alternative to a treatment order is
usually detention in a jail that is ill-equipped to accommodate the mental
health issues of unfit individuals, the timing of the order also affects the
interim detention conditions of the accused.  The timing therefore also affects
the dignity, security and liberty interests of the accused ― interests
that Part XX.1 seeks to protect.

[94]                         
The interpretation of the consent requirement
advanced by the respondents, which gives the hospital control over timing and
other conditions, is difficult to reconcile with the purposes of the regime. 
Requiring consent to all terms of a treatment “disposition” would effectively
give the hospitals a broad veto over whether a treatment order could be issued,
and control over the timing of the treatment, without regard to the
accused’s legal interests.

[95]                         
Nothing in the Code, or any other
legislation, requires hospitals to consider the detention conditions of unfit
accused that are not in their charge when making admission decisions, and they
are not in a position to properly do so.  Nor are designated hospitals under
any legal duty to provide procedural protections to the accused when
determining the timing of a treatment order.  The triage process conducted by
the hospital is only a determination of priority between the medical interests
of the accused and other patients ― it does not account for the liberty
or other legal and Charter  interests of the accused.

[96]                         
Therefore, it would not be consistent with the
purposes of Part XX.1 for hospitals to control the timing and conditions of a
treatment order.  Hospitals must continually manage for the most effective use
of their resources and patient intake protocols.  It is for a judge to weigh
the accused’s liberty, security and legal interests against the hospital’s
challenges in giving priority to the accused.  As I discuss later, the judge
will consider any bed shortages in setting the start date of any treatment. 
The purposes of Part XX.1 support a more limited scope for the consent
provision, focused on the hospital’s willingness to administer the specified
treatment.

(b)     
Purpose of the Consent Provision

[97]                         
Part XX.1 empowers judges to make various orders[23] requiring hospitals to
admit accused persons, without the hospital’s consent, even though they may
also cause administrative difficulties in immediately accommodating mentally
ill accused persons.  Thus, the scheme of the Code does not generally
require hospital consent simply because the treatment order makes demands on
hospital resources.

[98]                         
Consent is required only under the treatment
order regime.  This is no coincidence, given that the treatment order provision
is also the only provision in Part XX.1 that permits a court to order medical
treatment without the consent of the accused.

[99]                         
The reason hospital consent is required is to
protect the accused’s medical interests and to respect the hospital’s
professional right not to be forced to administer medical treatment.  It is one
of the “stringent safeguards” on court-ordered involuntary treatment of a
vulnerable accused.

[100]                     
Limiting the power to withhold consent to
concerns about the medical appropriateness of the treatment itself respects the
professional judgment of the hospital as to whether it should administer the
particular treatment.  It also acts as a safeguard to ensure that the medical
interests of the accused are not compromised by a treatment to which he does
not consent.  At the same time, it permits the judge to protect the legal
interests of the vulnerable accused when setting the timing of the order.  This
interpretation safeguards procedural protections, judicial supervision of the
detention, and the purposes of Part XX.1.

[101]                     
Thus, the consent requirement, examined
purposively in its legislative context, is limited to whether the hospital
would be willing to carry out the specified treatment.  It serves to ensure the
expert administration of medically appropriate treatment, rather than to
accommodate the hospital’s resource constraints.

(2)     
Scheme of the Treatment Order Regime

[102]                     
Through Part XX.1, Parliament sought to ensure
procedural fairness, and minimally infringe the liberty interests of the
accused, by setting detailed time limits and providing for judicial (or Review
Board) control and oversight of all aspects of the regime.

[103]                     
Pursuant to these controls, a treatment order
has maximum duration of 60 days (ss. 672.58 and 672.59); several pre-conditions
must be met before the order can be granted, based upon the evidence and
opinion of a medical practitioner who has assessed the accused (s. 672.59); the
accused has the right to challenge the application (s. 672.6); certain
treatments cannot be prescribed under the order (s. 672.61); consent to the
order is required from the treating hospital or doctor, but not from the
accused (s. 672.62); and the court can specify the effective date of the order
(s. 672.63).

[104]                     
If hospitals may refuse consent, or dictate the
timing of a treatment order, for any reason, including its internal operations
and wait lists, it would be a significant derogation from Part XX.1’s
comprehensive scheme of judicial controls and tight timelines.

(3)     
Appeal and Stay Provisions

[105]                     
A limited scope of the consent requirement also
gives effect to the appeal (s. 672.72) and the stay provisions (s. 672.75) in
the treatment order regime.  Section 672.75 provides for an automatic stay upon
appeal by any party.

[106]                     
The automatic stay of a treatment order upon
appeal by the institution would be meaningless if the treatment order could not
be issued absent hospital consent to all its terms and conditions.  If a
hospital could simply withhold consent when it objected to terms, there would
never be any need for it to appeal.  Rather, the scheme provides a stay and
contemplates a hospital appeal precisely because certain “conditions” of the
treatment order ― including the timing ― are decided by the court. 
An appellate court would be in a position to review the judge’s decision based
upon the information before the court.

[107]                     
Conversely, a delay caused by the hospital
withholding consent to a future date cannot easily be challenged.  Although an
accused can appeal against the treatment order under s. 672.72(1), this is an
onerous challenge for an unfit accused and the appeal is unlikely to be heard
before the commencement date of the order.  Moreover, because the order usually
issues when the treatment is involuntary, the accused is unlikely to seek its
earlier implementation.

[108]                     
In any event, the hospital’s decision would not
easily be susceptible to appellate review.  If consent can simply be withheld
by the hospital, there may well be little information before the court other
than a refusal to consent to an earlier date.

[109]                     
My colleagues contend that “[i]f . . . consent
to a ‘disposition’ as required by s. 672.62 does not require consent as to
timing of treatment, it must follow that an appeal under s. 672.72 from a
‘disposition’ cannot relate to the timing of the treatment either” (para. 25). 
To be clear, my conclusion is not that the timing of the treatment order is not
part of the disposition.  Rather, I conclude that the timing of the
order does not fall within the hospital consent requirement.  Nothing
prevents the hospital from appealing the disposition made by the judge ―
respecting its timing or any other aspect ― if it believes the judge’s
decision was unreasonable.

[110]                     
Thus, the appeal and stay provisions are
consistent with a more limited consent requirement under Part XX.1:  consent
relates only to the hospitals’ willingness to deliver the particular treatment.

C.           
The Role of Bed Shortages

[111]                     
The respondent hospitals argue that bed
shortages directly affect their ability to carry out treatment.  However,
designated hospitals under Part XX.1 take on a forensic role and are
presumptively equipped to treat unfit accused persons.

[112]                     
Usually, the management of bed shortages is more
closely tied to the efficient management of hospital resources.  The CAMH
Statement of Principles and Practices for Admission Prioritization suggests
that, barring medical emergency, priority is granted on a first come, first
served basis.  No doubt it is simpler to forecast bed availability in light of
the existing waiting list, subject only to medical emergencies.  But in the
context of Part XX.1, medical emergencies are not the only measure of urgency
or priority.

[113]                     
Even where an unfit accused’s treatment is not
“medically urgent” according to hospital criteria, denial of immediate
treatment may nevertheless put his physical safety and life in jeopardy for
reasons that are wholly unknown to the hospital and that are impossible for the
hospital to assess.  Only judges will be able to assess the risks that would
flow from failing to immediately treat an unfit accused because many of the
greatest dangers will result not from the “medical urgency” of this treatment
as seen by hospitals, but rather from the risks that such an accused would face
in jail.  Medical triage and hospital priority protocols do not account for the
legal interests of the unfit accused.

[114]                     
There may also be exceptional circumstances
where the lack of a bed means that the hospital cannot safely administer the
treatment, despite treating the accused as a priority.  Doctors should not be
ordered to provide treatment in circumstances that are unsafe to patients or
staff.

[115]                     
However, the record suggests such situations
will be rare.  Hospitals find the means to deal with medical emergencies, under
the principle that “[n]o one waits who cannot”.[24]  Dr. Simpson testified
that when the hospital deems it truly necessary, it finds room.[25]  When a judge makes a
treatment order, the hospital must take it to indicate that treatment is
necessary as of that date.

[116]                     
This may mean that the hospital will have to
move a less critical patient to a different ward, use emergency seclusion areas
or otherwise accommodate the accused, much as it would in order to accommodate
a medical emergency.  Under Part XX.1 of the Code, the designated
hospitals may have to accommodate the exigencies of the criminal justice
system.

[117]                     
Sometimes bed shortages will affect the ability
of a hospital to carry out treatment safely; but this is distinct from whether
the treatment is otherwise medically suitable.  These are important but
separable concepts.  Thus, while bed shortages are not a basis for the hospital
to refuse consent, they are part of the circumstances in which the judge
exercises her discretion in deciding the start date of a treatment order.

[118]                     
I would add this.  While the state must resource
its hospitals so as to accommodate a judge’s order under the Code, this
does not mean the courts can expect a perfect system, with treatment facilities
available immediately in all cases.  Nothing in the Code requires that
hospitals be resourced to ensure there is always an empty bed waiting.  If the
hospital is concerned about bed unavailability, or its ability to safely carry
out the treatment immediately, the discussion about triage can take place
before the judge.  The judge is in the best position to deal with the various
interests, in an informal and co-operative process.

D.          
The Treatment Order:  A Collaborative Process

[119]                     
Despite the tensions created by bed shortages,
the dedicated professionals who work daily in the mental health courts work
co-operatively in implementing Part XX.1.  In this case, for example, this
collaborative process resulted in numerous steps ― the assessment, the
fitness hearing, and the treatment order hearing ― being dealt with in a
single day, the day after Mr. Conception’s arrest.

[120]                     
Like all decisions of criminal court judges, the
decision to issue a treatment order must be reasonable, having regard to all
the circumstances.  The psychiatrist will have testified as to the need for
treatment.  The hospital, as a party to the proceedings, is entitled to
indicate its preferred timeline, to avoid disrupting other priority patients. 
The psychiatrist may give her opinion as to how the accused will fare in
prison, and whether his treatment prospects would be adversely affected by a
delay.

[121]                     
However, the timeline proposed by the hospital
may not meet the needs of the criminal justice system.  For example, the mental
(or physical) health of the accused may be jeopardized by waiting in jail
before being transferred to hospital; or the required detention in jail may be
disproportionate to the actual charges against the accused.  In such cases, the
court may make further inquiries of the hospital.  The hospital may provide
information about the current capacity and waiting list of the hospital and
whether, if measures were taken to admit the accused on an urgent basis, it
could safely provide treatment.

[122]                     
This enquiry is consistent with the judge’s role
under Part XX.1 and will not usually require a detailed examination of hospital
evidence, which would result in delays to treatment and trial.  An informal
exchange of information, as is current practice, should suffice.  This ensures
efficiency and is consistent with the direction under s. 672.5(2) of the Code,
which states that a hearing to make a disposition under Part XX.1 “may be
conducted in as informal a manner as is appropriate in the circumstances”.

[123]                     
The judge will aim to craft a realistic
treatment order accounting for the hospital’s resource constraints, the
interests of the accused and the needs of the criminal process.  This is
consistent with the judge’s broad power to set the conditions of a disposition
under s. 672.58 and to set the effective date of the disposition under s.
672.63.

[124]                     
Finally, if the court attaches what the hospital
considers to be unreasonable conditions to a treatment order (including for
example, where treatment cannot safely be provided), the hospital may, of
course, exercise its statutory right of appeal, and benefit from the automatic
stay.  The Court of Appeal is empowered to overturn a treatment order in such a
case.

E.           
Conclusions

[125]                     
For these reasons, I conclude that before a
judge can make a treatment order, the consent provisions under s. 672.62(1) 
require that a hospital must have indicated it would be willing to administer
the specified treatment.  When read in their full context, the consent
provisions do not permit hospitals to assess the priority of the accused
against others on the waiting list ― or to withhold consent on the basis
of its bed shortages or waitlists.  Consent may be withheld only for medical
reasons.

[126]                     
Judges are charged under Part XX.1 with ensuring
procedural fairness and minimal infringement of the accused’s liberty.  The
judge can consider bed shortages, in light of the medical and legal interests
of the unfit accused.  It is the court, and not the hospital, that is tasked
with fulfilling the ultimate goal of the treatment regime.  That goal is to
make the accused fit to stand trial, thereby avoiding a potentially lengthy
period of detention.

[127]                     
If there are exceptional circumstances at the
hospital such that, even if the accused is treated as a patient who “cannot
wait”, it would not be safe to admit and treat the accused, then the hospital
should bring that to the attention of the judge.  If the hospital is concerned
about the treatment order, its remedy is to launch an appeal, and receive an
automatic stay.

VI.       
The Treatment Order Issued in This Case

[128]                     
The validity of Hogan J.’s order is now moot. 
However, the parties agreed that the appeal should proceed.

[129]                     
Obviously, all those involved were acting in
good faith.  Indeed, in many respects, the 102 Court-CAMH system is a good
example of co-operation among the various institutions involved in implementing
Part XX.1.

[130]                     
The record indicates that the hospital’s refusal
to agree to the judge’s desired start date for the treatment order ― a
refusal they characterize as a denial of consent ― was based on its own
waitlists rather than the treatment of the accused.  Staff safety was a concern
at CAMH because of the sexual assault allegation, and a bed at MHCP would only
be available in six days.  The hospital argued that an earlier start date would
impact the priority of other patients waiting for an available bed.

[131]                     
I do not agree with the Court of Appeal that the
trial judge lacked jurisdiction to issue a treatment order in this case.  It is
obvious from the record that the hospital consented to provide the treatment,
subject to bed availability.  However, I conclude that the hearing judge’s
decision regarding the timing of the treatment order was not reasonable.

[132]                     
It is clear that the hearing judge was concerned
generally about unfit accused waiting in jail, and the impact of the delay upon
their mental health.  However, she did not base her decision upon the specific
circumstances of this case in issuing a “forthwith” treatment order.  There was
no discussion of the impact on the offender’s treatment prospects resulting
from a delay; the holding conditions in the jail where he would likely be sent
to wait; or any possible alternatives to detention while waiting for a bed. 
And there was no information about whether the hospital could safely administer
treatment immediately, if so ordered, or when safe treatment could be provided,
if he was given priority.  These are relevant factors that could have assisted
the judge in the exercise of her discretion to issue a treatment order in this
case.  Like many others at the time, the judge made the treatment order in good
faith, but out of frustration with the mental health system’s inability to
immediately accommodate patients under treatment orders.

[133]                     
As a result, I agree with the Court of Appeal
that the judge erred in issuing a “forthwith” treatment order.  I would dismiss
the appeal without costs.

reasonable grounds to believe that such evidence is necessary to determine

(a) whether the accused is unfit to stand trial;

(b) whether the accused was, at the time of the commission of the alleged offence,
suffering from a mental disorder so as to be exempt from criminal
responsibility by virtue of subsection 16(1);

(c) whether the balance of the mind of the accused was disturbed at the time of commission
of the alleged offence, where the accused is a female person charged with an
offence arising out of the death of her newly-born child;

(d) the appropriate disposition to be made, where a verdict of not criminally responsible on
account of mental disorder or unfit to stand trial has been rendered in respect
of the accused; or

(e) whether an order should be made under section 672.851 for a stay of proceedings,
where a verdict of unfit to stand trial has been rendered against the accused.

                  672.46 (1) [Status quo pending Review Board
hearing] Where the court does not make a disposition in respect of the accused
at a disposition hearing, any order for the interim release or detention of the
accused or any appearance notice, promise to appear, summons, undertaking or
recognizance in respect of the accused that is in force
at the time the verdict of not criminally responsible on account of mental
disorder or unfit to stand trial is rendered continues in force, subject to its
terms, until the Review Board makes a disposition.

                  (2) [Variation of order] Notwithstanding
subsection (1), a court may, on cause being shown, vacate any order, appearance
notice, promise to appear, summons, undertaking or recognizance referred to in
that subsection and make any other order for the interim release or detention
of the accused that the court considers to be appropriate in the circumstances,
including an order directing that the accused be detained in custody in a
hospital pending a disposition by the Review Board in respect of the accused.

                  672.54 [Dispositions that may be made] Where a
court or Review Board makes a disposition under subsection 672.45(2) or section
672.47 or 672.83, it shall, taking into consideration the need to protect the
public from dangerous persons, the mental condition of the accused, the
reintegration of the accused into society and the other needs of the accused,
make one of the following dispositions that is the least onerous and least
restrictive to the accused:

 (a) where a verdict of not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder has
been rendered in respect of the accused and, in the opinion of the court or
Review Board, the accused is not a significant threat to the safety of the
public, by order, direct that the accused be discharged absolutely;

(b) by order, direct that the
accused be discharged subject to such conditions as the court or Review Board considers appropriate; or

(c) by order, direct that the accused be detained in custody in a hospital, subject to
such conditions as the court or Review Board considers appropriate.

                  672.58 [Treatment disposition] Where a verdict of unfit to stand trial is
rendered and the court has not made a disposition under section 672.54 in
respect of an accused, the court may, on application by the prosecutor, by
order, direct that treatment of the accused be carried out for a specified period
not exceeding sixty days, subject to such conditions as the court considers
appropriate and, where the accused is not detained in custody, direct that the
accused submit to that treatment by the person or at the hospital specified.

                  672.59 (1) [Criteria for disposition] No disposition may be made under
section 672.58 unless the court is satisfied, on the basis of the testimony of
a medical practitioner, that a specific treatment should be administered to the
accused for the purpose of making the accused fit to stand trial.

                  (2)
[Evidence required] The testimony required by the court for the purposes of
subsection (1) shall include a statement that the medical practitioner has made
an assessment of the accused and is of the opinion, based on the grounds specified,
that

(a) the accused, at the time of the assessment, was unfit to stand trial;

(b) the psychiatric treatment and any other related medical treatment specified by the medical
practitioner will likely make the accused fit to stand trial within a period
not exceeding sixty days and that without that treatment the accused is likely
to remain unfit to stand trial;

(c) the risk of harm to the
accused from the psychiatric and other related medical treatment specified is
not disproportionate to the benefit anticipated to be derived from it; and

(d) the psychiatric and other
related medical treatment specified is the least restrictive and least intrusive treatment that could, in the circumstances, be specified for the
purpose referred to in subsection (1), considering the opinions referred to in
paragraphs (b) and (c).

                  672.6 (1) [Notice required] The court shall not make a disposition under
section 672.58 unless the prosecutor notifies the accused, in writing and as
soon as practicable, of the application.

                  (2)
[Challenge by accused] On receiving the notice referred to in subsection (1),
the accused may challenge the application and adduce evidence for that purpose.

                  672.61 (1) [Exception] The court shall not direct, and no disposition made
under section 672.58 shall include, the performance of psychosurgery or
electro-convulsive therapy or any other prohibited treatment that is
prescribed.

                  (2)
[Definitions] In this section,

“electro-convulsive therapy” means a procedure for
the treatment of certain mental disorders that induces, by electrical
stimulation of the brain, a series of generalized convulsions;

“psychosurgery” means any procedure that by
direct or indirect access to the brain removes, destroys or interrupts the
continuity of histologically normal brain tissue, or inserts indwelling
electrodes for pulsed electrical stimulation for the purpose of altering
behaviour or treating psychiatric illness, but does not include neurological
procedures used to diagnose or treat intractable physical pain, organic brain
conditions, or epilepsy, where any of those conditions is clearly demonstrable.

                  672.62
(1) [Consent of hospital required for treatment] No
court shall make a disposition under section 672.58 without the consent of

(a) the person in charge of
the hospital where the accused is to be treated; or

(b) the person to whom responsibility for the treatment of the accused is assigned by the court.

                  (2)
[Consent of accused not required for treatment] The court may direct that
treatment of an accused be carried out pursuant to a disposition made under
section 672.58 without the consent of the accused or a person who, according to
the laws of the province where the disposition is made, is authorized to
consent for the accused.

                  672.63 [Effective date of disposition] A disposition shall come into force
on the day on which it is made or on any later day that the court or Review
Board specifies in it, and shall remain in force until the Review Board holds a
hearing to review the disposition and makes another disposition.

                  672.72 (1) [Grounds for appeal] Any party may appeal against a disposition
made by a court or a Review Board, or a placement decision made by a Review

law or fact alone or of mixed law and fact.

 

                  (2)
[Limitation period for appeal] An appellant shall give notice of an appeal
against a disposition or placement decision in the manner directed by the
applicable rules of court within fifteen days after the day on which the

reasons for it or within any further time that the court of appeal, or a judge
of that court, may direct.

                  (3)
[Appeal to be heard expeditiously] The court of appeal shall hear an appeal
against a disposition or placement decision in or out of the regular sessions
of the court, as soon as practicable after the day on which the notice of
appeal is given, within any period that may be fixed by the court of appeal, a

on appeal from the court of appeal for manitoba

                    Criminal law — Sentencing — Dangerous
offender — Application for remand for assessment — Meaning of “serious personal
injury offence” — Whether robbery committed by using threats of violence to a
person falls within the meaning of “serious personal injury offence” — Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, ss. 343 (a), 752  “serious personal injury offence”,
752.1(1)

                    S
robbed a drugstore, telling the cashiers that he had a gun. There is no
evidence that he actually had a gun or that physical force was used. No one was
injured. One of the cashiers testified that she had been scared during the
robbery, while the other described her reaction as one of shock. S was
convicted of robbery under s. 343 (a) of the Criminal Code  on the
basis that he had “use[d] . . . threats of violence to a person”. The
Crown applied to the court to remand him for assessment pursuant to s. 752.1(1) 
of the Criminal Code . Both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal found
that a threat of violence does not on its own constitute “the use or attempted
use of violence” in accordance with subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of
“serious personal injury offence” in s. 752  of the Criminal Code .

                    Held: 
The appeal should be allowed.

                    This case concerns the scope of the definition
of a “serious personal injury offence” (SPIO) and, consequently, the threshold
for entry into the dangerous and long-term offender system. A threat of
violence that suffices to ground a conviction for robbery under s. 343 (a)
does indeed constitute the use of violence against another person within the
meaning of subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of an SPIO set out in s. 752 .


                    Indeterminate
detention and long-term supervision are exceptional sentences which are
reserved for individuals who pose an ongoing threat to the public. There are a
number of procedural steps and substantive requirements before a court can find
that an offender is a dangerous offender or a long-term offender. Before the
court remands an offender for assessment, it must be satisfied that the
offender has been convicted of an SPIO as defined in s. 752 . There also must be
reasonable grounds to believe that the offender might be found to be a
dangerous offender under s. 753 or a long-term offender under s. 753.1. Thus,
the SPIO requirement plays a crucial role in the operation of the dangerous and
long-term offender scheme.

                    The
primary rationale for both indeterminate detention and long-term supervision
under Part XXIV is public protection, and an overly narrow construction of the gateway
provision would indeed undermine this purpose. However, the specific purpose of
the SPIO requirement is to link the sentence to the predicate offence, and an
overly broad construction would undermine this purpose and violate the
fundamental principle of sentencing, that a sentence must be proportionate to
the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.
The SPIO requirement helps safeguard the constitutionality of the scheme. In
interpreting the definition of an SPIO, effect must be given to the overall
protective purpose of Part XXIV, while also furthering the specific purpose of
the SPIO requirement by tying the punishment to the predicate offence and
safeguarding the objective of proportionality.

                    Subparagraph
(a)(i) of the definition in s. 752  does not invite a court to assess the
seriousness of the violence the offender used or attempted to use; any level of
violence is sufficient. The words “use or attempted use of violence” must be
read in their grammatical and ordinary sense, having regard to their statutory
context. Neither the purpose of the SPIO requirement nor that of Part XXIV
warrants reading in a qualitative minimum level of violence. This
interpretation is consistent with the gatekeeper function of the SPIO requirement.

                    Unless
the context or the purpose of the statute suggests a different approach, the
prevailing definition of “violence” is a harm-based one that encompasses acts
by which a person causes, attempts to cause or threatens to cause harm and not
a force-based one. This is not to say that the definition of violence must be a
harm-based one in every case. Context will be paramount and there may be
situations in which the presumption of consistent expression is clearly
rebutted by other principles of interpretation and, as a result, the intended
meaning of violence may vary between statutes and even, in some circumstances,
within them. The scope of the expression “use or attempted use of
violence” must ultimately be determined having regard to the context in which
it is used. 

                    There is no
indication that the various parts of the definition of an SPIO in s. 752  are
mutually exclusive. The fact that a proposed interpretation would bring some
offences within the ambit of more than one part of the definition in s. 752 
should not, in itself, justify narrowing the definition to avoid such overlaps.
Subparagraph (a)(i) concerns violent acts — “the use or attempted use of
violence” — and requires violent intent on the offender’s part. This part of
the definition will apply to an offender who intentionally causes,
attempts to cause or threatens to cause harm. Threats are included by virtue of
the speaker’s intent that they be taken seriously. Subparagraph (a)(ii)
relates solely to the effects of the conduct and, as such, will include offences
involving negligence. Therefore, a harm-based approach to subpara. (a)(i)
according to which threatening violence constitutes a form of use of violence
is not inconsistent with the endangerment and psychological damage aspects of
the definition in subpara. (a)(ii).

                    The exclusion of
robbery from the offences listed in para. (b) of the definition is not
relevant to the determination of legislative intent. There is no indication
that Parliament intended to create an exhaustive list of all offences
constituting SPIOs in all cases. 

                    The Court
of Appeal relied on the presumption that the use of different language suggests
that the legislature intended different meanings and the principle that the
same words have the same meaning throughout a statute; however, it failed to
take into account the full context in which the expressions “uses violence” and
“use of violence” appear in s. 343  and subpara. (a)(i) of the
definition of an SPIO in s. 752 . The two provisions are in unrelated parts of
the Criminal Code , and they have distinct purposes and legislative
histories. The Court of Appeal’s approach is also inconsistent with the
principles of statutory interpretation and would result in untold difficulties
for trial judges seeking to establish the elusive dividing line between threats
that are inherently violent and those that are not. It is
moreover incompatible with the plain meaning and the purpose of the provision.
All threats of violence are themselves violent, even though the seriousness of
the violence may be quite limited. In seeking to distinguish violent from non-violent
threats, courts are in effect reading in an objective minimum level of
violence. The Court of Appeal’s interpretation is inconsistent with the clear
language of subpara. (a)(i) of the definition, which requires violence,
not serious violence, and it risks undermining the overall purpose of Part XXIV
by precluding courts from remanding potentially dangerous offenders for
assessment. 

                    Threats of violence
to a person that are sufficient to ground a conviction for robbery under s. 343 (a)
meet the “use . . . of violence” criterion in subpara. (a)(i)
of the definition of an SPIO in s. 752 . By threatening to harm his victims while committing robbery, S used
violence against them. Since the other requirements of the definition are
clearly met, his offence qualifies as an SPIO.

Introduction

[1]                             
Indeterminate detention and long-term
supervision under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 ,
are exceptional sentences in our criminal justice system. They are reserved for
individuals who pose an ongoing threat to the public and accordingly merit
enhanced sentences on preventive grounds. Part XXIV outlines the process by
which an offender may be designated as a dangerous offender or a long-term
offender and be sentenced accordingly. Before either of these designations can
be made, a number of conditions must be met. One such condition is that the
offence that forms the basis for the dangerous offender or long-term offender
application must be a “serious personal injury offence” as defined in s. 752  of
the Criminal Code . 

[2]                             
The term “serious personal injury offence”
means, inter alia, an indictable offence involving “the use or attempted
use of violence against another person” for which the offender may be sentenced
to imprisonment for 10 years or more: s. 752 , subpara. (a)(i) of the
definition of “serious personal injury offence” (“SPIO”). On application by a
prosecutor, where an individual has been convicted of such an offence, and if
the court finds that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the
individual might be found to be a dangerous offender or a long-term offender,
the court must remand the individual for a psychological assessment: s. 752.1(1) .
This assessment then forms the basis for an application for a finding that the
individual is a dangerous offender or a long-term offender. 

[3]                             
This case concerns the scope of the definition
of an SPIO and, consequently, the threshold for entry into the dangerous and
long-term offender system. The offender, Mr. Steele, robbed a drugstore,
telling the cashiers that he had a gun. There is no evidence that he actually
had a gun or that physical force was used. Mr. Steele was convicted of robbery
under s. 343 (a) of the Criminal Code  on the basis that he had
“use[d] . . . threats of violence to a person”. The Crown, viewing
this as an SPIO, gave notice of its intention to apply to the court to remand
Mr. Steele for assessment pursuant to s. 752.1(1) . Mr. Steele’s offence
clearly meets two of the requirements of the definition of an SPIO referred to
above: robbery is an indictable offence for which the offender may be sentenced
to imprisonment for 10 years or more (see s. 344 ). The question is whether the
offence — which involved threats of violence to a person, but no physical force
— meets the other requirement of that definition: that of involving “the use or
attempted use of violence against another person”. 

[4]                             
Both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal
answered this question in the negative. They found, in essence, that a threat
of violence does not on its own constitute “the use or attempted use of
violence”. For the reasons that follow, I respectfully disagree. 

[5]                             
A threat of violence that suffices to ground a
conviction for robbery under s. 343 (a) does indeed constitute the use of
violence against another person within the meaning of subpara. (a)(i) of
the definition of an SPIO set out in s. 752 . By threatening to harm his victims
while committing robbery, Mr. Steele used violence against them. Since the
other requirements of the definition are clearly met, his offence qualifies as
an SPIO. 

[6]                             
In the result, I would allow the Crown’s appeal.
The other requirements for the Crown’s application for remand for an assessment
have not been contested, which means that all the requirements are met. I would
therefore grant the application and order that Mr. Steele be remanded for
assessment pursuant to s. 752.1(1)  of the Criminal Code . 

II.          
Relevant Statutory Provisions

[7]                             
The dispute over the definition of an SPIO
arises in the context of the Crown’s application for remand for an assessment,
which is a step that must be taken before applying for a finding that an
offender is a dangerous offender or a long-term offender: 

752.1 (1) [Application for remand for assessment]
On application by the prosecutor, if the court is of the opinion that there are
reasonable grounds to believe that an offender who is convicted of a serious
personal injury offence or an offence referred to in paragraph 753.1(2)(a)
might be found to be a dangerous offender under section 753 or a long-term
offender under section 753.1, the court shall, by order in writing, before
sentence is imposed, remand the offender, for a period not exceeding 60 days,
to the custody of a person designated by the court who can perform an
assessment or have an assessment performed by experts for use as evidence in an
application under section 753 or 753.1.

[8]                             
The requirements of the definition of an SPIO
must be met both at the stage of the application for an assessment (s.
752.1(1) ) and, subsequently, at that of the application for a finding that the
offender is a dangerous offender (s. 753(1)). The definition reads as follows:

752. [Definitions] In this Part,

. . .

 

“serious personal injury
offence” means

 

(a)   an
indictable offence, other than high treason, treason, first degree murder or
second degree murder, involving

 

(i)
the use or attempted use of violence against another person, or

 

(ii)
conduct endangering or likely to endanger the life or safety of another person
or inflicting or likely to inflict severe psychological damage on another
person,

 

and
for which the offender may be sentenced to imprisonment for ten years or more,
or

 

(b)    an offence or attempt to commit an
offence mentioned in section 271 (sexual assault), 272 (sexual assault with a
weapon, threats to a third party or causing bodily harm) or 273 (aggravated
sexual assault).

[9]                             
The offence of robbery under s. 343  encompasses
a number of different acts. Section 343  reads as follows:

343. [Robbery]
Every one commits robbery who

 

(a) steals, and for the purpose of extorting whatever is
stolen or to prevent or overcome resistance to the stealing, uses violence
or threats of violence to a person or property;

 

(b)
steals from any person and, at the time he steals or immediately before or
immediately thereafter, wounds, beats, strikes or uses any personal violence to
that person;

 

(c)
assaults any person with intent to steal from him; or

 

(d)
steals from any person while armed with an offensive weapon or imitation
thereof.

III.       
Background

[10]                         
The key facts are not in dispute. At
approximately 1:35 p.m. on May 28, 2010, Mr. Steele entered a drugstore with
his face concealed by a tightly drawn hoodie, as could be seen on a
surveillance videotape. He approached the checkout counter and said something
like, “Give me the money. It’s a robbery. I have a gun”. The cashier was unable
to open the register and requested the assistance of another cashier, who
opened it and positioned the cash tray so that Mr. Steele could reach it.  Mr.
Steele left the store approximately one minute and ten seconds after entering
it. He was at the checkout counter for 39 seconds. 

[11]                         
No weapon was seen in Mr. Steele’s possession
either inside or outside the store. No one was injured. One of the cashiers
testified that she had been scared during the robbery, while the other
described her reaction as one of shock. 

[12]                         
Mr. Steele was convicted of robbery, disguise
with intent and failure to comply with a probation order: 2011 MBQB 67. The
Crown then applied to the court to remand him for assessment pursuant to s.
752.1(1)  of the Criminal Code .  

A.          
Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench, 2011 MBQB 181, 267
Man. R. (2d) 91

[13]                         
McKelvey J. denied the Crown’s application. She
began her analysis by noting that the legislature has not specified that
robbery is an SPIO, as it has done in para. (b) of the definition of an
SPIO with respect to certain sexually based offences. She then said that there
was no evidence that Mr. Steele’s conduct had endangered or been likely to
endanger the lives or safety of the cashiers or that severe psychological
damage had been inflicted on them within the meaning of subpara. (a)(ii)
of the definition. The case therefore turned on subpara. (a)(i). Did Mr.
Steele’s conduct involve the use or attempted use of violence against the
cashiers?

[14]                         
On this question, McKelvey J. acknowledged two
lines of authority. According to the first, that of R. v. Neve, 1999
ABCA 206, 71 Alta. L.R. (3d) 92, the “use or attempted use of violence”
threshold requires that the violence be “objectively serious” (para. 76). The
second, that of R. v. Goforth, 2005 SKCA 12, 257 Sask. R. 123, and R.
v. Lebar, 2010 ONCA 220, 101 O.R. (3d) 263, rejects this requirement.
McKelvey J. noted (at para. 11) that “[t]he case law is trending towards an
acceptance of [the latter approach]”, according to which the expression “use or
attempted use of violence” encompasses all violent conduct irrespective of how
serious it is. 

[15]                         
McKelvey J. nevertheless found that the “implied
threat of violence” (para. 28) in the case at bar fell short of the subpara. (a)(i)
threshold. She noted that no one had been injured. Although Mr. Steele’s hands
were in his pockets when he uttered the threat, he had done nothing that could
be likened to pulling out a weapon. McKelvey J. accepted that the two cashiers
had experienced shock and fear as a result of Mr. Steele’s actions, but
nevertheless concluded that those actions had not constituted the use or
attempted use of violence. In reaching this conclusion, she relied on the
reasoning of other courts that had found that similar threats of violence
failed to meet the SPIO threshold:  e.g., R. v. Thompson, 2009 ONCJ 359
(CanLII); R. v. Roy, 2008 SKCA 41, 307 Sask. R. 276; R. v. Jolicoeur,
2011 MBQB 129, 265 Man. R. (2d) 225. 

B.           
Manitoba Court of Appeal, 2013 MBCA 21, 288 Man.
R. (2d) 304 (per Scott C.J.M. and Beard and Monnin JJ.A.)

[16]                         
The Manitoba Court of Appeal, per Scott
C.J.M., unanimously upheld McKelvey J.’s decision. The definition of robbery in
s. 343 (a) refers to a person who “uses violence” or “uses . . .
threats of violence”, whereas subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of an
SPIO in s. 752  refers to the “use . . . of violence” or the
“attempted use of violence”. Scott C.J.M. reasoned that these differences in
language imply that not all robberies involve the use or attempted use of
violence. He discussed R. v. C.D., 2005 SCC 78, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 668, in
which this Court had adopted a definition of the expression “violent offence”
as used in s. 39(1) (a) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C.
2002, c. 1  (“YCJA ”), that included threats to cause bodily harm,
but found that that case should be distinguished. In his opinion, the fact that
s. 343 (a) refers to the use of both violence and threats of violence
means that there must be some difference between the two. 

[17]                         
After surveying the various types of threats
that might support a robbery conviction under s. 343 (a), Scott C.J.M.
noted that whether or not violence was used or attempted is a factual
determination, and a matter for the trial judge. He agreed with McKelvey J. in
endorsing the holding in Goforth and Lebar that the issue is not
whether the violence used in committing the predicate offence was objectively
serious. What must be determined, according to the court in Lebar, is
“whether the evidence proves that violence was actually used” (Scott C.J.M., at
para. 70, quoting Lebar, at para. 50). Although he agreed in substance
with this approach, Scott C.J.M. found that the court had sidestepped the
distinction between the concepts of use of violence and attempted use of
violence referred to in subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of an SPIO in
s. 752 . The use of violence to a person in committing robbery will also
constitute a use of violence within the meaning of that provision. Where, on
the other hand, robbery is committed by the use of threats of violence
against a person, the question is whether those threats also constitute the attempted
use of violence within the meaning of subpara. (a)(i). 

[18]                         
In this regard, Scott C.J.M. approved the
approach adopted in Thompson, at para. 28:

In the myriad of factual circumstances
that can constitute criminal offences, there is often a threat of violence,
sometimes explicit and sometimes implicit. There may be instances when that
threat of violence is so real that one could reasonably characterize it as an
attempted use of violence. In other words, very little more need be done by
the offender before the threat becomes actual use. To try and distinguish an
attempt from a threat on such facts may be nothing more than semantics. However,
in other cases, the threat of violence may be so remote from any actual
perpetration of violence such that it cannot reasonably amount to an attempted
use. [Emphasis added.]

[19]                         
Scott C.J.M. proposed the following approach for
determining whether a given threat amounts to an attempted use of violence
(para. 85):

[S]ome degree of physical action must
be part of a threat for it to constitute the “attempted use of violence”. That
is, there needs to be some indication of imminent apparent danger to a person
or some overt act directed towards the actual use of violence against a person
for a threat of violence to also constitute the attempted use of violence. 

[20]                         
Finally, Scott C.J.M. noted that McKelvey J.’s
findings of fact had not been challenged, and because the threat of violence
was not associated with either imminent danger or “any, even minimal, overt
physical act”, he upheld the trial judge’s decision (para. 86). The threat,
while sufficient to ground a conviction for robbery under s. 343 (a), did
not constitute the use or attempted use of violence for the purposes of the
definition of an SPIO and did not trigger the sentencing procedures under Part
XXIV. 

IV.       
Issue

[21]                         
Does robbery committed by using threats of
violence to a person within the meaning of s. 343 (a) of the Criminal Code 
constitute an SPIO in accordance with subpara. (a)(i) of the
definition of that expression set out in s. 752 ?

V.          
Analysis

[22]                         
To determine whether an offence constitutes an
SPIO, it is necessary to review the elements of the offence, but it may also be
necessary, if that review is insufficient, to consider the factual
circumstances in which the offence was committed. Certain offences
automatically constitute SPIOs regardless of the manner in which they are
committed: s. 752 , para. (b) of the definition of “serious personal
injury offence”; see R. v. Currie,
[1997] 2 S.C.R. 260, at paras. 21-22. There are other offences that always
constitute SPIOs in that one of their elements automatically satisfies the
descriptive criteria set out in para. (a) of the definition of an SPIO. 
One example would be where personal violence or endangerment forms part of the
definition of the offence: see, e.g., R. v. Cepic, 2010 ONSC 561,
93 M.V.R. (5th) 129, at para. 18. Robbery is clearly not one of this second
type of offences, since it can involve the use of violence or threats of
violence to a person or property, whereas subpara. (a)(i) of the
definition of an SPIO refers only to the use or attempted use of violence against
another person: see Lebar, at para. 65. 

[23]                         
Thus, the question is whether a robbery
committed as in the instant case — by using threats of violence to a person,
but without using actual physical violence — satisfies the criterion of “use or
attempted use of violence against another person” set out in the definition. I
conclude that it does. I reach this conclusion in light of the modern principle
of statutory interpretation that the words of legislation must be read “in
their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously
with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of
Parliament”: E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at
p. 87. 

[24]                         
I will begin by discussing the purpose of the
SPIO threshold and its function within the scheme of Part XXIV. I will then
consider the plain meaning of the term “violence” in the context of the Criminal
Code  and other legislation. Finally, I will discuss the statutory context
of the provision in which the phrase “use or attempted use of violence”
appears, including the other provisions of the definition of an SPIO and the
provision that defines the offence of robbery. Taken together, these
considerations support the view that threats of violence to a person that
suffice to ground a conviction for robbery meet the violence criterion in the
definition of an SPIO. Because robbery is an indictable offence for which the
offender may be sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years or more, all the
criteria of subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of an SPIO are satisfied. 

A.          
Purpose of the SPIO Requirement

[25]                         
The Crown emphasizes that the SPIO requirement
serves as a gateway in that it is applied before an offender is assessed for
dangerousness and before an application can be made for a finding that he or
she is a dangerous offender or a long-term offender. The “use or attempted use
of violence” criterion must therefore, the Crown argues, be interpreted broadly
to ensure that offenders who might meet the criteria are not excluded from
being assessed, which would undermine the goal of public protection. 

[26]                         
Mr. Steele counters that the SPIO requirement
performs an important function in Part XXIV by ensuring that offenders may only
be sentenced to indeterminate detention for sufficiently serious crimes. He
argues that an overly broad construction of this requirement would frustrate
the scheme’s objective of proportionality. 

[27]                         
As I will explain, both these purposive
arguments have merit. The general purpose of Part XXIV is public protection,
and an overly narrow construction of the gateway provision would indeed
undermine this purpose. However, the specific purpose of the SPIO requirement
is to link the sentence to the predicate offence, and an overly broad
construction would undermine this purpose and jeopardize the objective of
proportionality. My interpretive approach must be sensitive to both the general
and the specific purpose.  I will now discuss each of these purposes in detail
and will conclude that the seriousness requirement of subpara. (a)(i) of
the definition of an SPIO is satisfied by a textual and contextual
interpretation of the words “use or attempted use of violence”, and that it
would be wrong to read in an objective minimum level of violence.

General Purpose of the Dangerous and Long-term
Offender Provisions 

[28]                         
Part XXIV of the Criminal Code  authorizes
the indeterminate detention of individuals who are found to be “dangerous
offender[s]” on the basis that their past conduct and patterns of behaviour
show that they constitute a threat to the life, safety or physical or mental
well-being of other persons (s. 753(1) (a)), or that their failure to
control sexual impulses means that they are likely to cause injury, pain or
other evil to other persons (s. 753(1) (b)). It also authorizes the
long-term supervision of individuals who are found to be “long-term
offender[s]” where a sentence of imprisonment of two years or more would be
appropriate, there is a substantial risk that the individuals will reoffend,
and there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of that risk in the
community (s. 753.1(1) ). 

[29]                         
The primary rationale for both indeterminate
detention and long-term supervision under Part XXIV is public protection. Both
sentences advance the “dominant purpose” of preventive detention identified by
Dickson J. in Hatchwell v. The Queen, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 39, at p. 43,
namely “to protect the public when the past conduct of the criminal
demonstrates a propensity for crimes of violence against the person, and there
is a real and present danger to life or limb”. When the constitutionality of
the dangerous offender provisions came before this Court in R. v. Lyons,
[1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, La Forest J., wrote at p. 329, “[Part XXIV] merely enables the court to accommodate its sentence to
the common sense reality that the present condition of the offender is
such that he or she is not inhibited by normal standards of behavioural
restraint so that future violent acts can quite confidently be expected
of that person” (emphasis in original). Lamer C.J. subsequently explained this
rationale as follows in Currie, at para. 26: “Parliament has thus
created a standard of preventive detention that measures an accused’s present
condition according to past behaviour and patterns of conduct.” See also R.
v. Sipos, 2014 SCC 47, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 423, at para. 19. 

[30]                         
Parliament amended Part XXIV in 1997 to create
the category of “long-term offenders” and make it possible to supervise such
offenders in the community, thus establishing an alternative to the
indeterminate detention of persons designated as “dangerous offenders”.
Long-term offenders, those who meet the criteria specified in s. 753.1(1), may
be ordered to be subject to supervision in the community for a specified period
(maximum of 10 years) after the expiry of a determinate sentence, which must be
for a term of two years or more: s. 753.1(3). The purpose of the long-term
supervision provisions is twofold: to protect the public and to rehabilitate
offenders and facilitate their reintegration into the community: R. v.
Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433, at para. 50. 

[31]                         
In R. v. Johnson, 2003 SCC 46,
[2003] 2 S.C.R. 357, Iacobucci and Arbour JJ. considered the purpose of the
long-term supervision provisions and the relationship between them and the
dangerous offender provisions. At the time, the use of the word “may” indicated
that, even if all the criteria were met, designation as either a long-term
offender or a dangerous offender was discretionary. The Court held that, in
light of the discretionary nature of a finding that an offender was a dangerous
offender and given the principles of sentencing in s. 718.2  of the Criminal
Code , a judge was required to consider finding an offender to be a
long-term offender — inquiring in particular into the possibility of eventual
control of the risk posed by the offender in the community — before imposing
the harsher punishment applicable to a dangerous offender (para. 28; Sipos,
at para. 22). Subsequent to the Court’s decision in Johnson,
Parliament acted in 2008 to eliminate the judge’s discretion in the context of
a dangerous offender application. The word “shall” now indicates that if a
court is satisfied that the criteria in s. 753(1)  have been met, it must find
the offender to be a dangerous offender. In eliminating this discretion,
however, Parliament built in a new flexibility regarding the consequences of
such a finding. Before 2008, a court that found an offender to be a dangerous
offender was obliged to (“shall”) impose a sentence of detention for an
indeterminate period (Johnson, at para. 5). Today, a court that
makes such a finding has the option of imposing an indeterminate sentence, a
determinate sentence of two years or more combined with long-term supervision
for up to 10 years, or a sentence for the offence for which the offender has
been convicted: s. 753(4) . It may impose one of the latter two sentences only
if it is satisfied that the sentence will adequately protect the public: s.
753(4.1) . 

(2)        
Specific Purpose of the SPIO Requirement in the
Dangerous and Long-term Offender Scheme

[32]                         
There are a number of procedural steps that must
be taken before a court can find that an offender is a dangerous offender or a
long-term offender. First of all, the prosecutor must apply to have the
offender remanded for assessment: s. 752.1(1) . An assessment report must then be
filed before the prosecutor can apply for a finding that the offender is a
dangerous offender or a long-term offender: ss. 753(1) or 753.1(1). The
prosecutor must give notice to the offender outlining the basis on which it is
intended to found the application: s. 754(1)(b). The Attorney General of
the province must consent to the application: s. 754(1)(a). All these
procedural protections enhance the overall fairness of the scheme. See Lyons,
at pp 362-63, for a discussion of the procedural safeguards provided
for in Part XXIV. 

[33]                         
There are also substantive requirements to be
met. Before the court remands an offender for assessment, it must be satisfied,
first, that the offender has been convicted of an SPIO as defined in s. 752 .
Second, there must be reasonable grounds to believe that the offender might be
found to be a dangerous offender under s. 753 or a long-term offender under s.
753.1. The SPIO requirement comes into play once again at the stage of the
application for a finding that the offender is a dangerous offender, as the
court must be satisfied that the offence is an SPIO before making such a
finding: s. 753(1). 

[34]                         
Thus, the SPIO requirement plays a crucial role
in the operation of the dangerous and long-term offender scheme. The sentences
that can be imposed under Part XXIV, including indeterminate detention and
long-term supervision, serve the purposes of both prevention and punishment. To
the extent that the sentence is based on a risk established in light of past
conduct and patterns of behaviour, it is preventive. As La Forest J. held in Lyons,
preventive detention under Part XXIV “represents a judgment that the
relative importance of the objectives of rehabilitation, deterrence and
retribution are greatly attenuated in the circumstances of the individual case,
and that of prevention, correspondingly increased” (p. 329). 

[35]                         
These sentences are also punitive, however, and
in this regard, the function of the SPIO requirement is twofold: first, it
serves as a “gatekeeper” for entry into the dangerous or long-term offender
system (s. 752.1(1) ); second, if the Crown applies for a finding that the
offender is a dangerous offender, it serves as a requirement for the making of
such a finding (s. 753(1)). If the punitive purpose of these sentencing options
were outweighed entirely by their preventive purpose, they might violate the
fundamental principle of sentencing, that a sentence must be proportionate to
the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.
The SPIO requirement helps safeguard the constitutionality of the scheme: Lyons,
at p. 338. As Lamer C.J. put it in Currie, “[t]he [SPIO] requirement
acts as a gatekeeper to ensure that the sentence is not disproportionate to the
offence” (para. 31; see also Goforth, at para. 44).

[36]                         
These two purposes, one of them general and the
other specific, are in conflict. In interpreting the definition of an SPIO, I
must give effect to the overall protective purpose of Part XXIV, while also
furthering the specific purpose of the SPIO requirement by tying the punishment
to the predicate offence and safeguarding the objective of proportionality.
Whereas an unduly narrow interpretation of the words “use or attempted use of
violence” could preclude courts from remanding potentially dangerous offenders
for assessment and thereby undermine the goal of public protection, an unduly
broad interpretation of those words would dilute the gatekeeper function of the
SPIO requirement and jeopardize the scheme’s objective of proportionality. 

[37]                         
The Crown relies on the Court’s statement in Currie
that the SPIO requirement “merely triggers the [s. 753(1)(b)]
application process. There remains a second stage to [s. 753(1)(b)], at
which point the trial judge must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the
likelihood of future danger that an offender presents to society before he or
she can impose the dangerous offender designation and an indeterminate
sentence” (Currie, at para. 25). This comment was made in the
context of a finding that an offender is a dangerous offender on the basis of
s. 753(1)(b) — that is, in relation to the commission of one of the
sexual offences enumerated in para. (b) of the definition of an SPIO in
s. 752  — but the same logic applies to a finding made under s. 753(1)(a),
which provides that the predicate offence must “for[m] a part” of a pattern of
behaviour underlying the threat the offender constitutes or be “associated
with” particularly brutal behaviour relied on as evidence of that threat. In
every case, the sentence is based on past conduct or patterns of behaviour, but
it cannot be divorced entirely from the predicate offence. 

(3)        
Words “Use or Attempted Use of Violence” Do Not
Include a Requirement of Objective Seriousness

[38]                         
This Court’s statement in Lyons (at p.
324) that the offences falling within the definition of an SPIO are “very
serious violent crimes” reflects the importance of the SPIO requirement in the
overall scheme. Some courts took this statement to mean that in every case the
predicate offence must on its own warrant the kind of punishment imposed under
Part XXIV, but this represents an incorrect reading of Lyons. As this
Court explained in Currie, at para. 28, the words “very serious
violent crime” were used in relation to the specific facts of Lyons and
did not require that all predicate offences fit that description. A predicate
offence must be serious, but the degree of seriousness intended by Parliament
is exhaustively set out in the definition of an SPIO in s. 752 . 

[39]                         
Paragraph (a) of the definition in s. 752 
requires, first, that the offence be an indictable offence, second, that the
maximum sentence for the offence be imprisonment for 10 years or more and,
third, that the offence involve (i) the use or attempted use of violence
against another person, or (ii) conduct endangering or likely to endanger the
life or safety of another person or inflicting or likely to inflict severe
psychological damage on another person. In subpara. (a)(i), the word
“violence” is not qualified, which means that the criteria may be satisfied even
if the violence in question is not in itself “serious” (see Goforth, at
para. 21; Lebar, at para. 67; R. v. Smith, 2012
ONCA 645 (CanLII), at para. 2). The degree of seriousness intended by
Parliament exists if all three requirements of the definition are met. Thus, an
offence that involves the use or attempted use of violence against another
person is not an SPIO under para. (a) of the definition if it is not an
indictable offence or if it is not punishable by a sentence of imprisonment for
10 years or more. Just as para. (b) of the definition does not invite
the court to assess the manner of commission of the enumerated offences,
subpara. (a)(i) does not invite it to assess the seriousness of the
violence the offender used or attempted to use; any level of violence is
sufficient. 

[40]                         
This interpretation is consistent with the
gatekeeper function of the SPIO requirement. An offender who commits an indictable
offence for which he or she may be sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years or
more and that involves the use or attempted use of violence against a person
commits what Parliament has defined as an SPIO; it is not necessary to further
inquire into the level of the violence in question. If the offender is remanded
for assessment and is then found, on the basis of past conduct and patterns of
behaviour, to be a dangerous offender or a long-term offender, it cannot be
said that the offender was “picked up off
the street because of his past criminality (for which he has already been
punished), or because of fears or suspicions about his criminal proclivities,
and then subjected to a procedure in order to determine whether society would
be better off if he were incarcerated indefinitely” (Lyons, at p.
328). Rather, the punishment “flows from the actual commission of a specific
crime, the requisite elements of which have been proved to exist beyond a
reasonable doubt” (ibid.). See also Johnson, at para. 23, in which
the Court mentioned that dangerous and long-term offender proceedings form part
of the sentencing process. 

[41]                         
This statutory framework enables courts to
properly sentence dangerous offenders who have committed SPIOs “without having
to wait for them to strike out in a particularly egregious way” (Currie,
at para. 26). For our purposes, the jurisprudence confirms that the words
“use or attempted use of violence” must be read in their grammatical and
ordinary sense, having regard to their statutory context. Neither the purpose
of the SPIO requirement nor that of Part XXIV warrants reading in a qualitative
minimum level of violence. 

B.           
Plain Meaning of the Term “Violence” in the
Context of the Criminal Code  and Other Legislation

[42]                         
The question of what constitutes violence is as
old as the criminal law itself. It is a moral question as much as a legal one,
and no doubt society’s answer to it has changed in tandem with evolving social
mores. I will not attempt — nor am I required — to answer it definitively. However,
in interpreting the words “use or attempted use of violence” in subpara. (a)(i)
of the definition of an SPIO, I must endeavour to ascertain their “plain
meaning”. In this regard, I am aided by dictionary definitions as well as by
judicial interpretations from a variety of contexts involving both the Criminal
Code  and other legislation. I will explain a conflict that exists between harm-based
definitions of violence that focus on acts by which a person causes, attempts
to cause or threatens to cause harm, and force-based definitions that
focus on the physical nature of the act. Building upon this Court’s reasoning
in C.D. and subsequent cases, I conclude that the prevailing definition
of violence is a harm-based one. 

[43]                         
In C.D., Bastarache J. began his discussion
of the definition of “violence” by noting that there is disagreement with
respect to its grammatical and ordinary meaning. After quoting one dictionary
definition of “violence”, namely “[t]he exercise of physical force so as to
inflict injury on, or cause damage to, persons or property” (The Oxford
English Dictionary (2nd ed. 1989), at p. 654), Bastarache J. noted that
violence is ordinarily understood not only in terms of the use of force, but
also in terms of the effects of that use. This conflict is reflected in
judicial definitions, as Prof. Teresa Scassa explains:

It
is significant that the Criminal Code , which one might assume to be the “bible”
of the control of violence in society, offers no definition of violence. It is,
surprisingly, perhaps the most “assumed” term within the entire Code. Offences
which one might consider the most “violent” of all crimes, such as murder and
assault, do not mention violence. Rather, they talk about concrete, measurable
things like “death” and “bodily harm.” 

 

(T. Scassa,
“Violence Against Women in Law Schools” (1992), 30 Alta. L. Rev.
809, at p. 816, cited in C.D., at para. 30.)

[44]                         
I would add that even dictionary definitions of “violence”
vary, reflecting both harm-based and force-based approaches. For instance, Le
Petit Robert dictionary (new ed. 2012) contains the following definition
of the French expression “faire violence” (do violence): “agir sur
[quelqu’un] ou le faire agir contre sa volonté, en employant la force ou
l’intimidation” ([translation]
“act so as to influence a person or to cause the person to act in a manner
contrary to his or her wishes, by using force or intimidation”) (p. 2717
(emphasis added)). The variance among definitions of violence — both those
found in dictionaries and those adopted by judges — highlights the need to
interpret the word in the context in which it is used. 

[45]                         
In C.D., the Court was being asked
to interpret the scope of the term “violent offence” as used in s. 39(1) (a)
of the YCJA  with respect to the imposition of custodial sentences on
young persons. Bastarache J. concluded that in the context of the YCJA ,
the term “violent offence” means “an offence in the commission of which
a young person causes, attempts to cause or threatens to cause bodily harm”
(para. 17). This definition is notable for its emphasis on the harmful effects
of violence rather than on the nature of the force that was applied. Thus,
threats of bodily harm are included even if physical force has not been used.
Bastarache J. explained that a harm-based approach encompasses both physical
and psychological harm, whereas a force-based approach would apply only to
those “harm-causing” offences that also involve the use, attempted use or
threatened use of force (para. 66). This definition of “violent offence” also
excludes certain acts that might otherwise fall within the ordinary meaning of
the word “violence”. For instance, it excludes crimes against property even
though such offences are generally considered to involve “violence” to property
(paras. 33 and 51). It also excludes relatively minor assaults committed
without causing, attempting to cause or threatening to cause bodily harm,
whereas a force-based definition would tend to encompass such assaults (para.
64). 

[46]                         
Some of the reasoning in C.D. was statute-specific.
For instance, Bastarache J. favoured a harm-based approach in part to include
certain offences — e.g. murder committed without the direct application of
physical force — that in his view ought to fall within the definition of
“violent offence” but that might not be included by a force-based approach
(paras. 58-65). However, he also made some general observations in support of
his adoption of a harm-based definition. He stated that such a definition
“better accords with . . . the ‘usual’ definition of violence, which
tends to focus on its effects (i.e. harm) rather than on the means employed to
produce the effects (i.e. force)” (para. 67). The inclusion of threats of
bodily harm in the definition of “violent offence” “accords with the commonly
held view that a threat to cause bodily harm is, at base, an act of violence”
(para. 85). He added the following:

The view that threats of bodily harm
are essentially acts of violence is likely based on the fact that threatening
to cause bodily harm can often perform the same function as actually causing
it, in that both can instill the level of fear in the victim that is needed to
achieve the offender’s goal: see [R. v. McCraw, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 72], at
pp. 81-82. In this sense, it can be said that irrespective of whether an
offender threatens to cause bodily harm or actually causes bodily harm, in both
cases he or she is “wielding violence” to satisfy his or her object(s). [para.
85]

I would endorse these
observations of Bastarache J. and would note that the harm-based approach he
articulated draws additional support from several recent decisions rendered by
this Court in a variety of contexts, including those of the offence of uttering
threats, the violence exception to freedom of expression, and the offence of
robbery. 

[47]                         
First, a recent case concerning the offence of
uttering threats provided for in s. 264.1(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  supports
the proposition that threats of violence are inherently violent, not
simply a means of communicating future violence. In R. v. McRae,
2013 SCC 68, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 931, the Court confirmed the elements of the
offence of uttering threats: 

[I]t is not necessary to prove that the
threats were conveyed to their intended recipients (prohibited act) or that the
accused intended the threats to be so conveyed (fault element). Further, it is
not necessary to prove that anyone was actually intimidated by the threats
(prohibited act) or that the accused specifically intended to intimidate anyone
(fault element). The concept of the “closed circle” is therefore legally wrong.
 Threats are tools of intimidation and violence.  As such, in any
circumstance where threats are spoken with the intent that they be taken
seriously, even to third parties, the elements of the offence will be made out.
[Emphasis added; para. 24.]

In other words, the act
of threatening harm can itself be an act of violence even if the threats are
not conveyed to their intended recipients or are not intended to be so
conveyed, so long as they are intended to be taken seriously. 

[48]                         
Incidentally, this does not mean that the
offence of uttering threats under s. 264.1(1) (a) is an SPIO. Even if the
offence were found to meet the violence requirement (“use or attempted use of
violence”) of subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of an SPIO, it is not
punishable by a sentence of imprisonment for 10 years and therefore fails to
meet the seriousness requirement: s. 264.1(2) (a). 

[49]                         
Second, in C.D., Bastarache J. discussed
this Court’s decisions with respect to freedom of expression and the question
whether threats of violence fall outside the scope of constitutionally
protected speech (para. 31). In R. v. Keegstra, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 697,
Dickson C.J. had held that only “expression communicated directly through
physical harm” could be considered violence and be excluded from the protection
of s. 2 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  on that
basis (p. 732). It was unclear from the early cases whether the “violence
exception” extended to threats of violence, but any lingering uncertainty was
eliminated in R. v. Khawaja, 2012 SCC 69, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 555, in which
McLachlin C.J. held: “This Court’s jurisprudence supports the proposition that
the exclusion of violence from the s. 2 (b) guarantee of free expression
extends to threats of violence” (para. 70). The same rationale for excluding
expression conveyed by physical violence from the protection of s. 2 (b)
also applies to threats of violence. 

[50]                         
Third, Bastarache J. in C.D. discussed
the different forms of robbery under s. 343. Regarding s. 343(b), he
mentioned that the expression “personal violence” in the phrase “wounds, beats,
strikes or uses any personal violence” had been interpreted to require something
more than a mere technical assault. On the other hand, the phrase “uses
violence or threats of violence” in s. 343(a) had been interpreted to
include simple assault (para. 32). Putting aside, for a moment, technical
arguments about the construction of each of the provisions, I would note that
Parliament included threats of violence among the violent acts that elevate the
offence of theft to that of robbery. In this regard, I agree with the comment
of Epstein J.A. in Lebar: “Section 343(a) applies to a robbery
committed with violence. It is categorically a crime of violence — violence is
an essential element of an offence under that section” (para. 33). 

[51]                         
This brief survey of judicial interpretations of
the term “violence” suggests that the focus is on the harm caused, attempted or
threatened rather than on the force that was applied. I do not suggest that the
definition of violence must be a harm-based one in every case. Context will be
paramount. As I mention below (see para. 65), there may be situations in which
the presumption of consistent expression is clearly rebutted by other
principles of interpretation and, as a result, the intended meaning of violence
may vary between statutes and even, in some circumstances, within them: R.
Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (5th ed.
2008), at p. 222. However, unless the context or the purpose of the
statute suggests a different approach, the prevailing definition of “violence”
is a harm-based one that encompasses acts by which a person causes, attempts to
cause or threatens to cause harm. 

C.           
Statutory Context Supports a Harm-Based
Definition That Encompasses Threats of Violence

[52]                         
Having established that the purposive arguments
are in conflict, that it is therefore necessary to consider the plain meaning
of the words as well as the statutory context, and that the plain meaning
generally favours a harm-based definition of violence that includes threats, I
will now discuss the context in detail. The scope of the expression “use or
attempted use of violence” must ultimately be determined having regard to the
context in which it is used: C.D., at para. 33; Lebar, at
para. 38. 

[53]                         
Currently, the definition of an SPIO is relevant
only to the dangerous and long-term offender scheme in Part XXIV of the Criminal
Code , but this was not always the case. Between 2007 and 2012, s. 742.1  of
the Criminal Code  referred to that definition for the purpose of
excluding certain offenders from the imposition of conditional sentences. In
interpreting the definition for this purpose, some courts reasoned that the
context of s. 742.1  called for a different interpretive approach: see, for
example, Lebar; R. v. Goulet, 2011 ABCA 230, 52 Alta. L.R.
(5th) 241. I mention this in passing because, although some of the SPIO
jurisprudence was developed in that context, the definition of an SPIO is no
longer relevant to the imposition of such sentences and must therefore be
interpreted solely in the context of its role in the dangerous and long-term
offender scheme. 

[54]                         
Mr. Steele relies heavily, as did the Court of
Appeal, on contextual arguments and the corresponding principles of statutory
interpretation, and in particular on the presumption against tautology and the
presumption of consistent expression. I must address the following arguments: 
First, it is argued that the words “conduct . . . inflicting or
likely to inflict severe psychological damage” in subpara. (a)(ii) of
the definition of an SPIO would be redundant if the words “use or attempted use
of violence” in subpara. (a)(i) are not interpreted narrowly. Second,
according to the Court of Appeal, the fact that robbery is excluded from the
offences enumerated in para. (b) of the definition of an SPIO indicates
that not every robbery is an SPIO. Third, the Court of Appeal stated that
because the definition of robbery in s. 343(a) refers to the use of both
violence and threats of violence, there must be some difference between the two
and that, in light of the presumption of consistent expression, the reference
to the use of violence in the definition of an SPIO therefore excludes threats
of violence. With respect, I disagree with each of these arguments, for the
following reasons.  

(1)        
Subparagraph (a)(ii) of the Definition of
an SPIO in Section 752 

[55]                         
Subparagraph (a)(ii) of the definition of
an SPIO refers to “conduct endangering or likely to endanger the life or safety
of another person or inflicting or likely to inflict severe psychological
damage on another person”. Mr. Steele argues that if subpara. (a)(i) of
the definition is interpreted more broadly, it would apply to less serious
instances of the very conduct to which subpara. (a)(ii) applies, thereby
rendering the “severe psychological damage” portion of the definition
redundant. If this argument is taken a step further, it might be argued that
subpara. (a)(ii) targets violent activity on the basis of its harm or
effects — i.e. danger to life or safety or severe psychological damage —
whereas subpara. (a)(i) targets violent activity on the basis of the
force that was applied — i.e. use or attempted use of violence. 

[56]                         
With respect, after considering the relationship
between subparas. (a)(i) and (a)(ii) of the definition, I am led
to the opposite conclusion. As a preliminary matter, there is no indication
that the various parts of the definition of an SPIO in s. 752  are mutually
exclusive: see R. v. J.Y. (1996), 141 Sask. R. 132 (C.A.), at para. 22.
On the contrary, I can think of many scenarios in which an offence causing the
harms outlined in subpara. (a)(ii) would clearly also involve “the use
or attempted use of violence”. The same can be said about para. (b) of
the definition, which lists a number of sexual offences to include them in the
definition of an SPIO. The offences enumerated in para. (b) will of
course often also meet the qualitative criteria of subparas. (a)(i) and
(a)(ii). The fact that a proposed interpretation would bring some
offences within the ambit of more than one part of the definition in s. 752 
should not, in itself, justify narrowing the definition to avoid such overlaps.


[57]                         
Furthermore, to the extent that redundancy is a
problem in the case at bar, I would suggest that the Court of Appeal’s
interpretation of subpara. (a)(i) adds to the redundancy rather than
reducing it. By confining the expression “use or attempted use of violence” to
physical action or danger, the Court of Appeal has rendered it largely
indistinguishable from the expression “conduct endangering or likely to
endanger the life or safety of another person” in subpara. (a)(ii). The
Court of Appeal held that there must be “some degree of physical action” for a
threat to amount to an attempted use of violence: “[T]here needs to be some
indication of imminent apparent danger to a person or some overt act directed
towards the actual use of violence against a person for a threat of violence to
also constitute the attempted use of violence” (para. 85). Scott C.J.M.
endorsed the reasoning in Thompson, in which a similar distinction was
made between violent and non-violent threats on the basis of proximity to the “actual
perpetration of violence” (para. 77). With respect, this interpretation
artificially limits the ordinary harm-based meaning of the “violence” concept
in subpara. (a)(i) and transforms that provision into a replication of
the dangerousness portion of subpara. (a)(ii). As Bastarache J. stated
in C.D., “[t]he fact that violent conduct is different from dangerous
conduct is made quite clear in . . . s. 752 ” (para. 79). 

[58]                         
I agree that the effect of my interpretation
will be to include certain offences causing less-than-severe psychological
damage within the scope of subpara. (a)(i). However, this does not
render the reference to “severe psychological damage” in subpara. (a)(ii)
redundant. In other words, the endangerment and severe psychological damage
referred to in subpara. (a)(ii) do not merely form a narrower subset of
“the use or attempted use of violence”. In my view, the two provisions are
qualitatively different owing, in part, to the required level of intent. 
Subparagraph (a)(i) concerns violent acts — “the use or attempted use of
violence” — and requires violent intent on the offender’s part. This part of
the definition will apply to an offender who intentionally causes,
attempts to cause or threatens to cause harm. Threats are included by virtue of
the speaker’s intent that they be taken seriously.  Subparagraph (a)(ii),
on the other hand, relates solely to the effects of conduct. It does not refer
to violence in general, or even to intent. Thus, numerous courts have properly
included offences involving negligence — for example, dangerous operation of a
motor vehicle, vessel or aircraft causing bodily harm (s. 249(3) ) — within the
scope of subpara. (a)(ii) on the basis that they caused one of the
effects in question: see, e.g., Cepic; R. v. O’Keefe, 2011 NLCA
41, 309 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 253. Conversely, although I will not decide this
issue, I would have difficulty concluding that a negligence-based offence
involves “the use or attempted use of violence”. 

[59]                         
I would note that in C.D., Bastarache
J. excluded offences for which bodily harm need merely be reasonably
foreseeable from the definition of “violent offence”. He reasoned: “. . . I do
not support the inclusion of a ‘reasonable foreseeability of bodily harm’
aspect in the definition of ‘violent offence’ because, in my view, whether
an offence is likely to result in bodily harm is really a question of whether
the offence is dangerous rather than whether it is violent, and these two
concepts are quite distinct from one another” (para. 79 (emphasis added)).
He relied on s. 752  in support of this proposition. 

[60]                         
In conclusion, a harm-based approach to subpara.
(a)(i) according to which threatening violence constitutes a form of use
of violence is not inconsistent with the endangerment and psychological damage
aspects of the definition in subpara. (a)(ii). 

(2)        
Paragraph (b) of the Definition

[61]                         
I have already briefly addressed the argument
that the exclusion of robbery from the offences listed in para. (b) of
the definition is relevant to the determination of legislative intent. With
respect, this argument is based on two false premises. First, robbery may be
committed by way of threats of violence to property and such threats are
clearly excluded from the definition of an SPIO, which means that Parliament
could not have categorically defined robbery as an SPIO even if it considered
the threats to be violent. Second, Parliament identified three sexual offences
each of which categorically qualifies as an SPIO in para. (b). There is
no indication that Parliament intended to create an exhaustive list of all
offences constituting SPIOs in all cases. Rather, as this Court stated in Currie,
para. (b) serves to make it clear that the enumerated sexual
offences, whatever form they may take, are inherently serious and may trigger a
dangerous offender application (para. 22).   

[62]                         
The reason why Parliament included a list of
sexual offences is surely not that sexual offences are not otherwise covered by
the expression “use or attempted use of violence”. The more reasonable view is
that Parliament included the list to make it clear that such offences will
constitute SPIOs in all circumstances, even those that are committed with
minimal physical force and that do not result in bodily harm. Furthermore, the
view that Parliament, in enacting para. (b) of the definition, was
rejecting a narrow approach that might exclude some sexual offences is
consistent with my interpretation of subpara. (a)(i), which rules out a
similarly narrow approach in the context of threats of violence. 

(3)        
Section 343(a)

[63]                         
The Court of Appeal relied heavily on the need
for consistency in the interpretation of s. 343(a) and subpara. (a)(i)
of the definition of an SPIO in s. 752 . This argument is appealing at first
glance. It can be summarized as follows: Section 343(a) refers to the
use of violence and the use of threats of violence. Subparagraph (a)(i)
of the definition refers to the use of violence and the attempted use of
violence. Threats of violence are not mentioned in subpara. (a)(i). If
s. 343(a) is read disjunctively, there must be some difference between
the use of violence and the use of threats of violence. As a result, the
question is whether the expression “uses . . . threats of violence”
in s. 343(a) is equivalent to the expression the “attempted use of violence”
in subpara. (a)(i) of the definition. The Court of Appeal cited the
presumption that the use of different language suggests that the legislature
intended different meanings and the principle that the same words have the same
meaning throughout a statute. 

[64]                         
With respect, I find this argument to be an
overly technical one that fails to take into account the full context in which
the expressions “uses violence” and “use of violence” appear in the two
provisions. First, the argument is based on a strictly disjunctive reading of
the words “uses violence or threats of violence” in s. 343(a) that
suggests that the expressions “violence” and “threats of violence” have
different meanings. But in s. 343(b), the list “wounds, beats, strikes
or uses any personal violence” is clearly not disjunctive — the words “uses any
personal violence” encompass the other acts in the list. In my view, the
contextual information from s. 343(b) suggests that Parliament may well
have included threats of violence in s. 343(a) as a way to make it clear
that threats of violence were to be included among the violent acts that would
be included in the definition of robbery (see Sullivan, at p. 214). 

[65]                         
Second, even a strictly disjunctive reading of
the words “uses violence or threats of violence” in s. 343(a) does not
lead inexorably to the conclusion that the expression “use . . . of
violence” in subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of an SPIO means the same
thing as “uses violence” in s. 343(a). The two provisions are in
unrelated parts of the Criminal Code , and they have distinct purposes
and legislative histories. As Ruth Sullivan notes, “[s]ome statutes, like Insurance Acts or the Criminal
Code , are frequent[ly] amended decade after decade. It is not surprising,
then, that inadvertent variations occur within a single Act. It is even more
likely that they would occur within the statute book as a whole” (p. 222). If s. 343(a) were to be interpreted disjunctively, the use of
violence would have to be understood as the use of physical violence in
order to exclude threats of violence from the definition. As I mentioned above,
however, the meaning of the word “violence” is not limited to physical violence
everywhere it appears in the Criminal Code  or in other legislation. For
instance, as this Court stated in McRae (at para. 24), threats are
themselves “tools of intimidation and violence” in the context of s. 264.1(1) (a).
Thus, even if the word “violence” in s. 343 (a) is interpreted using a
force-based definition, that is, as meaning uses physical violence or
threats of physical violence, this need not preclude courts from
interpreting the same word in a contextually sensitive manner in subpara. (a)(i)
of the definition of an SPIO in s. 752 . 

[66]                         
In short, I find that threats of violence to a
person (and not threats to property) that are sufficient to ground a conviction
for robbery under s. 343(a) meet the “use . . . of violence”
criterion in subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of an SPIO in s. 752 .
This approach is consistent with the broader understanding of robbery as the
crime of theft committed with violence. 

D.          
Conclusion: Robbery Committed by Using Threats
of Violence to a Person is a Serious Personal Injury Offence

[67]                         
Not all robberies are SPIOs. Robbery committed
by using violence or a threat of violence to property is clearly
excluded. Robbery committed by using violence to a person is clearly
included. In the case bar, in the context of a robbery committed by using a threat
of violence to a person, the trial judge and the Court of Appeal
attempted to draw a line. Although the Court of Appeal was not prepared to
conclude categorically that threats are not violent, it held that some, but not
all, threats are violent. Something more than a mere verbal threat is required:
“[T]here needs to be some indication of imminent apparent danger to a
person or some overt act directed towards the actual use of violence”
(para. 85 (emphasis added)).

[68]                         
I have rejected this view for the numerous
reasons given above. In short, a threat of violence is itself a form of
violence, and the respondent’s context-based arguments have not persuaded me to
depart from this premise in interpreting subpara. (a)(i) of the
definition of an SPIO. 

[69]                         
Finally, the Court of Appeal’s interpretation
would have undesirable consequences. In seeking to distinguish between violent
and non-violent threats, the Court of Appeal referred to a number of cases in
which courts have grappled with this very question. Threatening to “splat” the
clerk of a cheque cashing business (Thompson), raising a baseball bat in
a threatening manner in confronting two police officers (Roy), and
saying “[m]oney and cigarettes in the bag” while making an implied threat of
violence if this demand were not met (Jolicoeur, at para. 25), have all
been held not to satisfy the “use or attempted use of violence” criterion,
because they lacked the requisite physical act or danger. On the other hand, an
offender who had committed robbery by producing a knife and holding it close to
the victim satisfied the criterion despite the absence of physical injury (Lebar).
It would be possible to list other examples of cases in which trial judges have
endeavoured to distinguish violent from non-violent threats on the facts of the
cases before them. At the end of the day, however, I conclude that such an
exercise is not just difficult, but pointless. 

[70]                         
The Court of Appeal’s approach is inconsistent
with the principles of statutory interpretation I discussed above. It would
result in untold difficulties for trial judges seeking to establish the elusive
dividing line between threats that are inherently violent and those that are
not. Finally, in my view, it is incompatible with the plain meaning and the
purpose of the provision. All threats of violence are themselves violent, even
though the seriousness of the violence may be quite limited. In seeking to distinguish
violent from non-violent threats, courts are in effect reading in an objective
minimum level of violence. This is inconsistent with the clear language of
subpara. (a)(i) of the definition, which requires violence, not serious
violence, and it risks undermining the overall purpose of Part XXIV by
precluding courts from remanding potentially dangerous offenders for
assessment. 

[71]                         
When, in committing the robbery, Mr. Steele
threatened the cashiers by saying “I have a gun”, he used violence against another
person within the meaning of subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of an
SPIO. 

VI.       
Disposition

[72]                         
I would allow the appeal without costs. Mr.
Steele was convicted under s. 343(a) of robbery, an offence that
satisfies the criterion set out in subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of
a “serious personal injury offence” in s. 752 . Since the other requirements for
the Crown’s application for remand for an assessment have not been contested, I
would grant the application and order that Mr. Steele be remanded for assessment
pursuant to s. 752.1(1) .

                    The judgment
of the Court was delivered orally by 

[1]                             
Cromwell J. ― This
appeal as of right comes to us on the dissent of Berger J.A. in the Alberta
Court of Appeal. The question is whether the trial judge’s failure to identify
a s. 8  breach in addition to the admitted breach of s. 10 (b) justifies
considering the trial judge’s s. 24(2)  analysis afresh on appeal.

[2]                             
In our view it does not.  Assuming, without deciding, that there was a
s. 8  breach on these facts, it is clear that the trial judge conducted her s.
24(2)  analysis on the basis that the s. 10 (b) breach resulted in the
appellant producing the joint and lump of marihuana. As she put it, “While [the
police officer] gave evidence that she would have arrested Mr. Mohamed if he
had not got out of the car at her request, and I have found that she had
grounds to do so, it is not a certainty that the exhibits of marihuana would
have been discovered otherwise.  The production of the joint and the lump of
marihuana were clearly as a result of [the officer’s] prompting of Mr. Mohamed”
(A.R., vol. I, p. 57 (emphasis added)). It is thus clear that the trial judge’s
s. 24(2)  analysis would not have been different had she found an independent s.
8  breach.

[3]                             
In light of that conclusion, our view is that there is no basis to
interfere on appeal with the trial judge’s weighing of the various factors
under the s. 24(2)  analysis.

[4]                             
The appeal is dismissed.

                    Constitutional law — Charter of Rights  —
Search and seizure — Fundamental justice — Interception of communications —
Exemption from offence of disclosing intercepted private communication without
consent — Provision of Criminal Code  exempting disclosure of lawfully intercepted
private communication to person or authority with responsibility in a foreign
state for investigation or prosecution of offences if disclosure is intended to
be in the interests of the administration of justice in Canada or elsewhere —
Whether provision unjustifiably infringes s. 7  or 8  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 193(2) (e).

                    Criminal law —
Interception of communications — Disclosure of information — Exemption from
offence — Whether exemption provision which authorizes sharing of lawfully
obtained wiretap information between Canadian and foreign law enforcement
agencies is constitutional — Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, ss. 7 , 8 
— Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 193(2) (e).

                    The
RCMP lawfully intercepted private communications between W and others that
revealed a plot to transport drugs into the United States of America. The
wiretap information was disclosed to U.S. authorities, who used it to seize a
large quantity of ecstasy pills at a border crossing. The U.S. requested W’s
extradition. At the extradition hearing, W submitted that legislation
authorizing the disclosure violates ss. 7  and 8  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms , and the intercepted communications should not be
admitted as evidence. The extradition judge rejected W’s arguments and issued a
committal order. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal.

                    Held
(Abella, Cromwell and Karakatsanis JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be
dismissed.

                    Per
LeBel, Rothstein and Moldaver JJ.:  The ability to share information between law enforcement agencies
facilitates the effective investigation of domestic and multi-jurisdictional
crime. Part VI of the Criminal Code  sets out a comprehensive scheme intended
by Parliament to exclusively govern the interception and use of private
communications for law enforcement purposes. Therefore,
there is no need to consider the
constitutionality of s. 8(2) (f) of the Privacy Act. Section
193(2) (e) of the Criminal Code  is the governing provision in this
case. Although not structured as an explicit authorizing provision, it
implicitly authorizes cross-border disclosure of lawfully intercepted wiretap
information. Accordingly, the arguments raised by W properly go to the
constitutionality of s. 193(2) (e). 

                    Section 8  of the Charter  is
engaged. Although a disclosure is not a search within the meaning of s. 8 , s. 8 
protects wiretap targets at both the interception and disclosure stages under
Part VI of the Criminal Code . Wiretap interceptions are highly invasive and
pose heightened privacy concerns. There is a residual, albeit diminished,
expectation of privacy in wiretap information after it has been lawfully
collected. W’s s. 7  arguments need not be addressed. They are subsumed under the s. 8  analysis.

                    In order for a search to be
reasonable under s. 8 , it must be authorized by law, the law itself must be reasonable,
and the search must be carried out in a reasonable manner. This same framework
applies, mutatis mutandis, to disclosures made pursuant to s. 193(2) (e).
Applying this framework to the facts at hand, there is no violation of s. 8 . The disclosure in this case was lawfully authorized by s. 193(2) (e),
and the legislation, taken as a whole, is reasonable. Furthermore, there is no
evidence that the manner of disclosure was unreasonable. 

                    With respect to the first step of
the s. 8  framework, the disclosure in this case was authorized by law. A
disclosure will be authorized by law where it is carried out in accordance with
the procedural and substantive requirements the law provides. Section 193(2) (e)
requires that the recipient must be a person or authority with responsibility
in a foreign state for the investigation or prosecution of offences, and the
disclosure must be intended to be in the interests of the administration of
justice in Canada or elsewhere. The disclosure in this case was provided to
U.S. law enforcement authorities for the purpose of foiling a cross-border drug
smuggling operation. In making the disclosure, Canadian authorities intended to
advance the administration of justice in Canada and the United States.

                    Turning to the second step, s.
193(2) (e) is a reasonable law. First, it is not unconstitutionally
overbroad. It limits the type of information that may be disclosed, the purpose for which it may
be disclosed, and the persons to whom it may be disclosed. Second, it is not
unconstitutionally vague. While “the administration of
justice” as used in s. 193(2) (e) is a broad concept, it is not one that
so lacks in precision as to give insufficient guidance for legal debate. In
this context, the phrase “the administration of justice” means that the
disclosure must be for a legitimate law enforcement purpose.

                    Third, s. 193(2)(e) is not
unconstitutional for lack of accountability or transparency mechanisms. Part VI of the Criminal
Code  contains numerous privacy safeguards. The judicial authorization relating to the
initial interception requires privacy interests to be balanced with the
interests of law enforcement. The interception of communications is also
subject to notice and reporting requirements. Additionally, accountability has
been built into the disclosure scheme itself. A disclosure that fails to comply
with s. 193(2) (e) can lead to criminal charges against the disclosing
party or result in the exclusion of improperly disclosed evidence at a
subsequent proceeding. This provides a powerful incentive for Canadian
authorities to comply with s. 193(2) (e). Finally, although not
constitutionally mandated in every case, adherence to international protocols
and the use of caveats or information-sharing agreements may be relevant in
determining whether a disclosure was intended to advance the administration of
justice, and therefore was authorized by s. 193(2) (e).

                    As
regards the third step of the s. 8  framework, the use of protocols, caveats, or
agreements may also be relevant to assessing whether the disclosure was carried
out in a reasonable manner. The
disclosure in this case was carried out in a reasonable manner. Nothing
suggests that the police acted unreasonably. However,
in different factual contexts, there may be significant potential dangers posed
by the disclosure of intercepted communications to foreign authorities. Where a disclosing party knows or should
have known that the information could be used in unfair trials, to facilitate
discrimination or political intimidation, or to commit torture or other human
rights violations, s. 8  requires that the disclosure, if permissible at all, be
carried out in a reasonable manner. In the most serious cases, s. 8  will forbid
disclosure. In other cases, information-sharing protocols or caveats may
sufficiently mitigate the risks. 

                    Per
McLachlin C.J.:  The only issue on this appeal is whether the disclosure of the
intercepted communications violated s. 8  of the Charter , and, if so,
whether the evidence should have been excluded under s. 24(2) . It is not
necessary to consider the constitutionality of s. 193(2)(e), s. 193(2)(b)
or the Privacy Act to answer that question. W has not shown an
infringement of his s. 8  rights. The individual whose communications are
lawfully intercepted under a valid and reasonably executed warrant cannot
complain that use of the information for law enforcement breaches his right to
privacy. This principle is not confined to the use of information in Canada.
Sharing the information for purposes of law enforcement does not violate s. 8 . Sections
7  and 8  of the Charter  protect against unreasonable uses of lawfully
intercepted information but in this case, where the information was disclosed
to U.S. authorities for law enforcement purposes, these residual concerns about
unreasonable use do not arise. W’s rights were not violated.

                    Section
193(2)(e) does not change this. It is not an authorizing
provision. It does not confer a power on Canadian authorities to share
information with foreign counterparts. The provision operates by exempting
officers from prosecution where they disclosed intercepted communications under
their common law powers. Section 193(1)  of the Criminal Code  makes it an
offence to disclose intercepted private communications without consent. Section
193(2)(e) is an exemption from that offence. It preserves the common law
power of law enforcement authorities to share lawfully obtained information for
purposes of law enforcement both domestically and abroad. The exception
prevents law enforcement officers from being convicted for using information
obtained under warrant for purposes of law enforcement. It is therefore
unnecessary to opine on the constitutionality of s. 193(2)(e). 

                    Per
Abella, Cromwell and Karakatsanis JJ. (dissenting):  Section 193(2)(e)
violates s. 8  of the Charter  in a manner that is not justified under s. 1 .
It permits disclosure of wiretapped information to foreign officials
without safeguards or restrictions on how the information may be used and
without accountability measures for this broad state power. Nothing restrains
foreign law enforcement officials from using this highly personal information
in unfair trials or in ways that violate human rights norms, from publicly
disseminating the information, or from sharing it with other states. The torture of Maher Arar in Syria provides a chilling example of
the dangers of unconditional information sharing. Section 8  requires that when
a law authorizes intrusions on privacy, it must do so in a reasonable manner. A
reasonable law must have adequate safeguards to prevent abuse. It must avoid intruding
farther than necessary. It must strike an appropriate balance between privacy
and other public interests. Section 193(2)(e) falls short on all three
counts. The permitted disclosure to foreign officials without safeguards
renders the Part VI wiretap regime of the Criminal Code  unconstitutional.
The appropriate remedy is to strike the words “or to a person or authority with
responsibility in a foreign state” from s. 193(2)(e). It is unnecessary
to consider the constitutionality of s. 8(2) (f) of the Privacy Act
or arguments with respect to s. 7  of the Charter . 

                    Balancing
the state’s interest in a search and the public interest in protecting privacy
involves asking what level of privacy protection we are entitled to expect.
International cooperation and information sharing are essential to law
enforcement. Canadian interests are served by appropriate information sharing
with other jurisdictions. Timely disclosure will often be critical in the
investigation of serious transnational crimes. However, when information is
shared across jurisdictional lines, safeguards that apply in domestic investigations
lose their force. Section 193(2)(e) does nothing to prevent the use of
disclosed information in proceedings which fail to respect due process and
human rights. The requirement of prior judicial authorization does not provide
sufficient protection against inappropriate future use. The failure to require
caveats on the use of disclosed information is unreasonable. Caveats or
standing agreements would not undermine the objectives of the wiretap scheme. They
are commonplace in international law enforcement cooperation and provide some
assurance that disclosed information will only be used in accordance with
respect for due process and human rights. 

                    For
a law to provide reasonable authority for a search or seizure, it must include
some mechanism to permit oversight of state use of the power. Accountability
mechanisms deter and identify inappropriate intrusions on privacy. None of the
safeguards in Part VI apply to disclosure to foreign officials. Improper or
hazardous information sharing is unlikely to come to light without record-keeping,
reporting or notice obligations. It is for Parliament to decide what measures
are most appropriate, but, at a minimum, the disclosing party should be
required to create a written record and to make the sharing known to the target
or to government.

                    The
infringement of s. 8  of the Charter  is not justified under s. 1 . The
objective of international cooperation in law enforcement is pressing and substantial, and disclosure of wiretap information is
rationally connected to that objective. However, s. 193(2)(e) as it is
presently drafted interferes with privacy to a greater extent than necessary. The
inclusion of accountability mechanisms and limits on subsequent use would cure
the constitutional deficiencies without undermining Parliament’s goals.

I.             
Introduction

[1]                             
The ability to share information between law
enforcement agencies, including lawfully intercepted wiretap information,
facilitates the effective investigation of both domestic and
multi-jurisdictional crime. But the effective investigation of crime must
proceed in accordance with the rights guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms . The main issue in this appeal is whether federal
legislation which authorizes the sharing of lawfully obtained wiretap
information between Canadian and foreign law enforcement agencies is
constitutional — specifically, whether the legislation falls short of the
constitutional standards mandated by the Charter . 

II.          
Background

[2]                             
Andrew Gordon Wakeling was the subject of a
Canadian drug investigation. Over the course of the investigation, the RCMP
lawfully monitored and recorded communications between Mr. Wakeling and others.
These communications revealed a plot to transport drugs across the Canada-U.S.
border. Canadian authorities provided this information to U.S. authorities (the
“Impugned Disclosure”), who used it to intercept and seize 46,000 ecstasy pills
at the International Falls, Minnesota border crossing on April 5, 2006.

[3]                             
The U.S. sought Mr. Wakeling’s extradition from
Canada for his involvement in the ecstasy shipment. At the extradition hearing,
Mr. Wakeling submitted that the legislation authorizing the Impugned Disclosure
was unconstitutional. Specifically, he argued that the provisions breach ss.  7 
and 8  of the Charter , and that the wiretap information provided to U.S.
law enforcement authorities should therefore not be admitted as evidence
against him.

[4]                             
The extradition judge, Ross J., rejected Mr.
Wakeling’s arguments and issued a committal order. That order was upheld by the
British Columbia Court of Appeal. Before this Court, Mr. Wakeling requests that
the committal order be quashed and that a new extradition hearing be held.

[5]                             
For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss Mr.
Wakeling’s appeal. 

III.       
Statutory Provisions

[6]                             
Section 193  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1985, c. C-46 , states:

193.
(1) Where a private communication has been intercepted
by means of an electro-magnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device without
the consent, express or implied, of the originator thereof or of the person
intended by the originator thereof to receive it, every one who, without the
express consent of the originator thereof or of the person intended by the
originator thereof to receive it, wilfully

 

(a)
uses or discloses the private communication or any part thereof or the
substance, meaning or purport thereof or of any part thereof, or

 

(b)
discloses the existence thereof,

 

is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.

 

(2)
Subsection (1) does not apply to a person who discloses a private communication
or any part thereof or the substance, meaning or purport thereof or of any part
thereof or who discloses the existence of a private communication

 

. . .

 

(b)
in the course of or for the purpose of any criminal investigation if the
private communication was lawfully intercepted;

 

. . .

 

(e) where disclosure is
made to a peace officer or prosecutor in Canada or to a person or authority
with responsibility in a foreign state for the investigation or prosecution of
offences and is intended to be in the interests of the administration of
justice in Canada or elsewhere; or

. . .

[7]                             
Section 8  of the Privacy Act, R.S.C.
1985, c. P-21 , states:

8. (1) Personal information under the control of a government

British Columbia Act  — , the government of a foreign state, an
international organization of states or an international organization
established by the governments of states, or any institution of any such
government or organization, for the purpose of administering or enforcing any
law or carrying out a lawful investigation;

 

. . .

[8]                             
Finally, ss. 7 and 8 of the Charter 
state:

7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person
and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the
principles of fundamental justice.

 

8. Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or
seizure.

Judicial History

A.          
Supreme Court of British Columbia, 2011 BCSC
165, 268 C.C.C. (3d) 295 (Ross J.)

[9]                             
At his extradition hearing, Mr. Wakeling
restricted his constitutional challenge to s. 193(2) (e) of the Criminal
Code  and s. 8(2) (f) of the Privacy Act . He made a variety
of broad and sweeping submissions in support of his contention that the
impugned provisions do not pass constitutional muster. 

[10]                         
Mr. Wakeling submitted that transparency,
accountability and the rule of law are principles of fundamental justice under
s. 7  of the Charter  and that the provisions in question are
unconstitutional because the disclosure they authorize does not comply with
these principles (trial judgment, at para. 42). He also argued that both
provisions breach s. 7  of the Charter  because they are vague and overbroad.
With respect to s. 193(2) (e), he submitted that it “provides virtually
unlimited discretion to law enforcement” to disclose wiretap communications and
he criticized the subjective nature of the test it employs (ibid., at
para. 99). He further submitted that the phrase “the interests of the
administration of justice . . . elsewhere” is “incapable of framing
legal debate within Canada” and that it does not have a “constant and settled
meaning” (ibid.). In his view, the effect of these uncertainties is that
decision-makers are given “unrestricted latitude . . . to disclose
intercepted private communications or the substance of the communications, and
to be exempt from the application of the offence provisions of Part VI” (ibid.).


[11]                         
With respect to s. 8  of the Charter , Mr.
Wakeling submitted that the Impugned Disclosure re-engaged s. 8  such that a second
judicial authorization was needed before the disclosure could occur. In this
regard, he submitted that his privacy interests at the disclosure stage were
the same as those he enjoyed at the interception stage and deserved the same
protection (trial judgment, at para. 68). Hence, he argued that a second
judicial authorization should be required prior to disclosure, and that the
provisions in question are unreasonable because they do not provide for this. 
He also submitted that the provisions are unreasonable because they do not
contain sufficient accountability mechanisms such as a police record-keeping
requirement, a requirement to report to Parliament about the disclosures, or an
obligation to provide notice of the disclosure to the person whose
communications were intercepted. Finally, he took issue with the fact that
Canadian authorities have little control over the subsequent use of the
disclosed information (para. 116). 

[12]                         
The extradition judge considered and rejected
all of Mr. Wakeling’s arguments. In her view, the constitutionality of s. 8(2) (f)
of the Privacy Act  did not need to be considered because s. 193(2) (e)
of the Criminal Code  “expressly governs disclosure of private
communications intercepted under Part VI of the Criminal Code  to foreign
law enforcement authorities” and “[t]he more general information sharing rules
in the Privacy Act  are subject to the specific provisions of [the Criminal
Code ]” (para. 21). 

[13]                         
Turning to Mr. Wakeling’s constitutional
arguments, the extradition judge concluded that the Impugned Disclosure did not
re-engage s. 8  of the Charter , as the Impugned Disclosure was “not
conduct that interferes with a reasonable expectation of privacy in the
circumstances” (para. 75). Thus, the disclosure did not amount to “a search or
seizure that engages s. 8  of the Charter ” (ibid.). In the
alternative, she reasoned that if the Impugned Disclosure engaged s. 8,
s. 193(2)(e) is a reasonable law.

[14]                         
The extradition judge also rejected Mr.
Wakeling’s submission that transparency and accountability are principles of
fundamental justice that apply to s. 193(2) (e). In her view, “[e]ven if
these concepts could be characterized as principles of fundamental justice in
some contexts, they could not realistically be applied to the manner in which
police investigate criminal activity” (para. 48).

[15]                         
The extradition judge similarly rejected Mr.
Wakeling’s submission that s. 193(2) (e) is vague and overbroad, noting
that

in making
the arguments on vagueness and overbreadth that he does, the applicant demands
a level of drafting precision from Parliament that is neither constitutionally
mandated, nor realistic. By necessity, the wording of s. 193(2) (e) had to be
kept fairly broad to capture the myriad of ways in which a need to disclose “in
the interests of the administration of justice” might arise. The law must
retain flexibility since laws must of necessity govern a variety of different circumstances
and situations. [para. 108]

[16]                         
Lastly, the extradition judge rejected Mr.
Wakeling’s rule of law argument. Relying on this Court’s decision in British
Columbia v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2005 SCC 49,
[2005] 2 S.C.R. 473, she found Mr. Wakeling’s submissions to be “circular,
since the measures are themselves embodied in the law” (para. 53). 

[17]                         
Having rejected Mr. Wakeling’s legal arguments,
the extradition judge considered the evidence and found that it was sufficient
to warrant his committal. 

B.           
British Columbia Court of Appeal, 2012 BCCA 397,
328 B.C.A.C. 174 (Low, Groberman and MacKenzie JJ.A.)

[18]                         
On appeal, Mr. Wakeling reiterated his challenge
to the constitutionality of s. 193(2) (e) of the Criminal Code  and
s. 8(2) (f) of the Privacy Act . The B.C. Court of Appeal, per
Low J.A., agreed with the extradition judge that s. 193(2) (e) was the
governing provision for the specific disclosure at issue. Hence, the court
found it unnecessary to consider the constitutionality of s. 8(2) (f) of
the Privacy Act . 

[19]                         
In addressing Mr. Wakeling’s s. 8  claim, Low
J.A. concluded that the state conduct did not interfere with any reasonable
privacy expectation to which Mr. Wakeling could lay claim. The court thus
rejected Mr. Wakeling’s s. 8  argument. As the Impugned Disclosure did not
re-engage s. 8  of the Charter , no second judicial authorization was
needed. 

[20]                         
Low J.A. similarly concluded that Mr. Wakeling’s
fundamental justice submissions pertaining to transparency and accountability
were without merit:

The impugned provision does not have to
be transparent by requiring prior notice and there is no need for a reporting
requirement of some sort after the fact.  The information gathered by lawful
electronic interception becomes law enforcement intelligence.  In my opinion,
it is no different than information obtained from a police informer or
information contained in documents that lawfully come into the hands of the
police.  If disclosure is in the interests of the administration of justice,
there is no need for prior judicial approval or for notice or for reporting.  Such
requirements would formalize and hamper the inter-jurisdictional investigation
of crime and sometimes the prevention of crime.  Control of the use of
lawfully-gathered police intelligence by foreign authorities is not practical
and would be presumptuous. What is practical and necessary for both crime
detection and crime prevention is the ability of police officers to lawfully
inform their counterparts in other jurisdictions about impending criminal
activity, as occurred in the present case, or past criminal activity. [para.
43]

[21]                         
Finally, the court rejected Mr. Wakeling’s
vagueness and overbreadth arguments, noting that “[t]he administration of
justice is a concept that is well understood and needs no clarification or
narrowing” (para. 44). In the result, the court dismissed the appeal. 

C.           
Issues

[22]                         
On appeal to this Court, Mr. Wakeling renews his
constitutional attack on s. 193(2) (e) of the Criminal Code  and s.
8(2) (f) of the Privacy Act , relying on the same arguments he made
below. He also raises for the first time, with leave of the Court, the
constitutionality of s. 193(2)(b) of the Code.  He maintains that
all of these provisions infringe his rights under ss. 7  and 8  of the Charter ,
and that the infringements are not justified under s. 1 .

V.          
Analysis

[23]                         
I propose initially to explain why this appeal
turns on the constitutionality of s. 193(2) (e) of the Criminal Code 
and not s. 193(2)(b) of the Code or s. 8(2) (f) of the Privacy
Act . I will then address Mr. Wakeling’s Charter  arguments as they
relate to s. 193(2) (e).

A.          
The Privacy Act  Does Not Apply 

[24]                         
The Privacy Commissioner of Canada, an
intervener, submits that contrary to the lower court decisions, the RCMP must
comply with both the Criminal Code  and the Privacy Act 
when disclosing intercepted private communications to a foreign state, as
“[n]othing in the Criminal Code  relieves the RCMP from their duty to
comply with the Privacy Act ” (factum, at para. 13). According to the
Privacy Commissioner, s. 193(2)(e) of the Criminal Code  “limits
the breadth of the criminal prohibition” set out in s. 193 , “[b]ut this
exemption neither authorizes a disclosure under the Privacy Act  nor is
itself a source of police power” (para. 14).

[25]                         
With respect, I do not agree. The federal Privacy
Act  is a statute of general application. Section 8(2) of the Act sets
out the circumstances in which personal information under the control of a
government institution may be disclosed. That section explicitly states that it
is “[s]ubject to any other Act of Parliament”. Therefore, prior to considering
the disclosure contemplated by s. 8(2) , it must first be determined whether
another Act of Parliament addresses the particular disclosure in issue. In this
case, the Impugned Disclosure (involving lawfully intercepted private
communications) is specifically addressed by another Act of Parliament —
the Criminal Code . 

[26]                         
Part VI of the Criminal Code  represents a
comprehensive scheme dealing with the interception of private communications.
The individual right to privacy stands in tension with our collective need for
effective law enforcement, and the safeguards layered into the wiretap
provisions show Parliament’s efforts to “reconcile these competing interests” (R.
v. Duarte, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 30, at p. 45). As noted by the extradition
judge,

Part VI . . . creates a
specific regime for the protection of privacy interests in relation to
intercepted communications by creating specific offences, setting out
procedures for authorized interception of private communications in the
investigation of specific crimes, and delineating the circumstances under which
intercepted communications may be disclosed. [para. 22] 

This level of detail and
specificity in Part VI indicates that Parliament intended this framework to be
the exclusive regime governing the interception and use of private
communications for law enforcement purposes.[1]


[27]                         
Section 193(2)(e) deals directly with the
issue at hand — namely, the cross-border disclosure of wiretap information.
Admittedly, s. 193(2) is not structured as an explicit authorizing provision.
Rather, it takes the form of a series of exemptions to the criminal offence
identified in s. 193(1) . Nonetheless, I am satisfied that it represents
Parliament’s attempt to regulate the disclosure of intercepted communications
and specify the circumstances in which such disclosures may lawfully be made.
Succinctly put, s. 193(2)(e) implicitly authorizes the disclosure of
wiretap information in accordance with the conditions prescribed therein. 

[28]                         
For these reasons, s. 193(2) (e) of the Criminal
Code , and not s. 8(2) (f) of the Privacy Act , is the
governing provision in this case. Accordingly, I need not consider the
constitutionality of s. 8(2) (f).

[29]                         
In concluding that s. 193(2) (e) is an
authorizing provision, I do not quarrel with the Chief Justice that, in
general, the police may look to the common law for authority to use the fruits
of a lawful search for legitimate law enforcement purposes, including
disclosures to foreign law enforcement agencies. However, adopting this
analysis in the wiretap context poses a problem. Finding that s. 193(2) (e)
is not an authorizing provision, but merely an exception to a criminal
offence, implies that none of the subparts of s. 193(2)  are authorizing
provisions, and that authorization for all of the listed disclosures must come
from some other source. This, however, does not accord with the Court’s recent
decision in Imperial Oil v. Jacques, 2014 SCC 66, [2014] 3 S.C.R.
287, in which the majority held that the exemptions in s. 193(2)  “give a person the right to disclose recordings that otherwise could
not be disclosed” (para. 43).[2] Therefore, in my view, s. 193(2) (e)
is properly read as an authorizing provision. 

B.           
Section 193(2) (b) Need Not Be Considered

[30]                         
As noted, Mr. Wakeling was granted leave to
challenge the constitutionality of s. 193(2) (b) of the Criminal Code 
before this Court. In contrast to s. 193(2) (e), which addresses the cross-border
disclosure of wiretap communications, s. 193(2) (b) authorizes the
disclosure of wiretap communications “in the course of or for the purpose of
any criminal investigation”.

[31]                         
Mr. Wakeling made only cursory mention of s.
193(2) (b) in argument. As his complaint is specific to the issue of
international, cross-border sharing of wiretap information for criminal law
purposes, it is properly considered under s. 193(2) (e). For that reason
— and the fact that Mr. Wakeling did not press s. 193(2) (b) in written
or oral argument — I see no need to address its constitutionality. 

C.           
Does the Impugned Disclosure Violate Section 8
of the Charter ?

(1)        
Is Section 8 Engaged?

[32]                         
Section 8 is typically invoked where police
perform a search or seizure and thereby infringe upon an individual’s
reasonable expectation of privacy. It is quite evident that the interception of
wiretap communications constitutes a search. However, the disclosure of
previously intercepted communications — which is what s. 193(2) (e)
implicitly authorizes — is not, in my view, a “search” within the meaning of s.
8. Therefore, as a preliminary matter, it is important to clarify precisely how
s. 8 is engaged in the present case. I now turn to that issue. 

[33]                         
Mr. Wakeling submits that s. 8 is engaged
because the disclosure of his intercepted communications pursuant to s. 193(2) (e)
amounted to a second search, such that a second judicial authorization was
necessary prior to the Impugned Disclosure. Absent such authorization, he
argues that the police violated his s. 8 rights.  

[34]                         
With respect, I disagree. As the intervener the
British Columbia Civil Liberties Association (“BCCLA”) observes, the plain
meaning of “search” does not include the disclosure of information by the
state. A disclosure is simply the communication to a third party of previously
acquired information. 

[35]                         
In sum, there was only one search that engaged
s. 8  of the Charter  on the facts of this case — the original lawful
interception of Mr. Wakeling’s private communications. For this reason, to
invoke s. 8 , the appellant must rely on some other analytical approach. 

[36]                         
The BCCLA frames the s. 8 analysis in a
different way. It submits that to the extent s. 193(2) (e) permits
disclosure of the fruits of a search, it forms “part of the context in which
courts must assess the reasonableness of the law authorizing the search”
(factum, at para. 3).

[37]                         
This submission warrants brief elaboration.
According to the BCCLA, s. 193(2)(e) is an integral part of a search
regime for wiretap interceptions set out in Part VI of the Criminal Code .
Like all laws authorizing searches, that regime — including any integral part
of that regime — must be reasonable in order to comply with s. 8  of the Charter .
Therefore, if s. 193(2) (e) is held to be unreasonable, this would taint
the overall regime for s. 8  purposes and render it unconstitutional. 

[38]                         
While I see some merit in the analytical
approach proposed by the BCCLA, my conclusion that s. 8 protects targets at
both the interception and disclosure stages under Part VI is more a
function of the special dangers associated with wiretaps. Parliament has
recognized that wiretaps pose heightened privacy concerns beyond those inherent
in other searches and seizures. Justice Karakatsanis describes (at para. 116)
the serious privacy implications of electronic surveillance, citing this
Court’s caution that “one can scarcely imagine a state activity more dangerous
to individual privacy” (Duarte, at p. 43). Given these implications, the
protections that Parliament has seen fit to fold into the wiretap regime
include s. 193  which provides that, other than for one of the delineated
purposes, the disclosure of wiretap information is not only unauthorized, it is
criminal. 

[39]                         
The highly intrusive nature of electronic
surveillance and the statutory limits on the disclosure of its fruits suggest a
heightened reasonable expectation of privacy in the wiretap context. Once a
lawful interception has taken place and the intercepted communications are in
the possession of law enforcement, that expectation is diminished but not extinguished.
This heightened and continuing expectation of privacy in the wiretap context is
further indication that s. 8 ought to apply to disclosures under Part VI. 

[40]                         
In sum, while I acknowledge the Chief Justice’s
concern that s. 193(2)(e) does not engage s. 8 simply by virtue of its
integral place in the search regime of Part VI, that is not the sole
reason — or indeed the main one — why I conclude that s. 8 is engaged in this
context. As I have emphasized, Parliament has recognized that wiretap
interceptions are an exceptional and invasive form of search, and it is
therefore perfectly appropriate, in my view, that s. 8 protections should
extend to wiretap disclosures by law enforcement. Furthermore, there is a
residual and continuing expectation of privacy in wiretap information that
persists even after it has been lawfully collected. Indeed, the Chief
Justice agrees that “residual privacy interests” remain at the time of
disclosure and that s. 8 protects against unreasonable uses of the information
by law enforcement (para. 95). I am therefore satisfied that s. 8 is properly
engaged.  

(2)        
The Analytical Framework Under Section 8 of the Charter 

[41]                         
In order for a search to be reasonable under s.
8  of the Charter , “[it] must be authorized by law, the law itself must
be reasonable, and the search must be carried out in a reasonable manner” (R.
v. Caslake, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 51, at para. 10; see also R. v.
Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p. 278). I reiterate that a disclosure is
not, standing alone, a “search” within the meaning of the Charter .
However, for the reasons outlined above, s. 8  is engaged. Therefore, in my
view, the s. 8  framework applies, mutatis mutandis, to disclosures made
by law enforcement pursuant to s. 193(2) (e) of the Criminal Code .
 

[42]                         
Following the approach outlined above, I will
address each step of the s. 8 framework independently: (1) whether the Impugned
Disclosure was authorized by law; (2) whether the law authorizing the Impugned
Disclosure is reasonable; and (3) whether the Impugned Disclosure was carried
out in a reasonable manner. 

(3)        
Was the Impugned Disclosure Authorized by Law?

[43]                         
For ease of reference, I repeat s. 193(2) (e):

(2)
Subsection (1) does not apply to a person who discloses a private communication
or any part thereof or the substance, meaning or purport thereof or of any part
thereof or who discloses the existence of a private communication

 

. . .

 

(e)
where disclosure is made to a peace officer or prosecutor in Canada or to a
person or authority with responsibility in a foreign state for the
investigation or prosecution of offences and is intended to be in the interests
of the administration of justice in Canada or elsewhere . . . 

[44]                         
A disclosure will be authorized by law where it
is “carried out in accordance with the procedural and substantive requirements
the law provides” (Caslake, at para. 12). Section 193(2) (e)
imposes two essential requirements. First, with respect to cross-border
disclosures, the recipient must be “a person or authority with responsibility
in a foreign state for the investigation or prosecution of offences”. Second,
the disclosure must be “intended to be in the interests of the administration
of justice in Canada or elsewhere”. 

[45]                         
Under the second requirement, the relevant
intention is that of the disclosing party. For the disclosure to be authorized
by law, that party must subjectively believe that the disclosure will advance
the interests of the administration of justice in Canada and/or the foreign
state. The belief must be honestly and genuinely held. The credibility of the
disclosing party’s expressed intent can be tested against objective facts.

[46]                         
The disclosure in this case was authorized by
law. No one contends otherwise. The intercepted communications were provided to
U.S. authorities for the purpose of foiling a cross-border drug smuggling
operation. When Canadian authorities shared information about the operation
with their American counterparts, they intended to advance the administration
of justice in Canada and the United States. The requirements under s. 193(2) (e)
were therefore satisfied.

(4)        
Is Section 193(2)(e) a Reasonable Law?

[47]                         
The parties’ submissions focus on the second
step of the s. 8 framework, that is the reasonableness of s. 193(2)(e).
They argue, and Justice Karakatsanis agrees, that this provision is
constitutionally deficient. I do not share that view. As I will explain, s.
193(2)(e) is a reasonable law. 

(a)         
Overview of the Parties’ Charter Challenges

[48]                         
Mr. Wakeling and the BCCLA raise a host of Charter 
arguments challenging the constitutionality of s. 193(2) (e). For the
sake of clarity, these arguments can be broken down into three distinct (though
somewhat overlapping) categories: (1) s. 193(2) (e) is unconstitutionally
overbroad; (2) s. 193(2) (e) is unconstitutionally vague; and (3) s. 193(2) (e)
is unconstitutional because it lacks accountability mechanisms. Viewed
individually and collectively, these arguments challenge the reasonableness of
the law authorizing the Impugned Disclosure. As such, they are properly
considered under the second step of the s. 8  framework.

(i)          
Overbreadth

[49]                         
The BCCLA’s main line of attack on s. 193(2)(e)
is that it creates an almost “limitless” scope for disclosure of private
intercepted communications. In failing to place reasonable, or indeed any
limits on disclosure, the provision effectively grants police untrammeled
discretion and is ripe for abuse by both domestic and foreign authorities. This
argument strikes me as very similar to Mr. Wakeling’s submission that s.
193(2)(e) is unconstitutionally overbroad and thus contravenes the
principles of fundamental justice in violation of s. 7  of the Charter . I
am of the view that both of these arguments can be dealt with together under
the reasonableness framework of s. 8 . To put it simply, a law that suffers from
overbreadth will necessarily be unreasonable.  

(ii)        
Vagueness

[50]                         
Mr. Wakeling argues that the language of s.
193(2)(e) is so vague as to be unworkable. He makes this argument under
s. 7  of the Charter , asserting that the phrase “in the interests of the
administration of justice” does not have a constant and settled meaning. Like
the argument on overbreadth, I believe that this argument can be disposed of
under s. 8 . A provision that is unconstitutionally vague will necessarily be
unreasonable. 

(iii)      
Accountability Mechanisms

[51]                         
Mr. Wakeling and the BCCLA submit that s.
193(2)(e) is unconstitutional since it is devoid of mechanisms to hold
authorities accountable for their disclosures of intercepted communications. In
particular, they are concerned that the provision lacks sufficient safeguards,
including judicial pre-authorization, notice and record-keeping requirements,
Parliamentary reporting, as well as international protocols and caveats
limiting the use of disclosed information.

[52]                         
Mr. Wakeling’s accountability argument goes
somewhat further than that of the BCCLA. He claims that accountability — and
the related value of transparency — are principles of fundamental justice under
s. 7 . I find it unnecessary to finally decide that issue. The accountability
concerns identified by Mr. Wakeling and the BCCLA are best dealt with under s.
8. As this Court’s decision in R. v. Tse, 2012 SCC 16, [2012]
1 S.C.R. 531, notes, accountability forms part of the reasonableness analysis
under s. 8. 

[53]                         
Having outlined the three categories of
objections to s. 193(2)(e), I will now address each of them in greater
depth.

(b)        
Is the Scope of Disclosure Authorized by Section
193(2)(e) Unconstitutionally Overbroad?

[54]                         
Both Mr. Wakeling and the BCCLA take issue with
the extent of disclosure that s. 193(2)(e) authorizes for substantially
similar reasons. Both submit that s. 193(2)(e) permits “near-limitless
disclosure of private communications intercepted by wiretap” (BCCLA factum, at
para. 3; see also A.F., at paras. 129-30).

[55]                         
With respect, I believe that Mr. Wakeling and
the BCCLA overstate the nature and extent of the disclosure contemplated by s.
193(2)(e). A law may be broad without suffering from overbreadth. While
the provision authorizes a wide scope of disclosure, it does not permit
“near-limitless” disclosure of lawfully intercepted communications. On the
contrary, it limits the type of information that may be disclosed, the purpose
for which it may be disclosed, and the persons to whom it may be disclosed. 

[56]                         
Second, the BCCLA notes that the provision
allows disclosure where it is intended to be “in the interests of the
administration of justice in Canada or elsewhere” and submits that the
use of the word “or” means that disclosure could be in the sole
interests of the foreign state, and not Canada’s. According to the
BCCLA, “it is never reasonable to disclose an intercepted private communication
to a foreign state when to do so is only in the foreign state’s interests and
not Canada’s” (factum, at para. 33).

[57]                         
With respect, I reject this line of thinking.
Multi-jurisdictional cooperation between law enforcement authorities furthers
the administration of justice in all of the jurisdictions involved. It
must not be forgotten that Canada is often on the receiving end of
valuable information from foreign law enforcement authorities. The language of
s. 193(2)(e) appropriately captures the reciprocity inherent in this
practice. 

[58]                         
Third, the BCCLA submits that “on its face, s.
193(2)(e) permits disclosure even to support torture, or to prosecute an
offence in a foreign state that violates Canadian constitutional norms or
international law, provided only that someone intends that disclosure to
be in the interests of the administration of justice somewhere” (factum,
at para. 10 (emphasis in original)). It also contends that s. 193(2)(e)
“opens the door to disclosures to foreign states that are motivated by Canadian
authorities’ political, financial, personal, or other interests, as long as the
foreign state’s intention relates to the interests of its
administration of justice” (ibid., at para. 13 (emphasis in original)).

[59]                         
Once again, I disagree. Under s. 193(2)(e),
it is the disclosing party’s intention that matters. The provision
requires that the disclosing party must subjectively believe that disclosure
will further the interests of justice in Canada and/or the foreign state. The
belief must be an honest one, genuinely held. If the disclosing party’s
subjective belief is challenged, the reviewing judge may look at objective
indicators in deciding whether the disclosing party is to be believed.
Measuring the stated belief against objective facts is an accepted way of
separating beliefs that are honestly and genuinely held from those that are
not. 

[60]                         
A disclosing party who knows little or nothing
about the justice system in the foreign state or who does not know how or for
what purpose the foreign state intends to use the information will have a hard
time satisfying a court that he or she genuinely believed that disclosure would
further the interests of the administration of justice. The same holds true for
a disclosing party who knows or has reason to believe that the information will
be used to commit torture or other human rights violations, or for someone who
has sent the information for personal or partisan reasons. That a disclosing
party may have his or her credibility tested against objective indicators
incentivizes that person to proceed cautiously when disclosing information to a
foreign state. Given these limitations inherent in s. 193(2)(e), I am
not persuaded that the provision grants police a “limitless” power to
disclose.  

(c)         
Is Section 193(2)(e) Unconstitutionally Vague?

[61]                         
I will now address Mr. Wakeling’s objection that
s. 193(2)(e) is unconstitutionally vague. He contends that the phrase
“where disclosure . . . is intended to be in the interests of the
administration of justice in Canada or elsewhere” is “unworkable” because “the
decision maker would be required to have a full appreciation and understanding
of the laws of the country which will receive the disclosure” (A.F., at para.
126). He also argues that “the administration of justice” does not have a constant
and settled meaning (para. 129).

[62]                         
Like the extradition judge and the Court of
Appeal, I would not give effect to these submissions. This Court in R. v.
Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 606, stated that “a law
will be found unconstitutionally vague if it so lacks in precision as not to
give sufficient guidance for legal debate” (p. 643). Section 193(2)(e)
does not offend in this regard. It sets out who must intend that the
disclosure be in the interests of the administration of justice (the person
disclosing the information) and to whom the information may be disclosed
(to a peace officer or prosecutor in Canada or to a person or authority with
responsibility in a foreign state for the investigation or prosecution of
offences). Moreover, while “the administration of justice” is a broad concept,
it is not one that so lacks in precision as to give insufficient guidance for
legal debate. As Borins Co. Ct. J. in R. v. Samson (1982), 37 O.R. (2d)
237, explained:

. . . “administration of justice”,
with particular reference to the criminal law, is a compendious term that
stands for all the complexes of activity that operate to bring the substantive
law of crime to bear, or to keep it from coming to bear, on persons who are
suspected of having committed crimes. It refers to the rules of law that govern
the detection, investigation, apprehension, interviewing and trial of persons
suspected of crime and those persons whose responsibility it is to work within
these rules. The administration of justice is not confined to the courts; it
encompasses officers of the law and others whose duties are necessary to ensure
that the courts function effectively. The concern of the administration of
justice is the fair, just and impartial upholding of rights, and punishment of
wrongs, according to the rule of law. [pp. 246-47]

In the context of s. 193(2)(e),
the phrase “the administration of justice” means that disclosure must be for a
legitimate law enforcement purpose, such as the prevention of cross-border drug
trafficking. It is not unconstitutionally vague.  

(d)        
Is Section 193(2)(e) Unconstitutional for Lack
of Accountability Mechanisms?

[63]                         
Mr. Wakeling and the BCCLA also make a variety
of submissions pertaining to accountability and the related value of transparency.
They take issue with the fact that s. 193(2)(e) contains no
record-keeping requirement, nor any requirement that would “attempt to
constrain the foreign state’s use and dissemination of the communications”
(BCCLA factum, at para. 2). The essence of these arguments is that s. 193(2)(e)
inadequately protects the privacy interests at stake and that, absent
procedural requirements such as notice to the target of the disclosure,
protocols or international agreements, police record keeping, and Parliamentary
reporting, s. 193(2)(e) is unconstitutional.  

[64]                         
In making these arguments, Mr. Wakeling and the
BCCLA rely on Tse, where the constitutionality of s. 184.4  of the Criminal
Code  was in issue. That provision permitted peace officers to intercept
certain private communications without judicial authorization if an officer
believed, on reasonable grounds, that the interception was immediately
necessary to prevent an unlawful act that would cause serious harm. In striking
it down, this Court held that “s. 184.4  falls down on the matter of
accountability because the legislative scheme does not provide any mechanism
to permit oversight of the police use of this power” (para. 11 (emphasis
added)). 

[65]                         
In my opinion, Tse is distinguishable
from the present case. First, the statutory scheme at issue in Tse
contained no accountability measures. As I will explain, that is not the
case with s. 193(2)(e). 

[66]                         
Second, the impugned provision in Tse
involved warrantless searches and seizures. Accountability measures,
including after-the-fact notice and reporting requirements, are of particular
importance in that context. The emergency wiretap provision, by its very
nature, allows the police to conduct a warrantless search in exigent
circumstances. No balancing of interests before a judge occurs. In contrast,
Mr. Wakeling’s private communications were intercepted pursuant to a judicial
authorization. Issuing the authorization required the judge to balance Mr.
Wakeling’s privacy interests with the interests of law enforcement. A variety
of procedural safeguards were adhered to. Unlike an emergency wiretap
situation, Mr. Wakeling’s privacy interests were afforded significant
protection at the interception stage.

[67]                         
Section 193(2)(e) must be considered in
context. In my view, it is inappropriate “to seize upon individual sections of
[the wiretap scheme] and to see if those sections, viewed in isolation,
contravene the provisions of the Charter ” (R. v. Finlay (1985),
52 O.R. (2d) 632 (C.A.), at p. 653). Rather, the proper approach is to consider
the “provisions and the safeguards contained therein in their entirety” (ibid.).
Section 193(2) (e) is part of a unique statutory scheme that contains
numerous privacy safeguards, including notice and reporting requirements.
Pursuant to s. 196(1)  of the Criminal Code , an individual who has been
wiretapped must be provided with written notification within three months of
the time the authorization was given or renewed, subject to judicially
authorized extensions. These extensions may be authorized, for instance, where
providing notice to the suspect would derail an ongoing police investigation. 

[68]                         
While Parliament could perhaps, as a matter of
policy, require a second notice relating specifically to a s. 193(2)(e)
disclosure, there are inherent difficulties with such a requirement. In order
to decide whether to apply for an extension of time in providing notice of
disclosure, Canadian authorities would have to keep abreast of all foreign
investigations involving the disclosed information. Without such knowledge, it
would be impossible for them to know whether providing notice of the disclosure
to the suspect would derail or otherwise compromise a foreign investigation. 

[69]                         
To require Canadian authorities to stay on top
of all foreign investigations that involve the disclosed information is surely
unreasonable. It would be highly burdensome, if not entirely impractical. In my
view, the absence of a requirement to provide a second notice does not render
the wiretap regime unconstitutional.   

[70]                         
As noted, the existing notice requirements
contained in Part VI of the Criminal Code  ensure that all individuals
who have been wiretapped are provided with notice of this fact. Once notified,
individuals may wish to know whether their intercepted communications have been
disclosed to a foreign authority. An individual may make a request pursuant to
the applicable access to information statute in an effort to obtain this
information. Justice Karakatsanis correctly notes that such efforts may not
always be successful, depending on the details of the applicable access to
information regime and the individual’s circumstances. I express no view on
whether a guaranteed right of access to this information would be advisable —
only that it is not constitutionally required.

[71]                         
As for Parliamentary reporting, the Minister of
Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness must prepare an annual report to
Parliament on the use of electronic surveillance pursuant to s. 195  of the Criminal
Code . Once again, Parliament could require that disclosures made under s.
193(2) (e) be included in an annual report. But that is a policy
decision, and it is important that this Court separate policy matters from
constitutional imperatives — especially in this context where international
relations are involved. As this Court stated in Tse, a reporting
requirement to Parliament is not a constitutional imperative (para. 89). 

[72]                         
Contrary to the submissions of Mr. Wakeling and
the BCCLA, s. 193(2)(e) is not devoid of accountability measures.
Rather, accountability has been built into the scheme for the disclosure of
wiretap communications. Section 193(1)  provides a powerful incentive for
Canadian authorities to comply with the dictates of s. 193(2)(e). The
failure to do so can lead to criminal charges against the disclosing party or
result in the exclusion of the improperly disclosed evidence at a subsequent
proceeding in Canada. The possibility of criminal sanction or the loss of
important evidence creates an incentive to maintain records about what
information was disclosed, to whom, and for what purpose. Indeed, according to
the evidence of the Deputy Commissioner of Canada West, Gary David Bass, who
testified with respect to certain RCMP practices and procedures, the RCMP have
a number of internal record-keeping policies that apply to the cross-border
sharing of information.

[73]                         
While police record keeping is not, in my view,
constitutionally required for disclosures made under s. 193(2)(e), I
should not be taken as discouraging the practice. Likewise, these reasons are
not intended to discourage Parliament from instituting reporting requirements
or establishing international agreements between Canada and foreign states to
address cross-border disclosure of wiretap communications. The record at hand
indicates that many agreements are in place between law enforcement agencies.
The record also shows that information is often disclosed with caveats as to
its subsequent use. 

[74]                         
Although not constitutionally mandated,
adherence to international protocols and the use of caveats or information-sharing
agreements may be highly relevant in determining whether a given disclosure was
authorized by law under s. 193(2)(e). These objective indicators may
assist a court in assessing whether disclosure was genuinely intended to
advance the interests of the administration of justice. Moreover, as I discuss
below in reference to the third step of the s. 8 framework, they will also
impact on whether the manner of disclosure is found to be reasonable. 

[75]                         
In considering the possible accountability and
transparency mechanisms that Parliament could enact, certain realities cannot
be ignored. Even where the information is disclosed to a foreign state with a
legal system much like our own, once the information is in the hands of the
foreign state, its use will, for the most part, be beyond our purview. Such is
a defining feature of state sovereignty. Caveats on disclosure and
information-sharing protocols may be desirable, and they may be relevant to
evaluating whether a disclosure is intended to be in the interest of the
administration of justice (as required at the first step of the s. 8 analysis)
or is carried out reasonably (as required at the third step). However, they are
not constitutionally required in every case, nor would they be a panacea if
they were — certainly not standard-form agreements or caveats accompanying
every disclosure, as Justice Karakatsanis’s proposal would likely generate.
There is always a risk that a foreign law enforcement agency may misuse
the information disclosed to it under s. 193(2)(e). This risk can never
be entirely eliminated, regardless of the nature and extent of the procedural
safeguards in place in Canada, and it must not be allowed to undermine the
vital interests served by the detection and prosecution of multi-jurisdictional
crime. In this regard, I re-emphasize that Canada is frequently on the receiving
end of such disclosures — and Canadians are safer for it. 

[76]                         
 I do not gainsay the possibility that a foreign
law enforcement agency could misuse the information provided to it by Canadian
authorities. In such cases, there are certain avenues Canada may pursue where
the subsequent use of information disclosed to a foreign state offends our own
notions of justice. For example, where the disclosed information is being used
to seek the extradition of an individual who faces a realistic prospect of
torture or other human rights violations in a foreign country, Canada can
refuse the extradition request to avoid a manifest violation of the Charter .
Likewise, if the information in question is found to have been unlawfully
obtained, its use in an extradition proceeding — or in any other legal venue —
could be challenged. In other contexts, Canada could exert pressure through
diplomatic channels. There are various ways that Canada pursues its objectives
on the international stage — founded on the principles of comity and state
sovereignty — which may have application in a particular case. 

[77]                         
It bears emphasizing that this Court’s task is
not to determine whether there may be better or additional accountability
measures or stricter language that could be put in place with respect to the
cross-border disclosure of wiretap communications. Any attempt to micromanage
Parliament in this context must be approached with great care. The task at hand
is to determine whether s. 193(2)(e) passes constitutional muster. As
discussed, there are a number of accountability measures contained within Part
VI and within s. 193(2)(e) itself, and the scope of the disclosure
contemplated by s. 193(2)(e) is, in my view, entirely reasonable. For
these reasons, I conclude that the impugned legislation does not fall short of
the constitutional standards mandated by s. 8  of the Charter .

(5)        
Was the Impugned Disclosure Carried Out in a
Reasonable Manner?

[78]                         
Having determined that s. 193(2)(e) is a
reasonable law and that it was complied with in this case, the remaining
inquiry is whether the manner of the Impugned Disclosure was
unreasonable, and therefore violates s. 8  of the Charter . Nothing in the
record suggests that the police acted unreasonably in disclosing Mr. Wakeling’s
intercepted communications to U.S. authorities. Neither the Chief Justice nor
Justice Karakatsanis suggest otherwise. Common sense would suggest that
similarly unremarkable and entirely reasonable instances of law enforcement
cooperation to combat cross-border criminal activity occur on a daily basis
between Canadian and U.S. authorities. Saddling police with the obligation of
imposing boilerplate caveats on even the most routine disclosures poses an
unnecessary burden. It would do little to safeguard the interests protected by
s. 8  while impeding legitimate law enforcement operations.

[79]                         
Nothing further is needed to dispose of the
instant case. However, in different factual contexts, there may be significant
potential dangers posed by the disclosure of intercepted communications to
foreign authorities. Given these dangers, a broader discussion of the third
step of the s. 8 framework is warranted. 

[80]                         
Where a disclosing party knows or should have
known that the information could be used in unfair trials, to facilitate
discrimination or political intimidation, or to commit torture or other human
rights violations — concerns rightly expressed by Justice Karakatsanis — s. 8
requires that the disclosure, if permissible at all, be carried out in a
reasonable manner. In the most serious examples, where there are no steps that
could be taken to mitigate the danger, s. 8 forbids disclosure entirely. I
should emphasize that this inquiry as to the manner of disclosure is distinct
from whether disclosure would be authorized by law pursuant to s. 193(2)(e)
— although, as a practical matter, the two inquiries may overlap. For example,
where the risks are so great that there is no manner of disclosure that
would be objectively reasonable, a disclosing party would find it difficult to
prove that he or she believed that the disclosure was “in the interests of the
administration of justice” under any plausible meaning of that term. 

[81]                         
In other cases, a disclosure could be reasonably
carried out where the use of information-sharing protocols or the imposition of
caveats would sufficiently mitigate the risks. An example may be useful to
illustrate this point. Suppose that Canadian authorities know or ought to know
that a foreign government, to which they are contemplating a disclosure, may
pass on the information to a third country that could exploit it to harm a
Canadian citizen. In that context, the failure to include a caveat limiting
subsequent use of the disclosed information, even where the disclosing party
intended to further the administration of justice, might render the disclosure
unreasonable under s. 8. In such cases, therefore, the existence of appropriate
safeguards will play a crucial role in determining the constitutionality of a
challenged disclosure. It is by mandating appropriate safeguards on a
case-by-case basis, rather than inflexibly requiring them in all situations,
that a proper balance is struck between protecting against unreasonable
disclosures of private communications and facilitating the effective
investigation of domestic and multi-jurisdictional crime. 

VI.       
Conclusion

[82]                         
Inter-agency cooperation is critical to the
prevention, detection, and punishment of cross-border crime. Recognizing this,
Parliament has authorized the cross-border sharing of wiretap communications
under s. 193(2) (e) of the Criminal Code . The disclosure in this
case was lawfully authorized by that provision, and the legislation, taken as a
whole, does not violate s. 8  of the Charter . Furthermore, there is no
evidence that the manner of disclosure was unreasonable. Accordingly, I would
dismiss the appeal.

                    The following are
the reasons delivered by

[83]                         
The Chief
Justice — I have read the reasons of my colleagues Moldaver J. and
Karakatsanis J., who come to different conclusions about the constitutionality
of s. 193(2) (e) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , and
the measures that should be in place to govern sharing information obtained
under warrant with law enforcement agencies in other countries.

[84]                         
I approach the matter differently.  In my view,
the question on this appeal is whether Mr. Wakeling’s rights under s. 8  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  were violated.  The constitutionality of s.
193(2) (e) becomes an issue only if Mr. Wakeling can show that s. 193(2) (e)
infringed his s. 8  rights.  In my view, he has not shown this.  Accordingly, I
would dismiss the appeal.

I.         
Background

[85]                         
Moldaver J. has set out the facts and judicial
history of the case.  Briefly put, Mr. Wakeling was the subject of a Canadian
drug investigation.  In the course of the investigation, the RCMP obtained a
warrant to monitor communications between Mr. Wakeling and others.  The
communications revealed a plot to transport drugs across the Canada-U.S. border. 
The RCMP shared information obtained from the communications with U.S.
authorities, who used it to intercept and seize 46,000 ecstasy pills at the
International Falls, Minnesota border crossing.

[86]                         
The U.S. sought Mr. Wakeling’s extradition from
Canada to face charges arising from the seizure of the ecstasy pills.  At the
hearing, Mr. Wakeling argued that the RCMP’s disclosure of the information
obtained from the intercepted communications violated his rights under s. 8  of
the Charter  and that the evidence should not be admitted against him.

[87]                         
The extradition judge held that there was no
violation of Mr. Wakeling’s s. 8  rights, admitted the evidence, and issued a
committal order for extradition.  The British Columbia Court of Appeal dismissed
Mr. Wakeling’s appeal.

II.          
The Issue

[88]                         
The main — and in my view the only — issue on
this appeal is whether the RCMP’s disclosure of the intercepted communications
to U.S. authorities violated Mr. Wakeling’s s. 8  rights and, if so, whether the
evidence should have been excluded under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .

[89]                         
In my view, it is not necessary to consider the
constitutionality of s. 193(2) (e) of the Criminal Code  to answer
that question.  I agree with my colleagues that it is unnecessary to consider
the Privacy Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-21 , or s. 193(2) (b) of the Criminal
Code .

III.       
Analysis

[90]                         
Section 8  of the Charter  protects
individuals against unreasonable search and seizure.  It provides:

     Everyone has the right to be
secure against unreasonable search or seizure.

[91]                         
Section 8  protects the individual’s privacy
interest against unreasonable state intrusion.  Here, Mr. Wakeling has a
reasonable expectation of privacy in his communications with others.   In order
to obtain private information by intercepting communications, the state must
obtain a judicial warrant, which requires the state to demonstrate that there
are reasonable grounds to believe the interception will show evidence of a
crime.  (Circumstances where the state can intercept without a warrant
are not relevant here, e.g., s. 184.4  of the Criminal Code .)  Where such
grounds exist, the individual’s privacy interest in the intercepted
communication gives way to the state’s interest in law enforcement.

[92]                         
The warrant allows the police to obtain the
information and to use it for purposes of law enforcement.  The individual
whose communications are lawfully intercepted under a valid warrant cannot
complain that this unreasonably breaches his privacy.  To put it
metaphorically, a valid warrant sanitizes the state intrusion on privacy, as
long as the execution of the warrant is reasonable and the information is used
for purposes of law enforcement.

[93]                         
It has never been suggested that this principle
is confined to the use of information in Canada.  The reality is that crime
does not stop at national borders, and police routinely share information that
they have lawfully obtained under warrant with their counterparts in other
countries.  Provided information is shared for purposes of law enforcement, the
individual cannot complain that the sharing violates his s. 8  right to privacy.

[94]                         
This Court has found that s. 8  is violated in
cases where the information was seized in a context outside law
enforcement and then passed along for the purpose of law enforcement:  R. v.
Colarusso, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 20;  R. v. Law, 2002 SCC 10, [2002] 1
S.C.R. 227; and R. v. Cole, 2012 SCC 53, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 34.  In those
cases, the “sanitizing” effect of the warrant (or similar authorization
process) was absent; the individual’s privacy interest had not been balanced
against the state’s interest in law enforcement through judicial
pre-authorization.  Where, as here, that process has taken place, disclosure
for law enforcement purposes does not violate s. 8 .

[95]                         
Once information is obtained under warrant, s. 8 
protects against unreasonable uses of that information.  For example,
information obtained under warrant cannot be used for rendition to a foreign
country (the Maher Arar case discussed by Karakatsanis J.) or public
titillation.  Section 7  of the Charter  may also be engaged where
disclosure gives rise to a concern that the recipient country will use the
information to kill, torture or mistreat the target.  These concerns do not
arise on the facts of this case.  Where these residual privacy interests are infringed,
remedies may include prosecution of the disclosing officer under s. 193(1)  of
the Criminal Code  and remedies under s. 24(1)  of the Charter .

[96]                         
It follows that sharing information obtained
under warrant for law enforcement purposes with foreign law officers does not
violate s. 8 , absent the residual concerns just discussed.  Here, the
information was disclosed to the U.S. authorities for law enforcement purposes,
and none of the residual concerns arise.  It follows that Mr. Wakeling’s rights
were not violated, and his appeal must fail.

[97]                         
The question is whether s. 193(2) (e) of
the Criminal Code  changes this.  I do not think it does.  As I
state in Imperial Oil v. Jacques, 2014 SCC 66, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 287, at
para. 89, I am of the view that s. 193(2)  is not an authorizing provision.
Section 193(2) (e) does not confer a power on Canadian authorities to
share information obtained under warrant with foreign counterparts. Rather, it
operates by exempting officers from prosecution where they disclose intercepted
private communications under their common law powers.  Section 193(1) , the
offence provision, is intended to guard against the disclosure of intercepted
private communications by making it an offence to do so without the consent of
the individual concerned.  Section 193(2)  then lists a number of exemptions
from what otherwise would be an offence by virtue of s. 193(1) .  The exception
in s. 193(2) (e) demonstrates that the common law power to use
information obtained under warrant for law enforcement purposes is one of the
categories of disclosure protected from liability as an offence under s.
193(1) .  I agree with my colleague Moldaver J. when he says that “the
administration of justice” in s. 193(2) (e) refers only to use for
legitimate law enforcement purposes.  The provision therefore preserves the
common law power of law enforcement authorities to share lawfully obtained
information for purposes of law enforcement both domestically and abroad.  In a
nutshell, the exception prevents law enforcement officers from being convicted
for doing their job — using information obtained under warrant for purposes of
law enforcement.

[98]                         
It is therefore unnecessary to opine on the
constitutionality of s. 193(2) (e) of the Criminal Code .  To do so
invites speculation, as the eloquent reasons of my colleagues demonstrate:  one
says the current legislative scheme provision is unconstitutional, the other
says it is eminently reasonable.  We should not send Parliament back to the
legislative drawing board on the basis of hypothetical speculation, where it is
not established that the law infringes anyone’s s. 8  rights.

[99]                         
For the same reasons, I find it unnecessary to
consider the constitutionality of the Privacy Act .  Assuming without
deciding that the Privacy Act  applies, it permits the disclosure of
personal information for the purposes of law enforcement.  It is specifically
permitted under s. 8(2) (f)[3]
and more generally as a use consistent with the purpose for which the
information was obtained under s. 8(2) (a).[4]  As discussed, this
alone does not violate ss. 7  or 8 .

[100]                     
Much is made of the need — or the absence of
need — for measures to address the risk that information shared with law
enforcement agencies in other countries will be abused.  Mr. Wakeling and
supporting interveners argue that the exclusion in s. 193(2) (e) from the
offence for improper disclosure is too broad to provide adequate protection. 
The Crown and supporting Attorneys General, on the other hand, emphasize the
risks associated with bureaucratic restrictions on the international sharing of
information and argue that it would be unrealistic and unworkable in today’s
interconnected world.  These are difficult questions more redolent of policy
than of law.  Parliament has considered them and answered with the offence
provisions and exemptions of s. 193 .  In the absence of a demonstrated breach
of s. 8  rights flowing from those provisions, Parliament’s choice must be
allowed to stand, in my respectful opinion.

IV.       
Conclusion

[101]                     
I would dismiss the appeal and confirm the order
for committal of Mr. Wakeling.

                    The reasons of Abella,
Cromwell and Karakatsanis JJ. were delivered by

[102]                     
Karakatsanis J. (dissenting) — Does the legislation permitting Canadian law
enforcement agencies to disclose wiretapped information to foreign law
enforcement officials violate s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms ?  I conclude that it does.

[103]                     
When police intercept an individual’s private communications without
consent, the information they obtain is of an extremely private and personal
nature.  Officers must obtain prior judicial authorization before conducting
these intrusive searches, except in exigent circumstances:  Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, ss. 184.2 , 185 , 186  and 487.01(5) ; R.
v. Duarte, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 30.  Once the
information is obtained, there are strict limits on how officers can use the
information and to which Canadian officials it may be disclosed.

[104]                     
By contrast, s. 193(2) (e) of the Criminal Code  permits
Canadian law enforcement officers to disclose wiretapped information to foreign
law enforcement officials without any restrictions on how the information may
be used and without any measures to permit oversight of when and how this broad
state power is used.  Nothing in the provision restrains recipients from using
the information outside Canada in unfair trials or in ways that violate human
rights norms.  Similarly, recipient officials are not prevented from publicly
disseminating the information or sharing it with officials in other states,
many of which do not share our legal and democratic values.  The torture of
Maher Arar in Syria provides a particularly chilling example of the dangers of
unconditional information sharing.

[105]                     
I would hold that the wiretap scheme set out in Part VI of the Criminal
Code  violates the Charter  “right to be secure against unreasonable
search or seizure” because s. 193(2) (e) permits the sharing of
intercepted information with foreign officials without meaningful safeguards. 
To render the scheme constitutional, Parliament must require the disclosing
party to impose conditions on how foreign officials can use the information
they receive, and must implement accountability measures to deter inappropriate
disclosure and permit oversight.

I.         
The Legislation

[106]                     
Part VI of the Criminal Code  is the
legislative scheme that governs wiretap interceptions and the use of
intercepted information.  In recognition of the profound invasion of privacy
associated with the interception of private communications, Part VI imposes
strict preconditions on such interceptions.  With narrow exceptions for exigent
circumstances (ss. 184.1  and 184.4 ), law enforcement officers may generally
only use wiretaps in the course of investigating enumerated crimes (s. 183 ),
must obtain prior judicial authorization (ss. 184(2) (b) and 184.2 ), and
must comply with notice and reporting requirements (ss. 195  and 196 ).  A number
of the safeguards contained in Part VI have been added to ensure the
constitutionality of this wiretapping regime:  An Act to amend the Criminal
Code, the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act  and the Radiocommunication Act,
S.C. 1993, c. 40; Response to the Supreme Court of Canada Decision in R. v.
Tse Act, S.C. 2013, c. 8 .

[107]                     
While the basic scheme of Part VI has been found
to strike the balance between privacy and law enforcement interests required
under s. 8  of the Charter  (Duarte, at p. 45), this is the first
time that this Court has considered the effect of the disclosure provisions on
its constitutionality.  Section 193  of the Criminal Code  makes it an
indictable offence to disclose intercepted information without consent, except
where the disclosure falls into a permitted category such as disclosure for the
purpose of a criminal investigation.  Since 1988, the Criminal Code  has
permitted disclosure

(e)   where disclosure is made to a peace officer or
prosecutor in Canada or to a person or authority with responsibility in a
foreign state for the investigation or prosecution of offences and is intended to
be in the interests of the administration of justice in Canada or elsewhere . . .

 

(Criminal Code, s. 193(2) (e))

II.          
Section 8  of the Charter 

[108]                     
Section 8  of the Charter  protects against “unreasonable search or
seizure”.  A search or seizure is reasonable “if it is authorized by law, if
the law itself is reasonable and if the manner in which the search was carried
out is reasonable” (R. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p. 278).  In
this case, the interception of the appellant’s communications was a search
authorized by law.  A warrant was obtained authorizing the wiretap.  The
communications were shared with U.S. police pursuant to s. 193(2) (e)
without any conditions or written record.

[109]                     
I agree with my colleague Moldaver J. that we need not consider the
constitutionality of s. 8(2) (f) of the Privacy Act, R.S.C. 1985,
c. P-21 .  For the reasons set out by my colleague, I also find it unnecessary
to address the arguments with respect to s. 7  of the Charter .  The issue
in this case is whether the foreign disclosure contemplated by s. 193(2) (e)
of the Criminal Code  is reasonable.  In particular, does s. 193(2) (e)
render the wiretap scheme set out in Part VI unreasonable by permitting
essentially unrestricted and unsupervised disclosure of the fruits of wiretap
interceptions to foreign law enforcement officials?

[110]                     
Whether a law provides reasonable authority for a search is a contextual
inquiry:  R. v. Rodgers, 2006 SCC 15, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 554, at para. 26. 
The question here is whether the wiretap provisions “strik[e] an appropriate
balance” between the state’s interest in the search and the public interest in
protecting privacy:  R. v. Tse, 2012 SCC 16, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 531, at
para. 10.

[111]                     
The assessment of this balance must be connected to the underlying
purposes of s. 8  itself.  Just as the expectation of privacy analysis asks what
we, as a society, should be able to expect will be kept private (R. v. Quesnelle, 2014 SCC 46, [2014]
2 S.C.R. 390, at para. 44), the assessment of whether a law provides reasonable
authority for a search involves asking what level of privacy protection we are
entitled to expect, given the state’s objective in seeking the information.

[112]                     
In order to determine whether s. 193(2)(e) of Part VI of the Criminal
Code  permits an “unreasonable search or seizure”, it is first necessary to
consider the interests that the disclosure regime was meant to serve and its
impact on the privacy rights of affected persons.  With those interests in
mind, I will then turn to the particular aspects of s. 193(2) (e) that,
in my view, render Part VI unconstitutional.

III.       
The Interests at Stake

[113]                     
There is no question that international cooperation and
information sharing are essential to law enforcement:  United States of
America v. Cotroni, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1469; R. v. Hape, 2007 SCC 26, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 292.  Crime does not stop at
state borders, nor should efforts to combat it.  Just as electronic
surveillance “plays an indispensable role in the detection of sophisticated
criminal enterprises” (Duarte, at p. 44), international dissemination of
the fruits of that surveillance is increasingly important for law enforcement.

[114]                     
When Canadian officials share information with
foreign officials, the foreign state is not the only beneficiary; the
importance of comity cannot be ignored.  Canadian interests are served when our
law enforcement agencies build appropriate information-sharing relationships
with law enforcement officials in other jurisdictions, and the disclosure of
wiretapped information in individual cases contributes to these relationships. 
Further, timely disclosure will often be critical in the investigation of
serious transnational crimes such as drug smuggling, human trafficking and
terrorism.  Often, the circumstances will require immediate police action to
protect public safety and prevent crimes.  This case is one such example.

[115]                     
The state’s interest in law enforcement and comity must
be balanced against the significant privacy and other interests engaged by
disclosure.  Wiretap interceptions gather private information that is likely
“to reveal intimate details of the lifestyle and personal choices of the
individual” (R. v. Plant, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 281, at p. 293; and R. v.
Tessling, 2004 SCC 67, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 432, at para. 25).  This can include
information about an individual’s political and religious affiliations,
personal finances, intimate relationships, family problems, physical and mental
health, substance use, and encounters with police.

[116]                     
This Court recognized the invasiveness of wiretapping in Duarte,
where La Forest J. stated that “one can scarcely imagine a state activity more
dangerous to individual privacy than electronic surveillance” (p. 43).  He
warned that

[i]f the state may arbitrarily record
and transmit our private communications, it is no longer possible to strike an
appropriate balance between the right of the individual to be left alone and
the right of the state to intrude on privacy in the furtherance of its goals,
notably the need to investigate and combat crime.  [p. 44]

[117]                     
Law enforcement officers in Canada are therefore subject to strict
limits on the use of wiretapped information.  Section 193  of the Criminal
Code  makes it an indictable offence to disclose intercepted information,
subject to limited exceptions such as giving evidence in civil or criminal
proceedings (s. 193(2) (a)) or disclosing information for the purpose of
a criminal investigation (s. 193(2) (b)).  By contrast, courts have held
that information obtained by the state in other kinds of searches and seizures
may be shared with regulatory agencies for purposes outside of criminal
investigations and existing proceedings (see, for example, Brown v. The
Queen, 2013 FCA 111, 2013 D.T.C. 5094).

[118]                     
When information is shared across jurisdictional lines, the safeguards
that apply in domestic investigations lose their force.  This can create
serious risks to individual privacy, liberty and security of the person
interests.  As Commissioner O’Connor observed, when information is shared with
foreign authorities, “respect for human rights cannot always be taken for
granted”:  Commission of Inquiry into the Actions of Canadian Officials in
Relation to Maher Arar, Report of the Events
Relating to Maher Arar:  Analysis and Recommendations (2006) (“O’Connor Report”), at p. 321.

[119]                     
Wiretap information that is shared with foreign
officials may ultimately be used in unfair trials or to prosecute offences that
are not crimes in Canada.  Information obtained from wiretaps can lead to
discrimination on the basis of political or religious affiliation.  In the
wrong hands, wiretap information may even be used to intimidate or smear
political figures and members of civil society:  see, e.g., B. A. Franklin,
“Wiretaps reveal Dr. King feared rebuff on nonviolence”, The New York Times,
September 15, 1985; J. Sanchez, “Wiretapping’s true danger”, Los
Angeles Times, March 16, 2008.  Further, s. 193(2)(e)
permits the disclosure to foreign officials of both intercepted personal
information that may be completely unrelated to the criminal investigation or
to its target and information resulting from wiretaps that are later found to
be unlawful.

[120]                     
Professor Kent Roach writes that the expansion in international
information sharing since 2001 has exacerbated a number of problems:

. . . law enforcement
agencies are now more likely to undertake enforcement actions based on shared
information that is unreliable, and there is now a greater risk that
information shared by intelligence services will be disclosed in subsequent
legal proceedings.  Individuals are also at greater risk of having their
rights, especially their right to privacy, infringed.  Individuals will rarely
have the opportunity to challenge the accuracy of shared information because
they will often be unaware that information about them has been shared and will
not have access to the shared information.

 

(K.
Roach, “Overseeing Information Sharing”, in H. Born and A. Wills, eds., Overseeing
Intelligence Services:  A Toolkit (2012), 129, at p. 131)

[121]                     
The respondent the Attorney General of Canada submits
that the expectation of privacy in communications is diminished after they have
been lawfully intercepted.  Indeed, people should expect that police will
“share lawfully gathered information with other law enforcement officials,
provided the use is consistent with the purposes for which it was gathered” (Quesnelle,
at para. 39).

[122]                     
However, that does not mean that there is no
privacy interest in wiretap information; to the contrary, people have the right
to expect that such information will only be disclosed appropriately. 
In a well-known passage in R. v. Mills, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 668, McLachlin and
Iacobucci JJ. stated:

Privacy is not an all or nothing right.  It does not
follow from the fact that the Crown has possession of the records that any reasonable
expectation of privacy disappears.  Privacy interests in modern society include
the reasonable expectation that private information will remain confidential to
the persons to whom and restricted to the purposes for which it was divulged. 
[para. 108]

[123]                     
This Court, per Charron J., also confirmed in R. v. McNeil,
2009 SCC 3, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 66, that “any number of persons and entities may
have a residual privacy interest in material gathered in the course of a
criminal investigation” (at para. 19; see also paras. 12 and 39).  The
“protective mantle of s. 8 ” shields information seized by the state “so long as
the seizure continues” (R. v. Colarusso, [1994] 1
S.C.R. 20, at p. 63).

[124]                     
Nor is the privacy interest in wiretap information reduced simply
because a subject of a wiretap might anticipate that law enforcement agencies
may share it pursuant to s. 193  of the Criminal Code .  A focus on
subjective expectations, which Professor L. M. Austin has described as the
“what did you expect” approach to privacy, would protect “an interest in being
unfairly surprised by state intrusions”, but would fail to guard against
“expected, though nonetheless problematic, invasions of privacy”
(“Information Sharing and the ‘Reasonable’ Ambiguities of Section 8  of the
Charter ” (2007), 57 U.T.L.J. 499, at p. 507 (emphasis added)).  As this
Court held in Tessling, a diminished subjective expectation of privacy
does not necessarily result in reduced constitutional protections:  the
“[e]xpectation of privacy is a normative rather than a descriptive standard”
(para. 42).

[125]                     
In light of the intrusive nature of wiretapping, the
highly personal nature of the information in question, and the very real risks
that may be created by disclosure to foreign officials, it is clear that a
substantial privacy interest remains in wiretapped information.  This restricts
how the information may be divulged and used.

IV.       
Challenges to Section 193(2)(e)

[126]                     
The appellant and interveners challenge a number of aspects of s. 193(2)(e),
including the breadth, alleged vagueness and subjective nature of the test for
disclosure.  They also point to a number of deficiencies:  of a warrant
requirement for the disclosure; of restrictions on how information may be used
once it is shared; and of accountability mechanisms such as record-keeping and
notice or reporting requirements.  I agree with my colleague Justice Moldaver’s
rejection of many of these challenges.  However, in my view, the last two
objections ― concerning the lack of restrictions on disclosed information
and the absence of any accountability measures ― each identify serious
constitutional problems.  For the reasons set out below, I conclude that to the
extent s. 193(2)(e) permits disclosure of wiretap
information to foreign authorities without restrictions on recipients’ use and
without accountability measures, it is unreasonable and
contrary to s. 8  of the Charter .

A.          
Limits on Use of Disclosed Information

[127]                     
The first failure is that s. 193(2)(e) does not impose any limits
on how the shared information will be used or further disclosed.  It simply
permits disclosure of wiretapped information as long as the disclosure “is
intended to be in the interests of the administration of justice in Canada or
elsewhere”.  In my view, it is not an answer to say that because police
officers can only share information that they genuinely believe would further
the interests of the administration of justice, in the context of law
enforcement, it is unlikely that s. 193(2)(e) would result in sharing
with foreign states that engage in torture or other human rights violations. 
While Canadian law enforcement officials are constrained in their use of
wiretapped information by the Charter  and s. 193  of the Criminal Code ,
these restrictions do not apply to foreign officials.

[128]                     
Of course, many foreign jurisdictions impose some form of legal
oversight on the use of wiretapped information or criminal intelligence
generally.  But s. 193(2)(e) itself does nothing to prevent those who
receive the information from using it in proceedings which fail to respect due
process and human rights, which may involve unjustified detention or torture,
or in which the accused has no access to counsel.  Even if the direct
recipients of the information respect human and fair trial rights, s. 193(2)(e)
does not stop them from disclosing the information to others who do not.  As my
colleague LeBel J. has observed, “[i]f the process is
irretrievably flawed, no amount of trust in the future good behaviour and
restraint of prosecutors and police will save it”:  Lavallee, Rackel &
Heintz v. Canada (Attorney General), 2002 SCC 61, [2002] 3
S.C.R. 209, at para. 69 (dissenting in part).

[129]                     
One need only look to the case of Maher Arar to understand what is at
stake.  Although in that case the information provided was not obtained by way
of wiretap, Commissioner O’Connor found that “[t]he fact that [the RCMP] did
not attach written caveats to the information about Mr. Arar provided to
American agencies increased the risk that those agencies would use the
information for purposes unacceptable to the RCMP, such as removing him to
Syria” (O’Connor Report, at p. 23).  Although
disclosure by the state that compromises an individual’s life, liberty or
security of the person interests may well give rise to a remedy under s. 7  of
the Charter , s. 8  must be construed to prevent unreasonable intrusions
on privacy and their potential consequences before they occur:  Hunter v.
Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at p. 160.

[130]                     
The failure to require any caveats on the use of disclosed information
is, in my view, unreasonable.  To the extent that s. 193(2)(e) permits
law enforcement officers to intercept private communications and then share the
results with foreign officials without any restrictions on what they may do
with them, Part VI does not achieve the balancing of interests required to
satisfy the demands of s. 8  of the Charter .

[131]                     
Further, the requirement of prior judicial
authorization for the wiretap itself does not provide sufficient protection
against inappropriate future disclosure of the information.  Authorizations to
intercept communications are granted with respect to specified times, places
and persons in the context of Canadian laws and protections.  At the time an
authorization is granted, the judge generally does not weigh the targeted
individual’s privacy interests (let alone those of third parties whose
communications are also intercepted) against a future hypothetical state
interest in disclosing the information to foreign law enforcement officials. 
Restrictions on the use of disclosed material would provide some protection of
individuals’ privacy and security interests.

[132]                     
Imposing restrictions on foreign use of Canadian wiretap information
would not undermine the objectives of the wiretap scheme.  Caveats on
information sharing are commonplace in international law enforcement and
intelligence cooperation:  O’Connor Report, at p. 150;
U.K. Intelligence and Security Committee, Rendition (2007), at p. 53. 
Indeed, according to the affidavit of RCMP Deputy Commissioner of Canada West,
Gary David Bass, such caveats are “normally” attached to wiretap disclosures as
a matter of course.  Further, the need for written caveats
need not hinder timely information sharing.  For example, police forces could
have standing agreements with certain foreign forces with whom they regularly
cooperate, or they could complete a standardized form each time information is
shared.

[133]                     
I do not propose any particular form for such
caveats or agreements.  The key is that a wiretap scheme which authorizes deep
intrusions on privacy with potentially life-changing consequences cannot permit
the unconditional disclosure of information to foreign authorities.  Written
caveats must provide some assurance to our law enforcement agencies that
disclosed information will only be used to advance legitimate law enforcement
objectives, in accordance with respect for due process and human rights, and
will not be shared further except as agreed to by the disclosing party.

[134]                     
My colleague Justice Moldaver suggests that where a particular
disclosure is challenged (as here, in an extradition proceeding), the existence
of caveats or protocols may be relevant to determining the disclosing officer’s
subjective intent ― whether the disclosing officer intended that the
disclosure be “in the interests of the administration of justice in Canada or
elsewhere”.  Thus, he says, caveats and protocols may be relevant to whether
the disclosure was authorized by s. 193(2)(e) or whether the disclosure
is carried out in a reasonable manner.  This, of course, rests upon the
uncertain assumption that an individual would have knowledge of the disclosure
and the opportunity to challenge it in a Canadian proceeding.  Further, such an
approach leaves the assessment and balancing of interests in the hands of the
disclosing officer.  Given the significant risks involved in the international
dissemination of such information, and the limited ability of an individual whose
rights have been violated to seek redress, such an approach does not provide
sufficient protections for the important privacy interests engaged.  As noted
above, for s. 193(2)(e) to be reasonable, the law itself must strike the
appropriate balance of interests.

B.           
Oversight and Accountability

[135]                     
In addition, for a law to provide reasonable authority for a search or
seizure, it must include some mechanism to permit oversight of state use of the
power:  see Tse, at paras. 11 and 82.  In my view, this need for accountability
applies not only to the search itself but also to the subsequent use of the
resulting information.  Written caveats alone generally do not provide
sufficient protection.  Without some accountability mechanism, no information
is available on what is being shared, with whom, for what purpose and what
subsequent use is made of the information.  The need for such accountability is
made even greater where information is being shared across borders, putting it
beyond the reach of Canadian legal protections.

[136]                     
The purpose of accountability mechanisms is to deter and identify
inappropriate intrusions on privacy.  None of the safeguards included in the
broader Part VI wiretap regime, such as judicial pre-authorization,
after-the-fact notification, record-keeping or reporting requirements, apply to
the disclosure of wiretap information to foreign officials.  Ensuring that the
wiretapping itself is appropriate does not guarantee that subsequent
disclosures will be.

[137]                     
Justice Moldaver finds that because s. 193(2)(e) is an exemption
to the criminal offence set out at s. 193(1) , law enforcement officers will
have ample incentive to comply with the terms of the exemption in order to
avoid criminal liability.  With respect, I am not convinced that the presence
of the criminal offence is ― on its own ― an adequate
accountability mechanism.  My chief concern is not that Canadian officers will
intentionally disclose the information for purposes unrelated to “the interests
of the administration of justice in Canada or elsewhere”.  Rather, it is the
potential use by foreign officials ― who do not face the risk of
prosecution under s. 193(1)  ― that raises concerns about Charter 
interests.

[138]                     
Canadian law enforcement officers may subjectively intend to serve
justice by sharing information.  However, improper or hazardous sharing is
unlikely to come to light without record-keeping, reporting or notice
obligations.  Moreover, accountability is not only about fostering compliance
with the letter of the law; it is about giving oversight bodies, legislators
and the public the information that they need to ensure that statutory powers
are necessary and are used appropriately.

[139]                     
Justice Moldaver’s suggestion that individuals subject to disclosure of
wiretapped information might find out through an access to information request
is far from adequate in achieving accountability, particularly since the
various privacy laws governing law enforcement across Canada generally include
an exception for records relating to law enforcement matters:  see, for
example, Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c. M.56, s. 8(1).  Without any requirement that law enforcement
agencies maintain records, even a successful applicant may find there is little
or no record to obtain.

[140]                     
The case before us was likely an appropriate sharing of information.  It
related to drug crimes that spanned the Canada-United States border, was shared
with U.S. law enforcement, and was used to stop such a crime and to apprehend
the offender.  However, given the breadth of s. 193(2)(e) and of the
personal information that may be contained in a wiretap, it is not difficult to
imagine situations where disclosure would be inappropriate, even if it was
subjectively “intended to be in the interests of the administration of
justice”, as required by s. 193(2)(e).  Accountability mechanisms are
required to safeguard against disclosure in such cases.

[141]                     
Just as the reasonableness of a search power depends on context (Rodgers),
the exact accountability mechanism that will be required varies with the
circumstances.  In general, serious intrusions on a reasonable expectation of
privacy ― such as a search of a dwelling or interception of private
communications ― require prior judicial authorization:  R. v. Thompson,
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 1111.  In emergencies, after-the-fact notice can serve as a
substitute:  Tse.  Some kinds of searches, like searches incident to
arrest, may be immediately apparent to their targets, such that no formal
notice mechanism is required.

[142]                     
Notice of cross-border disclosure would permit individuals ― or
the executive branch of government ― to know which countries have
information and perhaps how it may be used.  After-the-fact reporting to the
legislature would create transparency, telling Canadians how often information
is disclosed to identified foreign law enforcement officials and for what
purposes.  I recognize that these choices involve practical and policy
considerations.  It is for Parliament to decide what measures are most
appropriate and how they should be implemented.  The Charter  does not
mandate a specific protocol; it requires only that the legislation authorizing
a search be reasonable.  Reasonableness, in this case, demands accountability
mechanisms that ensure an appropriate balance between privacy and the state
interest in the search.  At a minimum, the disclosing party should be required
to create a written record of what information is shared with whom, with some
obligation to make the sharing ultimately known to the target or to government.

[143]                     
To conclude, while the sharing of wiretapped information is an important
tool for law enforcement agencies, it must nonetheless be balanced against
adequate protections for the privacy interests at stake in order to pass Charter 
muster.  This balance requires that the disclosing party obtain assurances
that information will not be improperly used by foreign officials.  It also
requires the implementation of accountability measures to facilitate oversight
and to deter inappropriate disclosures.  Absent such protections, I find that
s. 193(2) (e) is contrary to s. 8  of the Charter .

V.          
Section 1 

[144]                     
In my view, s. 193(2)(e) infringes s. 8  of the Charter  in
a manner that is not justified under s. 1 .

[145]                     
To be upheld under s. 1 , legislation that limits a Charter  right
must meet the criteria set out in R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1
S.C.R. 103.  First, the legislation must serve a pressing and
substantial objective.  Second, the means chosen must be proportionate:  there
must be a rational connection between the legislation and the objective, the
legislation must limit the right as little as possible, and there must be
proportionality between the effects of the Charter  limitation and its
objectives.

[146]                     
In this case, the objective of international cooperation in law
enforcement is pressing and substantial, and disclosure of wiretap information
is rationally connected to that objective.  However, s. 193(2)(e) as it
is presently drafted interferes with privacy to a greater extent than
necessary.  The inclusion of accountability mechanisms and limits on subsequent
use would cure the constitutional deficiencies without undermining Parliament’s
goals.  Accordingly, I conclude that the disclosure to foreign officials
permitted without safeguards under s. 193(2)(e) renders the Part VI
regime unconstitutional.

VI.       
Conclusion

[147]                     
Section 8  requires that when a law authorizes intrusions on privacy, it
must do so in a manner that is reasonable.  A reasonable law must have adequate
safeguards to prevent abuse.  It must avoid intruding farther than necessary. 
It must strike an appropriate balance between privacy and other public
interests.  I conclude that s. 193(2)(e) falls short on all three
counts.

[148]                     
In my view, the appropriate remedy in this case
is to strike the words “or to a person or authority
with responsibility in a foreign state” from s. 193(2) (e) of the Criminal
Code .  Such a remedy respects Parliament’s intention to allow law
enforcement officials to collaborate within Canada, while invalidating those
aspects of the legislation that are inconsistent with the Charter . 
Severing the unconstitutional elements of this provision is also consistent
with this Court’s view that “when only a part of a statute or provision
violates the Constitution, it is common sense that only the offending portion
should be declared to be of no force or effect, and the rest should be spared”:
 Schachter v. Canada, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 679, at p. 696.  I would suspend
the effect of this order for 12 months to allow Parliament to amend Part VI to
comply with the Charter .

[149]                     
The Crown submitted that if this Court were to
suspend a declaration of invalidity, a new hearing should be ordered at which
the admissibility of the evidence under s. 24(2)  of the Charter  can be
addressed.  This Court has recognized that, where a suspended declaration of
invalidity is ordered, a constitutional exemption may be awarded “to relieve
the claimant of the continued burden of the unconstitutional law during the
period that the striking out remedy is suspended”:  R. v. Ferguson, 2008
SCC 6, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 96, at para. 46; see also Corbiere v. Canada
(Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 203, at para.
22.  I would accordingly exempt the appellant from the suspension of the
declaration of invalidity.

[150]                     
I would answer the relevant constitutional
questions as follows:

Does s. 193(2)(e) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , infringe s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms ?

Answer: Yes.

If so, is the infringement a reasonable
limit prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and
democratic society under s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

Answer: No.

[151]                     
Thus, in the circumstances of this case, I would allow
the appeal and order a new hearing.

[1]   Even if Part VI was not intended by Parliament to
be the exclusive regime governing wiretaps, the Privacy Act  would still
have no application here. Section 8(2)(b) of the Act permits disclosure
of personal information “for any purpose in accordance with any Act of
Parliament . . . that authorizes its disclosure”. Given my conclusion
that the Criminal Code  implicitly authorizes the Impugned
Disclosure, even under the terms of the Privacy Act , the Code is
the applicable statute in this case.





[2]   As observed by LeBel and Wagner JJ. in Imperial Oil,
s. 193(2) merely authorizes the disclosure of intercepted communications in a number of
prescribed circumstances. It does not create a right of access to intercepted
communications, nor a procedure for seeking and obtaining disclosure of such
communications by persons who are not otherwise in lawful possession of the
information.

                    The judgment of the Court was delivered orally by

[1]                             
Karakatsanis J. — This is an appeal as of right on a question
of law.  We agree with the majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal that it was
open to the trial judge to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the
complainant would not have engaged in sexual relations had he known about the
appellant’s HIV positive status.  The fact that the trial judge also found that
it was possible that the sexual relationship continued after disclosure,
despite the complainant’s denial, does not necessarily render that first
finding unreasonable.  While it would have been preferable for the trial judge
to more fully explain his reasoning relating to the complainant’s credibility,
we are not satisfied that the trial judge erred in the analytical process set
out in R. v. W. (D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, or that he failed to analyze
the evidence as a whole relating to an ultimate issue.  The appeal is
dismissed.

                    Constitutional law — Charter of Rights  — Right to liberty — Right to security
of person — Fundamental justice — Vagueness
— Criminal Code  provision prohibiting disposing of dead
body of child with intent to conceal its delivery whether child died before,
during or after birth — Whether provision is impermissibly vague in its application to child that
died before birth — Whether provision infringes
rights to liberty and security of person — Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms, s. 7  — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, s. 243 .

                    Criminal law — Offences — Concealing body of child — Whether phrase “child [that] died before . . . birth”
satisfies requirement of certainty —Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985,
c. C‑46, s. 243 .

                    While
cleaning a recently vacated apartment, a building superintendent discovered on
the balcony a bag containing the remains of a human baby.  According to the
Crown, the remains were of a female delivered “at or near full term”.  The
cause of death could not be determined and it was unknown whether there had
been a live birth.  The accused was charged under s. 243  of the Criminal
Code  with concealing the dead body of a child.  Before any evidence was
called, she challenged the constitutionality of s. 243  on the grounds that
the section infringes her right to liberty and security under s. 7  of the
Charter .  The trial judge concluded that the concept of a child that died
before birth is unconstitutionally vague because he could not identify the
moment on the gestational spectrum when a fetus becomes the body of a child for
the purpose of s. 243 .  He severed the word “before” from s. 243 .  The
Crown did not call evidence and the accused was acquitted.  The Court of Appeal
allowed an appeal and ordered a new trial on the grounds that the trial judge
applied an overly demanding standard of vagueness.  The Court of Appeal relied
on the “chance of life” standard from R. v. Berriman (1854), 6 Cox C.C.
388, to conclude that a fetus becomes a child for the purpose of s. 243  when
the fetus has reached a stage when, but for some external event or
circumstance, it would likely have been born alive.

                    Held:  The appeal
should be dismissed.

                    Impermissibly
vague laws mock the rule of law and scorn an ancient and well-established principle
of fundamental justice:  No one may be convicted or punished for an act or
omission that is not clearly prohibited by a valid law.  The issue on this
appeal is whether s. 243  of the Criminal Code  satisfies these
constitutional requirements.

                    The
risk of incarceration upon conviction clearly engaged the accused’s liberty
interest under s. 7  of the Charter .  It is thus unnecessary to
dispose of her submission that s. 243  infringes s. 7  because it
interferes with a decision of fundamental personal importance:  whether and how
to disclose the natural end of a failed pregnancy.  Furthermore, the accused’s
argument that s. 7  of the Charter  must hold s. 243  to a
heightened standard of precision because it interferes with every woman’s right
not to disclose a naturally failed pregnancy raises a challenge for vagueness
in form but overbreadth in substance.  Given that the accused’s overbreadth
arguments were rejected by both courts below and not raised on this appeal,
there is no proper basis to revisit the issue here.

                    In
accordance with s. 7  of the Charter , in a criminal context, a
statutory provision must afford citizens fair notice of the consequences of
their conduct and it must limit the discretion of those charged with its
enforcement.  A provision that fails to satisfy these essential requirements is
void for vagueness.  This is judicially determined by examination of both the
provision’s text and context.  Section 243  meets the minimum standard of
precision required by the Charter .  In its application to a child that
died before birth, it only captures the disposal of the remains of children
that were likely to be born alive.  A conviction will only lie where the Crown
proves that the child, to the knowledge of the accused, was likely to have been
born alive.  Section 243  gives fair notice of the risk of prosecution and
conviction and limits with sufficient clarity the discretion of those charged
with its enforcement.  There is thus no need to conduct a s. 1  analysis.  

                    A
court can conclude that a law is unconstitutionally vague only after exhausting
its interpretive function.  This requires considering prior judicial
interpretations of the provision, the legislative purpose of the provision, its
subject matter and nature, societal values and related legislative provisions. 
A plain reading of s. 243  makes clear that it is focused on the event of
birth.  The interpretation of s. 243  is informed by Berriman, which
sets out that an accused can only be convicted of child concealment if he or
she, with intent to conceal its birth, disposed of the body of a child that had
reached a point of development where, but for some accidental circumstances it
might have been born alive.  However, where Berriman required that the
fetus “might have been born alive”, a likelihood requirement is
to be preferred.  A likelihood standard best comports with the late term focus
of s. 243  and affords greater certainty in its application.  Moreover, a
likelihood standard is consistent
with the primary purpose of s. 243  in facilitating the investigation of
other Criminal Code  provisions: the homicide provisions that apply only
when the victim is a human being which, in the case of a child, requires that
the child has completely proceeded, in a living state, from the body of its mother;
ss. 238  and 242 , both of which focus on the event of birth; and, s. 662(4) 
which, on a charge of murder or infanticide, permits a conviction under s. 243 
where neither murder nor infanticide is made out.  Limiting
the pre-birth application of s. 243  to fetuses that were likely to have
been born alive is consistent with the clear late term focus of these offences. 


                    Section 243 
is not vague because an accused is dependent on expert medical evidence to know
whether a fetus would likely have been born alive.   Medical evidence would be
required even if s. 243  provided a detailed description of the precise
moment on the gestational spectrum where a miscarriage becomes a still birth.

                    Fish J. — 

I

[1]                             
Impermissibly vague laws mock the rule of law
and scorn an ancient and well-established principle of fundamental justice: No
one may be convicted or punished for an act or omission that is not clearly
prohibited by a valid law.  That principle is now enshrined in the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms . This has been recognized by the Court since
its earliest pronouncements on unconstitutional vagueness in the Charter 
era. 

[2]                             
In Reference re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of
the Criminal Code (Man.), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1123, the Court cited with
approval two decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States[1] holding that
“impermissibly vague laws” violate “the first essential of due process of law”
(p. 1151), and continued as follows:

The principles expressed in these two
citations are not new to our law.  In fact they are based on the ancient Latin
maxim nullum crimen sine lege, nulla poena sine lege ― that there
can be no crime or punishment unless it is in accordance with law that is
certain, unambiguous and not retroactive.  The rationale underlying this
principle is clear.  It is essential in a free and democratic society that
citizens are able, as far as is possible, to foresee the consequences of their
conduct in order that persons be given fair notice of what to avoid, and that
the discretion of those entrusted with law enforcement is limited by clear and
explicit legislative standards . . . . This is especially important in the
criminal law, where citizens are potentially liable to a deprivation of liberty
if their conduct is in conflict with the law. [p. 1152]

[3]                             
And very recently, speaking for the Court in R.
v. Mabior, 2012 SCC 47, [2012] S.C.R. 584, Chief Justice McLachlin
reaffirmed the governing principle in these terms:

It is a fundamental requirement of the
rule of law that a person should be able to predict whether a particular act
constitutes a crime at the time he commits the act.  The rule of law requires
that laws provide in advance what can and cannot be done . . . .  Condemning
people for conduct that they could not have reasonably known was criminal is
Kafkaesque and anathema to our notions of justice.  After-the-fact condemnation
violates the concept of liberty in s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms  and has no place in the Canadian legal system. [para. 14]

[4]                             
Our concern here is with s. 243  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 , which is said by the appellant to be impermissibly vague, at least
in part.  For that reason and to that extent, the appellant submits, s. 243 
infringes her right to liberty and security of the person under s. 7  of the Charter . 
She submits as well that this infringement of s. 7  cannot be justified ―
or “saved” ― under s. 1  of the Charter .

[5]                             
Section 243  makes it a crime in Canada to
dispose of the dead body of a child with intent to conceal its delivery ―
whether the child died before, during, or after birth. 
The decisive issue on this appeal is whether s. 243  is impermissibly vague in
its application to a child that died before birth.  

[6]                             
The trial judge held that it is; the Ontario
Court of Appeal held that it is not.  With respect for the contrary conclusion
of the trial judge, I agree with the Court of Appeal. 

[7]                             
The appellant argues that s. 7  of the Charter 
must hold s. 243  to a more exacting standard of precision because it
interferes with what in her view is a constitutionally protected personal
autonomy and privacy interest: every woman’s right not to disclose a naturally
failed pregnancy. 

[8]                             
In fact, however, the appellant’s vagueness
challenge does not rest ultimately ― if at all ― on a woman’s
constitutionally protected autonomy and privacy interests.  On the contrary,
the appellant expressly recognizes Parliament’s right to criminalize the
concealment by a woman of the fact that she was delivered of a child that died
during, after and even before birth.  More particularly, she concedes
that Parliament may “enact legislation which has application to the concealment
of a fetus at some stages of development prior to live birth”.  Her
constitutional challenge relates exclusively to a woman’s “inability to
determine the conduct to which s. 243  applies in the context of a child that
dies before birth”: A.F., at para. 4. 

[9]                             
It seems to me that the appellant’s submission
regarding a woman’s right not to disclose a naturally failed pregnancy amounts
to a challenge for vagueness in form but overbreadth in substance.  A challenge
for overbreadth would require the Court to balance the impact of s. 243  on the
appellant’s constitutionally protected interests against the impact necessary
for s. 243  to achieve its justified legislative objectives.  The appellant’s
arguments regarding this balance were rejected by both courts below.  Moreover,
there is no challenge for overbreadth on this appeal.  And it is not open to
the appellant, in characterizing her privacy interest submission as a vagueness
challenge, to circumvent this balancing exercise that informs a proper
constitutional challenge for overbreadth.

[10]                         
There is otherwise no dispute regarding the
analytical framework for determining whether a statutory provision is void for
vagueness.  Nor is there any dispute as to the governing criteria: In a
criminal context, the impugned provision must afford citizens fair notice of
the consequences of their conduct and limit the discretion of those charged
with its enforcement.  

[11]                         
Whether the provision satisfies these essential
requirements will be judicially determined by examination of both its text and
context.  Normally, in making that determination, the court will first consider
the plain meaning of the words used by Parliament to define the essential
elements of the offence.  In this regard, the requirement of a specific intent,
as in this case, will often shed light on the intelligibility of the terms used
to describe the prohibited act or omission. 

[12]                         
I shall later have more to say about these
established rules of interpretation.  As we shall see, their application here
leads me to conclude that s. 243  of the Criminal Code  is not
impermissibly vague in its application to a child that dies before birth.  Only
that aspect of the provision is in issue on this appeal.  

[13]                         
Any ambiguity as to this element of the offence
is resolved in favour of the accused, as it must be, by restricting the
pre-birth application of s. 243  to the delivery of a child that would likely
have been born alive.  By this I mean, here and throughout, a child that has
reached a stage of development where, but for some external event or
circumstances, it would likely have been born alive. 

[14]                         
I recognize, of course, that provincial and
territorial legislation requires reporting of all stillbirths, generally
defined as “the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product
of conception either after the twentieth week of pregnancy or after the product
of conception has attained the weight of 500 grams or more [without signs of
life]”, or words to this effect: see, for example, Vital Statistics Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c. V.4, s. 1.  

[15]                         
The unchallenged constitutionality of these
provisions may well negate the privacy and autonomy interests claimed by the
appellant in this case.  And they doubtless provide clear and specific
standards for provincial reporting purposes.  In my view, however, they cannot
be invoked ― by “harmonization”, analogy, or otherwise ― to expand
by judicial fiat the meaning of “child [that] died before . . .  birth” in s.
243  of the Criminal Code .  Section 243 , an enactment that falls squarely
within federal jurisdiction, has a distinct legislative history and creates a
crime for different legislative purposes.

[16]                         
Finally, a brief word regarding the fault
element of s. 243  in its application to a child that died before birth.  The
Crown concedes, properly in my view, that the burden of proof would be on the
prosecution to establish the accused’s awareness that the child died at a time
when it was likely to be born alive.  Any doubt in this regard would require an
acquittal.  In addition, as in cases where the child dies at or after birth, the
prosecution must prove that the accused disposed of its body “with intent to
conceal the fact that [the child’s] mother has been delivered of it”.  

[17]                         
For these reasons and the reasons that follow, I
would dismiss the appellant’s appeal to this Court, affirm the judgment of the
Court of Appeal, and remit the matter for trial. 

II

[18]                         
By agreement, the appellant’s constitutional
challenge to s. 243  was heard and decided by the trial judge before any
evidence was called.  Accordingly, the facts alleged by the Crown remain to
this day unproven and are thus conditionally relevant here as a matter of
context only. 

[19]                         
For present purposes, the following summary will
suffice. 

[20]                         
While cleaning a recently vacated apartment, a
building superintendent discovered on the balcony a bag containing the remains
of a human baby.  Post-mortem examination revealed that the remains were of a
female delivered “at or near full term”: R.F., at para. 8.  Due to the
decomposition of the remains, the cause of death could not be determined and it
was unknown whether there had been a live birth.  

[21]                         
Following media reports of the superintendent’s
discovery, Ivana Levkovic, the appellant in this Court, attended at a police
station and gave a statement to the police.  She gave birth to the baby, she explained,
after falling while alone in the apartment.  She then placed the baby in a bag,
deposited the bag on the balcony, and left the apartment.  Nothing in her
statement to the police suggests that the baby was alive at birth. 

[22]                         
Ms. Levkovic was charged with concealing the
body of a child under s. 243  of the Criminal Code .  She pleaded not
guilty and, before any evidence was called, challenged the constitutionality of
s. 243  on the ground that it is impermissibly vague in its application to a child
that died before birth.  To this extent, she submitted, s. 243  violates s.
7  of the Charter .  

[23]                         
The trial judge granted Ms. Levkovic’s
application: (2008), 235 C.C.C. (3d) 417.  He concluded that the concept of a
child that died before birth is unconstitutionally vague because he could not
identify the moment on the gestational spectrum when a fetus becomes the body
of a child within the meaning of s. 243 .  

[24]                         
To bring the provision into compliance with s. 7 
of the Charter , the trial judge severed the word “before” from the text
of the provision, thereby limiting its application to children that died either
during or after birth.  

[25]                         
The Crown elected to call no evidence and the
trial judge acquitted the appellant.  

[26]                         
The Court of Appeal allowed an appeal by the
Crown, set aside the decision of the trial judge, restored the pre-birth
application of s. 243 , and ordered a new trial: 2010 ONCA 830, 103 O.R. (3d) 1.


[27]                         
The Court of Appeal concluded that the trial
judge had erred by applying an overly demanding standard of vagueness and in
failing to apply R. v. Berriman (1854), 6 Cox C.C. 388 (Surrey Assizes),
to his interpretation of s. 243 .  Relying on Berriman, the Court of
Appeal held that a fetus becomes a child for the purpose of s. 243  upon
reaching a stage in its development when, but for some external event or other
circumstances, it would likely have been born alive.

[28]                         
Ms. Levkovic now asks this Court to overrule the
Court of Appeal and restore her acquittal.  She raises two main grounds:  (1)
that the Court of Appeal erred in conducting an insufficiently contextual
vagueness analysis, overlooking the full impact of s. 243  on her Charter -protected
right to liberty and security; and (2) that the Court of Appeal erred in
relying on the chance of life standard to uphold the constitutionality
of s. 243 .

III

[29]                         
Plainly, Ms. Levkovic’s prosecution under s. 243 
of the Criminal Code  engages her liberty interest under s. 7  of the Charter ,
given the risk of her incarceration upon conviction: Canada (Attorney
General) v. PHS Community Services Society, 2011 SCC 44, [2011] 3 S.C.R.
134, at para. 87.  

[30]                         
It is therefore unnecessary at this stage to
dispose of the appellant’s submission that s. 243  also infringes her
liberty and security under s. 7  of the Charter  because it interferes
with a decision of fundamental personal importance: whether and how to disclose
the natural end of a failed pregnancy.  

[31]                         
Accordingly, I now turn instead to consider
whether s. 243 , though it engages s. 7  of the Charter , nevertheless
passes constitutional muster because it accords with the principles of
fundamental justice. 

IV

[32]                         
The doctrine against vagueness is founded on two
rationales: a law must provide fair notice to citizens and it must limit
enforcement discretion.  Understood in light of its theoretical foundations,
the doctrine against vagueness is a critical component of a society grounded in
the rule of law:  R. v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, [1992] 2
S.C.R. 606, at pp. 626-27; Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the
Law v. Canada (Attorney General), 2004 SCC 4, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 76, at
para. 16.  

[33]                         
Since long before the Charter , Canadian
criminal law has adhered to the principle of certainty: prohibited conduct must
be fixed and knowable in advance: M. Manning and P. Sankoff, Manning, Mewett & Sankoff: 
Criminal Law (4th ed. 2009), at p. 76.  As
Glanville Williams explained in Criminal Law: The General Part (2nd ed.
1961), at pp. 575-76 (cited in D. Stuart, Canadian Criminal Law:  A Treatise
(6th ed. 2011), at pp. 20-21):

. . .  Nullum crimen sine
lege, Nulla poena sine lege ― that there must be no crime or
punishment except in accordance with fixed, predetermined law ― this has
been regarded by most thinkers as a self-evident principle of justice ever
since the French Revolution.  The citizen must be able to ascertain beforehand
how he stands with regard to the criminal law; otherwise to punish him for
breach of that law is purposeless cruelty. . . .  

 

. .
. “Law” for this purpose means a body of fixed rules; and it excludes wide
discretion even though that discretion be exercised by independent judges.  The
principle of legality involves rejecting “criminal equity” as a mode of
extending the law.

[34]                         
This does not mean that an individual must know
with certainty whether a particular course of conduct will ultimately result in
a conviction of the crime that prohibits such conduct.  What it does mean is
that the essential elements of the crime must be ascertainable in advance.  If
an accused must wait “until a
court decides what the contours and parameters of the offence are then the
accused is being treated unfairly and contrary to the principles of fundamental
justice”:  Manning, at pp. 75-76.

[35]                         
Individuals are nonetheless expected to refrain
from conduct that tests the boundaries of criminal law lest they bear the
consequences of the risk they have knowingly assumed: see Canadian
Foundation for Children, at para. 42.  Understandably, the appellant
acknowledges that the Constitution contemplates a necessary degree of
imprecision in this regard.  She submits, however, that such imprecision is
unconstitutional if it requires individuals to refrain from constitutionally
protected conduct.  

[36]                         
The appellant argues that s. 243  must explicitly
draw a dividing line between miscarriages and stillbirths lest a woman feel
compelled by her uncertainty to give up more of her Charter -protected
privacy than necessary.  In effect, the appellant urges the Court to modify the
well-established vagueness standard by introducing an additional factor into
the vagueness analysis:  the potential chilling impact of the impugned
provision on Charter -protected interests.  I would decline this
invitation to vary the governing analytical framework established by the
Court.  

[37]                         
The rule against unconstitutional vagueness is
primarily intended to assure the intelligibility of the criminal law to those
who are subject to its sanctions and to those who are charged with its
enforcement.  As this Court stated in Ontario v. Canadian Pacific Ltd.,
[1995] 2 S.C.R. 1031, at para. 82: 

In the
context of vagueness, proportionality plays no role in the analysis.  There is
no need to compare the purpose of the law with its effects (as in overbreadth)
. . . . A court is required to perform its interpretive function, in order to
determine whether an impugned provision provides the basis for legal debate. 

[38]                         
This does not mean that the impact of s. 243  on
a woman’s privacy interests is irrelevant to its constitutionality.  However,
it is important to maintain the analytical distinction between true vagueness
and the additional vagueness concern raised by the appellant.  The latter, in
my view, is more appropriately considered an aspect of overbreadth and dealt
with in that context.  As the respondent rightly points out, failing to do so
would create a “lopsided” analysis that “takes account of individual interests
. . . without equal regard to the law’s objectives”: R.F., at para. 63.   

[39]                         
As this Court held in Nova Scotia
Pharmaceutical, “once the minimal general standard has been met, any
further arguments as to the precision of the enactments should be considered at
the ‘minimal impairment’ stage of s. 1 analysis” (p. 643).  Or, in this
case, where no Charter  violation has yet been established and there is
therefore no need to consider s. 1, additional precision-based arguments
relating to the scope of the provision should be considered in an overbreadth
analysis.  

[40]                         
Where a law meets the minimum standard of
precision required by the Charter , it may nevertheless by
“[g]enerality and imprecision of language . . . fail to confine the invasion of
a Charter  right within reasonable limits.  In this sense vagueness is an
aspect of overbreadth”: Osborne v. Canada (Treasury Board), [1991] 2
S.C.R. 69, at pp. 94-95.  

[41]                         
Given that the appellant’s overbreadth arguments
were rejected by both courts below and not raised on this appeal, there is no
proper basis to revisit the issue here.

[42]                         
I turn then to the question at the heart of this
appeal:  Does s. 243 sufficiently limit enforcement discretion and provide
citizens with fair notice of the type of conduct that risks criminal sanction? 
As mentioned at the outset, I believe that it does.

V

[43]                         
Section 243 states:

243. Every one who in any manner disposes of the dead body of a child,
with intent to conceal the fact that its mother has been delivered of it,
whether the child died before, during or after birth, is guilty of an
indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two
years.

[44]                         
A plain reading of its text makes clear that s.
243 is focused on the event of birth.  The phrase “before, during or after
birth” leaves no room for doubt in this regard.  Indeed the parties agree that
in its application to a child that died before birth, s. 243 applies
only to stillbirths ― not to miscarriages or abortions: see A.F., at
paras. 3-4.

[45]                         
Despite this clear connection to the event of
birth, the appellant argues that the word “before” renders s. 243 vague because
it does not clearly distinguish a birth from a miscarriage.  In other words, a
woman may not know whether she has miscarried and is therefore outside the
scope of s. 243, or has instead experienced a stillbirth and may therefore be
caught by s. 243.  From the appellant’s perspective, the transition point
between miscarriage and stillbirth is critical.  It represents the moment when
a fetus becomes a child and therefore delineates the boundary between
permissible and criminal conduct: only the concealment of the body of a child
is caught by s. 243.

[46]                         
Thus, the central vagueness question is whether
s. 243 sufficiently identifies the moment on the gestational spectrum when a
miscarriage becomes a stillbirth.  The answer to this question does not lie
entirely and exclusively in the text of s. 243.

[47]                         
A court can conclude that a law is
unconstitutionally vague only after exhausting its interpretive function.  The
court “must first develop the full interpretive context surrounding an impugned
provision”: Canadian Pacific, at paras. 47 and 79.  

[48]                         
To develop a provision’s “full interpretive
context”, this Court has considered: (i) prior judicial interpretations; (ii)
the legislative purpose; (iii) the subject matter and nature of the impugned
provision; (iv) societal values; and (v) related legislative provisions: Canadian
Pacific, at paras. 47 and 87.  

[49]                         
Relevant jurisprudence as to the scope of this
offence dates back over 150 years to the English case of Berriman.  Ms.
Berriman was charged with concealing the birth of her child.  The police linked
Ms. Berriman to the “half calcined” bones of a baby with a gestational age of
seven to nine months.  Erle J. instructed the jury not to convict if the fetus
could have had no “chance of life”:

This offence cannot be
committed unless the child had arrived at that stage of maturity at the time of
birth, that it might have been a living child. It is not necessary that it
should have been born alive, but it must have reached a period when, but for
some accidental circumstances, such as disease on the part of itself or of its
mother, it might have been born alive.  There is no law which compels a
woman to proclaim her own want of chastity, and if she had miscarried at a time
when the fœtus was but a few months old, and therefore could have had no chance
of life, you could not convict her upon this charge. No specific limit can be assigned
to the period when the chance of life begins, but it may, perhaps, be safely
assumed that under seven months the great probably [sic] is that the
child would not be born alive. [p. 390] 

[50]                         
According to this test, an accused could only be
convicted of child concealment if he or she, with the intent to conceal its
birth, disposed of the body of a child that had reached a point of development
where, “but for some accidental circumstances . . . it might have been born
alive”.  

[51]                         
Berriman suggests
that an unborn child of at least seven months is more likely than not to be
born alive.  By setting seven months as a guideline ― rather than a
bright line ― the court in that case recognized that a child’s chance of
being born alive will generally increase along the gestational spectrum but is
not necessarily predictable based on the gestational age of the fetus alone.  

[52]                         
I would in any case hesitate to import into s.
243 a fixed threshold based on gestational age that Parliament has so far
chosen to omit.

[53]                         
In my view, s. 243 is informed by Berriman.


[54]                         
However, where Erle J. found it sufficient in Berriman
that the fetus “might have been born alive”, I would adopt a likelihood
requirement instead.  I agree with the Court of Appeal that, for the purposes
of s. 243, a fetus becomes a child when the fetus “has reached a stage in its
development when, but for some external event or other circumstances, it would
likely have been born alive” (para. 115 (emphasis added)).

[55]                         
This “likelihood” standard best comports with
the late term focus of s. 243 and thus affords greater certainty in its
application.

[56]                         
To support a conviction under s. 243, it must be
shown that the “remains” disposed of were the remains of a child.  In cases
involving death before birth, the burden is therefore on the Crown to prove
that the fetus would likely have been born alive.

[57]                         
This brings me to another important aspect of a
full contextual interpretation of s. 243: its legislative purpose and context. 

[58]                         
The parties agree that
s. 243 is largely concerned with facilitating the investigation of homicides. 
In order to do so, s. 243 must cover potential victims of homicide.

[59]                         
Pursuant to s. 222(1) ,
the homicide provisions of the Criminal Code  apply only when the victim
is a human being.  And pursuant to s. 223(1) of the Code, a child
becomes a human being “when it has completely proceeded, in a living state,
from the body of its mother, whether or not (a) it has breathed; (b)
it has an independent circulation; or (c) the navel string is severed”.

[60]                         
In order to facilitate
the investigation of homicides, s. 243 must therefore apply to children that
were either born alive or were likely to be born alive and thus capable of
satisfying the Criminal Code  definition of a human being in s. 223(1) . 
As the trial judge reasoned at para. 156:

. . . allowing persons to conduct
themselves as though pregnancy terminated in still-birth, and to say so if
challenged, all without reliable government certification, amounts to an easy
and unacceptable escape for those inclined to eliminate a new-born infant by
killing it. Unchecked and unreviewable disposal of a still-born child
effectively defeats the state’s ability to verify that death preceded live
birth.  

[61]                         
Accordingly, a likelihood
approach to s. 243 ― that is, requiring evidence that the child would
likely have been born alive ― serves its goal of facilitating the
investigation of potential homicides. 

[62]                         
That said, to fully
achieve its purpose, s. 243 must also facilitate the investigation of ss. 238 
and 242 , which both contemplate the death of a child that has not yet become a
human being within the meaning of s. 223(1)  of the Criminal Code .

[63]                         
Section 238  prohibits
killing an unborn child in the act of birth and s. 242  proscribes the failure
to obtain assistance in childbirth, resulting in permanent injury or death
immediately before, during, or a short time after birth.  

[64]                         
To facilitate the
investigation of these offences, the pre-birth application of s. 243 is appropriately
limited to fetuses that were likely to have been born alive ― that is
children, not fetuses that were miscarried.

[65]                         
This likelihood approach
is also consistent with s. 662(4)  of the Criminal Code , which, on a
charge of murder or infanticide, permits a conviction under s. 243  where
neither murder nor infanticide is made out, but the evidence proves the
requisite elements of s. 243 .  

[66]                         
When considered in light of s. 662(4) , it is
clear that the pre-birth application of s. 243 is not intended to reach back
beyond the delivery of a child that would likely have been born alive.  Rather,
its application to a child that died before birth simply ensures that the law
can respond to criminal conduct against newly born infants in cases where the
evidence does not establish that death occurred post-birth.

[67]                         
By facilitating the investigation of the
offences discussed above, s. 243 ultimately serves to protect children born
alive and a subset of children that died before birth.  The parties agree that
Parliament can properly legislate with respect to both.  As we have seen, the
appellant explicitly concedes that Parliament may “enact legislation which has
application to the concealment of a fetus at some stages of development prior
to live birth”.

[68]                         
With regard to newly born
children, the importance of s. 243 is clear.  As expressed in the Goudge
Report, vol. 1, at p. 4,[2]
society is gravely concerned with investigating offences committed against
society’s youngest:

For the
community itself, the death of a child in criminally suspicious circumstances
is deeply disturbing.  Children are the community’s most precious and most
defenceless asset.  The sense of outrage and the urgent need to understand what
happened are overwhelming.

[69]                         
Bearing its purposes in mind, the pre-birth application
of s. 243 is appropriately limited to fetuses that were likely to have been
born alive.  In the words of the respondent, the crime of concealment is
“limited by the clear late term focus of the offences s. 243 is supporting”:
R.F., at para. 50.   

[70]                         
The appellant argues, however, that even if we
describe a child that died before birth as a fetus that would likely
have been born alive, s. 243 remains vague because an accused is dependent on
expert medical evidence to know whether a fetus was, in fact, likely to have
been born alive.  

[71]                         
Indeed, the doctrine against vagueness cannot be
satisfied by inaccessible laws.  It is not enough for laws to provide guidance
to legal experts; laws, as judicially interpreted, must be sufficiently
intelligible to guide ordinary citizens on how to conduct themselves within
legal boundaries.  As McLachlin C.J. explained in Mabior (in a passage
more fully set out above): “It is a fundamental requirement of the rule of law
that a person should be able to predict whether a particular act constitutes a
crime at the time he commits the act” (para. 14).  

[72]                         
Nonetheless, reliance on expert evidence is not
necessarily fatal to the constitutionality of a provision.  Section 243 is by
no means the only offence that relies on expert evidence to determine whether
an offence was committed.  For example, without the benefit of a breathalyser,
individuals may not know whether they have consumed an amount of alcohol that
would bring them over the legal limit.  Similarly, in some murder cases an
accused may not know, without expert medical evidence, whether his or her conduct
actually caused the victim’s death.  

[73]                         
Expert evidence cannot serve to define the
elements of an offence, but only to help the court determine whether the
elements are made out on the facts of a particular charge.  In the case of s.
243, expert evidence can thus be relied on to establish as a matter of fact
that the disposed-of remains were those of a child that was likely to be born
alive ― an essential element of the offence.

[74]                         
Even if s. 243 provided a detailed description
of the precise moment on the gestational spectrum where a miscarriage becomes a
stillbirth, as the appellant suggests it should, medical evidence would often
be required in any event.  For example, if s. 243 stated that the concealment
offence only applies to a child that died before birth where the gestational
age is over seven months, what additional certainty would that give a woman who
was unsure of the date of conception?  In such a case, expert medical evidence
regarding gestational age would be required to ascertain whether s. 243 would
capture a decision to keep a failed pregnancy private.  

[75]                         
Similarly, if the word “before” were severed
from s. 243, making it only applicable to a child that died during or after
birth, a woman remains dependent on medical evidence to determine whether her
conduct would fall within s. 243.  As the trial judge noted: “A mother may not
be in the best position to know whether her new-born is alive or dead . . . .” (para. 83).  He went on to explain, at
para. 145: 

Where a
woman who has given birth mistakenly believes the child to be dead and disposes
of the body intending to conceal its birth as opposed to notifying the relevant
authorities, there is no opportunity to correct the mother’s “mistake” and save
the child (see R. v. Bryan (1959), 123 C.C.C. 160 (Ont. C.A.) ―
mother erroneously believed child to be still-born, disposed of body down
garbage chute; baby subsequently dying in incinerator).

[76]                         
Accordingly, under the severed version adopted
by the trial judge that would apply only to deaths that occur during or after
birth, medical evidence would still be required; it would simply relate to the
time of death instead of fetal development.  Clearly, it is the subject matter,
rather than the imprecision of the law, that gives rise to the need for expert
medical evidence.

[77]                         
Finally, the state’s interest in late-term
failed pregnancies is both ascertainable and well established.  Stillbirths are
highly regulated by provincial and territorial legislation: see R.F., at Appendix
D.  The regulations in all provinces and territories impose some kind of
positive obligation to disclose failed pregnancies where the gestational age is
20 weeks or more or where the fetus weighs 500 grams or more: see, for example,
Vital Statistics Act, ss. 1 and 9.1; and associated regulations under
R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 1094, s. 20.  

[78]                         
The foregoing contextual and purposive analysis
persuades me that s. 243 meets the minimum standard of precision required
by the Charter .  In its application to a child that died
before birth, s. 243  only captures the delivery of a child that was likely
to be born alive. 

[79]                         
And I recall in this context that a conviction
would only lie where the Crown proves that the child, to the knowledge of the
accused, would likely have been born alive.

VI

[80]                         
For all the foregoing reasons, I have concluded
that s. 243 does not violate s. 7  of the Charter .  Section 243  gives
women ― and men ― fair notice that they risk prosecution and
conviction if they dispose of the remains of a child born at or near full term
with intent to conceal the fact that its mother had been delivered of it.  And
s. 243 limits with sufficient clarity the discretion of those charged with its
enforcement.  There is thus no need to conduct a s. 1 analysis.  

[81]                         
I would therefore dismiss the appeal and affirm
the order for a new trial.

on appeal from the court of appeal for newfoundland and labrador

                    Criminal
law — Appeals — Unreasonable verdict — Role of appellate court when assessing
reasonableness of verdict based on jury’s assessment of witness credibility — Jury
finding accused guilty of sexual assault — Court of Appeal concluding that
verdict unreasonable and entering acquittal — Whether Court of Appeal applied
proper legal test — Whether verdict unreasonable — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985,
c. C‑46, s. 686(1) (a)(i).

                    A
jury found the accused guilty of sexual assault of his niece which occurred
when she was between the ages of 12 and 14.  At trial, the complainant had
testified about several sexual incidents involving the accused.  The accused
had testified in his own defence and denied any sexual activity with the
complainant.  On appeal, the Court of Appeal was troubled by a number of
inconsistencies in the complainant’s testimony and previous statements.  However,
it noted that nothing appeared from the transcript which should have caused a
juror to question the accused’s truthfulness.  In light of those factors, the
court was of the view that no experienced judge sitting alone would have been
able to provide adequate reasons for the guilty verdict.  The Court of Appeal
concluded that the verdict was unreasonable, set it aside and entered an
acquittal.

                    Held: 
The appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored.

                    A
verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence if it is one
that a properly instructed jury acting judicially could not reasonably have
rendered.  Appellate review of a jury’s verdict of guilt must be conducted
within two well‑established boundaries.  On one hand, the reviewing court
must give due weight to the advantages of the jury as the trier of fact who was
present throughout the trial and saw and heard the evidence as it unfolded.  The
reviewing court must not act as a “13th juror” or simply give effect to vague
unease or lurking doubt based on its own review of the written record or find
that a verdict is unreasonable simply because the reviewing court has a
reasonable doubt based on its review of the record.  On the other hand,
however, the review cannot be limited to assessing the sufficiency of the
evidence.  A positive answer to the question of whether there is some evidence
which, if believed, supports the conviction does not exhaust the role of the
reviewing court.  Rather, the court is required to review, analyse and, within
the limits of appellate disadvantage, weigh the evidence and consider through
the lens of judicial experience, whether judicial fact‑finding precludes
the conclusion reached by the jury.  Thus, in deciding whether the verdict is
one which a properly instructed jury acting judicially could reasonably have
rendered, the reviewing court must ask not only whether there is evidence in
the record to support the verdict, but also whether the jury’s conclusion
conflicts with the bulk of judicial experience.

                    The
traditional test for unreasonable verdict applies to cases such as this one in
which the verdict is based on an assessment of witness credibility.  In
applying the test, the court of appeal must show great deference to the trier
of fact’s assessment of witness credibility given the advantage it has in
seeing and hearing the witnesses’ evidence.  This applies with particular force
to verdicts reached by juries. It is for the jury to decide, notwithstanding
difficulties with a witness’s evidence, how much, if any, of the testimony it
accepts.  Credibility assessment does not depend solely on objective
considerations such as inconsistencies or motive for concoction; accordingly, the
jury is entitled to decide how much weight it gives to such factors.  The
reviewing court must be deferential to the collective good judgment and common
sense of the jury.  While appellate review for unreasonableness of guilty
verdicts is a powerful safeguard against wrongful convictions, it is also one
that must be exercised with great deference to the fact‑finding role of
the jury.  Trial by jury must not become trial by appellate court on the
written record.

                    The
Court of Appeal in this case applied the wrong legal test and, in carrying out
its review of the jury’s verdict, failed to give sufficient deference to the
jury’s assessment of witness credibility.  The test to be applied by courts of
appeal in reviewing guilty verdicts for unreasonableness does not involve the
reviewing court attempting to put itself in the place of an imaginary trial
judge and on a review of the written record asking whether that imaginary judge
could have articulated legally adequate reasons for conviction.  The Court of
Appeal’s adoption of this new test resulted in its failure to take a
sufficiently deferential approach to the findings of the jury viewed, as they
must be, in the context of the whole of the evidence.

                    The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

                    Cromwell J. — 

I.       Overview and Issue

[1]                             
A jury found the respondent guilty of sexual
assault, but the Court of Appeal concluded that the jury’s finding was
unreasonable, set it aside and entered an acquittal. The Crown appeals, arguing
that the Court of Appeal wrongly substituted its assessment of witness
credibility for that of the jury. The appeal therefore raises the issue of an
appellate court’s role when it assesses the reasonableness of a jury’s guilty
verdict based on the jury’s assessment of witness credibility.

[2]                             
Of course, a jury’s guilty verdict based on the
jury’s assessment of witness credibility is not immune from appellate review
for reasonableness.  However, the reviewing court must treat the verdict with
great deference. The court must ask itself whether the jury’s verdict is
supportable on any reasonable view of the evidence and whether proper
judicial fact-finding applied to the evidence precludes the conclusion
reached by the jury. Here, the Court of Appeal did not follow this approach. It
asked itself instead whether an experienced trial judge could give adequate
reasons to explain the finding of guilt and, having answered that question in
the negative, found the verdict unreasonable. In my respectful view, the Court
of Appeal applied the wrong legal test and reached the wrong conclusion.

[3]                             
I would allow the appeal and restore the
conviction entered at trial.  

II.     Facts and Proceedings

A.     Overview of the Facts

[4]                             
The respondent was charged with sexual assault
of and sexual interference with his niece when she was between the ages of 12
and 14. The jury found the respondent guilty. The trial judge entered a
conviction for sexual assault but stayed the sexual interference count because
it was based on the same factual and legal foundation:  see Kienapple v. The
Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729; R. v. S.J.M., 2009 ONCA 244, 247 O.A.C.
178. The background as it emerged at trial is this.

[5]                             
The complainant’s parents separated when she was
nine years old. Her mother moved to Ontario while she continued to live with
her father in a small town in Newfoundland and Labrador.  Their home was next
door to the respondent and his wife, who is her father’s sister. When her
father was away for work, the respondent and his wife were responsible for her
care and even when her father was home, they would regularly all have supper
together.

[6]                             
The complainant testified that she was prompted
to disclose the respondent’s conduct towards her by an incident in June 2008. 
She had missed the school bus and asked the respondent to drive her to school. 
During the drive, the respondent began to talk to her about sex and said, “all
you have to do is say the word and I’ll make love to you”: A.R., vol. II, at p.
47.  Later that day or the next day, the complainant called her mother in
Ontario and told her about this incident. She then flew to Ontario to be with
her mother.  Her mother took her to a doctor who made a referral to child
protection authorities which in turn led to police involvement. In late July,
her mother accompanied her to the Port Elgin police station to make an initial
videotaped statement in which she described one incident. 

[7]                             
At trial, the respondent also testified about an
incident in June.  He agreed to drive the complainant to school after she
missed her bus.  He testified that he spoke to her about being careful not to
become pregnant, a conversation he said was prompted by MSN blog messages she
had written using his computer and the respondent’s concern about the sexual
nature of the messages and her use of alcohol.  According to the respondent,
the complainant did not want to talk about it and when she got out of the car,
told him it was none of his business and slammed the car door.  The respondent
did not tell his wife or the complainant’s father about his concerns or about
the door-slamming incident.

[8]                             
RCMP officers in Newfoundland became involved in
the investigation in late July 2008.  RCMP Constable Paul Hierlihy reviewed the
initial videotaped statement from Ontario but was not satisfied with the way
the interview had been conducted. He therefore arranged for RCMP Constable Lisa
Norman, who had received training in interviewing child victims of sexual
abuse, to re-interview the complainant in Ontario.  

[9]                             
Cst. Norman testified that the complainant’s initial
statement to Port Elgin police was conducted in the police station, with four
persons present (the interviewing male police officer, a social worker, the
complainant and her mother). In Cst. Norman’s experience, interviewing an
alleged child victim of sexual assault in the presence of her mother is not
always helpful because it is not a topic that children are comfortable talking
about.  She saw no need for the presence of a social worker and noted that
“sometimes it helps talking to a female” officer: A.R., vol. I, at p. 196. She
agreed with Cst. Hierlihy’s assessment that the original statement was vague
and had a lot of “I don’t remembers” and, in her view, there was not a good
rapport between the interviewing officer and the complainant who appeared not
to have been comfortable at that time. 

[10]                         
In November 2008, Cst. Norman conducted her
interview one-on-one with the complainant in a private hotel conference room,
in order to avoid the police station which is sometimes “intimidating”: A.R.,
vol. I, at p. 197. During this interview, the complainant described more incidents
than she had in her initial statement. When Cst. Norman asked her about this,
the complainant told her that she had not felt comfortable with the male
officer and that she had not wanted to talk about it in front of her mother.

[11]                         
At trial, the complainant testified about
several sexual incidents involving the respondent. Her evidence was that one
incident occurred in the respondent’s car, when he placed his hand between the
complainant’s legs and touched her vagina; another in the computer room in the
respondent’s home when he placed his hand on her left breast over her clothing;
and another in the kitchen of the respondent’s home while the respondent’s wife
was present in the room when the respondent touched the complainant’s breast
over her clothing. The complainant also referred to an occasion on which the
respondent had asked her if she was mad at him, and said, “You know I love you
and I wouldn’t do anything to you like that”: A.R., vol. II, at p. 45. But she
could not remember why he had said that.

[12]                         
The respondent testified in his own defence and
denied any sexual activity with the complainant. The respondent’s wife echoed
the respondent’s testimony. The respondent’s brother and nephew testified that
the complainant was quite affectionate towards the respondent, that she seemed
comfortable when she was around him and, generally, that the respondent and the
complainant seemed to enjoy a good relationship.

B.     The Trial Judge’s Instructions to the Jury

[13]                         
The parties agree that the trial judge’s
instructions to the jury were error-free.  She gave the usual instructions with
respect to credibility and truthfulness generally, including the direction that
the jury could believe or disbelieve all or parts of anything a witness said in
the witness box. She specifically addressed the young age of the victim and
instructed the jury that they could consider this factor along with lapse of
time in dealing with minor discrepancies in the complainant’s testimony. She
however specified that lying under oath was serious and could taint the entire
testimony of a witness. The trial judge stressed the fact that this case was
about credibility and noted that there was no other direct evidence supporting
the complainant’s allegations. She gave a thorough summary of the evidence of
the complainant and the respondent and clearly drew the jury’s attention to the
inconsistencies between the complainant’s testimony and that of other witnesses
and her own previous statements.  

[14]                         
The trial judge directed the jury that it was
“essential that the credibility and reliability of [the complainant’s] evidence
be tested in the light of all the other evidence”: A.R., vol. I, at p. 69.  She
reviewed in detail the position of the defence that the complainant was not
telling the truth, referring to several points at which her recollections were
not consistent. The trial judge also noted that the defence theory was that the
complainant lied because she wanted her mother to return to Newfoundland so
that they could live together. She also reviewed in detail the position of the
Crown, noting that the motive to lie alleged by the defence was never put to
the complainant directly and further that her evidence was that she could have
left Newfoundland to live with her mother at any time.

[15]                         
The jury returned a verdict of guilty on both
counts.

C.     The Judgment of the Court of Appeal, 2011 NLCA 59, 312 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 12 (per Barry J.A., Wells
and White JJ.A. Concurring)

[16]                         
The Court of Appeal concluded that the jury’s
verdict was unreasonable, set it aside and acquitted the respondent.  The court
stated that in conducting a review for unreasonableness, “the appellate court
draws its own inference from the evidence admitted at trial as to the reasoning
process of the jury and determines whether this could have been logical or
rational in light of the verdict being reviewed. . . . If no reasonable process
of analysis by a judge could justify conviction in the circumstances of the
case, an appellate court will be justified in concluding a jury must not have
acted judicially in convicting”:  paras. 47 and 52. 

[17]                         
After reviewing the record, the court concluded
that the verdict was unreasonable because “[a]n experienced judge sitting
alone, with the evidence presented in this case, would not be able to provide
adequate reasons to explain how he or she could be convinced beyond a
reasonable doubt of the accused’s guilt in light of the credibility concerns
arising from the unexplained inconsistencies and improbabilities arising from
the complainant’s testimony and statements”: para. 75.

[18]                         
The Court of Appeal was troubled by a number of
inconsistencies in the complainant’s testimony and statements, even taking into
account “all explanations given by her for those inconsistencies”: para. 64.

[19]                         
First, the Court of Appeal was concerned by
inconsistencies regarding the number and nature of the incidents between the
complainant’s trial evidence and her initial disclosure. The complainant
described only a single and different incident to her mother, father and to the
male police officer when she first came forward. As noted earlier, when the
complainant later spoke to a female police officer, she described more
incidents as she did at trial. The court noted that the complainant said that
she felt more comfortable speaking alone to the female RCMP constable and
wanted to avoid the embarrassment of speaking in the presence of her mother. 
However, the court reasoned that “[d]iscomfort and embarrassment may help
explain omitted incidents [but] they do not adequately explain her express
denial that any other incidents had occurred”: para. 66. The court was also
concerned that the complainant “contradicted herself somewhat in her
explanation in that at the preliminary inquiry she had said her memory had
improved between the first and second police interviews while at trial she said
she had deliberately decided not to discuss all incidents”: para. 66.

[20]                         
A second matter referred to by the Court of
Appeal as creating a “serious concern about [the complainant’s] truthfulness
overall” (para. 67) was this: the complainant told the male police officer at
the initial interview that the only incident happened in the respondent’s home
and nowhere else. But she testified at trial that the most serious incident
happened in the respondent’s vehicle. She explained this inconsistency by
saying that she felt discomfort speaking to a male police officer in her
mother’s presence. With regard to the complainant’s explanation of this
inconsistency, the Court of Appeal indicated that “discomfort would go somewhat
towards explaining omissions but does not adequately explain her express denial
of other locations”: para. 67.

[21]                         
A further point which troubled the Court of
Appeal was the fact that in her initial statement to the male police officer, the
complainant had said that the respondent had been alone in the house when she
had been assaulted, while she later said that the respondent’s wife had been
present on one occasion in the same room and that the respondent’s wife and the
complainant’s father had been present on another occasion in a different room
but within hearing range.  This unexplained discrepancy left the Court of
Appeal with “an additional question regarding her credibility”: para. 68.

[22]                         
The Court of Appeal also found that various
inconsistencies regarding the complainant’s nervousness about being alone
around the respondent raised “significant concerns about her credibility”:
para. 71. These included: the complainant’s father’s denial of the
complainant’s testimony that she had told him she did not want to go to her uncle’s
home; the complainant’s willingness to continue having interactions with the
respondent even after the incidents; and the fact that the complainant declared
at the preliminary inquiry that she was not afraid to be alone with her uncle in
his car yet she had told police in a prior statement that she was “frightened
to death” to drive alone with him: para. 70. 

[23]                         
In the Court of Appeal’s view, the complainant’s
inability to give any detail regarding the nature of the other incident which
she vaguely recalled added “some slight additional doubt regarding her
credibility”: para. 73.

[24]                         
The Court of Appeal concluded that by virtue of
these “unexplained inconsistencies and improbabilities alone, the credibility
of the complainant was damaged to the extent that it is questionable whether a
jury acting judicially could reasonably have convicted”: para. 74. The court
noted that in addition, a jury acting judicially has to consider the
complainant’s testimony in the context of the respondent’s denial of all her allegations.
 In the court’s view, “[n]othing appears from the transcript which should have
caused a juror to question his truthfulness”: para. 74. In light of the
complainant’s testimony and the apparently plausible denial of the accused, the
court was of the view that no experienced judge sitting alone would have been
able to provide adequate reasons for the guilty verdict. The Court of Appeal
concluded that the jury could not have been acting judicially in reaching a
guilty verdict and that the verdict was therefore unreasonable. 

III.    Analysis

A.     The Scope of Review for “Unreasonableness” of a Jury
Verdict: Basic Principles

[25]                         
A person convicted of an indictable offence has
broad avenues of appeal.  There is a right of appeal on any question of law
alone and an appeal by leave of the court on questions of fact or mixed law and
fact or on “any ground of appeal . . . that appears to the court of appeal to
be a sufficient ground of appeal”: Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46,
s. 675(1) (a). However, as broad as the access to appellate review is, a
court of appeal may only overturn a conviction on three grounds: that the
verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence, that there was
an error of law at trial or that there was a miscarriage of justice: s. 686(1)(a)
of the Code.  This appeal concerns only the first of these grounds (s.
686(1) (a)(i)).

[26]                         
A verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported
by the evidence if it is one that a properly instructed jury acting judicially
could not reasonably have rendered: R. v. Yebes, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168, at
p. 185; R. v. Biniaris, 2000 SCC 15, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381, at para. 36. 
While the same test was traditionally applied to verdicts by both juries and
trial judges, the more recent jurisprudence from the Court has expanded
somewhat the scope of review for unreasonableness in the case of verdicts
reached by trial judges: R. v. Beaudry, 2007 SCC 5, [2007] 1
S.C.R. 190;  R. v. Sinclair, 2011 SCC 40, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 3. This
development recognizes a practical distinction between reasonableness review of
a trial judge’s verdict and of a jury verdict: judges, unlike juries, give
reasons for their findings which the appellate court may review and consider as
part of its reasonableness analysis.  However, this expanded reasonableness
review of verdicts entered by trial judges does not apply to
reasonableness review of a jury verdict. 

[27]                         
Appellate review of a jury’s verdict of guilt
must be conducted within two well-established boundaries. On one hand, the
reviewing court must give due weight to the advantages of the jury as the trier
of fact who was present throughout the trial and saw and heard the evidence as
it unfolded. The reviewing court must not act as a “13th juror” or simply give
effect to vague unease or lurking doubt based on its own review of the written
record or find that a verdict is unreasonable simply because the reviewing
court has a reasonable doubt based on its review of the record.

[28]                         
On the other hand, however, the review cannot be
limited to assessing the sufficiency of the evidence. A positive answer to the
question of whether there is some evidence which, if believed, supports the
conviction does not exhaust the role of the reviewing court.  Rather, the court
is required “to review, analyse and, within the limits of appellate
disadvantage, weigh the evidence” (Biniaris, at para. 36) and
consider through the lens of judicial experience, whether “judicial
fact-finding precludes the conclusion reached by the jury”: para.
39 (emphasis added). Thus, in deciding whether the verdict is one which a
properly instructed jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered, the
reviewing court must ask not only whether there is evidence in the record to
support the verdict, but also whether the jury’s conclusion conflicts with the
bulk of judicial experience:  Biniaris, at para. 40.

[29]                         
While it is not possible to catalogue
exhaustively the sorts of cases in which accumulated judicial experience may
suggest that a jury’s verdict is unreasonable, a number of examples may be
offered.  Circumstances in which a special caution to the jury is
necessary about a certain witness or a certain type of evidence are reflective
of accumulated judicial experience and may well factor into an appellate
court’s review for reasonableness.  Some examples include the evidence of
jailhouse informants and accomplices, and eyewitness identification evidence. 
Other circumstances that generally do not require, as a matter of law, any
particular warning to the jury may nonetheless, in light of
accumulated judicial experience, contribute to a conclusion of an unreasonable
verdict, for example the risks of accepting bizarre allegations of a sexual
nature and the risk of prejudice in relation to psychiatric defences:  Biniaris,
at para. 41. What all of these examples have in common is that accumulated
judicial experience has demonstrated that they constitute an explicit and
precise circumstance that creates a risk of an unjust conviction. 

B.     Unreasonable Verdicts and Credibility Assessment

[30]                         
The traditional test for unreasonable verdict
applies to cases such as this one in which the verdict is based on an
assessment of witness credibility.  This was affirmed, in the context of a
judge-alone trial, in R. v. W. (R.), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122, at p. 131.
However, in applying the test, the court of appeal must show great deference to
the trier of fact’s assessment of witness credibility given the advantage it
has in seeing and hearing the witnesses’ evidence: W. (R.), at p. 131. 

[31]                         
This point was underlined in R. v. C. (R.),
[1993] 2 S.C.R. 226, also a judge-alone case, in which the Court approved the
dissenting reasons of Rothman J.A. in the Court of Appeal: (1992), 49 Q.A.C.
37.  Rothman J.A. noted, at para. 16:

Credibility
is, of course, a question of fact and it cannot be determined by fixed rules.
Ultimately, it is a matter that must be left to the common sense of the trier
of fact . . . .

[32]                         
This counsel of caution applies with particular
force to verdicts reached by juries. In R. v. François, [1994] 2 S.C.R.
827, McLachlin J. (as she then was) reiterated that the general rule enunciated
in Yebes “also applies to cases where the objection
to the conviction is based on credibility — where it is suggested that
testimony which the jury must have believed to render its verdict is so
incredible that a verdict founded upon it must be unreasonable”: pp. 835-36. 
There are a number of points in François that are particularly relevant
to this case:

1.         It is for the jury to decide, notwithstanding
difficulties with a witness’s evidence, how much, if any, of the testimony it
accepts. As McLachlin J. put it, at p. 836: 

More problematic is a challenge to
credibility based on the witness’s alleged lack of truthfulness and sincerity,
the problem posed in this appeal.  The reasoning here is that the witness may
not have been telling the truth for a variety of reasons, whether because of
inconsistencies in the witness’s stories at different times, because certain
facts may have been suggested to her, or because she may have had reason to
concoct her accusations.  In the end, the jury must decide whether, despite
such factors, it believes the witness’s story, in whole or in part.  

2.         Credibility assessment does not depend solely on
objective considerations such as inconsistencies or motives for concoction.  As
McLachlin J. said in François, at pp. 836-37:

[Credibility] turns not only upon such
factors as the assessment of the significance of any alleged inconsistencies or
motives for concoction, which may be susceptible of reasoned review by a court
of appeal, but on the demeanour of the witness and the common sense of the
jury, which cannot be assessed by the court of appeal.  The latter
domain is the “advantage” possessed by the trier of fact, be it judge or jury,
which the court of appeal does not possess and which the court of appeal must
bear in mind in deciding whether the verdict is unreasonable: R. v. W.
(R.), supra. [Emphasis added.]

3.         The jury is entitled to decide how much weight to give to
factors such as inconsistency and motive to concoct. Particularly where the
complainant offers an explanation for inconsistencies, the jury may reasonably
conclude that those inconsistencies lose “their power to raise a reasonable
doubt with respect to the accused’s guilt”: François, at p. 839. Again
in François, at p. 837, the Court said this: 

In
considering the reasonableness of the jury’s verdict, the court of appeal must
also keep in mind the fact that the jury may reasonably and lawfully deal
with inconsistencies and motive to concoct, in a variety of ways.  The jury
may reject the witness’s evidence in its entirety.  Or the jury may accept the
witness’s explanations for the apparent inconsistencies and the witness’s
denial that her testimony was provoked by improper pressures or from improper
motives.  Finally, the jury may accept some of the witness’s evidence while
rejecting other parts of it; juries are routinely charged that they may accept
all of the evidence, some of the evidence, or none of the evidence of each
witness.  It follows that we cannot infer from the mere presence of
contradictory details or motives to concoct that the jury’s verdict is
unreasonable.  A verdict of guilty based on such evidence may very well be both
reasonable and lawful. [Emphasis added.]

4.         To sum up, the reviewing court must be deferential to the
collective good judgment and common sense of the jury. As stated in François,
“the court of appeal reviewing for unreasonableness must keep in mind . . .
that the jury may bring to the difficult business of determining where the
truth lies special qualities which appellate courts may not share”: p. 837. 

[33]                         
R. v. Burke,
[1996] 1 S.C.R. 474, and R. v. R.P., 2012 SCC 22, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 746,
while judge-alone cases, further underline the great deference which must be
shown by the appellate court to the trial court’s assessment of credibility. In
the latter case, Deschamps J., for the majority, reiterated the applicable
principle as follows:

Whereas the
question whether a verdict is reasonable is one of law, whether a witness is
credible is a question of fact.  A court of appeal that reviews a trial
court’s assessments of credibility in order to determine, for example, whether
the verdict is reasonable cannot interfere with those assessments unless it is
established that they “cannot be supported on any reasonable view of the
evidence” (R. v. Burke, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 474, at para. 7). [Emphasis
added; para. 10.]

[34]                         
Perhaps the most useful articulations of the
test for present purposes are those found in Biniaris and Burke. 
In the former case, Arbour J. put it this way: “. . . the unreasonableness . .
. of the verdict would be apparent to the legally trained reviewer when, in all
the circumstances of a given case, judicial fact-finding precludes the
conclusion reached by the jury”: para. 39 (emphasis added). In the latter,
Sopinka J. concluded that a verdict based on credibility assessment is
unreasonable if “the trial court’s assessments of credibility cannot be
supported on any reasonable view of the evidence”: para. 7
(emphasis added). While appellate review for unreasonableness of guilty
verdicts is a powerful safeguard against wrongful convictions, it is also one
that must be exercised with great deference to the fact-finding role of the
jury.  Trial by jury must not become trial by appellate court on the written
record.

C.     Application to the Facts of This Case 

[35]                         
In my respectful view, the Court of Appeal in
this case applied the wrong legal test and, in carrying out its review of the
jury’s verdict, failed to give sufficient deference to the jury’s assessment of
witness credibility.

[36]                         
To turn first to the legal test, the Court of
Appeal fashioned a new approach to its task by drawing on the law relating to
the sufficiency of a trial judge’s reasons for conviction.  Noting that in a
judge-alone trial the trial judge must provide reasons which are responsive to
the case’s live issues and the parties’ key arguments, the Court of Appeal then
stated: 

A court of
appeal, in reviewing the reasonableness of a jury’s decision, must consider
what would be entailed in the process of analysis by a judge to merit the
conclusion that the judge acted judicially.  If no reasonable process of
analysis by a judge could justify conviction in the circumstances of the case,
an appellate court will be justified in concluding a jury must not have acted
judicially in convicting. [para. 52]

[37]                         
Respectfully, this test is wrong in law and in
principle.

[38]                         
As outlined earlier, the test to be applied by
courts of appeal in reviewing guilty verdicts for unreasonableness is clear and
well settled.  It does not involve the reviewing court attempting to put itself
in the place of an imaginary trial judge and on a review of the written record
asking whether that imaginary judge could have articulated legally adequate
reasons for conviction. Not only is this approach contrary to binding
authority, it is also, as I see it, fundamentally flawed. 

[39]                         
One of the main drivers of the great deference
paid to the jury’s findings of credibility is that the jurors were present at
the trial and saw and heard the evidence as it unfolded. The jury’s reasoning
as to what evidence it accepted and what evidence it did not accept may well be
tied directly to factors flowing from that advantage.  Moreover, the
jurisprudence on the sufficiency of reasons recognizes that it is often
difficult if not impossible to articulate with precision the various factors
that influence an ultimate judgment about a witness’s credibility. As McLachlin
C.J. noted in R. v. R.E.M., 2008 SCC 51, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3, at paras.
48-49, referring with approval to the reasons of Bastarache and Abella JJ. in R.
v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 621:

. . . it may be difficult for
a trial judge “to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of
impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and
attempting to reconcile the various versions of events” . . . .

 

. .
. the fact remains that the exercise may not be purely intellectual and may
involve factors that are difficult to verbalize. . . . In short, assessing
credibility is a difficult and delicate matter that does not always lend itself
to precise and complete verbalization.

[40]                         
The Court of Appeal’s test, respectfully, fails
to give any weight to these considerations. It is premised on trying, on the
basis only of the written record, to fashion an explanation for the jury’s
decision.  But that exercise ignores both the inherent difficulty of the
exercise and the main basis for deference to the jury’s assessment of witness
credibility. The advantage of having heard and seen the evidence, while
afforded to the jury, is not afforded to the appellate court in trying to
reconstruct its reasoning on the basis of the written record. 

[41]                         
As the Court stated in François, where it
is suggested that a witness is not telling the truth because of
inconsistencies, because facts may have been suggested to him or her by others
or because he or she may have reason to concoct the accusations, the jury must
in the end decide whether it believes the witness’s story in whole or in part. 
“Th[e] determination turns not only upon such factors as the assessment of the
significance of any alleged inconsistencies or motives for concoction, which
may be susceptible of reasoned review by a court of appeal, but on the demeanour
of the witness and the common sense of the jury, which cannot be assessed by
the court of appeal”: pp. 836-37.

[42]                         
The Court of Appeal’s adoption of this new test
resulted in its failure to take a sufficiently deferential approach to the
findings of the jury viewed, as they must be, in the context of the whole of
the evidence. 

[43]                         
The Court of Appeal’s treatment of the
complainant’s statement to the Port Elgin police will serve as a first example.
Of great concern to the Court of Appeal was the inconsistency between the
complainant’s initial statement and her subsequent statements and testimonies.
Four of the five inconsistencies which the Court of Appeal found to raise
serious questions about the complainant’s credibility are grounded in whole or
in substantial part in that initial statement: the inconsistencies regarding
the number and nature of incidents, the location, who was present and whether
the complainant was nervous about being alone with the respondent. It seems to
me, however, that there are two problems with the Court of Appeal’s approach.

[44]                         
The first is that the court overlooked
potentially significant parts of the evidence about why that initial statement
was not satisfactory. While the court noted that the RCMP was not satisfied
with how the first interview had been conducted, it did not refer to the trial
evidence about why that was the case. As I outlined earlier, the trial evidence
raised a number of specific concerns about the way the first interview had been
conducted: the potentially intimidating police station setting, the use of a
male interviewing officer, the number of persons present, the presence of the
complainant’s mother, the lack of rapport between the interviewing officer and
the complainant and the complainant’s discomfort during the interview. It would
not have been unreasonable for the jury, on the basis of this evidence, to
decide to attach little value to the initial statement by virtue of the
conditions under which it was taken.  If the jury reached that conclusion it
would of course give little weight to any inconsistencies between that initial
statement and the complainant’s later statements and testimonies.

[45]                         
The second difficulty, in my respectful view, is
that the Court of Appeal, in discounting the complainant’s explanation for
these inconsistencies, engaged in speculative reasoning that has no basis in
judicial experience.  The court referred to the complainant’s explanation that
she had been uncomfortable speaking to the male police officer and embarrassed
to discuss these matters in her mother’s presence. The court reasoned, however,
that while discomfort and embarrassment may help explain omitted incidents,
“they do not adequately explain her express denial that any other incidents had
occurred”: para. 66.  Similarly, with respect to the location of one of the
incidents, the court again concluded that while discomfort in the initial
interview would go somewhat towards explaining omissions, it “does not
adequately explain her express denial of other locations”: para. 67.  

[46]                         
Respectfully, I am not aware of any basis in
fact or judicial experience supporting the view that a witness’s discomfort and
embarrassment during an interview may explain some types of inconsistencies but
not others.  Rather, in my view, it was open to the jury to accept the
complainant’s explanation in whole or in part.

[47]                         
The Court of Appeal also wrongly substituted its
views for those of the jury in other respects.  The court simply re-applied, on
the basis of its review of the written record, the test in R. v. W. (D.),
[1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, for assessing reasonable doubt in light of the
respondent’s testimony. It found the respondent’s denial to be plausible
because there was nothing in the transcript to cause it to be questioned and
because the prosecutor could point to nothing remarkable about the respondent’s
demeanour. Respectfully, this reasoning ignores the disadvantages of an
appellate court in relation to these sorts of findings and undermines the
jury’s unique position and special role in assessing witness credibility.

[48]                         
Respectfully, the Court of Appeal, while rightly
conscious of its responsibility to conduct a thorough review of the record,
erred by applying the wrong legal test in carrying out that review. It further
erred by failing to take a sufficiently deferential stance in relation to the
credibility findings made by the jury.

on appeal from the

                    Criminal law — Charge to jury —

trial ordered.

                    APPEAL from a judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal (Thibault and
Rochette JJ.A. and Viens J. (ad hoc)), 2011 QCCA 1203, SOQUIJ
AZ-50763975, [2011] Q.J. No. 8124 (QL), 2011 CarswellQue 15728, upholding the accused’s

                    Sophie Dubé and Caroline Gravel, for the appellant.

                    René
Verret and Jean Campeau, for the respondent.

                    English version of the judgment of the Court delivered
orally by 

[1]                             
LeBel J. — The Court is
unanimously of the view that the appeal should be allowed.  The judge who
presided over the appellant’s trial gave, in response to a specific question
from the jury on being an accessory and being a party to an offence, additional
instructions that were incomplete and confusing.  Moreover, although we need
not rule on this issue for the purposes of this appeal, the nature of the
charges against the appellant raises the question whether it would be possible
to base a conviction for first degree murder under s. 231(5)  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , on the accused being a party to the offence
within the meaning of s. 21(2) . For these reasons, the appeal is allowed, the verdict
of guilty is set aside, and the Court orders that a new trial be held in
respect of the same charges.

                    Judgment accordingly.

on appeal from the ontario superior court of justice

                    Criminal
law — Interception of communications — General warrant — Telecommunications
company employing unique process for transmitting text messages resulting in
messages stored on their computer database for brief period of time — General
warrant requiring telecommunications company to produce all text messages sent
and received by two subscribers on prospective, daily basis — Whether general
warrant power in s. 487.01  of Criminal Code  can authorize prospective
production of future text messages from service provider’s computer — Whether
investigative technique authorized by general warrant in this case is an interception
requiring authorization under Part VI of Criminal Code  — Whether general
warrant may properly issue where substance of investigative technique, if not
its precise form, is addressed by existing legislative provision — Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, s. 487.01 .

                    Unlike
most telecommunications service providers, TELUS Communications Company
routinely makes electronic copies of all the text messages sent or received by
its subscribers and stores them on a computer database for a brief period of
time.  The police in this case obtained a general warrant and related
assistance order under ss. 487.01  and 487.02  of the Criminal Code  requiring
Telus to provide the police with copies of any stored text messages sent or
received by two Telus subscribers.  The relevant part of the warrant required
Telus to produce any messages sent or received during a two‑week period
on a daily basis.  Telus applied to quash the general warrant arguing that the
prospective, daily acquisition of text messages from their computer database
constitutes an interception of private communications and therefore requires
authorization under the wiretap authorization provisions in Part VI of the
Code.  The application was dismissed.  The focus of the appeal is on
whether the general warrant power can authorize the prospective production of
future text messages from a service provider’s computer.

                    Held
(McLachlin C.J. and Cromwell J.
dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed and the general warrant and related
assistance order should be quashed.

                    Per
LeBel, Fish and Abella JJ.:  Part VI of the Criminal Code  provides
a comprehensive scheme for “wiretap authorizations” for the interception of
private communications.  The purpose of Part VI is to restrict the ability
of the police to obtain and disclose private communications.

                    Telus
employs a unique process for transmitting text messages that results in the
messages being stored on their computer database for a brief period of time. 
In considering whether the prospective, daily production of future text
messages stored in Telus’ computer falls within Part VI, we must take the
overall objective of Part VI into account.  

                    Text
messaging is, in essence, an electronic conversation.  Technical
differences inherent in new technology should not determine the scope of
protection afforded to private communications.  The only practical difference
between text messaging and traditional voice communications is the transmission
process.  This distinction should not take text messages outside the protection
to which private communications are entitled under Part VI.  

                    Section 487.01
of the Code, the general warrant provision, was enacted in 1993 as part
of a series of amendments to the Code in Bill C‑109, S.C. 1993,
c. 40.  It authorizes a judge to issue a general warrant permitting
a peace officer to “use any device or investigative technique or procedure or
do any thing described in the warrant that would, if not authorized, constitute
an unreasonable search or seizure”.  Notably, s. 487.01(1)(c)
stipulates that the general warrant power is residual and resort to it
is precluded where judicial approval for the proposed technique, procedure or
device or the “doing of the thing” is available under the Code or
another federal statute.  

                    Section
487.01(1)(c) should be broadly construed to ensure that the general
warrant is not used presumptively to prevent the circumvention of the more
specific or rigorous pre‑authorization requirements for warrants, such as
those found in Part VI.  To decide whether s. 487.01(1)(c)
applies, namely, whether another provision would provide for the authorization
sought in this case, requires interpreting the word “intercept” in Part VI.
 “Intercept” is used throughout Part VI with reference to the intercept of
private communications.  This means that in interpreting “intercept a
private communication”, we must consider the broad scope of Part VI and
its application across a number of technological platforms, as well as its
objective of protecting individual privacy interests in communications by
imposing particularly rigorous safeguards.  The interpretation should not be
dictated by the technology used to transmit such communications, like the
computer used in this case, but by what was intended to be protected under
Part VI.  It should also be informed by the rights enshrined in s. 8
of the Charter, which in turn must remain aligned with technological
developments.  

                    A
technical approach to “intercept” would essentially render Part VI
irrelevant to the protection of the right to privacy in new, electronic and
text‑based communications technologies, which generate and store copies
of private communications as part of the transmission process.  A narrow
definition is also inconsistent with the language and purpose of Part VI
in offering broad protection for private communications from unauthorized
interference by the state. 

                    The
interpretation of “intercept a private communication” must, therefore, focus on
the acquisition of informational content and the individual’s expectation of
privacy at the time the communication was made.  To the extent that there may
be any temporal element inherent in the technical meaning of intercept, it
should not trump Parliament’s intention in Part VI to protect an
individual’s right to privacy in his or her communications.  The use of the
word “intercept” implies that the private communication is acquired in the
course of the communication process.  The process encompasses all activities of
the service provider which are required for, or incidental to, the provision of
the communications service.  Acquiring the substance of a private communication
from a computer maintained by a telecommunications service provider would, as a
result, be included in that process.  

                    Text
messages are private communications and, even if they are stored on a service
provider’s computer, their prospective production requires authorization under Part VI
of the Code.  If Telus did not maintain its computer database, there is
no doubt that the police would be required to obtain an authorization under Part VI
to secure the prospective, and in this case continuous, production of text
messages.  Most service providers do not routinely copy text messages to a
computer database as part of their transmission service.  Accordingly, if the
police wanted to target an individual who used a different service provider,
they would have no option but to obtain wiretap authorizations under Part VI
to compel the prospective and continuous production of their text messages. 
This creates a manifest unfairness to individuals who are unlikely to realize
that their choice of telecommunications service provider can dramatically
affect their privacy.  The technical differences inherent in Telus’
transmission of text messages should not deprive Telus subscribers of the
protection of the Code that every other Canadian is entitled to. 

                    The
general warrant in this case was invalid because the police had failed to
satisfy the requirement under s. 487.01(1)(c) of the Code that
a general warrant could not be issued if another provision in the Code is
available to authorize the technique used by police.  Since the warrant
purports to authorize the interception of private communications, and since Part VI
is the scheme that authorizes the interception of private communications, a
general warrant was not available.  

                    Per Moldaver and Karakatsanis JJ.:  There is agreement with Abella J.
that the police are entitled to a general warrant only where they can show that “no other provision” of the Criminal
Code  or any other Act of Parliament would provide for the investigative
technique, including a substantively equivalent technique, for which
authorization is sought.  The investigative technique in this case was
substantively equivalent to an intercept.  The general
warrant is thus invalid.  Resolution of whether what occurred in this
case was or was not, strictly speaking, an “intercept” within the meaning of s. 183 of the Code is unnecessary.  A narrower
decision guards against unforeseen and potentially far‑reaching
consequences in this complex area of the law.

                    The
result is driven by the failure of the authorities to establish the requirement
in s. 487.01(1)(c) that there be “no other provision” that would
provide for the search.  This provision ensures that the general warrant is
used sparingly as a warrant of limited resort.  In creating the general
warrant, Parliament did not erase every other search authorization from the Code
and leave it to judges to devise general warrants on an ad hoc basis as
they deem fit.  Courts must therefore be careful to fill a legislative lacuna
only where Parliament has actually failed to anticipate a particular search
authorization.  The “no other provision” requirement must be interpreted so as
to afford the police the flexibility Parliament contemplated in creating the
general warrant, while safeguarding against its misuse.  There is a need for
heightened judicial scrutiny where Parliament has provided an authorization for
an investigative technique that is substantively equivalent to what the police
seek but requires more onerous preconditions.  Thus, the test under s. 487.01(1)(c)
must consider the investigative technique that the police seek to utilize with
an eye to its actual substance and not merely its formal trappings. 

                    The
approach to the “no other provision” requirement accepts a measure of
uncertainty by tasking judges with the job of inquiring into the substance of
purportedly “new” investigative techniques.  When uncertainty exists, the
police would do well to err on the side of caution.  General warrants may not
be used as a means to circumvent other authorization provisions that are
available but contain more onerous preconditions.  Judges faced with an
application where the investigative technique, though not identical, comes
close in substance to an investigative technique covered by another provision
for which more rigorous standards apply should therefore proceed with extra
caution.  Where careful scrutiny establishes that a proposed investigative
technique, although similar, has substantive differences from an existing
technique, judges may grant the general warrant, mindful of their obligation
under s. 487.01(3) to impose terms and conditions that reflect the nature
of the privacy interest at stake. 

                    A
literal construction of s. 487.01(1)(c) must be rejected.  Such an
approach strips the provision of any meaning and renders it all but valueless. 
Legislative history confirms that general warrants were to play a modest role,
affording the police a constitutionally sound path for investigative techniques
that Parliament has not addressed.  Ensuring that general warrants are confined
to their limited role is the true purpose of s. 487.01(1)(c). 
While the “best interest” requirement in s. 487.01(1)(b) serves to
prevent misuse of the general warrant, this provision should not be interpreted
as swallowing the distinct analytical question that the “no other provision”
test asks.  A purposive approach to s. 487.01(1)(c) has nothing to
do with investigative necessity.  Under the “no other provision” test, the
police are not asked to show why an alternative authorization would not work on
the facts of a particular case, but rather why it is substantively different
from what Parliament has already provided.  

                    In
this case, the general warrant is invalid because the investigative technique
it authorized was substantively equivalent to an intercept.  What the police
did — securing prospective authorization for the delivery of future private
communications on a continual, if not continuous, basis over a sustained period
of time — was substantively equivalent to what they would have done pursuant to
a Part VI authorization.  It was thus, at a minimum, tantamount to an
intercept.  Though there is no evidence to suggest that the police acted
other than in good faith, the police failed to meet their burden to show that
the impugned technique was substantively different from an intercept.  On the facts here, the general warrant served only to provide a
means to avoid the rigours of Part VI.  The police could and should have
sought a Part VI authorization.

                    Per McLachlin C.J. and Cromwell J. (dissenting):  The
question of whether what the police did under this general warrant is an interception
of a private communication is one of statutory interpretation.  When the text
of the statutory provisions is read in its full context, it is clear that the
general warrant does not authorize an interception that requires a Part VI
authorization.  While there is no doubt that the text message is a private
communication and that text messages here were intercepted by Telus by means of
an electro-magnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device, the police in this
case, did not intercept those messages when Telus turned over to them copies of
sent and received messages previously intercepted by Telus and stored in its
databases.  Therefore, the investigative technique authorized by the general
warrant in this case was not an interception of private communication.  

                    Fundamental
to both the purpose and to the scheme of the wiretap provisions is the
distinction between the interception of private communications and the
disclosure, use or retention of private communications that have been
intercepted. The purpose, text and scheme of Part VI show that the
disclosure, use or retention of intercepted private communications is distinct
from the act of interception itself.  That is, if disclosure or use of a
private communication were an interception of it, there would be no need to
create the distinct disclosure or use offence.  Similarly, the exemptions from
criminal liability show that Parliament distinguished between interception on
one hand and retention, use and disclosure on the other.

                    In
this case, it is not disputed that Telus was intercepting text messages when it
copied them for its own systems administration purposes.  However, it is also
agreed that Telus lawfully intercepted private communications.  Under the
general warrant, the police sought disclosure from Telus of information that it
had already lawfully intercepted.  The general warrant did not require Telus to
intercept communications, but to provide copies of communications that it had
previously intercepted for its own lawful purposes.  As the scheme of the
legislation makes clear, disclosure or use of a lawfully intercepted
communication is not an interception.  It is inconsistent with the fundamental
distinction made by the legislation to conclude that the police were
intercepting private communications when Telus provided them with copies of
previously intercepted and stored text messages.  The distinction in the
statute between interception and disclosure cannot be dismissed as a mere
“technical difference”.  The distinction is fundamental to the scheme of the
provisions.  When Telus turns over to the police the copies of the
communications that it has previously intercepted, Telus is disclosing the
communications, not intercepting them again.  This disclosure by Telus from its
databases cannot be an interception by the police.

                    Acquiring
the content of a previously intercepted and stored communication cannot be an
interception because that broad reading is inconsistent with the clear
distinction between interception and disclosure in the provisions.  Applied
broadly, this interpretation of “acquire” would extend the scope of
investigative techniques which require wiretap authorizations far beyond
anything ever previously contemplated.  Further, introducing a temporal aspect
of interception would confuse the act of interception with the nature of its
authorization.  Interception is a technique, a way of acquiring the substance
of a private communication.  It could not be that exactly the same technique,
which acquires information in exactly the same form, may be either a seizure of
stored material or an interception, depending on the point in time at which the
technique is authorized.

                    The
general warrant is not one of limited resort that should be used sparingly.  On
the contrary, as numerous authorities have acknowledged, the provision is cast
in wide terms.  Therefore, it is not accepted as an imperative that s. 487.01 
must be interpreted with a view to heavily restricting its use.  The focus of
the inquiry is on two matters (in addition of course to reasonable grounds to
believe that an offence has been committed and that information concerning the
offence will be obtained): Is authorization for the “technique, procedure or
device to be used or the thing to be done” provided for in any other federal
statute, and is it in the best interests of the administration of justice to
authorize it to be done?  Section 487.01(1)(c) provides that a
general warrant may issue if “there is no other provision . . . that
would provide for a warrant, authorization or order permitting the technique,
procedure or device to be used or the thing to be done”.  The words
“technique”, “procedure”, “device to be used” and “thing to be done” all are
concerned with what the police want to do, not why they want to
do it.  This paragraph does not require issuing judges to consider whether
other techniques are similar or allow access to the same evidence; it simply
asks if the same technique can be authorized by another provision.  This
is not simply a narrow, literal interpretation of s. 487.01 .  Rather, it
is an interpretation that reflects its purpose of conferring a broad judicial
discretion to authorize the police to “use any device or investigative
technique or procedure or do any thing”, provided of course that the
judge is satisfied that it is in the best interests of the administration of
justice to do so, having due regard to the importance of the constitutional
right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures.  However, courts should
not authorize anything the police seek to do simply because it is not
authorized elsewhere.  The judicial discretion to issue the warrant must give
full effect to the protection of reasonable expectations of privacy as set out
under s. 8 of the Charter.  

                    There
is no support in the text or the purpose of s. 487.01(1)(c), or in
the jurisprudence, for building into it a “substantive equivalency” test.  The
paragraph asks a simple question:  Does federal legislation provide for “a
warrant, authorization or order permitting the technique, procedure or device
to be used or the thing to be done”?  Where this threshold is met, the judge is
entitled to consider granting the requested authorization.  The further
question of whether the authorization ought to be granted is not the
focus of this paragraph of the section. Rather, whether a general warrant ought
to issue is properly considered under s. 487.01(1)(b), which asks
whether authorizing the warrant would be in the best interests of the administration
of justice.  This approach is not only supported by the text, purpose and
jurisprudence, but by the application of a “substantive equivalency” test
creates unnecessary uncertainty and distracts the issuing judge from the
question of whether the technique sought to be authorized is inconsistent with
the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.  Predictability
and clarity in the law are particularly important in the area of judicial
pre-authorization of searches.  The primary objective of pre-authorization is
not to identify unreasonable searches after the fact, but to ensure that
unreasonable searches are not conducted.  The requirements for
pre-authorization should be as clear as possible to ensure that Charter
rights are fully protected. 

                    The
technique sought to be authorized here is not the substantive equivalent of a
wiretap authorization.  On the facts of this case, a wiretap authorization
alone would not allow the police to obtain the information that Telus was
required to provide under the general warrant.  Three separate authorizations
would be required in order to provide the police with the means to access the
information provided to them under the general warrant.  Therefore, even if one
were to accept reading into s. 487.01(1)(c) a “substantive
equivalency” test, neither the facts nor the law would support its application
in this case.

                    The
police did not seek a general warrant in this case as a way to avoid the
rigours of Part VI.  The general warrant achieved the legitimate aims of
the police investigation in a much more convenient and cost-effective manner
than any other provision would have allowed.  There is no evidence of “misuse”
of s. 487.01 .  The effective and practical police investigation by a
relatively small municipal police force was fully respectful of the privacy
interests of the targets of the investigation and other Telus subscribers.

                    The
judgment of LeBel, Fish and Abella JJ. was delivered by

[1]                             
Abella J. — For many Canadians, text messaging has
become an increasingly popular form of communication.  Despite technological
differences, text messaging bears several hallmarks of traditional voice
communication: it is intended to be conversational, transmission is generally
instantaneous, and there is an expectation of privacy in the communication. 
The issue in this appeal is the proper procedure under the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , for authorizing the prospective daily production of these
messages from a computer database maintained by a telecommunications service
provider.

[2]                             
The service provider in this case is TELUS
Communications Company.  It urges this Court to find that the prospective,
daily acquisition of text messages from their computer database constitutes an
interception of private communications and therefore requires authorization
under Part VI of the Code, a comprehensive scheme for “wiretap
authorizations” for the interception of private communications.  The
Crown, on the other hand, contends that the retrieval of messages from a
computer maintained by a service provider does not fall within the scope of
Part VI because the production of messages in computer storage does not amount
to an “interception”, and that the police are therefore permitted to use the
general warrant power in s. 487.01 of the Code to get copies of the text
messages.  

[3]                             
Part VI of the Code provides a scheme to
protect private communications.  Telus employs a unique process for
transmitting text messages that results in the messages being stored on their
computer database for a brief period of time.  The question in this appeal is
whether the technical differences inherent in Telus’ transmission of text
messages should deprive Telus subscribers of the protection of the Code that
every other Canadian is entitled to. 

[4]                             
The focus of this appeal therefore turns on the
interpretation of “intercept” within Part VI.  “Intercept” is used throughout
Part VI with reference to the intercept of private communications.  This
means that in interpreting “intercept a private communication”, we must
consider the broad scope of Part VI and its application across a number of
technological platforms, as well as its objective of protecting individual
privacy interests in communications by imposing particularly rigorous
safeguards.  The interpretation should not be dictated by the technology used
to transmit such communications, like the computer used in this case, but by
what was intended to be protected under Part VI.  

[5]                             
Text messaging is, in essence, an electronic
conversation.  The only practical difference between
text messaging and the traditional voice communications is the transmission
process.  This distinction should not take text messages outside the protection
of private communications to which they are entitled in Part VI.  Technical
differences inherent in new technology should not determine the scope of
protection afforded to private communications.

Background 

[6]                             
When Telus subscribers send a text message, the
transmission of that message takes place in the following sequence.  It is
first transmitted to the nearest cell tower, then to Telus’ transmission
infrastructure, then to the cell tower nearest to the recipient, and finally to
the recipient’s phone.  If the recipient’s phone is turned off or is out of
range of a cell tower, the text message will temporarily pause in Telus’
transmission infrastructure for up to five days.  After five days, Telus stops
trying to deliver the message and deletes it without notifying the sender.  

[7]                             
Unlike most telecommunications service
providers, Telus routinely makes electronic copies of all the text messages
sent or received by its subscribers and stores them on a computer database for
a period of 30 days.  Text messages that are sent by a Telus subscriber are
copied to the computer database during the transmission process at the point in
time when the text message enters Telus’ transmission infrastructure.  Text
messages received by a Telus subscriber are copied to the computer database
when the Telus subscriber’s phone receives the message.  In many instances,
this system results in text messages being copied to the computer database
before the recipient’s phone has received the text message and/or before the
intended recipient has read the text message.  

[8]                             
On March 27, 2010, the Owen Sound Police Service
obtained a general warrant under s. 487.01  and related assistance order under
s. 487.02 of the Code.  The warrant named two Telus wireless subscribers
and required Telus to provide the police with copies of any text messages sent
or received by these subscribers which were stored on Telus’ computer
database.  In addition, the warrant required the production of subscriber
information identifying any individuals who sent text messages to, or received
text messages from the two individuals who were the target of the warrant.  

[9]                             
The warrant covered a subsequent two-week period
between March 30, 2010 and April 16, 2010.  During this time, the warrant
required Telus to abide by a specific production schedule.  On March 30, 2010,
Telus was required to produce the information for March 18, 2010 to March 30,
2010.  On each of the following 13 days, Telus was required to produce, on a
daily basis, the text messages sent or received within the last 24 hours, as
well as any related subscriber information. 

[10]                         
Telus argued that the warrant was invalid
because the police had failed to satisfy the requirement under s. 487.01(1)(c)
of the Code that a general warrant could not be issued if another
provision in the Code is available to authorize the technique used by
police.  Since the warrant purports to authorize the interception of private
communications, and since Part VI is the scheme that authorizes the
interception of private communications, a general warrant was not available.  The
Crown’s position, on the other hand, was that the retrieval of messages from
Telus’ computer database does not fall within the scope of Part VI since the
copies on Telus’ computer database are not real-time communications and the
police are therefore permitted to use the general warrant power to authorize
the prospective production of text messages stored on a service provider’s
computer.  

[11]                         
The application judge dismissed Telus’
application (2011 ONSC 1143, 105 O.R. (3d) 411).  The part of the warrant that
required production of historical messages predating the issuance of the
warrant was rescinded since both the Crown and Telus conceded that a production
order was available to obtain those messages.

[12]                         
 In my view, text messages are private
communications and, even if they are stored on a service provider’s computer,
their prospective production requires authorization under Part VI of the Code. 


[13]                         
If Telus did not maintain its computer database,
there is no doubt that the police would be required to obtain an authorization
under Part VI to secure the prospective, and in this case continuous,
production of text messages.  In fact, most service providers do not routinely
copy text messages to a computer database as part of their transmission
service.  Accordingly, if the police wanted to target an individual who used a
different service provider, they would have no option but to obtain wiretap
authorizations under Part VI to compel the prospective and continuous
production of their text messages.  This creates a manifest unfairness to
individuals who are unlikely to realize that their choice of telecommunications
service provider can dramatically affect their privacy.

[14]                         
I would therefore allow the appeal and quash the
general warrant and related assistance order. 

Analysis

[15]                         
We have not been asked to determine whether a
general warrant is available to authorize the production of historical text
messages, or to consider the operation and validity of the production order
provision with respect to private communications.  Rather, the focus of this
appeal is on whether the general warrant power in s. 487.01 of the Code can
authorize the prospective production of future text messages from
a service provider’s computer.  That means that we need not address whether the
seizure of the text messages would constitute an interception if it were
authorized after the messages were stored.  

[16]                         
 Section 487.01  was enacted in 1993 as part of a
series of amendments to the Code in Bill C-109, S.C. 1993, c. 40.  The
Bill introduced a number of new judicial authorization provisions.  Section
487.01  was meant to make search warrants available for techniques or procedures
not specified in the Code.  It authorizes a judge to issue a
general warrant permitting a peace officer to “use any device or investigative
technique or procedure or do any thing described in the warrant that would, if
not authorized, constitute an unreasonable search or seizure”: 

           487.01 (1) A
provincial court judge, a judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction or
a judge as defined in section 552 may issue a warrant in writing authorizing a
peace officer to, subject to this section, use any device or investigative
technique or procedure or do any thing described in the warrant that would, if
not authorized, constitute an unreasonable search or seizure in respect of a
person or a person’s property if

 

(a)
the judge is satisfied by information on oath in writing that there are reasonable
grounds to believe that an offence against this or any other Act of Parliament
has been or will be committed and that information concerning the offence will
be obtained through the use of the technique, procedure or device or the doing
of the thing;

 

(b)
the judge is satisfied that it is in the best interests of the administration
of justice to issue the warrant; and

 

(c)
there is no other provision in this or any other Act of Parliament that
would provide for a warrant, authorization or order permitting the technique,
procedure or device to be used or the thing to be done.

 

[17]                         
The key to this case lies in whether s.
487.01(1)(c) applies, namely, whether another provision would provide
for the authorization sought in this case.  In R. v. Ha, 2009 ONCA 340,
96 O.R. (3d) 751, MacPherson J.A. observed that the focus of the s. 487.01(1)(c)
analysis is “on the particular investigative technique or procedure that the
police seek to utilize and whether it can properly be authorized by another
provision in the Code or any other federal statute” (at para. 43; see also R.
v. Brand, 2008 BCCA 94, 229 C.C.C. (3d) 443 (sub nom. R. v. Ford),
at para. 50).

[18]                         
Viewed contextually, therefore, s. 487.01(1)(c)
stipulates that the general warrant power is residual and resort to it
is precluded where judicial approval for the proposed technique,
procedure or device or the “doing of the thing” is available under the Code or
another federal statute. 

[19]                         
In other words, s. 487.01(1)(c)  should
be broadly construed to ensure that the general warrant is not used
presumptively. This is to prevent the circumvention of more specific or
rigorous pre-authorization requirements for warrants (S. C. Hutchison et al., Search
and Seizure Law in Canada (loose-leaf), at p. 16-40.3). 

[20]                         
 This means that the Crown is only entitled to a
general warrant where it can show that no other provision would provide for a
warrant, authorization or order permitting the technique, including, as
Moldaver J. observes, provisions that authorize techniques which are
substantively equivalent to the technique proposed by the police in a given
case.  The investigative technique authorized by the general warrant in this
case allowed the police to obtain prospective production of future text
messages on a daily basis for a two-week period directly from a service
provider.  The essence of the Crown’s argument was that no other provision was
available because the retrieval of stored messages was not an interception.  If
the Crown is right, they are entitled to a general warrant.  If they are wrong,
the general warrant must be quashed.  Either way, it is impossible to avoid an
examination of whether the technique the police sought to employ was something
that required a Part VI authorization.  

[21]                         
The Crown never conceded that these were
circumstances in which a choice was available under either a general warrant or
a Part VI authorization.  Instead, it argued that the requirement in s.
487.01(1)(c) was satisfied because no other provision was available to
authorize the prospective production of future text messages stored on a
service provider’s computer, maintaining that Part VI did not apply because the
retrieval of messages from computer storage is not an “intercept”.  That is the
central issue that is engaged in this case.  

[22]                         
This requires us to determine whether Part VI
applies to the prospective, and in this case continuous, production of text
messages sought by the police, or whether the fact that the messages are stored
in Telus’ computer means that their retrieval by the police is not an
“intercept”.  If Part VI does apply, then in accordance with s. 487.01(1)(c),
a general warrant is not available. 

[23]                         
Section 184(1) makes it an indictable offence to
“wilfully intercep[t] a private communication” by use of a device.  Part VI provides
a comprehensive scheme for the authorization of these interceptions.  It was
enacted in 1974 through the Protection of Privacy Act, S.C. 1973-74, c.
50, which amended the Code to add Part IV.1 (now Part VI) entitled
“Invasion of Privacy”.  The goal of the legislation was explained by Zuber J.A.
in R. v. Welsh an Iannuzzi (No. 6) (1977), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 363 (Ont.
C.A.) as follows: 

It is apparent that in enacting the Protection
of Privacy Act, 1973-74 (Can.), c. 50, . . . Parliament had two
objectives.  The first was to protect private communications by prohibiting
interception and to render inadmissible evidence obtained in violation of the
statute.  The second objective, which balances the first, was to recognize the
need to allow the appropriate authorities, subject to specific controls, to
intercept private communications in the investigation of serious crime, and to
adduce the evidence thus obtained. [p. 369]

[24]                         
Because the purpose of Part VI is to restrict
the ability of the police to obtain and disclose private communications, it is
drafted broadly to ensure the necessary protection.  In Lyons v. The Queen,
[1984] 2 S.C.R. 633, this Court explained this breadth as follows: 

This is broad legislation embracing in
these extensive provisions the use of a wide range of
radio, telephone, optical and acoustical devices for listening to and recording
private communications as broadly defined. It is not “wiretapping” legislation,
nor eavesdropping legislation, nor radio regulation.  It is the regulation of
all these things and “any other device” that may be used to intercept
intelligence reasonably expected by the originator not to be intercepted by
anyone other than the intended recipient. [p. 664]

[25]                         
The definition of “intercept” in s. 183 includes
“listen to, record or acquire a communication or acquire the substance, meaning
or purport thereof”.  Consistent with the broad scope of Part VI, this
definition is not exhaustive and focuses on the state acquisition of
informational content — the substance, meaning, or purport — of the private
communication.  It is not just the communication itself that is protected, but
any derivative of that communication that would convey its substance or
meaning. “[P]rivate communication” is defined in s. 183 as follows: 

. . . any oral
communication, or any telecommunication, that is made by an originator who is
in Canada or is intended by the originator to be received by a person who is in
Canada and that is made under circumstances in which it is reasonable for the
originator to expect that it will not be intercepted by any person other than
the person intended by the originator to receive it,
and includes any radio-based telephone communication that is treated
electronically or otherwise for the purpose of preventing intelligible
reception by any person other than the person intended by the originator to
receive it; 

 

[26]                         
This definition focuses on the individual’s
reasonable expectation of privacy in the communication. The word
“telecommunication” used in this definition is in turn defined in the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, s. 35 , amended in 1993 (S.C. 1993, c. 38, s. 87 )
as “the emission, transmission or reception of signs, signals, writing, images,
sounds or intelligence of any nature by any wire, cable, radio, optical or
other electromagnetic system, or by any similar technical system”. 

[27]                         
Sections 185 and 186 of the Code set out
the general requirements governing the application for an authorization under
Part VI.  Compared with other search and seizure and warrant provisions in the Code,
the provisions in Part VI contain more stringent requirements to safeguard
privacy interests.  Before granting an authorization under Part VI, a judge
must be satisfied that the authorization is in the best interests of the
administration of justice.  

[28]                         
A judge must also be satisfied, in accordance
with s. 186(1)(b), “that other investigative procedures have been tried
and have failed, other investigative procedures are unlikely to succeed or the
urgency of the matter is such that it would be impractical to carry out the
investigation of the offence using only other investigative procedures”.  In R.
v. Araujo, 2000 SCC 65, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 992, this Court clarified
that this criterion required the police to show that there was “no other
reasonable alternative method of investigation in the circumstances of the
particular criminal inquiry” (para. 29).  

[29]                         
 Part VI authorizations must also state the
identity of persons whose private communications will be intercepted, the place
at which they are intercepted, and the manner of the interception.  They are
required to contain such conditions as the judge considers advisable and will
only be valid for a limited period of time not to exceed 60 days.  Finally, a
written application by the Attorney General, Minister of Public Safety or a
designated agent is required.  

[30]                         
In addition to these prerequisites for
authorization, Part VI contains a number of notice requirements.  Section 196
requires that notice be given to targets of interceptions authorized under s.
186 within a certain timeframe.  Under s. 189, an accused must be given notice
of any interception intended to be produced in evidence.  In addition, s. 195
requires the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness or the
Attorney General for each province to produce an annual report with respect to
the use of Part VI authorizations.  In R. v. Tse, 2012 SCC
16, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 531, this Court found that a notice requirement provides
transparency and serves as a further check on the power of police to perform
highly intrusive interceptions of private communications.  The Court therefore
concluded that a notice provision was necessary to meet the minimal
constitutional standards of s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms .  

[31]                         
These safeguards illuminate Parliament’s
intention that a higher degree of protection be available for private
communications.  Part VI has broad application to a number of technologies and
includes more rigorous safeguards than other warrant provisions in the Code. 
In considering whether the prospective, daily production of future text
messages stored in Telus’ computer falls within Part VI, therefore, we must
take this overall objective into account.  

[32]                         
As all parties acknowledged, it is clear that
text messages qualify as telecommunications under the definition in the Interpretation
Act .  They also acknowledged that these messages, like voice
communications, are made under circumstances that attract a reasonable
expectation of privacy and therefore constitute “private communication” within
the meaning of s. 183 .  Similarly, there is no question that the computer used
by Telus would qualify as “any device” under the definitions in s. 183 .  

[33]                         
The issue then is how to define “intercept” in
Part VI.  The interpretation should be informed not only by the purposes of
Part VI, but also by the rights enshrined in s. 8  of the Charter , which
in turn must remain aligned with technological developments.  In R. v. Wong,
[1990] 3 S.C.R. 36, this Court found that “the broad and general right to
be secure from unreasonable search and seizure guaranteed by s. 8  [of the Charter ]
is meant to keep pace with technological development, and, accordingly, to
ensure that we are ever protected against unauthorized intrusions upon our
privacy by the agents of the state, whatever technical form the means of
invasion may take” (p. 44).  A technical approach to “intercept” would
essentially render Part VI irrelevant to the protection of the right to privacy
in new, electronic and text-based communications technologies, which generate
and store copies of private communications as part of the transmission process.


[34]                         
 It is true that unlike traditional voice
communication, a text message may or may not be delivered to its intended
recipient at the time it is created.  Receipt of the text message depends on
whether the phone is turned on, whether it is in range of a cell tower, and
whether the user has accessed the message.  If Telus is unable to deliver the
message, it remains in the transmission infrastructure for five days, at which
point Telus stops trying to complete delivery.  Furthermore, unlike voice
communications, text communications, by their nature, generate a record of the
communication which may easily be copied and stored.  A narrow or technical
definition of “intercept” that requires the act of interception to occur
simultaneously with the making of the communication itself is therefore
unhelpful in addressing new, text-based electronic communications.  

[35]                         
A narrow definition is also inconsistent with
the broad language and purpose of Part VI.  The statutory definition of
“intercept” in s. 183 includes three distinct parts — “listen to”, “record” or
“acquire”.  In French, the definition includes “de prendre . . .
connaissance”.  Rather than limit the definition of “intercept” to its
narrow, technical definition, the statutory definition broadens the concept of
interception.  There is no requirement in the Code definition of
“intercept” that the interception of a private communication be simultaneous or
contemporaneous with the making of the communication itself.  If Parliament
intended to include such a requirement, it would have included it in the
definition of “intercept”.  Instead, it chose to adopt a wider definition,
consistent with Part VI’s purpose to offer broad protection for private
communications from unauthorized interference by the state. 

[36]                         
The interpretation of “intercept a private
communication” must, therefore, focus on the acquisition of informational
content and the individual’s expectation of privacy at the time the
communication was made. In my view, to the extent that there may be any
temporal element inherent in the technical meaning of intercept, it should not
trump Parliament’s intention in Part VI to protect an individual’s right to
privacy in his or her communications. 

[37]                         
The use of the word “intercept” implies that the
private communication is acquired in the course of the communication process. 
In my view, the process encompasses all activities of the service provider
which are required for, or incidental to, the provision of the communications
service.  Acquiring the substance of a private communication from a computer
maintained by a telecommunications service provider would, as a result, be
included in that process.  

[38]                         
Focusing on the fact that the Code draws
a distinction between the interception of private communications and the
disclosure of those communications, fails to provide the intended protection
under Part VI.   On the contrary, it allows technological differences in Telus’
transmission process to defeat Parliament’s intended protection of private
communications from state interference. 

[39]                         
The reality of modern communication technologies
is that electronic private communications, such as text messages, are often
simultaneously in transit and in some form of computer storage by the
service provider.  As a result, the same private communication exists in more
than one place and may therefore be acquired by the state from the transmission
stream and from computer storage.  In other words, the same private
communication may be “intercepted” by police more than once from different
sources.  

[40]                         
When Telus copies messages to its computer
database, several steps in the transmission process have yet to occur.  The
production schedule required by the general warrant in this case means that the
police likely obtained stored copies of some text messages before they were
even received by the intended recipient.  Had the police acquired the same
private communications directly from the transmission stream, instead of from
the stored copies, the Crown concedes that a Part VI authorization would be
required.  The level of protection should not depend on whether the state
acquires a copy of the private communication that is being transmitted or a
copy that is in storage by a service provider as part of the communications
process.  Parliament drafted Part VI broadly to ensure that private
communications were protected across a number of technological platforms (see Lyons).


[41]                         
The communication process used by a third-party
service provider should not defeat Parliament’s intended protection for private
communications.  As the interveners Canadian Civil Liberties Association and
Samuelson-Glushko Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic point out
in their factums, this Court has recognized in other contexts that
telecommunications service providers act merely as a third-party “conduit” for
the transmission of private communications and ought to be able to provide
services without having a legal effect on the nature (or, in this case, the
protection) of these communications (Society of Composers, Authors and Music
Publishers of Canada v. Canadian Assn. of Internet Providers, 2004
SCC 45, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 427, at paras. 100-101).  

[42]                         
Part VI recognizes the dangers inherent in
permitting access to the future private communications of a potentially unlimited
number of people over a lengthy period of time.  Those are the very risks
inherent in the investigative technique in this case.  An authorization that
permits police to obtain the prospective production of future
text messages over a two-week period directly from the communications process
used by the service provider is precisely what Part VI was intended to
protect.  In my view, the investigative technique in this case therefore
qualifies as “intercepting private communications” under Part VI.  

[43]                         
An interpretation of “intercept a private
communication” that includes the investigative technique used by police in this
case finds support in the statutory definition of “intercept” in s. 183.  The
definition includes the simple acquisition of a communication.  It does not
require the acquisition of the communication itself; rather, the acquisition of
the “substance, meaning or purport” of the communication is sufficient. 
Moreover, this interpretation is harmonious with the scheme and objectives of
Part VI, which is drafted broadly in order to regulate and control a wide
variety of technological invasions of privacy.  Finally, it strikes the
appropriate balance between the serious invasion of privacy that results from
the surreptitious acquisition of private communications and the evolving needs
of effective law enforcement.  

[44]                         
The police gained a substantial advantage by
proceeding with a general warrant.  They did not need the Attorney General’s
request for an authorization; they did not need to show that other
investigative procedures had been tried and failed; they did not need to
provide any notice to the target individuals; and they did not need to identify
which other individuals’ private communications may be acquired in the course
of the search.  

[45]                         
The general warrant in this case purported to
authorize an investigative technique contemplated by a wiretap authorization
under Part VI, namely, it allowed the police to obtain prospective production
of future private communications from a computer maintained by a service
provider as part of its communications process.  Because Part VI applied, a
general warrant under s. 487.01  was unavailable.  

[46]                         
Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and quash
the general warrant and related assistance order.

I.       Introduction

[47]                         
Where a police investigative technique intrudes
on an individual’s reasonable expectation of privacy, it falls to Parliament to
provide for specific legislative authorization of the technique.  That is the
general rule.  The so-called “general warrant” provision of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , operates as an exception to the rule,
allowing the police to seek judicial authorization of a proposed investigative
technique that is not specifically authorized by statute.  Although several
issues have been raised in this appeal, the dispositive one, in my view, is
whether a general warrant may properly issue where the substance of an
investigative technique, if not its precise form, is addressed by an existing
legislative provision.

[48]                         
I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of
my colleague Abella J. and, although we approach the matter differently, I
share her conclusion that the general warrant in this case is invalid.  My
colleague’s reasons focus on the definition of “intercept” in s. 183 of the Code
and whether the search in this case fell within that definition for purposes of
Part VI.  I do not think it necessary to answer those questions because in my
view the result in this case is driven by the failure of the authorities to
establish one of the prerequisites needed to obtain a general warrant.

[49]                         
On the facts of this case, when one cuts through
form and looks at the substance of the search that the police sought to conduct,
what we are left with is the equivalent of a Part VI intercept.  As such, the
police could and, for reasons I will explain, should have sought an
authorization under Part VI, which thereby precludes the issuance of a general
warrant.  I would accordingly join my colleague Abella J. in allowing the
appeal and quashing the general warrant, as well as the related assistance
order.

II.     Overview of Issues on Appeal

[50]                         
The parties in this appeal framed their
principal arguments around the question of whether the investigative technique
authorized by the general warrant falls within the definition of “intercept” in
s. 183 of the Code.  The parties agree that if what occurred here was an
intercept, the general warrant could not issue, as it would fail the “no other
provision” requirement in s. 487.01(1)(c) of the Code.  They, of
course, disagree as to whether this technique was an intercept.

[51]                         
My colleague Abella J. and I agree that the
Crown is entitled to a general warrant only where it can show that “no other provision” would provide for
the technique, including a substantively equivalent technique, proposed by the
police in a given case.  We also agree on the result in this case.  We
part company, however, on the path to that result.

[52]                         
My colleague takes the position that the investigative technique
here was an intercept within the meaning of s. 183, and would thereby
hold the general warrant invalid.  I prefer, instead, to resolve this case on
the basis that the investigative technique here was substantively equivalent
to an intercept and, in light of that conclusion, would hold the general
warrant invalid.

[53]                         
I choose a different path because I am reluctant to use this case
as a vehicle to undertake an analysis of what constitutes an intercept for
purposes of Part VI.  In approaching the matter as I have, I am not unmindful
of the need to address the risks to privacy posed by the digital age.  The task
of adapting laws that were a product of the 1970s to a world of smartphones and
social networks is a challenging and profoundly important one.  But the
resolution of whether what occurred here was or was not, strictly speaking, an
intercept is unnecessary, in my view, because there is a narrower basis for
decision that guards against unforeseen and potentially far-reaching
consequences in this complex area of the law. 

III.    Analysis

A.     The General Warrant Provision

[54]                         
Parliament enacted the general warrant provision
in 1993 together with several new search powers as part of its response to a
series of decisions of this Court concerning electronic surveillance.  Section
487.01  was a specific response to R. v. Wong,
[1990] 3 S.C.R. 36.  That decision held that police video monitoring of
activities in a hotel room intruded on an individual’s reasonable expectation
of privacy and thus required prior judicial authorization pursuant to a valid
legislative provision.  Parliament’s response, in the form of s. 487.01 , went
beyond the authorization of video monitoring.  The provision states in relevant
part:

           487.01
(1) [Information for general warrant] A provincial
court judge, a judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction or a judge as
defined in section 552 may issue a warrant in writing authorizing a peace
officer to, subject to this section, use any device or investigative technique or
procedure or do any thing described in the warrant that would, if not
authorized, constitute an unreasonable search or seizure in respect of a person
or a person’s property if

 

(a)
the judge is satisfied by information on oath in writing that there are
reasonable grounds to believe that an offence against this or any other Act of
Parliament has been or will be committed and that information concerning the
offence will be obtained through the use of the technique, procedure or device
or the doing of the thing;

 

(b)
the judge is satisfied that it is in the best interests of the administration
of justice to issue the warrant; and

 

(c)
there is no other provision in this or any other Act of Parliament that would
provide for a warrant, authorization or order permitting the technique,
procedure or device to be used or the thing to be done.

 

           (2)
[Limitation] Nothing in subsection (1) shall be construed as to permit
interference with the bodily integrity of any person.

 

           (3)
[Search or seizure to be reasonable] A warrant issued under subsection
(1) shall contain such terms and conditions as the judge considers advisable to
ensure that any search or seizure authorized by the warrant is reasonable in
the circumstances.

[55]                         
The breadth of the general warrant — judicial
sanction to “use any device or investigative technique or procedure or do any
thing” that if not authorized would constitute an unreasonable search or
seizure — is kept in check by several prerequisites to its availability and
conditions on its operation.  Chief among them and what, in my view, lies at
the heart of this appeal is the requirement in s. 487.01(1)(c) that
“there is no other provision in this or any other Act of Parliament that
would provide for a warrant, authorization or order permitting the technique,
procedure or device to be used or the thing to be done”.

[56]                         
The requirement that there be “no other
provision” that would provide for the search ensures that the general warrant
is used sparingly as a warrant of limited resort.  It guards against the
general warrant becoming “an easy back door for other techniques that have more
demanding pre-authorization requirements”: S. C. Hutchison et al., Search
and Seizure Law in Canada (loose-leaf), at p. 16-40.3.  Without ascribing
any improper motive to the police, that, I believe, is what occurred in this
case.

B.     The General Warrant in This Case

[57]                         
In a typical scenario where TELUS Communications
Company (“Telus”), the telecommunications service provider here, is served with
an authorization under Part VI, the company installs a device that
automatically copies all activity for the identified phone number, including
all text messages, and automatically delivers such data to a police “wire
room”.  The Crown does not dispute that the acquisition of an individual’s text
messages in this manner constitutes a Part VI intercept, nor is there any
dispute that a text message can constitute a “private communication” within the
meaning of Part VI. 

[58]                         
As a matter of corporate practice, however,
Telus routinely stores a copy of a subscriber’s incoming and outgoing text
messages on its databases for at least 30 days.  Though Telus is unique among
major telecommunications service providers in making such copies, it is legally
entitled to do so pursuant to an exception in s. 184(2) of the Code.  The
company says it intercepts its subscribers’ messages in this manner to aid in
troubleshooting customer problems.

[59]                         
The fact that Telus stores its subscribers’ text
messages in this manner is significant — indeed, it is the reason this appeal
exists — because it creates an investigative resource for the authorities.  As
Det. Sgt. Prosser of the Ontario Provincial Police said in his affidavit filed
with this Court, Telus’s practice “provides investigators with another option
by which to access the content of these messages” (A.R., at p. 115).  Relying
on conventional search warrants (s. 487) or production orders (s. 487.012), the
police have obtained copies of the messages stored in Telus’s databases.  

[60]                         
In sum, prior to this case, with only a handful
of exceptions, all police searches that sought copies of Telus subscribers’
text messages were authorized either under Part VI or by a conventional search
warrant or production order.  The Crown in its factum puts the matter
succinctly: police practice with respect to Telus subscribers has been to seek
either “search warrants or production orders (for historic messages) or
wiretap authorizations (for future messages)” (R.F., at para. 10
(emphasis added)). 

[61]                         
The general warrant in this case thus represents
a third option.  In form, it resembles a production order because it authorizes
police access to text messages already stored in Telus’s database.  And
yet, in substance, it resembles a Part VI authorization, because it prospectively
authorizes police access to future private communications on a continual
basis over a sustained period of time.  

[62]                         
The inherent hybridity of the general warrant in
this case underscores the need for an inquiry into whether the “no other
provision” test is satisfied to assess the substance of the police
investigative technique, not merely its formal trappings.  But that is not what
happened here.

C.     Was the General Warrant Validly Issued?

[63]                         
The reviewing judge looked to binding authority
from the Ontario Court of Appeal for guidance.  In R. v. Ha, 2009 ONCA
340, 96 O.R. (3d) 751, MacPherson J.A. observed:

The focus in the s. 487.01(1)(c)
analysis is not on whether there are other investigative techniques that might
accomplish the purported investigative purposes or goals of the police; rather,
the focus is on the particular investigative technique or procedure that the
police seek to utilize and whether it can properly be authorized by another
provision in the Code or any other federal statute.  [Emphasis added; para.
43.]

[64]                         
On the strength of Ha, the reviewing
judge concluded that there was no other provision in the Code or any
other statute that would authorize the investigative technique in this case —
namely the “prospective and daily production of text messages” (2011 ONSC 1143,
105 O.R. (3d) 411, at para. 75).  Though the police “could have gone to a
justice of the peace every day for the 14 days covered by the General Warrant
and obtained the same records using conventional warrants”, the general warrant
could issue precisely because it provided a single, comprehensive authorization
for the search that was otherwise unanticipated by Parliament (para. 70).[1] 

[65]                         
The analysis is, in my respectful view,
incomplete.  It is self-evident that the police could have sought a Part
VI authorization and achieved their investigative objective.  Crown counsel
recognized this during the hearing of this appeal:

I’m not sure that they really thought this through at
the end of the day because if what the police are doing here is Part VI, well,
you know, presumably, the police could go back to the issuing justice who was a
Superior Court judge and say:  Okay.  Just issue this as a Part VI
authorization.  [Emphasis added; transcript, at p. 81.]

On the record before us,
the police have offered no explanation as to why they could not have sought a
Part VI authorization.  We do know that but for Telus’s practice of routinely
storing subscribers’ messages, the police would have had no option other than
to obtain such an authorization since what they were seeking was prospective
authorization for the daily production of future text messages.  Indeed, that is
what they do — ostensibly without any trouble — with the other major
telecommunications service providers, such as Rogers and Bell, who do not store
text messages as Telus does.  

[66]                         
Nonetheless, the question remains whether the
law requires that the police should have sought such an authorization. 
At the hearing of this appeal, Crown counsel argued that Ha conclusively
resolves the issue in the negative:

           . . . as
the Ontario Court of Appeal pointed out in Ha, the test for determining
whether a general warrant can be issued focuses on the nature of the
investigative technique in question, not the nature of the investigative
objective.  

 

           The
search of the Telus database for future records is a technique that’s quite
distinct from the seizure of a telecommunication.   I mean, mechanically . . .
the police were doing different things. . . . [I]t was a completely different
process.  [Emphasis added; transcript, at pp. 94-95.]

[67]                         
With respect, I cannot agree.  To adopt Ha in
this way is to turn a blind eye to the substance of the search — and to common
sense.  What the police did in this case — securing prospective authorization
for the delivery of future private communications on a continual,
if not continuous, basis over a sustained period of time — was substantively
equivalent to what they would have done pursuant to a Part VI authorization. 
It was thus, at a minimum, tantamount to an intercept.  

[68]                         
I accept the Crown’s contention that, as a
technical matter, what occurred here was different from what would occur
pursuant to a Part VI authorization.  I do not accept, however, that that fact
is determinative in light of the identical privacy interests at stake.  But for
the 24-hour time delay, the investigative techniques were the same.  Indeed, if
the Crown’s logic is to be accepted, a general warrant could still issue had
the delay been 24 minutes or, for that matter, 24 seconds.[2]  To draw a line between
what was authorized here and a Part VI intercept on the basis of such a theory
is to draw “an artificial and unrealistic distinction”: Lyons v. The Queen,
[1984] 2 S.C.R. 633, at p. 643.

[69]                         
As a result, the facts of the case at hand are
distinguishable from Ha.  Both Ha and R. v. Brand,
2008 BCCA 94, 229 C.C.C. (3d) 443 (sub nom. R. v. Ford), the other
appellate authority interpreting s. 487.01 , concerned unsuccessful attempts by
the target of a search to invalidate a general warrant on the basis that the
police could have sought multiple conventional warrants.  In Ha, the
police were investigating a suspected drug lab.  They sought the flexibility to
enter the property covertly at any time within a two-month period and to engage
in a broad range of evidence gathering activities therein, including
photographing, taking chemical samples, and fingerprinting items.  Likewise, in
Brand, the police were investigating a large marihuana grow operation
and needed covert access to multiple properties in order to verify the presence
of drugs without compromising other aspects of their investigation.  Fundamentally,
in each instance, the request for covert access and temporal flexibility made
clear that the substance of the investigative techniques for which
authorization was sought differed from what could be authorized under a
conventional warrant.  

[70]                         
Explaining why the search sanctioned by the
general warrant in Ha was thus substantively different from one
involving multiple conventional warrants, MacPherson J.A. said:

In this case, the police sought to
obtain authorization to conduct an unlimited number of covert entries and
searches on private property over a two-month period.  Except
for s. 487.01 of the Code, there is “no other provision in . . . any other Act
of Parliament” that could potentially accomplish this goal.  [para. 43]

Those are not our facts. 
Here, the police sought, in the reviewing judge’s words, authorization for “the
investigative technique or procedure of prospective and daily production of
text messages” (para. 75). The simple fact is that there is a provision
that substantively provides for this technique.  It is known as Part VI. 

[71]                         
In emphasizing the importance of looking beyond
the form of a search technique to uncover its true substance, a further point
bears noting.  In both Ha and Brand, if the police wanted the
evidence, they had a choice between a series of conventional warrants or a
general warrant.  If the police sought a general warrant, they would have to
meet the requirements of s. 487.01  which are deliberately stricter than those
for a conventional warrant.  For example, the requirements that a general
warrant can only be issued by a judge, not a justice of the peace, and that
issuance must be in the best interests of justice themselves serve to ensure
that the general warrant remains a rearguard warrant of limited resort.

[72]                         
In other words, by dint of its more stringent
requirements, the general warrant contains a disincentive to its everyday use. 
In Ha and Brand, where the only alternative was a series of
conventional warrants, reliance on a general warrant did not provide the police
with an easy way out from the rigours of a more demanding legislative
authorization — the general warrant was the more demanding legislative
authorization.  Thus, in these cases, it is harder to see how the general
warrant provision might be misused.

[73]                         
In this case, by contrast, the police actually
had a choice between a Part VI authorization and a general warrant.[3]  The incentives before
the police were thus markedly different than they were in Ha.  Though
both the general warrant and the Part VI provisions require that the issuing
judge be satisfied that the order is in the best interests of justice, Part VI
alone imposes several further requirements in the interest of protecting the
right to privacy:

1.                 
An authorization under Part VI is available only
for certain offences (s. 183).

2.                 
Only individuals designated by the Minister of
Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness or Attorney General may seek a Part VI
authorization (ss. 185(1) and 186(6)).

3.                 
A Part VI authorization is available only where
“other investigative procedures have been tried and have failed, other
investigative procedures are unlikely to succeed or the urgency of the matter
is such that it would be impractical to carry out the investigation of the
offence using only other investigative procedures” (s. 186(1)(b)).

4.                 
A Part VI authorization must state the identity
of persons whose private communications will be intercepted, the place at which
they are intercepted, and the manner of the interception (s. 186(4)(c)).


5.                 
The Attorney General or Minister is required to
provide notice to the target of the authorization within a certain timeframe
(s. 196).

6.                 
The Minister is required to make an annual
report to Parliament concerning the number of applications made for
authorizations under Part VI and the details thereof (s. 195).

[74]                         
Consequently, in this case, a narrow focus on
the mechanics of the search is to miss the forest for the trees.  The general
warrant must be analogized to a Part VI authorization if one is to appreciate
the actual incentives before the police.  A mechanistic interpretation of the
“no other provision” requirement cannot hold because, put bluntly, a general
warrant can prove easier to obtain than a Part VI authorization.  For that
reason, one can hardly fault the police for seeking a general warrant instead
of a Part VI authorization.  There was little to be lost (a delay in the
receipt of the data sought, which may well have had little consequence) and
much to be gained (no requirement to meet the onerous burdens Parliament has
chosen to impose under Part VI).

[75]                         
 The facts suggest that this is precisely what
has happened as a consequence of Telus’s unsuccessful challenge of the warrant
in this case.  The affidavit of Det. Sgt. Prosser states that the police seek
general warrants only in those “rare circumstances” requiring access to text
messages “under a more immediate timeline” (A.R., at p. 116).  And yet, though
Telus received only six general warrants prior to 2010, counsel for the company
informed us at the hearing of this appeal that the number has since grown to
“several hundred” in light of the decision below (transcript, at p. 42).  

[76]                         
The logic that led to this predictable result
effectively nullifies the “no other provision” safeguard by inviting the police
to distinguish an investigative technique in some manner — any manner, even if
substantively immaterial — so as to avoid the rigours of a more demanding
legislative authorization such as Part VI.  Faced with the choice of having to
seek an authorization under Part VI and being able to proceed down a less
demanding path, it should be expected that the police will elect the latter —
and understandably so.  It follows, in my view, that the “no other provision”
test must be given interpretive teeth if it is to serve its purpose of ensuring
that general warrants do not become a means to avoid more onerous search
authorizations. 

D.     The Summary of the Approach to the “No Other Provision”
Requirement

[77]                         
The test under s. 487.01(1)(c) must
consider the investigative technique that the police seek to utilize with an
eye to its actual substance and not merely its formal trappings.  The provision
must be interpreted so as to afford the police the flexibility Parliament
contemplated in creating the general warrant, while safeguarding against its misuse. 
As the facts of this case illustrate, there is a need for heightened judicial
scrutiny where Parliament has provided an authorization for an investigative
technique that is substantively equivalent to what the police seek but requires
more onerous pre-conditions.  

[78]                         
In so concluding, I note that in creating the
general warrant, Parliament did not erase every other search authorization from
the Code and leave it to judges to devise general warrants on an ad
hoc basis as they deem fit.  Courts must therefore be careful to fill a
legislative lacuna only where Parliament has actually failed to anticipate a
particular search authorization.  To do otherwise would chip away at the
foundation that shapes the respective roles of the courts and Parliament in our
system of criminal justice when individual rights and freedoms are at stake.

[79]                         
That said, I recognize, as I must, that this
approach accepts a measure of uncertainty by tasking judges with the job of
inquiring into the substance of purportedly “new” investigative techniques.  In
my view, an interpretation that is faithful to the purpose of the “no other
provision” requirement in s. 487.01(1)(c) necessarily demands as much. 
Two practical guidelines, however, should serve to mitigate concerns that may
arise. 

[80]                         
First, it is important for the police to
appreciate that general warrants are not warrants of general application.  On
the contrary, they are to be used sparingly, when the investigative technique
they wish to employ is truly different in substance from an investigative
technique accounted for by another legislative provision.  Where uncertainty
exists, the police would do well to err on the side of caution.  They must know
— with certainty — that general warrants may not be used as a means to circumvent
other authorization provisions that are available but contain more onerous preconditions.

[81]                         
Second, when judges are faced with an
application for a general warrant where the investigative technique, though not
identical, comes close in substance to an investigative technique covered by
another provision for which more rigorous standards apply, they should proceed
with extra caution.  At a minimum, judges should look closely at the material
filed and satisfy themselves that the request for a general warrant is genuine
and not merely a device to escape the rigours of another authorization
provision.  Where careful scrutiny establishes that a proposed investigative
technique, although similar, has substantive differences from an
existing technique — not simply that it is similar in substance but different
in form — judges may grant the general warrant, but they should be mindful of
their obligation under s. 487.01(3) to impose terms and conditions that reflect
the nature of the privacy interest at stake.  In doing so, they may borrow as
appropriate from the conditions that Parliament has chosen to impose on the
substantively similar existing authorization. 

[82]                         
With these twin considerations in mind, and
despite Justice Cromwell’s concerns about certainty, to which I shall turn
momentarily, if the police proceed in good faith and the authorizing judge
proceeds with caution, it is unlikely that a general warrant issued in such
circumstances will be found to be defective at trial — and even less so that
evidence obtained pursuant to it will be excluded under s. 24(2)  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

E.      The Competing Approach to the “No Other Provision”
Requirement

[83]                         
I have had the opportunity to read the reasons
of Cromwell J., who is of the view that the “no other provision” test was
satisfied in this case because the investigative technique does not meet the
definition of “intercept” for purposes of Part VI.  He would accordingly
dismiss the appeal.  Insofar as the definition of an intercept is concerned, my
colleague’s analysis hinges on distinguishing between the interception of a
private communication (s. 184) and the subsequent disclosure of such
intercepted communications (s. 193).  As I have explained, I do not find it
necessary to reach that question in this appeal and, for that reason, do not
comment on this aspect of his reasons.

[84]                         
My colleague does, however, take issue with my
interpretation of s. 487.01(1)(c) and its application to the case at
hand.  It is clear that my colleague and I have fundamentally different
understandings not only of the “no other provision” requirement, but of the
proper role of general warrants more broadly.  He has offered a careful
analysis that warrants a response.

[85]                         
Justice Cromwell maintains that s. 487.01(1)(c)
should be construed literally and he rejects the purposive approach I have
taken, asserting that it “creates unnecessary uncertainty and distracts the
issuing judge from the question of whether the technique sought to be
authorized is inconsistent with the right to be free from unreasonable searches
and seizures” (para. 171).  According to my colleague, “predictability and
clarity in the law are particularly important in the area of judicial
pre-authorization of searches” (para. 172). 

[86]                         
Justice Cromwell further challenges my
construction of s. 487.01(1)(c) on the basis that it impermissibly adds
“investigative necessity” as a further precondition to the issuance of a
general warrant — that is, to obtain a general warrant, the police must be able
to show that there are no other ways by which they can achieve their
investigative objective.  My colleague maintains that Parliament did not see
fit to add such a requirement and it is impermissible for the Court to do so. 

[87]                         
I propose to address each of Justice Cromwell’s
concerns.

[88]                         
First, for reasons that should be clear from the
above, I cannot accept my colleague’s literal construction of s. 487.01(1)(c). 
With respect, such an interpretation strips the provision of any meaning and
renders it all but valueless.  Writing in 1996, soon after the general warrant
was introduced, the authors of a leading treatise on this subject predicted:

Of the four preconditions [to a general
warrant] the most difficult for investigators will be [the “no other
provision” requirement], a novel provision intended to prevent this
residual warrant power from becoming an easy back door for other techniques
that have more demanding pre-authorization requirements. [Emphasis added;
Hutchison et al., at p. 16-40.3.]

My colleague’s approach,
however, would reduce that provision to a paper tiger.

[89]                         
On my colleague’s literal interpretation of s.
487.01(1)(c), any deviation — no matter how slight or insignificant —
that takes an investigative technique outside the four corners of another
authorization provision in the Code or an Act of Parliament is
sufficient to satisfy the “no other provision” requirement.  Thus, in this
case, had the police sought a general warrant requiring Telus to provide copies
of all stored text messages using a 24-second delay (as opposed to a 24-hour
delay), I gather that my colleague would hold that the “no other provision”
requirement had been met.  Likewise, on my colleague’s construction, had the
police sought a general warrant requiring both the contemporaneous
interception of text messages and a dial number recorder warrant, it
would appear that this too would suffice to satisfy the “no other provision”
requirement.

[90]                         
If, as my colleague reasons, Parliament truly
intended that the police could satisfy the “no other provision” requirement by
coming up with a hook — any hook — that would take the investigative technique
outside the four corners of an existing authorization, then we are left to
conclude that Parliament chose to enact an absurdity.  I cannot accept any such
conclusion.

[91]                         
Moreover, my colleague’s focus on the breadth of
the general warrant provision — breadth that I readily accept — conflates the
distinct questions of what the power can do, assuming it is available,
with when it arises.  As I have already observed, the general warrant
provision was not meant to erase every other authorization provision from the Code
and leave it to individual judges to fashion general warrants on an ad hoc
basis.  On the contrary, general warrants were created “to fill any
potential ‘gap’” (Schreiber v. Canada (Attorney General), [1997] 2
F.C. 176 (C.A.), at para. 86 (emphasis added), rev’d on other grounds, [1998] 1
S.C.R. 841), to provide a “legislative ‘failsafe’” that “supplement[s]
rather than supplant[s]” (S. C. Hutchison, Hutchison’s Canadian Search
Warrant Manual 2005 (2nd ed. 2004), at pp. 143 and 163 (emphasis added)),
to “fill an investigatory hiatus” (J. A. Fontana and D. Keeshan, The
Law of Search and Seizure in Canada (8th ed. 2010), at p. 459 (emphasis
added)), and to serve as a “residual power” (Hutchison et al., at p.
16-36 (emphasis added)).

[92]                         
Though little was said of general warrants in
debates or committee hearings in 1993, we do know that Parliament did not get
out of the warrant business after enacting s. 487.01 .  Multiple new authorizations
have been created since then, including production orders in 2004. 
Existing authorizations have been amended to reflect evolving investigatory
needs and privacy concerns, including the provisions of Part VI.  And even
today Parliament continues to consider warrant proposals introduced — and
sometimes withdrawn — by the government.  See, e.g., Bill C-30, Protecting
Children from Internet Predators Act, 1st Sess., 41st Parl. (First Reading,
February 14, 2012); Bill C-55, Response to the Supreme Court of Canada
Decision in R. v. Tse Act , 1st Sess., 41st Parl. (First Reading, February
11, 2013).

[93]                         
This history confirms that general warrants were
to play a modest role, affording the police a constitutionally sound path for
investigative techniques that Parliament had not addressed.  They were thus
rearguard warrants of limited resort, not frontline warrants of general
application.  They were meant to fill gaps, not create them.  

[94]                         
In sum, ensuring that general warrants are
confined to their limited role, in my view, is the true purpose of s.
487.01(1)(c).  Justice Cromwell’s literal construction of the provision
turns that purpose on its head by inviting the police to seek judicial sanction
of purportedly “new” investigative techniques on the basis of substantively
meaningless distinctions.  Manifestly, this approach puts a premium on form
over substance.

[95]                         
My colleague takes comfort in the “best
interests” clause in s. 487.01(1)(b) as an adequate safeguard against
misuse of the general warrant.  Parliament, he contends, enacted para. (1)(b)
to deal alone with “potential abuses of the general warrant” (para. 190).  But
if that is so, one might ask why Parliament enacted s. 487.01(1)(c) in
the first place.

[96]                         
No doubt, the “best interests” requirement
serves to prevent misuse of the general warrant.  But this provision should not
be interpreted as swallowing the distinct analytical question that the “no
other provision” test asks.  The role of each provision must be respected. 
First, under s. 487.01(1)(c), the question is whether there is any other
provision in the Code or other Act of Parliament that actually or
substantively provides for the investigative technique for which the police
seek authorization.  Second, under s. 487.01(1)(b), only if the first
question is answered in the negative does the inquiry shift to whether issuance
of the warrant is in the best interests of the administration of justice.

[97]                         
The two hypotheticals I mentioned earlier
illustrate the point.  I would hope that a 24-second delay and a dial number
recorder warrant piggy-backed on an authorization for the contemporaneous
interception of text messages would meet my colleague’s definition of abuse. 
Why?  Because both investigative techniques would presumably be seen for what
they are — the substantive equivalent of a Part VI authorization. In the end,
all roads lead to Rome.  But the interpretation of s. 487.01(1)(c) that
I endorse gives some meaning and purpose to the provision; my colleague’s
interpretation strips it of both.

[98]                         
Insofar as s. 487.01(1)(b) is concerned,
take, as just one example, the fact that the availability of a Part VI
authorization is limited to certain offences included under the definition of
“offence” in s. 183.  Should the police seek authorization for a search concerning
an offence not included within that definition, though the “no other provision”
test would be satisfied, it would fall to an analysis under para. (1)(b)
to guard against the issuance of a warrant that Parliament obviously
anticipated and deliberately excluded: S. Coughlan, “R. v. Ha:
Upholding General Warrants without Asking the Right Questions” (2009), 65 C.R.
(6th) 41, at pp. 41-43.

[99]                         
Leaving that aside, my colleague provides no
guidance as to the type of conduct that he would classify as abusive, even as
he stresses that “judges asked to issue general warrants must be vigilant to
ensure that the right to be free against unreasonable searches and seizures is
fully given effect” (para. 189).  Presumably, he would leave it to individual
judges to decide the matter on a case-by-case basis under s. 487.01(1)(b),
thereby accepting his own form of uncertainty in the process.  As I have
acknowledged, the substantive approach to which I ascribe is not airtight — but
it is no more porous than the total reliance on the “best interests” test that
my colleague endorses.

[100]                     
I turn then to my colleague’s second concern —
that I have impermissibly read investigative necessity, a concept peculiar to
Part VI, into s. 487.01 .  With respect, my approach to s. 487.01(1)(c)
has nothing to do with investigative necessity.

[101]                     
The requirement under s. 186(1)(b) that a
Part VI authorization be necessary is concerned with a factual question. 
In requiring that other procedures “have been tried and have failed”, or that
they were “unlikely to succeed”, or that the “urgency of the matter is such
that it would be impractical” to use them, it is apparent that s. 186(1)(b)
is concerned with whether the factual circumstances of a particular case
necessitate the use of the powers granted under Part VI.  LeBel J. explained as
much for the Court in R. v. Araujo, 2000 SCC 65, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 992:

Parliament and the courts have indeed
recognized that the interception of private communications is a serious matter,
to be considered only for the investigation of serious offences, in the
presence of probable grounds, and with a serious testing of the need for
electronic interception in the context of the particular investigation and its
objects . . . . There must be, practically speaking, no other reasonable
alternative method of investigation, in the circumstances of the particular
criminal inquiry. [Emphasis added; emphasis in original deleted; para. 29.]

[102]                     
By contrast, the “no other provision” test asks
a legal question.  The inquiry is not whether alternative search
techniques have been exhausted, or whether they are unlikely to work, or
whether there is urgency in the circumstances.  Rather, the question is whether
the purportedly “new” investigative technique is actually or
substantively equivalent to a technique that is already authorized by law.  In
other words, under the “no other provision” test, the police are not asked to
show why an alternative authorization would not work on the facts of a
particular case, but rather why it is substantively different from what
Parliament has already provided.  Though the fact that an alternative
authorization will satisfy the investigative objective of the police may be
helpful as a factor in demonstrating its substantive equivalence, the inquiry
under the “no other provision” test remains focused on the latter point, not
the former.  If the police successfully make this showing, the inquiry under s.
487.01(1)(c) ends.  

[103]                     
Two final matters raised by Justice Cromwell’s
reasons warrant clarification. 

[104]                     
First, I do not conclude — nor should I be taken as suggesting —
that the police acted duplicitously or in bad faith in seeking the general
warrant in the case at hand.  There is no evidence to that effect and I have no
reason to believe that the police acted other than in good faith.  Put simply,
we do not know what motivated the police, nor is that the real issue. 
Ultimately, whether the police could or could not obtain a Part VI
authorization in this case is irrelevant insofar as the “no other provision”
requirement is concerned.  What does matter is that we have been provided with
nothing that would assist the police in meeting their burden to show that the
impugned technique was substantively different from an intercept. 

[105]                     
Second, the approach I endorse does not take investigative
flexibility off the table.  As Ha and Brand make clear, it is a
factor that a judge may consider in deciding whether an investigative technique
is substantively different such that a general warrant should issue.  But it is
not the only factor, and it must be approached with caution, particularly in
cases like the present one, where the issuance of a general warrant may be a
convenient way for the police to avoid the rigours of another search provision
that is substantively equivalent.

IV.    Conclusion

[106]                     
For these reasons, I am of the view that the
approach taken by the police in this case cannot be sanctioned.  The general
warrant is invalid because the investigative technique it authorized was
substantively equivalent to an intercept.  On the facts here, the general
warrant served only to provide a means to avoid the rigours of Part VI.  As the
Crown recognized, the police could have sought a Part VI authorization.  It is
enough to decide this appeal to conclude that they should have. 

[107]                     
That said, though we are not presented with such
a scenario, I would not go so far as to conclude that a general warrant can never
prospectively authorize the delivery of future private communications to the
police on a continual basis over a sustained period of time.  If an issuing
judge is satisfied that a particular investigative technique is substantively
different such that the provisions of Part VI, or of any other statute, do not
provide for the search, it would be open to the judge to issue the warrant,
assuming other requirements are satisfied.  The judge must, of course, conclude
that the warrant is in the “best interests of the administration of justice”
(s. 487.01(1)(b)) and the judge “shall” impose such terms and conditions
as necessary to ensure that the search is reasonable in the circumstances (s.
487.01(3)).  

[108]                     
I would allow the appeal and quash the general
warrant and related assistance order.

                    The
reasons of McLachlin C.J. and Cromwell J. were delivered by

                    Cromwell J. (dissenting) — 

I.       Overview

[109]                     
TELUS Communications Company (“Telus”) stores in
its databases a copy of all text messages sent by or to its subscribers. The
main question on this appeal is whether, when the police wished to obtain
copies of these stored messages, they required a wiretap authorization.  My
colleagues Abella J. and Moldaver J. would hold that they did, although for
markedly different reasons. I respectfully disagree. Like the Ontario Superior
Court judge whose decision is under appeal, my view is that a wiretap
authorization was not required. I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

II.     Facts, Proceedings and Issues

[110]                     
We are concerned in this case with particular investigative techniques
that may be authorized under the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , in
the context of the police wishing to have lawful access to the content of text
messages. Before turning to an analysis of the specific legal issues we
confront, I will set out some technical background about text messaging and the
range of investigative techniques that may be open to the police to gain access
to them.  I will then set out a brief account of the proceedings which bring
the case to us and the specific issues that we must resolve.  

A.     Telus’s
Text Messaging Service

[111]                     
Text messaging, technically known as Short Message Service (“SMS”), is a
communication service using standardized communications protocols and mobile
telephone service networks to allow for the exchange of short text messages
from one mobile phone to another. 

[112]                     
Telus’s system of text message delivery is the same as that of other
telecommunications service providers. When a message is sent by a Telus
subscriber, it is transmitted to a Telus cell tower and then routed to a Mobile
Switching Centre (“MSC”) which is the computerized mainframe to the Telus
network. Within the MSC is Telus’s Short Message Service Centre (“SMSC”), which
uses routing engines to attempt to deliver the message to its destination. If
the recipient is also a Telus subscriber, the message will then be sent from
Telus’s SMSC to a cell tower which will forward the message to the recipient’s
phone. If the recipient is not a Telus subscriber, the message will pass from
Telus’s SMSC to the SMSC of the recipient’s provider and then through a cell
tower to the recipient’s phone. Where the destination phone is not available
(for example, because it is turned off or does not have service reception), the
text message remains in the Telus SMSC for up to five days. If the recipient
phone does not become available within that timeframe, the message is deleted.
The sender is not informed if a message is not delivered.

[113]                     
Telus differs from most other providers in that it makes electronic
copies of the text messages that pass through its system and stores those
copies in one of four computer databases for at least 30 days. There are three
PSMS databases (namely, PSMS 1 (primary database), PSMS 2 (secondary database),
and PSMS 3 (tertiary database)) which receive messages within up to
approximately 15 minutes of the time they are sent. Which PSMS a message goes
to depends on the capacity of each database. All text messages received by a
Telus customer are copied, and the copy is forwarded to the databases when the
Telus subscriber’s phone receives the message from the Telus SMSC. When a Telus
subscriber sends a text message, it is copied when it arrives at the Telus SMSC
and the copy is stored in a database. Telus also maintains a fourth database,
named PECSMS, which receives messages between two to eight hours after they are
sent. At the time this case was heard at first instance, Telus expected that by
April 2011, PECSMS would be the sole repository for all text message content;
it would cease to use the PSMS databases. 

[114]                     
Telus copies text messages in order to facilitate troubleshooting and
dealing with customer complaints. As I will explain, Telus in doing this is
intercepting the messages and it has legal authority under the Code to
do so without a wiretap authorization. In my view, Telus’s stated purpose,
coupled with the fact that most other service providers in Ontario transmit
text messages without storing copies of them in this manner, makes it clear
that this additional step is not part of the communications process.   Unlike
e-mail messages, which must go through transient storage as they are
transmitted, storage of the type in issue here is not inherent to the
communication of text messages.

B.     Text
Messages and Investigative Techniques

[115]                     
The Code provides at least three potential ways for the police to
obtain authorization to acquire the content of stored text messages from Telus:
a production order, a general warrant and a so-called “wiretap” interception
authorization. The police in this case sought and obtained a general warrant as
a sort of enhanced production order, but Telus’s contention is that they were
required to seek a wiretap authorization. It will be helpful to describe these
three investigative techniques briefly, because the requirements of each are
somewhat interrelated.  

                    1.     Production Order

[116]                     
The police may obtain the contents of stored text messages by means of a
production order under s. 487.012.  This provision allows a judge or justice to
order a person “to produce documents, or copies of them . . . or to prepare a document
based on documents or data already in existence and produce it” (s. 487.012(1)(a)
and (b)). The conditions for issuing a production order are similar to
those for a search warrant.  The issuing justice or judge must be satisfied by
information on oath that an offence has been or is suspected to have been
committed, that the documents or data will afford evidence respecting the
commission of the offence and that the person to whom the order is directed has
possession or control of the documents or data (s. 487.012(3)). In addition,
the person to whom the order is directed cannot be a person under investigation
(s. 487.012(1)).

[117]                     
When presented with a production order, Telus is required to produce to
police, documents or data, or copies thereof, which it already has. In this
way, police obtain copies of text messages that have already been sent or
received by the subscribers and stored in Telus’s databases.   It has been
assumed and I will accept for the purposes of this case that a production order
cannot issue for documents or data not yet in existence (see ss. 487.012(1)(b)
and 487.012(3)(c)). 

[118]                     
I would add that s. 487.012, on its face, allows a judge or justice to
order production of text messages from a provider’s databases through a series
of daily authorizations. Section 487.012 sets relatively few limits on the
issuance of production orders. Unlike the other authorizations that concern us
here, it does not require a finding by the judge that the order is necessary to
the police investigation, nor does it require that a production order be in the
best interests of the administration of justice. Like the reviewing judge, I
accept that the police could have accessed the text messages stored in Telus’s
databases pursuant to such a series of orders. 

                    2.     General Warrant

[119]                     
A judge may issue a general warrant, provided for in s. 487.01 , to
authorize a peace officer to “use any device or investigative technique or
procedure or do any thing described in the warrant that would, if not
authorized, constitute an unreasonable search or seizure”. The issuing judge
must be satisfied on the basis of information on oath that there are reasonable
grounds to believe that an offence has been or will be committed and that
information concerning the offence will be obtained through the use of the
technique for which the police seek authorization.  

[120]                     
Given the wide array of techniques that may be authorized under a
general warrant, Parliament has imposed additional, stringent conditions. 
First, unlike search warrants and production orders that may be issued by
judges or justices of the peace, general warrants may only be issued by judges
(s. 487.01(1)). Second, “the judge [must be] satisfied that it is in the best
interests of the administration of justice to issue the warrant” (s. 487.01(1)(b)).
Third, a general warrant must “contain such terms and conditions as the judge
considers advisable to ensure that the search or seizure authorized by the
warrant is reasonable in the circumstances” (s. 487.01(3)). Fourth, a general
warrant may be issued only if “there is no other provision . . . that would
provide for a warrant, authorization or order permitting the technique,
procedure or device to be used or the thing to be done” (s. 487.01(1)(c)).
In other words, a general warrant may not be used to authorize a “technique,
procedure or device to be used or . . . thing to be done” if there are other
provisions in the Code (or elsewhere) that could authorize it. (I will
refer to this as the “no other provision” requirement.)  Telus’s position is
that this requirement was not met because the wiretap provisions of the Code
provide for authorization of the technique which the police wished to use. 

                    3.     Wiretap Authorization


[121]                     
An authorization to intercept private communications under Part VI of
the Code allows police to receive messages as they are being sent or
received by subscribers. These sorts of authorizations are subject to even more
strict conditions than those which apply to general warrants.  They may only be
issued by a judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction or a judge as
defined in s. 552 of the Code.  The Attorney General, the Minister of
Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness or a specially designated agent must
bring the application (s. 185(1)). There are specific and detailed provisions
relating to what must be placed before the judge.  The issuing judge must be
satisfied not only that it would be in the best interests of the administration
of justice to issue the authorization but also that the so-called
“investigative necessity” test has been met (s. 186(1)).  This means that the
judge must be satisfied that “other investigative procedures have been tried
and have failed, other investigative procedures are unlikely to succeed or the
urgency of the matter is such that it would be impractical to carry out the
investigation of the offence using only other investigative procedures” (s.
186(1)). The authorization may generally not be valid for more than 60 days (s.
186(4)(e)) and there are notice and reporting requirements (s. 196).  

[122]                     
Where a wiretap authorization has issued in relation to text messages,
Telus installs a device which automatically re-routes a copy of each text
message to a police wire room or listening post. When a text message is sent by
a Telus subscriber, the device re-routes a copy of the message when it arrives
at the Telus SMSC. When a text message is received by a Telus subscriber, the
wiretap device re-routes the copy when the subscriber’s phone receives the
message. With an intercept authorization, then, police have access to messages
“in real time” as they are being sent and received. 

C.     Proceedings


[123]                     
The police sought and obtained a general warrant in this case. It
directed Telus to provide them with copies of the stored text messages to and
from two of its subscribers. The warrant required production of messages sent
and received before it was issued and, as well, of messages sent and received
roughly two weeks into the future.  Only the authorization in relation to the
future production is in issue here. For those future messages, Telus was
required by 2:00 p.m. each day Tuesday to Friday, to provide copies of all
messages that had been sent or received between 11:00 a.m. on the previous day
and 11:00 a.m. that same morning. On Mondays, Telus had to provide by 2:00 p.m.
copies of all messages that had been sent or received between 11:00 a.m. Friday
and 11:00 a.m. Monday. In addition, the general warrant required Telus to
provide the police with subscriber information for all of the telephone numbers
which exchanged texts with the two subscribers in question. Thus, this general
warrant was similar to a production order in that it required the production of
copies of stored messages and related subscriber information.  But it was
different from a production order in that it prospectively authorized the
production of these copies.

[124]                     
Telus applied to quash the general warrant and its application was
mainly dismissed by Sproat J. (2011 ONSC 1143, 105 O.R. (3d) 411). Telus’s
principal ground for its challenge to the general warrant was that it
authorized an interception, a technique that could be authorized under Part VI
of the Code. It followed that a general warrant could not issue because
the “no other provision” requirement for a general warrant was not met. 

[125]                     
The reviewing judge rejected this contention.  He did not think that
what the police were authorized to do under the general warrant was an
interception. The police were asking for copies of the messages already stored
in Telus’s databases; they were not asking permission to “intercept private
communications”. In his view, the word “intercept” requires a real time capture
of otherwise transient communications, and this does not cover obtaining copies
of messages stored in a database. The wiretap provisions could only be used to
authorize interceptions and therefore would not apply to the investigative
technique used by the police in this case.  It followed, in the reviewing
judge’s opinion, that a general warrant could issue.

[126]                     
Telus also advanced a number of other arguments which were rejected by
the reviewing judge. Telus submitted that police should have waited until the
end of the 14-day period covered by the general warrant and applied for a
single production order. The judge rejected Telus’s submission that police had
to wait so long to obtain the messages. He also found that while police could
have gone to the Justice of the Peace to obtain 14 separate production orders,
that would have been an impractical solution in the circumstances (para. 76).
He identified various drawbacks of requiring police to seek 14 authorizations
including the need to make repeated, daily applications potentially involving
different judicial officers and the inconvenience to Telus resulting from
having to deal with daily warrants requiring prompt response (para. 70). Sproat
J. concluded that a single general warrant that authorized police to receive
deliveries of messages by e-mail over roughly two weeks was appropriate because
“it would have been impractical for the police to obtain a daily warrant to
achieve the investigative objective of obtaining stored text messages for daily
review” (para. 76). 

[127]                     
The reviewing judge also dismissed Telus’s submission that issuing a
general warrant was not in the best interests of the administration of justice
(s. 487.01(1)(b)).  He held that the technique sought to be authorized
was not an interception. The judge concluded that “it is not open to the court
to decide on public policy grounds that the legislative scheme is inappropriate
and, under the guise of what is in the best interests of the administration of
justice, effectively expand the ambit of Part VI of the Criminal Code ”
(para. 80). The reviewing judge similarly rejected Telus’s submissions that the
general warrant was unwieldy and unworkable and imposed an undue burden. The
judge noted that similar concerns had been dismissed by this Court in Tele-Mobile
Co. v. Ontario, 2008 SCC 12, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 305, at para. 60.

D.     Issues

[128]                     
The principal point advanced by Telus on appeal is that the
investigative technique authorized by the general warrant was, in fact, an
interception of a private communication and therefore, by virtue of the “no
other provision” requirement in s. 487.01(1)(c), could only be
authorized under Part VI of the Code. My colleague Abella J. agrees with
this position while I, respectfully, do not.  My colleague Moldaver J., on the
other hand, does not find it necessary to address Telus’s principal submission. 
Instead, he would hold that even if the general warrant is not, strictly
speaking, an interception, it authorizes a technique that is substantively the
same as an interception and therefore should be excluded from authorization by
a general warrant by virtue of the “no other provision” requirement in s.
487.01(1)(c). Thus there are two issues:

1.      Is the
investigative technique authorized by the general warrant in this case an
interception which requires an authorization under Part VI of the Code? 

2.      If the
seizure of the stored text messages is not an interception, is the issuance of
a general warrant nevertheless barred by the “no other provision” requirement
in s. 487.01(1)(c) because the technique sought to be authorized was
substantively the equivalent of a wiretap?

III. 
  Analysis

A.     First Issue: Is the Investigative Technique
Authorized by the General Warrant in This Case an Interception Which Requires an
Authorization Under Part VI of the Code?

[129]                     
Telus submits that a general warrant could not issue in this case
because the technique for which police were seeking authorization was the
interception of private communications. The investigative technique of
interception of private communications can be authorized by a judge under s.
186 in Part VI of the Code.  Therefore, goes the argument, a general
warrant should not have been issued because the police did not meet the “no
other provision” requirement for a general warrant (s. 487.01(1)(c)). 

[130]                     
My colleague Abella J. substantially accepts this position. She would
hold that the general warrant purported to authorize an interception because it
allowed for “the prospective production of future text messages from a
service provider’s computer” (para. 15 (emphasis in original)). I understand
“the prospective production of future text messages” to mean that at the
time the warrant issues, at least some of the messages that are required to be
disclosed have not yet come into existence. In my respectful view, this general
warrant did not authorize an interception.

[131]                     
 The investigative technique authorized by the general warrant in this
case was not an interception of private communications that could be authorized
by s. 186. The general warrant provides the police with copies from Telus of
stored messages which it had previously intercepted; police only obtain
disclosure of the messages when Telus compiles them from its databases and
sends them by e-mail.  Far from being a “technical” difference, the distinction
between disclosure of an intercepted communication and interception of a
communication is fundamental to both the purpose and the scheme of the wiretap
provisions.

                    1.     The
Text, Context and Scheme of Part VI

[132]                     
The question of whether what the police did under this general warrant
is an interception of a private communication is one of statutory
interpretation.  In my view, when we read the text of the statutory provisions
in its full context, it is clear that the general warrant does not authorize an
interception that requires a Part VI authorization. 

[133]                     
As a general rule, the police require an authorization to intercept
private communications by means of any electro-magnetic, acoustic, mechanical
or other device. The key words are thus “intercept” and “private communication”. 


[134]                     
The word “intercept” is given a non-exhaustive definition: it includes
“listen to, record or acquire a communication or acquire the substance, meaning
or purport thereof” (s. 183).  The definition of the term “private
communication” is linked to the concept of interception. Stripping the
definition of “private communication” down to its essentials, a private
communication is a communication made “under circumstances in which it is
reasonable for the originator to expect that it will not be intercepted by any
person other than the person intended by the originator to receive it” (s.
183).  

[135]                     
There is no doubt that the text message is a private communication. As
we shall see, there is also no doubt that text messages were intercepted by
Telus by means of an electro-magnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device.
The question is whether the police also intercepted those messages when Telus
turned over to them copies of sent and received messages previously intercepted
by Telus and stored in its databases. 

[136]                     
This brings me to a fuller examination of the purpose, text and scheme
of the wiretap provisions.  In my view, this analysis sheds the most light on
Parliament’s intent as to whether the technique adopted by the police in this
case constitutes an interception. The relevant provisions are set out in the
Appendix.

[137]                     
Fundamental to both the purpose and to the scheme of the provisions is
the distinction between the interception of private communications and the
disclosure, use or retention of private communications that have been
intercepted. The purpose, text and scheme of Part VI show that the disclosure,
use or retention of intercepted private communications is distinct from the act
of interception itself. 

[138]                     
When the original wiretap provisions were introduced in 1973, the
explanatory note to the Bill outlined that one of its purposes was to create
three distinct types of offences. Two are relevant to this case. The first
offence relates to the interception of private communications by the use
of any electro-magnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device. The second
relates to the disclosure of private communications intercepted by the
use of any such device (Explanatory Note, Bill C-176, Protection of Privacy
Act, 1st Sess., 29th Parl. (S.C. 1973-74, c. 50)). While explanatory notes
are less authoritative than legislated statements of purpose, they nonetheless
provide some insight to legislative purpose: R. Sullivan, Sullivan on the
Construction of Statutes (5th ed. 2008), at p. 272. The explanatory note thus
shows that from its inception, one of the purposes of the legislation was to
distinguish between interceptions of private communications and the subsequent
and separate acts of disclosure or use of intercepted private communications.
This shows that Parliament understood interception and disclosure of
intercepted communications to be different things and therefore did not intend
to include disclosure or use of intercepted communications as part of the
concept of interception.

[139]                     
An early commentator on the legislation noticed that this distinction
was fundamental to the statutory scheme.  David Watt (now Watt J.A. at the
Ontario Court of Appeal) considered whether or not replaying, rehearing, or
re-recording a previously recorded conversation constituted an “interception”
and concluded: 

Each replaying or rehearing of the original
interception may well constitute [a] use or disclosure of the intercepted
communication within the relevant prohibition but, use or disclosure is not,
perforce, interception, and to equate the two is to ignore the fundamental
statutory distinction between them. [Emphasis added.]

 

(Law of Electronic
Surveillance in Canada (1979), at p. 44) 

[140]                     
This distinction between interception and disclosure is reflected in the
structure of the offence-creating provisions in Part VI. In other words, the
text of the legislation precisely reflects the purpose set out in the
Explanatory Note. Part VI creates distinct offences reflecting the purpose set
out in the Explanatory Note. 

[141]                     
One offence, as noted, prohibits the interception of a private
communication. Section 184 of the Code provides that “[e]very one
who, by means of any electro-magnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device,
willfully intercepts a private communication is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years”.  There
are a number of exceptions which I will review shortly. The other offence is
concerned with disclosure or use of intercepted information. Section 193
of the Code provides that it is an indictable offence to use or disclose
the content or existence of an intercepted communication without the consent of
the originator or the person intended to receive it.  Once again, there are
several exceptions which I will return to in a moment. The enactment of these
two distinct offences underlines that the act of interception and the act of
disclosure or use of intercepted communications are distinct acts which receive
distinct treatment under the statutory scheme.  

[142]                     
Turning to the first offence which deals with interceptions, there are
several “saving provisions” that exclude certain acts that would otherwise
constitute illegal interceptions.  These exclusions from liability are relevant
to understanding the statutory scheme because they distinguish interception
of communications from use or retention of intercepted communications.
It is not necessary to go into all of the details, but the exemptions from
criminal liability fall into three categories. It is not an offence to
intercept a private communication by means of an electro-magnetic, acoustic,
mechanical or other device if (i) the interception occurs with consent (s.
184(2)(a)); (ii) the interception is authorized in accordance with the
authorization provisions (s. 184(2)(b)); or (iii) the interception is
done for the purposes of providing a communications service or by a servant of
Her Majesty engaged in radio frequency spectrum management, or for the purposes
of managing or protecting a computer system (s. 184(2)(c), (d) and
(e)). 

[143]                     
The important point is that the third of these saving provisions — the
one in relation to computer system interceptions — makes a distinction between interception
on the one hand and use or retention of the intercepted
communications on the other.  Section 184(2)(e) excludes from the
offence the interception of a private communication passing through a computer
system by a person in control of it, provided that the interception is
reasonably necessary for managing the quality of service or protecting the
computer system.  This exception is qualified by s. 184(3), which relies on the
distinction between interception and use or retention. Under s.
184(3), a private communication intercepted by a person in control of a
computer system may only be used or retained if it is essential to
prevent harm to the system or if it is disclosed as provided for elsewhere in
the legislation. 

[144]                     
Thus, within the interception offence provisions, there is a distinction
made between interceptions and the use or retention of intercepted
communications. This suggests that Parliament viewed those acts as different
and distinct.

[145]                     
That brings us to the second offence in the scheme, the offence
prohibiting the use or disclosure of previously intercepted private
communications. Under s. 193(1), it is an offence to use or disclose
the content or existence of a private communication that has been intercepted
without consent. Note that the use and disclosure offence relates to a “private
communication or any part thereof or the substance, meaning or purport
thereof”.  The existence of this offence as something distinct from the
interception offence shows that Parliament treated interception and disclosure
or use as distinct concepts.

[146]                     
A comparison of the exemptions in ss. 184 and 193 reinforces my
position. The exemptions in s. 193 are far more permissive than those in s.
184, especially with respect to criminal investigations. Under s. 184, police
can only intercept communications if they are authorized to do so (s. 184(2)(b))
or in certain exceptional circumstances (s. 184.4). By contrast, s. 193
includes broad exemptions that permit disclosure of intercepted communications
in a range of circumstances including in the course of civil or criminal
proceedings (s. 193(2)(a)), and “in the course of or for the purpose of
any criminal investigation” (s. 193(2)(b)). Had Parliament understood
disclosure of intercepted private communications to be a form of interception,
one would expect substantial correspondence between the exemptions relating to
interception and those relating to disclosure. This is plainly not the case.

[147]                     
This point is even further supported by a comparison of the particular
exemptions that apply to communication service providers, set out in ss. 193(2)
and 184(2).  Recall that providers of communication services are exempt from
the interception offence when they intercept communications for the purposes of
service delivery (s. 184(2)(c)). There is a comparable exemption for
service providers in relation to the disclosure offence. Section 193(2)(d)
exempts from criminal liability disclosures in the course of the operation of a
communications or computer system, provided that the disclosure is necessarily
incidental to the purposes which provide such operators with an exemption from
the interception offence. Thus, operators of communications systems such as
Telus are exempted in certain circumstances from both the interception offence
and the disclosure offence. This further underlines that Parliament viewed
these activities as distinct. 

[148]                     
To sum up, the legislative scheme creates two distinct offences, one
which deals with interception and the other with use or disclosure of a
communication. Fundamental to the scheme is the distinction between these
activities:  if disclosure or use of a private communication were an
interception of it, there would be no need to create the distinct disclosure or
use offence.  Similarly, the exemptions from criminal liability show that
Parliament distinguished between interception on one hand and retention, use
and disclosure on the other. 

                    2.     Did the General Warrant
Authorize an Interception of a Private Communication? 

[149]                     
How does this relate to what Telus and the police were doing under the
general warrant in this case?  To begin with Telus, no one disputes that it was
intercepting text messages when it copied them for its own systems
administration purposes. Similarly, it is agreed (and I will accept for the
purposes of this appeal) that Telus did not commit the offence of unlawful
interception. It performed interceptions for a permitted purpose which was
exempted from criminal liability. Section 184(2)(c) makes it clear that
it is not an offence for communication service providers such as Telus to
intercept private communications where that is necessary for, among other
things, quality control purposes.  Under s. 193(2)(d), they also, for
the same purposes, can disclose the intercepted communications without
incurring criminal liability. There is, therefore, no question for the purposes
of this appeal that Telus lawfully intercepted private communications.

[150]                     
What about the actions of the police under the general warrant?  They
sought disclosure from Telus of information that it had already lawfully
intercepted. The general warrant did not require Telus to intercept
communications, but to provide copies of communications that it had previously
intercepted for its own lawful purposes. There is no suggestion that Telus was
carrying out these interceptions at the bidding of the police; interceptions
carried out for police purposes would clearly require authorizations as they
would not fall within the exempt purposes under s. 184(2)(c). However,
as the scheme of the legislation makes clear, disclosure or use of a lawfully
intercepted communication is not an interception.  As discussed in detail
earlier, Part VI of the Code makes a fundamental distinction between, on
one hand, intercepting — i.e. listening to, recording or acquiring a
communication or the substance, meaning or purport thereof — and, on the other,
using or disclosing a private communication or the substance, meaning or
purport thereof or disclosing the existence of the communication. This
distinction is recognized by the purposes of the provisions, by the creation of
distinct offences for unlawful interception and unlawful use or disclosure and
by the saving provisions which apply to the interception and disclosure
offences. 

[151]                     
In my view, it is inconsistent with the fundamental distinction made by
the legislation to conclude that the police were intercepting private
communications when Telus provided them with copies of previously intercepted
and stored text messages.

                    3.      Abella J.’s Reasons

[152]                     
That brings me to Abella J.’s reasons. She would hold that the general
warrant purported to authorize an interception because it allowed for  “the prospective
production of future text messages from a service provider’s computer” (para.
15 (emphasis in original)); the fact that the messages were stored in a
database is simply a “technical” difference in Telus’s service delivery system
that should not “deprive Telus subscribers of the protection of the Code”
(para. 3). Therefore, a wiretap authorization, not a general warrant, was
required. This interpretation relies on the fact that the word “intercept” is
defined to include “acquire a communication or . . . the substance, meaning or
purport thereof” (s. 183) and the fact that wiretap authorizations are
prospective in nature.  I do not find this approach convincing for three
reasons.

[153]                     
My first difficulty is that Abella J.’s approach does not give effect to
the clear distinction in the statute between interception and disclosure.  For
reasons I set out earlier, this distinction cannot in my view be dismissed as a
mere “technical difference”. The distinction is fundamental to the scheme of
the provisions. Parliament treated “interception” and “disclosure” as separate
acts, giving rise to different offences and different exemptions, even though
they may relate to the same private communications. When Telus turns over to the
police the copies of the communications that it has previously intercepted,
Telus is disclosing the communications, not intercepting them again.  I do not
understand how this disclosure by Telus from its databases can be an
interception by the police.  

[154]                     
 The second difficulty with my colleague’s position relates to her
reliance on the definition of “intercept” in s. 183 and particularly on the
fact that “intercept” includes “acquire the substance, meaning or purport” of a
private communication. Read broadly, this definition of “intercept” means that
any time the police acquire the content of a private communication by means of
any electro-magnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device, they have engaged
in an interception.   In my view, the context and purpose of Part VI require
the phrase “acquire the substance, meaning or purport” of a private
communication to be read more narrowly.  

[155]                     
To begin, “acquire” must be understood in the context of the text
surrounding it; it is found in a list that includes “listen to” and “record”,
both activities that occur simultaneously with the communication being
intercepted.  It is also used to explain the word “intercept” and I think it is
clear that there are many ways to acquire the content of a communication that
could not be thought of as an interception. Moreover, if, as my colleague
Abella J. maintains (at para. 37), “[a]cquiring the substance of a private
communication from a computer maintained by a telecommunications service
provider” constitutes an interception, then wiretap authorizations may well be
required for a host of searches that are clearly not contemplated by Part VI of
the Code.  Police may well have to obtain a Part VI authorization any
time they want access to the content of private communications, no matter when
the message has been sent or whether it has been received or stored on the
recipient’s device.  For example, on a broad reading of “acquire” police
seizing e-mails on a BlackBerry device would be engaged in an interception
because they are acquiring the content of private communications. Similarly, a
person authorized to search a computer system as contemplated under s. 487(2.1)
would need a wiretap authorization to seize copies of personal communications
stored on those computers (including, for example, e-mail messages and stored
copies of Internet chats). This approach would run counter to a line of cases
in which Canadian courts have found that search warrants are sufficient to
allow police to access documents and data stored on a computer: see, e.g., R.
v. Cole, 2012 SCC 53, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 34, at para. 73; R. v. Jones,
2011 ONCA 632, 107 O.R. (3d) 241, at para. 33; R. v. Bahr, 2006 ABPC
360, 434 A.R. 1; R. v. Cross, 2007 Can LII 64141 (Ont. S.C.J.), at
paras. 25-27; R. v. Little, 2009 CanLII 41212 (Ont. S.C.J.), at
para. 154; R. v. Tse, 2008 BCSC 906 (CanLII), at para. 198; R. v.
Weir, 2001 ABCA 181, 281 A.R. 333, at para. 19. If the phrase
“acquire a communication or . . . the substance, meaning or purport thereof” is
given a broad meaning, stored private communications that have long been
accessible to police under ordinary search warrants or production orders would
fall under Part VI. 

[156]                     
As I see it, such a broad reading of “acquire” is inappropriate, given
the scheme and purpose of the wiretap provisions. I will not repeat the
analysis set out above.  It flows from that analysis, however, that acquiring
the content of a previously intercepted and stored communication cannot be an
interception because that broad reading is inconsistent with the clear
distinction between interception and disclosure in the provisions. Applied
broadly, this interpretation of “acquire” would extend the scope of
investigative techniques which require wiretap authorizations far beyond
anything ever previously contemplated.

[157]                     
That brings me to the temporal aspect of interception that Abella J.
introduces, which is the third difficulty I see with her approach.  As I
understand it, the acquisition of the content of a private communication is an
interception if the acquisition is authorized prospectively.  It follows that
whether or not an act constitutes an interception depends not on the nature or
timing of the act itself, but on when the act is authorized.  It necessarily
follows that the seizure of previously intercepted and stored text messages
would not be an interception as long as it was authorized after the
messages were stored.  The police could obtain a production order at the end of
every day during the period covered by the general warrant and there would be
no interception. However, under this prospective authorization test, if the
police were to seize the exact same information, in the same form and by the
same means pursuant to an authorization issued before the messages were
stored, they would be engaging in an interception. This approach seems to me to
confuse the act of interception with the nature of its authorization.

[158]                     
Interception is a technique, a way of acquiring the substance of a
private communication.  I do not understand how it could be that exactly the
same technique, which acquires information in exactly the same form, may be
either a seizure of stored material or an interception, depending on the point
in time at which the technique is authorized. But that is the result of my
colleague Abella J.’s analysis. I cannot accept this conclusion.

                    4.      The Conclusion on the
First Issue

[159]                     
In my view, the investigative technique which the police were authorized
to use by the general warrant was not an interception within the meaning of the
wiretap provisions of the Code. 

B.     Second
Issue:  If the Seizure of the Stored Text Messages Is Not an Interception, Is
the Issuance of a General Warrant Nevertheless Barred by the “No Other Provision”
Requirement in Section 487.01(1)(c) Because the Technique Sought to Be
Authorized Was Substantively the Equivalent of a Wiretap?

[160]                     
My colleague Moldaver J., like Abella J., would set aside the general
warrant because the police did not meet the “no other provision” requirement in
s. 487.01(1)(c).  However, Moldaver J. reaches this conclusion by a
different route which, as I understand it, relies on three main points. First,
the general warrant is one of limited resort that should be used sparingly
(para. 56).  I respectfully do not accept this general proposition or the
result to which its adoption leads in this case. Second, the technique proposed
by police in this case is “substantively” the same as an interception and
therefore cannot be authorized under s. 487.01(1) because of the “no other
provision” requirement in para. (c). Respectfully, as I see it, the
“substantive equivalency” test is not part of the analysis under s. 487.01(1)(c)
and would not apply to the facts of this case even if it were. Third, given
this “substantive” similarity, police resort to the general warrant amounts to
a “misuse” of s. 487.01 , a “convenient way” for police to avoid the rigours of
wiretap authorizations. While I share my colleague’s view that the courts
should be vigilant for undue extension and abuse of the general warrant
provisions, my respectful view is that this is an inappropriate case in which
to give effect to those concerns. 

                    1.      The Purpose of the
General Warrant Provision

[161]                     
Moldaver J. counsels against literal interpretation of the provisions
and espouses a purposive one.  Of course, I agree that all legislation must be
interpreted purposively.  I respectfully part company about what results from a
purposive interpretation of this provision. 

[162]                     
I begin with the purposes of the general warrant provision. I do not
accept that the purpose of s. 487.01(1) is to provide authorizations only in
very limited circumstances and that it therefore must only be used “sparingly”.
On the contrary, as numerous authorities have acknowledged, the provision is
cast in wide terms.  As one leading commentator put it: 

                             Through
s. 487.01 (and s. 487.02 ), Parliament has provided a broad, plenary
warrant-granting power intended to ensure that judicial authorization is
legally available for virtually any investigative technique that can be brought
within the Hunter conditions for judicial pre-authorization. 

 

(S. C. Hutchison,
Hutchison’s Canadian Search Warrant Manual 2005 (2nd ed. 2004), at p. 143) 

When the Ontario Court of Appeal
considered this issue in R. v. Ha, 2009 ONCA 340, 96 O.R. (3d) 751, at
para. 35, leave to appeal refused, [2009] 3 S.C.R. vii, it rejected a
restrictive interpretation of s. 487.01. Rather, the court affirmed the remedial
character of s. 487.01 and cited its previous holding in R. v. Lauda
(1998), 37 O.R. (3d) 513, at pp. 522-23, aff’d [1998] 2 S.C.R. 683, to the
effect that the general warrant provides for a flexible range of investigative
procedures; see also R. v. Noseworthy (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 641,
at p. 644. 

[163]                     
Taking into account this understanding of the purpose of s. 487.01, I
approach the interpretation of the provision differently than my colleague. In
particular, I do not accept as an imperative that s. 487.01 must be interpreted
with a view to heavily restricting its use. The focus of the inquiry is on two
matters (in addition of course to reasonable grounds to believe that an offence
has been committed and that information concerning the offence will be obtained): 
Is authorization for the “technique, procedure or device to be used or the
thing to be done” provided for in any other federal statute and is it in the
best interests of the administration of justice to authorize it to be done?  

[164]                     
Turning from the purpose of s. 487.01 to the text and purpose of s.
487.01(1)(c) specifically, its focus is on the means by which an
investigation is carried out, not its objective.  Section 487.01(1)(c)
provides that a general warrant may issue if “there is no other provision . . .
that would provide for a warrant, authorization or order permitting the
technique, procedure or device to be used or the thing to be done”. The
words “technique”, “procedure”, “device to be used” and “thing to be done” all
are concerned with what the police want to do, not why they want
to do it. This paragraph does not require issuing judges to consider whether
other techniques are similar or allow access to the same evidence; it simply
asks if the same technique can be authorized by another provision. 

[165]                     
The jurisprudence under this provision has consistently taken this
approach.  MacPherson J.A. made this point in Ha when he observed, at
para. 43, that 

[t]he focus in the s. 487.01(1)(c) analysis is
not on whether there are other investigative techniques that might accomplish
the purported investigative purposes or goals of the police; rather the
focus is on the particular investigative technique or procedure that the police
seek to utilize and whether it can properly be authorized by another provision.
[Emphasis added.] 

This is not simply a narrow, literal interpretation
of s. 487.01. Rather, it is an interpretation that reflects its purpose of
conferring a broad judicial discretion to authorize the police to “use any
device or investigative technique or procedure or do any thing”,
provided of course that the judge is satisfied that it is in the best interests
of the administration of justice to do so, having due regard to the importance
of the constitutional right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures. 
I completely agree with MacPherson J.A., writing for the Ontario Court of
Appeal in Ha, when he said that he saw “no policy reason for struggling
to constrain the scope of s. 487.01 by adding words that were not expressly
included by Parliament in the provision” (para. 37).

[166]                     
I note that Moldaver J. relies on this same paragraph in Ha to
support the view that investigative goals are to be taken into account in the
s. 487.01(1)(c) analysis, suggesting that in this passage MacPherson
J.A. adopted an approach which considered “substantive” differences between
various techniques (para. 70). Read in full, however, MacPherson J.A.’s reasons
do not support that proposition. As I see it, MacPherson J.A. was not
“[e]xplaining why the search sanctioned . . . in Ha was . . .
substantively different from one involving multiple conventional warrants”
(Moldaver J., at para. 70). This is clear not only in the portions of the
paragraph which I cite above, but also from the way MacPherson J.A. summarizes
his conclusion, at para. 41: “The simple fact is that there is no provision . .
. that would authorize an unlimited number of covert entries and searches on
private property over a two-month period.”  In performing the s. 487.01(1)(c)
analysis, MacPherson J.A. simply compared the search for which the police
sought authorization under a general warrant with other search provisions and
concluded that none of them would permit authorization of what the police
sought to do.

[167]                     
Similarly, in R. v. Brand, 2008 BCCA 94, 229 C.C.C. (3d) 443 (sub
nom. R. v. Ford), at para. 50, Frankel J.A. for the court stated that
“[r]esort to a general warrant is only precluded when judicial approval for the
proposed ‘technique, procedure or device or the doing of the thing’ is
available under some other federal statutory provision.” There is no hint in
his reasons that there is any substantive equivalency or investigative
necessity analysis required.

[168]                     
I am reinforced in my reading of s. 487.01(1)(c) by a comparison
of that paragraph with s. 186(1)(b) which sets out the investigative
necessity requirement that must be met before a wiretap can be issued. According
to s. 186(1)(b) an authorization under that section cannot be given
unless the judge is satisfied 

that other investigative procedures have been tried and
have failed, other investigative procedures are unlikely to succeed or the
urgency of the matter is such that it would be impractical to carry out the
investigation of the offence using only other investigative procedures. 

In R. v. Araujo, 2000 SCC 65, [2000] 2 S.C.R.
992, the Court established that, under s. 186(1)(b), a judge cannot
issue an intercept authorization unless she is satisfied that “practically
speaking” there is “no other reasonable alternative method of investigation, in
the circumstances of the particular criminal inquiry” (para. 29 (emphasis
deleted)). The standard set by Parliament here is high; it is not enough that
an interception would be “more efficacious” than some other available
technique, it must be necessary to the investigation (Araujo, at
para. 39).  

[169]                     
By contrast, under s. 487.01(1)(c), a judge only needs to be
satisfied that the proposed technique cannot be authorized by provisions in the
Code or some other Act of Parliament. The judge does not, in addition,
need to be satisfied that the novel technique is necessary to the investigation
or that it is not the substantive equivalent of something that can be
authorized elsewhere. Parliament knew how to direct an issuing judge or justice
to consider whether other investigative techniques would achieve the
investigative objective.  It did so in s. 186(1)(b).  It did not do so
in s. 487.01(1)(c). 

[170]                     
Of course, this does not mean that the court should authorize anything
the police seek to do simply because it is not authorized elsewhere.  The
judicial discretion to issue the warrant must give full effect to the
protection of reasonable expectations of privacy as set out in the abundant
jurisprudence under s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms . Judges should not exercise their discretion so as to permit the
police to use the general warrant to evade the pre-authorization requirements
that Parliament has imposed on certain investigative techniques. However, as I
will explain, my view is that those concerns should be addressed directly and
specifically under s. 487.01(1) (b) when they arise, not by reading in a
limitation in s. 487.01(1) (c) that is not there. 

[171]                     
To sum up on this point, there is no support in the text or the
purpose   of s. 487.01(1)(c), or in the jurisprudence, for building into
it a “substantive equivalency” test.  The paragraph asks a simple question:
Does federal legislation provide for “a warrant, authorization or order
permitting the technique, procedure or device to be used or the thing to be
done”?  Where this threshold is met, the judge is entitled to consider granting
the requested authorization.  The further question of whether the authorization
ought to be granted is not the focus of this paragraph of the section.
Rather, as I will explain, whether a general warrant ought to issue
is properly considered under s. 487.01(1)(b), which asks whether
authorizing the warrant would be in the best interests of the administration of
justice. Not only, in my view, is this approach supported by the text, purpose
and jurisprudence.  The alternative proposed by Moldaver J. also creates
unnecessary uncertainty and distracts the issuing judge from the question of
whether the technique sought to be authorized is inconsistent with the right to
be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.  

[172]                     
I turn first to my concern about uncertainty. In my view, predictability
and clarity in the law are particularly important in the area of judicial
pre-authorization of searches. Judicial pre-authorization is a cornerstone of
the Charter ’s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. 
The primary objective of pre-authorization is not to identify unreasonable
searches after the fact, but to ensure that unreasonable searches are not
conducted. The requirements for pre-authorization should be as clear as
possible to ensure that Charter  rights are fully protected. 

[173]                     
Clarity also serves an important practical objective. Generally, and
unlike in this case, challenges to judicial pre-authorization of searches are
made after the fact at trial. If successful, the admissibility of the evidence
obtained under the authorized search is put at risk. The police cannot undo,
after the fact, that during their investigation, they relied on what is
ultimately found to be a defective authorization. This makes it of great
practical importance for the law to be clear to judges and justices who are
asked to authorize searches and to police officers who seek authorization. 

[174]                     
The approach adopted by my colleague Moldaver J. in my view is seriously
deficient in this regard. No guidance is provided as to when one investigative
technique should be found to be substantively the same as another and when the
differences are merely technical.  As I will discuss in the next section of my
reasons, this uncertainty is apparent from my colleague’s application of the
“substantive equivalency” test in this case.

[175]                     
Moreover, my view is that adopting this approach to s. 487.01(1)(c)
will not assist issuing judges in giving effect to the constitutional guarantee
of freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures.  That issue should be
addressed directly under s. 487.01(1)(b), not through a vague,
unnecessary and largely semantic exercise of comparing how much one technique
may be like another.  As I shall discuss, even when that question is addressed
directly in this case, the arguments against issuing the general warrant are,
in my respectful view, unconvincing.

                    2.      The “Substantive
Equivalency” of the Proposed Technique and an Interception

[176]                     
Even if I were to accept (which I do not) that s. 487.01(1)(c) is
concerned with the substantive equivalency of various investigative techniques,
I would not find the technique sought to be authorized here to be the
substantive equivalent of a wiretap authorization. According to my colleague
Moldaver J., the general warrant in this case authorized a technique that was
in substance an interception “because it prospectively authorizes police
access to future private communications on a continual basis over
a sustained period of time. . . .  But for the 24-hour time delay, the
investigative techniques were the same” (paras. 61 and 68 (emphasis in
original)).

[177]                     
Respectfully, this assertion is not borne out by the facts nor
consistent with the law. 

[178]                     
Turning first to the facts, a wiretap authorization alone would not
allow the police to obtain the information that Telus was required to provide
under the general warrant. In fact, as the evidence from Telus shows, three
separate authorizations would be required in order to provide the police with
the means to access the information provided to them under the general warrant.
As I explained above, when Telus responds to a wiretap authorization, it
installs a device which re-routes in real time a copy of each text message sent
to and from a particular number to the police. The general warrant in this case
requires Telus to do more: it has to sort through its databases to deliver
stored text messages and it also has to provide the relevant subscriber
information relating to them. 

[179]                     
In her affidavit filed before the reviewing judge, Corinne McNish, a
Telus Security Analyst, indicated that three different authorizations would be
necessary to obtain the information required under the general warrant: an
authorization under s. 492.2(1) for a dial number recorder; an authorization
under s. 492.2(2) to obtain telephone records; and a Part VI authorization. I
would add that, in order to make use of a Part VI authorization, police would
have to secure a wire room or listening post to receive the messages as well as
officers to process the incoming information, to deal with the information
obtained from the dial number recorder and to sort through the telephone
records. 

[180]                     
In light of Telus’s own evidence, then, it seems to me to be quite a
stretch to assert that the investigative techniques were substantively the
same. 

[181]                     
Notwithstanding these clear and significant differences between the two
techniques, my colleague relies heavily on two facts in concluding that the
techniques were substantively the same:  the fact that there was only a 24-hour
time delay in the police gaining access to the information under the general
warrant and that the general warrant authorized the turning over of the stored
messages “prospectively”. As I see it, the first fact is not correct and the
second does not support the conclusion drawn from it.

[182]                     
 Turning first to the time delay, my colleague finds that the time delay
between when the messages were sent and when they were to be received by police
was short enough that their production would constitute the substantive
equivalent of an interception. While Moldaver J. declines to identify the point
at which the period of delay would render the proposed technique substantively
different from an interception, he concludes that “the 24-hour gap here fell
short of the mark” (footnote 2).  Respectfully, I cannot agree for two reasons.


[183]                     
First, as the general warrant itself makes clear, some of the messages
that police were to receive would be delayed by 72 hours, not 24. The productions
ordered under the general warrant were to begin on March 30, 2010, and end on
April 16, 2010. On Tuesday March 30, Telus was to produce information from
March 18 to March 30, and the Crown concedes that this could have been obtained
by a production order and therefore could not be the subject of a general
warrant. Applied over the next two and a half weeks, the general warrant
created two different time gaps, as I described earlier. On Tuesday through
Friday, Telus was required to provide by 2:00 p.m. each day the messages sent
and received between 11:00 a.m. the previous day and 11:00 a.m. that day.  
However, on weekends, there was a longer “gap”.  By 2:00 p.m. on Mondays, Telus
was required to provide the messages stored between 11:00 a.m. the previous
Friday and 11:00 a.m. on Monday.  Thus, for twelve days, production was daily.
However, on weekends, or for six days covered by the general warrant, there was
a longer “gap” of   72 hours. The question therefore arises whether that
72-hour delay also “fell short of the mark” and if not, whether police would
need different authorizations for the messages they received on Mondays than
they would for the messages they received on the other days of the week. 

[184]                     
Second, because I agree with the reviewing judge that police could
have obtained a series of daily production orders, I have difficulty
accepting that the 24-hour “gap” on which Moldaver J. relies makes the general
warrant substantively equivalent to an interception. A series of daily
production orders would have provided police with copies of the text messages
within 24 hours of the time that they were sent. On my colleague’s
understanding of what is substantively an interception, then, some production orders
could also be the equivalent of interceptions.  This, as I see it, underlines
the confusion and uncertainty inherent in the substantive equivalency approach
to s. 487.01(1)(c).

[185]                     
The second fact advanced in support of the finding of substantive equivalency
is that the authorization is “prospective”.  As I pointed out earlier, however,
it is hard to understand how exactly the same technique either is or is not
equivalent to an interception, depending on the point in time that it is
authorized. If we accept for the purposes of this appeal, which I do, that the
police could lawfully obtain daily production orders, I simply cannot
understand how authorizing that technique two weeks earlier converts the
production order into a wiretap authorization.

[186]                     
Finally, the conclusion of substantive equivalency is inconsistent with
the text and scheme of the wiretap provisions themselves. As I have explained
at length earlier, the act of disclosure of previously intercepted private
communication has been identified and treated in the Code as a separate
and distinct act from that of interception itself. With respect, I cannot
accept that what Parliament has made a legally significant distinction is
merely a technical difference. 

[187]                     
To sum up, even if one were to accept reading into s. 487.01(1)(c)
a “substantive equivalency” test, neither the facts nor the law would support
its application in this case, in my respectful view. 

[188]                     
This also underlines, as I see it, the confusion and uncertainty that
would flow from adopting such a test.  My colleague provides no meaningful
guidance on this point aside from a 24-hour “gap” guideline.  The latter is
problematic, however, because it conflicts with the availability of daily
production orders under s. 487.012.  In my view, issuing judges and police
investigators should not be left to draw the line on their own and then to
hope, with little reason for optimism, that they will be found to have been
right after a voir dire at a future trial.

                    3.      Dealing
With Abuses of General Warrants

[189]                     
This brings us to the real heart of the matter: whether the general
warrant should not have been issued because it represents, as my colleague
would have it, a “misuse” of s. 487.01, an “easy way out”, or a “convenient
way”, “device” or “hook”, that allows the police to  “escape the rigours” of
Part VI (paras. 72, 81, 90 and 105). As I read Moldaver J.’s reasons, the
proposed interpretation of s. 487.01(1)(c) is driven by a need to
preclude abuses of the general warrant power. I accept that judges asked to
issue general warrants must be vigilant to ensure that the right to be free
against unreasonable searches and seizures is fully given effect by any
investigative technique that is authorized. However, my view is that this
analysis should be undertaken directly under s. 487.01(1)(b), not
through the lens of asking the question of whether two techniques are
substantively equivalent.

[190]                     
As MacPherson J.A. wisely pointed out in Ha, the “no other
provision” requirement in s. 487.01(1)(c)  is not the only requirement
that must be met before a general warrant may be issued (para. 44).  The
section should not be approached on the assumption that Parliament intended
that every investigative technique not authorized elsewhere could be authorized
under s. 487.01(1): see, e.g., S. Coughlan, “R. v. Ha: Upholding General
Warrants without Asking the Right Questions” (2009), 65 C.R. (6th) 41. Rather,
the judge asked to issue the warrant must also be satisfied that it is in the
best interests of the administration of justice to authorize the particular
technique (s. 487.01(1)(b)).  This is the provision under which
potential abuses of the general warrant should be addressed, in my view. Of
course, even where the requirements in s. 487.01(1)(b) and (c)
are met, s. 487.01(3) requires that a general warrant contain “such terms and
conditions as the judge considers advisable to ensure that any search or
seizure authorized by the warrant is reasonable in the circumstances”. 

[191]                     
Section 487.01(1)(b) was not raised in this appeal and I do not
want to say much about it beyond my view that it is the place in s. 487.01 that
addresses concerns about whether a new investigative technique is one that
should be authorized. That said, I do not find Moldaver J.’s concerns raised
under the rubric of the proposed “substantive equivalency” test at all
compelling.

[192]                     
First, I would not conclude that police sought a general warrant in this
case as a “convenient way” to avoid the rigours of Part VI.  Of course, there
is no evidence of that.  Second, I do not agree with the claim that the privacy
interests at stake in this case are exactly the same as those in issue where a
wiretap authorization is sought.  The reviewing judge accepted, and I agree,
that warrants could issue daily to provide the police with copies of the stored
messages.  I fail to see how the affected privacy interests are different if
permission to do that is granted two weeks in advance.  Third, for all of the
reasons identified by the reviewing judge, the general warrant was a more
practical approach than a series of production orders. Fourth, the general
warrant authorized a technique that was not only different from an interception
but was also more responsive to the needs of police. In particular, it
significantly reduced the burden on the police in terms of resources to staff a
wire room, and to extract information from subscriber records and dial number
recorders.  As I see it, the general warrant achieved the legitimate aims of
the police investigation in a much more convenient and cost-effective manner
than any other provision would have allowed.

[193]                     
Of course, the general warrant had the effect of shifting costs to
Telus. But that has nothing to do with the privacy interests of the
subscribers. Moreover, Telus advanced evidence and argument in relation to the
burden the general warrant placed on it, but those submissions were flatly
rejected by the reviewing judge and not renewed in this Court. 

[194]                     
On the record before us, I do not see evidence of “misuse” of s. 487.01
or an attempt by police to “escape the rigours” of Part VI.  What I see is effective
and practical police investigation by a relatively small municipal police force
which is fully respectful of the privacy interests of the targets of the
investigation and other Telus subscribers.

C.     Conclusion

[195]                     
For these reasons, I find that the general warrant did not authorize an
interception requiring a Part VI wiretap authorization and that the “no other
provision” requirement of s. 487.01(1)(c) was met.

IV.    Disposition

[196]                     
I would dismiss the appeal.

[1]
The validity of a series of daily (or more frequent) production orders
was not argued by the parties, nor is addressing that issue necessary to
resolve this appeal.  Accordingly, I would not decide whether there exists any
statutory or constitutional bar to the police seeking such orders.





[2] It is neither prudent nor necessary to draw a bright line in this
case as to when the period of delay would render the search technique substantively
different such that a general warrant would be acceptable.  Whatever that
timeframe may be, the 24-hour gap here fell short of the mark.  To the extent that
uncertainty arises in a future case, it must be resolved in keeping with the
approach to s. 487.01(1)(c) articulated here.  I also note that my
colleague Cromwell J. makes much of the fact that “some of the messages that
police were to receive would be delayed by 72 hours, not 24” (para. 183).  With
respect, I find his emphasis on this fact puzzling.  Even if one assumes that a
72-hour delay is substantively different from an intercept, it hardly follows
that because one part of an otherwise offensive authorization is valid,
the entire authorization should be spared.





[3]
The record in this case suggests that the entirety of the information
sought by the police could have been obtained pursuant to a Part VI
authorization, a number recorder under s. 492.2(1), and an order to obtain
telephone records under s. 492.2(2).  Before this Court, none of the parties
concentrated on the latter two authorizations; rather, they focused on whether
the warrant’s core — the delivery of text messages — amounted to an intercept.",2013-03-27 00:00:00,CA Supreme Court

                    Criminal
law — Sentencing —
Considerations — Collateral consequences of sentence — Accused sentenced to two
years’ imprisonment — Sentencing judge not made aware that sentence would
result in loss of right to appeal removal order under Immigration and Refugee
Protection Act  — Court of Appeal refusing to vary sentence to two years less a
day — What weight should be attributed to collateral consequences in sentencing?
— Whether sentence can be varied by appellate court on basis that accused would
face collateral consequences — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, ss. 718.1 ,
718.2 .

                    The
accused, a non‑citizen, was convicted of two drug‑related
offences.  In light of a joint submission by the Crown and defense counsel, the
sentencing judge imposed a sentence of two years’ imprisonment.  Under the Immigration
and Refugee Protection Act , a non‑citizen sentenced to a term of
imprisonment of at least two years loses the right to appeal a removal order
against him or her.  In the present case, neither party had raised the issue of
the collateral consequences of a two-year sentence on the accused’s immigration
status before the sentencing judge.  The majority of the Court of Appeal
dismissed the appeal and refused to vary the sentence. 

                    Held:
 The appeal should be allowed and the sentence of imprisonment reduced to two
years less a day.

                    A
sentencing judge may exercise his or her discretion to take collateral
immigration consequences into account, provided that the sentence ultimately
imposed is proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of
responsibility of the offender.  The significance of collateral immigration
consequences will depend on the facts of the case.  However, it remains that
they are but one of the relevant factors that a sentencing judge may take into
account in determining an appropriate sentence.  Those consequences must not be
allowed to skew the process either in favour of or against deportation. 
Further, it remains open to the sentencing judge to conclude that even a
minimal reduction of a sentence would render it inappropriate in light of the
gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.

                    An
appellate court has the authority to vary a sentence if the sentencing judge
was not aware of the collateral immigration consequences, or if counsel had
failed to advise the judge on this issue.  Where the matter was not raised
before the sentencing judge and where the Crown does not give its consent to
the appeal, some evidence should be adduced for consideration by the Court of
Appeal.  In the case at bar, the sentencing judge was unaware of the sentence’s
collateral immigration consequences and the Crown had conceded that sentence
should be reduced by one day.  It was wrong for the Court of Appeal to refuse
the sentence reduction based solely on the fact that the accused had a prior
criminal record or on its belief that the accused had abused the hospitality
that had been afforded to him by Canada.  It is therefore appropriate to grant
the variation of the sentence from two years to two years less a day.

                    The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

                    Wagner J. — 

I.  Introduction

[1]                             
The central issue in this appeal is whether a
sentence otherwise falling within the range of fit sentences can be varied by
an appellate court on the basis that the offender would face collateral
consequences under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C.
2001, c. 27  (“IRPA ”), s. 64 , that were not taken into account by the
sentencing judge.  

[2]                             
Since the Crown conceded that, had it been aware
of the collateral consequences at the time of the sentencing hearing, it would
have agreed to a sentence of two years less a day, this Court decided at the
conclusion of oral argument to allow the appeal and reduce the sentence from
two years to two years less a day. The following are the reasons for that
decision.

II.  Background

[3]                             
Hoang Anh Pham was convicted on charges of
producing marihuana and possessing it for the purpose of trafficking contrary
to ss. 7(1)  and 5(2)  of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C.
1996, c. 19 . In light of a joint submission by the Crown and counsel for the
appellant, the Provincial Court of Alberta imposed a sentence of two years’
imprisonment. 

[4]                             
Mr. Pham appealed the sentence, seeking to have
it reduced by one day. He argued that the sentencing judge was not aware of
and, for this reason, did not consider the collateral consequences of a
sentence of two years’ imprisonment on his immigration status. Under the IRPA ,
a non-citizen sentenced in Canada to a term of imprisonment of at least two
years loses the right to appeal a removal order against him or her. Considering
that a sentence of two years less a day, like the imposed sentence of two
years, remained within the range of appropriate sentences, the Crown conceded
that the sentence should be reduced by one day. It must be noted that neither
the appellant’s counsel nor the Crown had raised these issues before the
sentencing judge, who apparently was not aware of the collateral consequences. 


[5]                             
Despite the Crown’s concession, the majority of
the Court of Appeal of Alberta refused to vary the appellant’s sentence by one
day, holding that, in the circumstances, allowing the appeal from a sentence
situated within the range of otherwise fit sentences would inappropriately
undermine the provisions of the IRPA  (2012 ABCA 203, 533 A.R. 192, at
paras. 24-25). The dissenting judge would have allowed the variation, noting
that, had the appellant’s counsel been aware of the collateral consequences of
a two-year sentence in this case, a joint submission for a sentence of two
years less a day would have been agreed upon (para. 33). 

III. Analysis

[6]                             
Proportionality is a fundamental principle of
sentencing. Section 718.1  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 ,
provides that a sentence must
be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility
of the offender. 

[7]                             
LeBel J. explained proportionality as follows in
R. v. Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433, at para. 37: 

Proportionality is the sine qua non
of a just sanction. First, the principle ensures that a sentence reflects the
gravity of the offence. This is closely tied to the objective of denunciation.
It promotes justice for victims and ensures public confidence in the justice
system. . . . Second, the principle of proportionality ensures that a sentence
does not exceed what is appropriate, given the moral blameworthiness of the
offender. In this sense, the principle serves a limiting or restraining
function and ensures justice for the offender. In the Canadian criminal justice
system, a just sanction is one that reflects both perspectives on
proportionality and does not elevate one at the expense of the other. 

[8]                             
In addition to proportionality, the principle of
parity and the correctional imperative of sentence individualization also
inform the sentencing process. This Court has repeatedly emphasized the value
of individualization in sentencing: Ipeelee, at para. 39; R. v. Wust, 2000 SCC 18, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 455, at para. 21; R. v. M. (C.A.),
[1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 92. Consequently, in determining what a fit
sentence is, the sentencing judge should take into account any relevant
aggravating or mitigating circumstances (s. 718.2 (a) of the Criminal
Code ), as well as objective and subjective factors related to the
offender’s personal circumstances.  

[9]                             
As a corollary to sentence individualization,
the parity principle requires that a sentence be similar to those imposed on
similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances (s.
718.2 (b) of the Criminal Code ). In other words, “if the personal
circumstances of the offender are different, different sentences will be
justified” (C. C. Ruby, G. J. Chan and N. R. Hasan, Sentencing (8th ed.
2012), at §2.41). 

[10]                         
Ultimately, the sentence that is imposed must be
consistent with the fundamental purpose of sentencing, which is to contribute
to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe
society. The sentence must have one or more of the objectives of denunciation,
general and specific deterrence, separation of offenders from society if need
be, rehabilitation, reparations to victims for harm done to them, promotion of
a sense of responsibility in offenders and acknowledgment of the harm done to
victims and to the community (s. 718  of the Criminal Code ).

[11]                         
In light of these principles, the collateral
consequences of a sentence are any consequences for the impact of the sentence
on the particular offender. They may be taken into account in sentencing as
personal circumstances of the offender. However, they are not, strictly
speaking, aggravating or mitigating factors, since such factors are by
definition related only to the gravity of the offence or to the degree of
responsibility of the offender (s. 718.2 (a) of the Criminal Code ).
Their relevance flows from the application of the principles of
individualization and parity. The relevance of collateral consequences may also
flow from the sentencing objective of assisting in rehabilitating offenders (s.
718 (d) of the Criminal Code ). Thus, when two possible sentences
are both appropriate as regards the gravity of the offence and the
responsibility of the offenders, the most suitable one may be the one that
better contributes to the offender’s rehabilitation. 

[12]                         
However, the weight to be given to collateral
consequences varies from case to case and should be determined having regard to
the type and seriousness of the offence. Professor Manson explains this as
follows: 

                          As
a result of the commission of an offence, the offender may suffer physical,
emotional, social, or financial consequences. While not punishment in the true
sense of pains or burdens imposed by the state after a finding of guilt, they
are often considered in mitigation. . . .

 

. . .

 

                          The
mitigating effect of indirect consequences must be considered in relation both
to future re-integration and to the nature of the offence. Burdens and
hardships flowing from a conviction are relevant if they make the rehabilitative
path harder to travel. Here, one can include loss of financial or social
support. People lose jobs; families are disrupted; sources of assistance
disappear. Notwithstanding a need for denunciation, indirect consequences which
arise from stigmatization cannot be isolated from the sentencing matrix if they
will have bearing on the offender’s ability to live productively in the
community. The mitigation will depend on weighing these obstacles against
the degree of denunciation appropriate to the offence. [Emphasis added.] 

 

(The
Law of Sentencing (2001), at pp. 136-37)

[13]                         
Therefore, collateral consequences related to
immigration may be relevant in tailoring the sentence, but their significance
depends on and has to be determined in accordance with the facts of the
particular case. 

[14]                         
The general rule continues to be that a sentence
must be fit having regard to the particular crime and the particular offender.
In other words, a sentencing judge may exercise his or her discretion to take
collateral immigration consequences into account, provided that the sentence
that is ultimately imposed is proportionate to the gravity of the offence and
the degree of responsibility of the offender. 

[15]                         
The flexibility of our sentencing process should
not be misused by imposing inappropriate and artificial sentences in order to
avoid collateral consequences which may flow from a statutory scheme or from
other legislation, thus circumventing Parliament’s will. 

[16]                         
These consequences must not be allowed to
dominate the exercise or skew the process either in favour of or against
deportation. Moreover, it must not lead to a separate sentencing scheme with a de
facto if not a de jure special range of sentencing options where
deportation is a risk. 

[17]                         
In R. v. Badhwar, 2011 ONCA 266, 9 M.V.R.
(6th) 163, the offender was convicted of criminal negligence causing death
while street racing and failure to stop at the scene of an accident. He was
sentenced to 30 months (less 5 months for pre-trial custody) on the first count
and 12 months consecutive on the second. On appeal, he did not seek a reduction
of his global sentence of 37 months; rather, he asked the court to adjust his
sentence to 23 months and 19 months consecutive in order to avoid the
collateral consequences of a sentence of 24 months or more, namely the loss of
his immigration appeal rights. I agree with Moldaver J.A. (as he then was),
who, in refusing to grant the adjustment, wrote the following, at paras. 42-45:

In seeking to have his
sentence adjusted, the appellant does not suggest that the trial judge erred in
imposing a penitentiary sentence on the charge of criminal negligence causing
death — nor could he. This court . . . upheld a 30 month sentence for
[the offence of criminal negligence causing death while street racing] in
respect of Mr. Multani (2010), 261 O.A.C. 107 (Ont. C.A.).

 

Significantly,
in Multani’s case, the court refused to give effect to Mr. Multani’s submission
that the sentence of 30 months should be reduced to 23 months for reasons
relating to his immigration status. At para. 3 of the decision, the court noted
that “while the deportation consequences of the sentence may be a proper factor
to consider in determining the appropriate sentence in certain cases,
immigration consequences cannot take a sentence out of the appropriate range.”

 

That
principle applies equally to the appellant. In his case, somewhat ironically,
he seeks to benefit from the fact that he was convicted of two offences and therefore
can seek the adjustments he is requesting without interfering with the overall
length of his sentence — something Mr. Multani could not do given that he was
only convicted of the single offence of criminal negligence causing death.

 

No
matter how one chooses to come at the issue, the bottom line remains the same.
Courts ought not to be imposing inadequate or artificial sentences at all, let
alone for the purpose of circumventing Parliament’s will on matters of
immigration.

[18]                         
 It follows that where a sentence is varied to
avoid collateral consequences, the further the varied sentence is from the
range of otherwise appropriate sentences, the less likely it is that it will
remain proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the responsibility of
the offender. Conversely, the closer the varied sentence is to the range of
otherwise appropriate sentences, the more probable it is that the reduced
sentence will remain proportionate, and thus reasonable and appropriate. 

[19]                         
I adopt the position asserted by Doherty J.A. in
R. v. Hamilton (2004), 72 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), at paras. 156 and 158:

. . . the risk of deportation
cannot justify a sentence which is inconsistent with the fundamental purpose
and the principles of sentencing identified in the Criminal Code . The
sentencing process cannot be used to circumvent the provisions and policies of
the Immigration and Refugee Act. As indicated above, however, there is
seldom only one correct sentencing response. The risk of deportation can be a
factor to be taken into consideration in choosing among the appropriate
sentencing responses and tailoring the sentence to best fit the crime and the
offender . . . . 

 

. . .

 

. .
. If a trial judge were to decide that a sentence at or near two years was the
appropriate sentence in all of the circumstances for [the offender], the trial
judge could look at the deportation consequences for [the offender] of imposing
a sentence of two years less a day as opposed to a sentence of two years. I see
this as an example of the human face of the sentencing process. If the future
prospects of an offender . . . can be assisted or improved by imposing a
sentence of two years less a day rather than two years, it is entirely in
keeping with the principles and objectives of sentencing to impose the shorter
sentence. While the assistance afforded to [the offender] by the imposition of
a sentence of two years less a day rather than two years may be relatively
small, there is no countervailing negative impact on broader societal interests
occasioned by the imposition of that sentence . . . . [Citations omitted.] 

[20]                         
Accordingly, the sentencing judge is not
compelled in all circumstances to adjust a sentence in order to avoid the
impact of collateral immigration consequences on the offender. It remains open to
the judge to conclude that even a minimal reduction, i.e. from two years’
imprisonment to two years less a day, would render the sentence inappropriate
for the particular offence and the particular offender. Collateral immigration
consequences are but one relevant factor amongst many others related to the
nature and the gravity of the offence, the degree of responsibility of the
offender and the offender’s personal circumstances.   

[21]                         
The reasons of Doyon J.A. in R. v. Guzman,
2011 QCCA 136 (CanLII), provide an illustration of this approach to the
treatment of collateral immigration consequences in sentencing. In that case,
the Quebec Court of Appeal was asked to grant a minimal variation of a sentence
to ensure that the sentence would not have adverse consequences for the
offender’s immigration status. Doyon J.A. declined to acquiesce in this
request, stating that, in light of the facts of the case, a reduction of the
sentence, even a modest reduction of one day, would be both unfit and
inconsistent with the principles of sentencing. He held as follows, at paras.
102-3: 

[translation] In summary, the status of
the appellants and the impact of the prison sentences on their right to appeal
to the Immigration Appeal Division are relevant circumstances and must be taken
into consideration. However, given the circumstances in which the offences were
committed, their seriousness, the profile of the appellants, and the objectives
and principles of sentencing set out in the Criminal Code , I am of the
view that the sentences inflicted on the appellants are fit even if they are
not reduced by one day, as the appellants seek.

. the near total lack of factors suggesting a real
possibility of rehabilitation and change of behaviour on the part of the
appellants convinces me that, even if the judges had been aware of all of
the relevant facts, they would not have imposed sentences of less than two
years’ imprisonment solely to allow the appellants to preserve their right
of appeal. [Emphasis added.]

[22]                         
In sum, collateral immigration consequences may
be just as relevant in sentencing as the collateral consequences of other
legislation or of circumstances specific to the offender. 

[23]                         
Where the issue of immigration consequences is
brought to the trial judge’s attention and the trial judge applies the proper
sentencing principles but nonetheless decides on a two-year sentence, then,
absent fresh evidence, deference is owed to that decision. Where this issue has
not been raised before the trial judge and the Crown does not give its consent,
an affidavit or some other type of evidence should then be adduced for
consideration by the Court of Appeal.

[24]                         
An appellate court has the authority to
intervene if the sentencing judge was not aware of the collateral immigration
consequences of the sentence for the offender, or if counsel had failed to
advise the judge on this issue. In such circumstances, the court’s intervention
is justified because the sentencing judge decided on the fitness of the
sentence without considering a relevant factor: M. (C.A.), at para. 90.
As I explained above, however, the aim of such an intervention is to determine
the appropriate sentence in light of the facts of the particular case while
taking all the relevant factors into account. Although there will be cases in which
it is appropriate to reduce the sentence to ensure that it does not have
adverse consequences for the offender’s immigration status, there will be other
cases in which it is not appropriate to do so. 

[25]                         
In the case at bar, the sentencing judge was not
aware of the sentence’s collateral immigration consequences, and the appellate
court accordingly had the authority to intervene. The Crown conceded both in
the Court of Appeal and at the hearing in this Court that a reduced sentence of
two years less a day remains within the range of otherwise fit sentences and
that the imposed sentence of two years’ imprisonment should be reduced by one
day. The Crown also agreed that the reduced sentence is the one that the
sentencing judge would have imposed in the case at bar had he been aware of the
collateral immigration consequences (R.F., at para. 69). It was wrong for the
Court of Appeal to refuse the one-day reduction solely on the basis that the
appellant had a prior criminal record or that it felt that he had “abused the
hospitality that [had] been afforded to him by Canada” (para. 24). It is
therefore appropriate to grant the variation of the sentence sought by the
appellant. 

IV.  Conclusion

[26]                         
  For these reasons,
the Court allowed the appeal at the conclusion of the hearing and reduced the
sentence of imprisonment from two years to two years less a day.

                    Criminal Law — Offences — Conspiracy —
Parties to offences — Whether a person can be a party to the offence of
conspiracy — Whether party liability attaches to someone who knows of
conspiracy and does something for the purpose of furthering unlawful object —
Whether trial judge erred in instructions to jury pertaining to conspiracy —
Whether curative proviso should be applied to uphold conviction — Co‑conspirators’

ss. 21(1) , 465(1) , 686(1) (b)(iii).

                    J,
a youth, learned that his friend T and her sister R were planning to murder
their mother by plying her with alcohol and drowning her, a plan which the
sisters ultimately executed and were convicted for.  The police found an MSN
chat log between J and T in which J provided information to T about death by
drowning; suggested that the sisters should give their mother codeine pills in
addition to alcohol; and suggested ways to mislead the police.  The Crown also
led evidence that J supplied the girls with pills and met T and R after the
murder to provide an alibi.  The trial judge instructed the jury that J could
be convicted of conspiracy to commit murder under s. 465(1)  of the Criminal
Code  either as a principal, or as a party under s. 21(1) (b) or
(c) of the Criminal Code .  J was convicted of conspiracy to
commit murder.  The Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from the conviction but
reduced J’s sentence.

                    Held:  The appeal
should be dismissed.

                    Per McLachlin C.J. and LeBel, Fish,
Rothstein, Cromwell, Moldaver and Karakatsanis JJ.:  Party liability to
conspiracy is an offence known to Canadian law.  Unlike
attempted conspiracy, it does not involve stacking one form of inchoate
liability upon another, and does not suffer from remoteness.

                    There
are two schools of thought in Canada as to how, and under what circumstances, a
person can be found liable as a party to the offence of conspiracy.  The
narrower approach (the Trieu model) limits such liability to aiding or
abetting the formation of the agreement.  The broader approach (the McNamara
model) extends such liability to also include aiding or abetting the
furtherance of the conspiracy’s unlawful object.  The approach to be followed
is Trieu and not McNamara.  Party liability is limited to cases
where the accused aids or abets the initial formation of the agreement, or aids
or abets a new member to join a pre‑existing agreement.

                    The
Trieu model is a legitimate basis for party liability to a conspiracy. 
A person becomes party to an offence if he aids or abets a principal in the commission
of the offence.  It follows that party liability to a conspiracy is made out
where the accused aids or abets the actus reus of conspiracy, namely the
conspirators’ act of agreeing.  

                    The
McNamara model is not a basis for party liability to conspiracy.  Acts
that further the unlawful object of a conspiracy are not an element of the
offence of conspiracy.  Aiding or abetting the furtherance of the unlawful
object does not establish aiding or abetting the principal with any element of
the offence of conspiracy, and thus cannot ground party liability for
conspiracy.  However, where a person, with knowledge of a conspiracy, does or
omits to do something for the purpose of furthering the unlawful object, with
the knowledge and consent of one or more of the existing conspirators, this
provides powerful circumstantial evidence from which membership in the conspiracy
can be inferred.

                    While
party liability to conspiracy includes aiding or abetting the formation of a
new agreement (the Trieu model), it also includes aiding or abetting a
new member to join a pre‑existing agreement.  Such assistance or
encouragement facilitates the new member’s commission of the offence of
conspiracy — that is, the act of agreeing.

                    In
light of the conclusion that party liability does not extend to acts done in
furtherance of the unlawful object of the conspiracy, party liability should
not, in the present case, have been put to the jury.  There is no evidence that
J aided or abetted the initial formation of the agreement between R and T to
murder their mother or aided or encouraged a new member to join the existing
conspiracy.  The trial judge’s error, however, could not possibly have affected
the verdict.  The curative proviso under s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code  applies.  The evidence implicating J as a member of the conspiracy was
overwhelming and, once the jury rejected J’s defence, a finding of guilt under s. 465(1) 
of the Criminal Code  was inevitable.  

                    Finally,
the two grounds of appeal relating to evidence admitted under the co‑conspirators’
exception to the hearsay rule are dismissed.

                    The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

[1]                             
Moldaver J. — In this appeal, the Court is required to
decide whether the aiding and abetting provisions in the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , are applicable to the offence of conspiracy and, if so,
how and under what circumstances.  Appellate courts are divided on these
questions, and the case at hand provides an opportunity to resolve the
conflicting approaches.

I.       Background

[2]                             
The appellant was convicted of conspiracy to
commit murder following a trial before Van Melle J. of the Ontario Superior
Court of Justice and a jury.  He was tried as a youth and received a sentence
of 12 months’ imprisonment and 6 months’ conditional supervision in the
community.

[3]                             
The appellant appealed to the Ontario Court of
Appeal against both conviction and sentence.  His appeal from conviction was
dismissed; his appeal from sentence was allowed and the sentence was reduced to
8 months in custody and 4 months’ conditional supervision.

[4]                             
The appellant appeals his conviction to this
Court with leave.  As I have said, the primary issue is whether a person can be
found liable as a party to the offence of conspiracy and, if so, under what
circumstances.  

[5]                             
The charge of conspiracy to commit murder, for
which the appellant stands convicted, revolves around the killing of A.K. by
her two daughters R and T.  The evidence at the appellant’s trial established
that R and T conspired to kill their mother and eventually carried out their
plan.  R and T were tried as youths and both were convicted of first degree
murder.

A.     The Case Against the Appellant

[6]                             
The theory of the Crown against the appellant
was that he and T were friends and that he learned from T that she and R were
planning to kill their mother.  It was their intention to ply her with alcohol,
drown her in the family bathtub, and make it look like an accident.

[7]                             
According to the Crown, the appellant took
various steps to help R and T achieve their plan.  An MSN chat log, discovered
by the police on a computer belonging to R and T, contained a revealing
conversation between the appellant and T a few days before the killing.  In
that conversation, the appellant provided information to T about death by
drowning and explained what R and T should do if their mother woke up during
the drowning process.  He further suggested that in addition to plying their
mother with alcohol, R and T should give her about five Tylenol 3 pills as this
would “knock [her] right out” (A.R., at p. 198).  Autopsy results revealed
codeine in A.K.’s blood at 3.5 times the upper therapeutic level — a level
consistent with the consumption of four to six Tylenol 3 tablets.  The Crown
advanced evidence that it was the appellant who supplied R and T with Tylenol 3
tablets shortly before the killing.

[8]                             
In the same conversation, the appellant promised
to provide R and T with an alibi for the time of the murder and he proposed a
plan that he described as “irrefutable”.  R and T did not take up the
appellant’s suggestion, choosing instead to follow a plan of their own which
involved meeting the appellant and another friend at a specified restaurant a
short time after the killing.  Evidence presented by the Crown showed that the
appellant agreed to that suggestion and attended the restaurant as planned.

[9]                             
Finally, in the same chat with T, the appellant
offered to be present with R and T when the police arrived and he suggested
ways in which R and T should behave to mislead the police.  At one point in his
conversation with T, the appellant made the following telling admission:  “I’m
involved this much, I’m willing to help you out with any of it [T]” (A.R., at
p. 197).

[10]                         
In a statement made to the police following his
arrest, the appellant did not deny that he was the one communicating with T in
the MSN chats; rather, he maintained that he was not being serious and did not
expect that his comments would be taken seriously (R.F., at para. 20).

B.     The Crown’s Closing Address and the Trial Judge’s Instructions
to the Jury

[11]                         
Crown counsel in her closing address invited the
jury to find the appellant guilty on one of two bases: either as a principal
in the conspiracy, or as a party to the conspiracy under s. 21(1) (b)
or (c).  In other words, the Crown argued that either the appellant had
become a member of the conspiracy between R and T or, in the alternative, he
had become an aider or abettor of the conspiracy.

[12]                         
The trial judge acceded to the Crown’s request
that the jury be instructed on both bases of liability.  The relevant portions
of the charge on party liability are reproduced in full below:

A
person also commits an offence if he does anything for the purpose of helping
another person to commit the offence.

 

Anyone
who actively assists or encourages somebody else to commit an offence is as
guilty of the offence as the person who actually commits it.  I remind you
though that mere knowledge of, discussion, or passive acquiescence in a plan of
criminal conduct is not of itself sufficient.

 

. . .

 

It
is the position of the Crown that [the appellant] can be convicted of
conspiracy as either a full partner like [T] and [R] or if he was a party to
the conspiracy.  He is a party to the conspiracy by aiding, which means
assisting, or abetting, which means encouraging [T] and [R] in their plan to
murder — in the plan to murder [the deceased].

 

Some
of you might think that [the appellant] was a main partner of the plan that he
agreed to murder [the deceased].  Others might agree at the end of the day that
he was only a party to the conspiracy in that he assisted or encouraged the
girls in their murder plot.  The Crown’s position is that [the appellant] was
involved in this conspiracy because he provided at least one of the following:

 

•   Advice about the drowning process and how to act when
interacting with the police.

 

•   Help with details of the plan including combining alcohol and
Tylenol 3’s and what to do if she woke up part way through.

 

•   An agreement to assist with the alibi and attended at Jack
Astor’s the night of the murder.

 

•   Or Tylenol 3’s to facilitate her death.  [A.R., at pp. 61 and 69-70]

C.     Appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal, 2011 ONCA 220, 15
O.R. (3d) 161

[13]                         
On his appeal from conviction to the Ontario
Court of Appeal, the appellant raised several grounds, one being that the jury
should not have been instructed on party liability.  Rosenberg J.A., on behalf
of a unanimous court, disagreed.  In his view, on the facts of the case, the
appellant could be convicted as a party to the offence of conspiracy to commit
murder “if he aided or abetted the sisters within the meaning of s. 21(1)  [of
the Criminal Code ] to pursue their unlawful object” (para. 27
(emphasis added)).

[14]                         
Having concluded that party liability was
available, Rosenberg J.A. reviewed the instructions on party liability and
found them to be deficient.  In his view, they “were generic, divorced from the
facts of the case and failed to make clear that the jury had to find that the
appellant knew the object of the conspiracy and that his assistance was
intended to assist [R and T] in pursuing the unlawful object of murdering their
mother” (para. 29).

[15]                         
Despite this deficiency, Rosenberg J.A. was
satisfied that the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Code could
safely be applied to uphold the conviction.  In this regard, he observed that
the defence put forward by the appellant — his comments in the MSN chats
to T were not to be taken seriously — “did not depend on whether the
appellant was a principal in, or a party to, the conspiracy”.  If the jury
accepted his position or it raised a reasonable doubt, he would be acquitted. 
On the other hand, if the jury rejected his position, “a finding of guilt was inevitable”. 
Rosenberg J.A. further noted that the appellant’s MSN chats with T constituted
“direct evidence, in his own words, of the appellant’s role in the
conspiracy”.  It followed, in his view, that the “[appellant’s] liability as a
party or a member of the conspiracy was overwhelming” (para. 74).

[16]                         
Against that backdrop, I turn to what I believe
are the two main issues in this appeal, namely:  Can a person be a party to the
offence of conspiracy as a matter of law and, if so, how and
under what circumstances?  For the reasons that follow, I am satisfied that a
person can be a party to the offence of conspiracy as a matter of law under s.
21 of the Code.  

[17]                         
The more perplexing issue — and the one that in
my view forms the centerpiece of this appeal — is how and under what
circumstances.  The answer to that question hinges on how one conceptualizes
the offence of conspiracy for purposes of party liability.  Accepting that the
prohibited act in a conspiracy (the actus reus) consists of an agreement
by two or more persons to pursue an unlawful object, specifically a criminal
offence (R. v. O’Brien, [1954] S.C.R. 666), the question that arises is
this:  Should party liability be restricted to those who aid or abet the
agreement that forms the basis of the conspiracy, or does party liability
extend as well to those who aid or abet the furthering of the unlawful object
of the conspiracy?

[18]                         
Canadian jurisprudence on the subject is
divided.  Alberta and Quebec have adopted the narrower approach, restricting
party liability to those who aid or abet the agreement itself, with a
particular focus on its formation.  See R. v. Trieu, 2008 ABCA 143, 429
A.R. 200, and R. v. Bérubé (1999), 139 C.C.C. (3d) 304
(Que. C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [2000] 1 S.C.R. vii.  Ontario and British
Columbia have adopted the broader approach, expanding party liability to also
include those who aid or abet the furthering of the unlawful object.  See R.
v. McNamara (No. 1) (1981), 56 C.C.C. (2d) 193 (Ont. C.A.); R. v.
Vucetic (1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 178 (Ont. C.A.); and United States of
America v. Lorenz (2007), 222 C.C.C. (3d) 16 (B.C.C.A.), leave to appeal
refused, [2008] 1 S.C.R. vi (sub nom. Cheema v. Attorney
General of Canada on behalf of the United States of America).

[19]                         
The case at hand provides this Court with an opportunity to
resolve the conflicting viewpoints.  The first order of business, however, is
to address the seminal question raised by the appellant, namely:  Can a person
be a party to the offence of conspiracy as a matter of law?  

III.    Analysis

A.     Can a Person Be a Party to the Offence of Conspiracy as a
Matter of Law?

[20]                         
Section 465  of the Criminal Code 
criminalizes the offence of conspiracy.  Conspiracy to commit murder, the crime
at issue here, is a free-standing offence under s. 465(1)(a) of the Code,
which reads as follows:

465. (1) Except
where otherwise expressly provided by law, the following provisions apply in
respect of conspiracy:

 

(a) every
one who conspires with any one to commit murder or to cause another person to
be murdered, whether in Canada or not, is guilty of an indictable offence and
liable to a maximum term of imprisonment for life;

[21]                         
Like all conspiracies, conspiracy to commit
murder is a form of inchoate liability.  The crime is complete when two or more
persons agree to kill a third party.  No one need be killed; nor is it
necessary that any steps be taken to bring about the murder.

[22]                         
Section 21(1) of the Code sets out three
ways in which someone can be found liable as “a party to an offence”.

                           21. (1) Every one is a party to an offence who

 

                           (a) actually commits it;

 

                           (b) does or omits to do
anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it; or

 

                           (c) abets any person in
committing it.

[23]                         
Nothing in the language of s. 21 suggests that
party liability does not apply to offences that punish inchoate behaviour. The
appellant’s real complaint, as I understand it, is that party liability ought
not to apply to the offence of conspiracy because being a party to a conspiracy
“is an offence unknown to the law” (A.F., at para. 41).  It suffers from the
same problem of remoteness that led this Court in R. v. Déry, 2006 SCC
53, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 669, to conclude that “attempted conspiracy” is not an
offence known to law.  As Fish J. explained, the separate rationales
underlining the offences of “conspiracy” and “attempt” lose their justification
when these two forms of inchoate liability are stacked upon one another:  

                    When
applied to conspiracy, the justification for criminalizing attempt is lost,
since an attempt to conspire amounts, at best, to a risk that a risk will
materialize.  [para. 50]

[24]                         
Much as the appellant seeks to apply the logic
of Déry to party liability where the
offence in issue is conspiracy, I am respectfully of the view that the
comparison is inapt — no less so than comparing apples with oranges.  Quite
simply, unlike the crime of attempt, party liability is not inchoate.  In order
for the Crown to rely on party liability, the underlying offence must have been
committed by the principal.  Consequently, being a party to a conspiracy does
not involve stacking one form of inchoate liability upon another.

[25]                         
The appellant raised this argument before the
Court of Appeal.  Rosenberg J.A. rejected it for the following reasons, with
which I agree:

                           In
my view, the holding in Déry does not warrant reconsideration of this
court’s decisions in McNamara and Vucetic.  Party liability for
conspiracy does not suffer from the problem of remoteness identified in Déry
with respect to attempt to conspire.  A person can be liable as a s. 21(1) 
party to conspiracy only if the Crown proves an agreement by at least two
other people to commit a substantive offence.  If no agreement materialized,
the alleged party’s conduct would be at most an attempt to conspire and would
fail on the holding in Déry.  If, however, the accused is a party to
the conspiracy, . . . the risk of commission of the criminal offence has
sufficiently materialized to warrant criminal sanction.  [Emphasis added; para.
20.]

[26]                         
I would accordingly not give effect to this
aspect of the appellant’s argument.  In short, I am satisfied that being a
party to a conspiracy is an offence known to law.  The more difficult question,
to which I now turn, is how and under what circumstances a person can be found
liable as a party to a conspiracy.

B.     How and Under What Circumstances Can a Person Be Found
Liable as a Party to the Offence of Conspiracy?

                    (1)      The Two Approaches in Canadian
Jurisprudence

[27]                         
As mentioned, there are two schools of thought
in Canada as to how, and under what circumstances, a person can be found liable
as a party to the offence of conspiracy — the narrower view and the broader
view.  

[28]                         
The leading authority in support of the narrower
view is Trieu.  The facts are straightforward.  Trieu operated a
small business selling cellular phones.  He sold phones to five people who were
involved in a conspiracy to traffic in cocaine.  Trieu knew that the
conspirators were engaged in drug trafficking, that they worked as a group, and
that they would use the phones in their trafficking operation.  He claimed,
however, that he was not a member of the conspiracy and denied agreeing with
any of the conspirators to traffic in cocaine. 

[29]                         
The trial judge acquitted Trieu (R. v. Lam,
2005 ABQB 849 (CanLII)).  In his view, the evidence fell short of establishing
that Trieu was a member of the conspiracy.  He also rejected the Crown’s
alternate theory that in selling cellular phones to the conspirators, Trieu
intentionally assisted the conspirators in attaining their object — trafficking
in cocaine — and as such, he should be found liable as a party to the offence
of conspiracy. 

[30]                         
Recognizing that there were two lines of
authority on the subject, the trial judge adopted the narrower approach.  In
his view, party liability for the offence of conspiracy did not extend to those
who took steps to further the unlawful object of the conspiracy; rather, it was
restricted to those who aided in the formation of the agreement that had a
particular unlawful object as its goal.  And since there was no evidence that
Trieu aided in the formation of the agreement hatched by the conspirators, he
could not be found liable as a party to the offence of conspiracy.

[31]                         
The Crown appealed Trieu’s acquittal to the
Alberta Court of Appeal, claiming that the trial judge erred in taking the
narrower approach to party liability.  The Court of Appeal disagreed.

[32]                         
On behalf of the court, Costigan J.A. commenced
his analysis by reviewing some of the basic principles applicable to the law of
conspiracy and party liability.  Citing this Court’s decisions in Papalia v.
The Queen, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 256, and Sheppe v. The Queen, [1980] 2
S.C.R. 22, he noted that the essence of the offence of conspiracy is the
agreement, and acts done in furtherance of the unlawful object are not an
element of the offence.  He cited R. v. Hibbert, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 973,
for the proposition that “[t]o be a party to an offence, a person must aid the
principal in the commission of that offence” (para. 32).

[33]                         
Having identified the basic principles that
apply to the law of conspiracy and parties, Costigan J.A. turned to the facts
of Trieu and commented as follows:

It follows from these principles that for Trieu to be a party to the
offence of conspiracy to traffic in cocaine, the Crown had to prove that Trieu
performed acts for the purpose of aiding the formation of an agreement
to traffic in cocaine.  Acts performed after the agreement was formed did not
aid in the commission of the offence of conspiracy on the facts of this case. 
Therefore, Trieu could not be a party to the offence of conspiracy for
facilitating the conspirators in attaining their object of trafficking in
cocaine.  Although acts performed after the agreement was reached could have
aided in the commission of the offence of trafficking, Trieu was not charged
with the offence of trafficking.  [Emphasis added; para. 33.]

 

[34]                         
Trieu was brought
to the attention of the Court of Appeal in the present case.  Rosenberg J.A.
considered the reasoning underlying the narrower approach endorsed by Trieu
but refused to follow it, choosing instead the more expansive approach adopted
by the Ontario Court of Appeal in McNamara and Vucetic.

[35]                         
At issue in McNamara was whether two
individuals and a company were liable as co-conspirators for joining an ongoing
bid-rigging scheme operated by a number of pre-existing conspirators.  One of
the issues before the Court of Appeal was whether the two individuals and the
company could be found liable as parties to the offence of conspiracy.  The
court answered that question in the affirmative:

On the other
hand, if, at any time before the object of the conspiracy had been attained,
that is, the receipt of the contract money from the Crown, [the individuals and
the company] abetted or encouraged any of the conspirators to pursue its
object, they would become parties to the criminal offence of conspiracy by
virtue of s. 21 of the Code.  [Emphasis added; p. 454.]

[36]                         
In Vucetic, the Ontario Court of Appeal
re-affirmed the expansive approach to party liability endorsed in McNamara:

However, in
order to find him guilty as an aider and abettor, the jury would have to be
instructed that the appellant knew the object of the conspiracy and that his
assistance was intended to assist the conspirators in attaining their
unlawful criminal object.  [Emphasis added; para. 7.]

[37]                         
In choosing to follow McNamara and Vucetic,
Rosenberg J.A. made the following observations in his reasons:

Again,
I can see no basis in principle for refusing to follow McNamara and Vucetic
on this issue.  I appreciate the point made in Trieu that the essence of
a conspiracy is an agreement, but it is not an agreement in the abstract; it is
an agreement to attain a common goal, a particular unlawful object. . . . 

 

Admittedly,
including party liability for aiding or abetting pursuit of the unlawful object
blurs the line between the conspiracy and the substantive offence.  The
distinction, however, is that party liability for conspiracy requires proof of
an agreement; there is no requirement of proof that the unlawful object was
attained.  Liability as a party to the substantive offence requires proof that
the substantive offence was committed.  Thus, in this case, the appellant could
be guilty of conspiracy if he aided or abetted the sisters within the meaning of
s. 21(1)  to pursue their unlawful object, even if they ultimately did not carry
out the plan or the deceased had survived the attempt on her life.  [paras. 26
and 27]

[38]                         
To sum up, the cases illustrate two strands of
authority.  The first, favoured in Trieu, is narrower, grounding party
liability on aiding or abetting the agreement itself, specifically its
formation.  The second, as endorsed in McNamara, is broader, including
within the ambit of party liability aiding or abetting the furtherance of the
conspiracy’s unlawful object.  The question remains which of these two
approaches should be adopted.

(2)        The
Approach to Be Followed

[39]                         
The scope of party liability for conspiracy
turns on a proper understanding of the elements of the offence of conspiracy. 
That is because, to be a party to an offence, a person must aid or abet the
principals “in the commission of the offence”: R. v. Briscoe, 2010 SCC
13, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 411, at para. 16.  With respect to the offence of
conspiracy, this Court in Papalia held that “[t]he actus reus is
the fact of agreement” (p. 276).  Aiding or abetting the formation of an
agreement between conspirators (as contemplated in Trieu) amounts to
aiding or abetting the principals in the commission of the conspiracy, and
should therefore lead to party liability for conspiracy.

[40]                         
Earlier in these reasons, I explained why, as a
matter of law, a person can be found liable as a party to the offence of
conspiracy.  Once that is accepted, I see no reason in principle or policy why
the limited form of party liability contemplated in Trieu should not be
criminalized.[1] 
The parties and the intervener have submitted no authorities or academic
writings to the contrary — and I know of none.  Nor do those who advocate the
more expansive approach to party liability sanctioned by McNamara
question the Trieu model as a basis upon which party liability
for the offence of conspiracy may be grounded.  Indeed, in the present case,
Rosenberg J.A. recognized it as such.

[41]                         
It follows, in my view, that the Trieu
model represents a legitimate basis upon which party liability for the offence
of conspiracy may be found.  I hasten to add that a review of the jurisprudence
in Canada and elsewhere reveals that there are few reported cases where the
facts have come within the Trieu paradigm.  Trieu itself was not
such a case.  And the only authority that has come to my attention is People
v. Strauch, 240 Ill. 60 (1909).  In that case, a father introduced his son
to another person with the intention that they enter into a conspiracy, which
they did.  The father was convicted as a party to the conspiracy for aiding and
abetting its formation.

[42]                         
That brings me to the broader approach endorsed
in McNamara and the central issue in this appeal — namely, whether party
liability can attach to someone who knows of a conspiracy and who does (or
omits to do) something for the purpose of furthering its unlawful object.

[43]                         
With respect to those who hold a different view,
I have concluded that it should not.  Party liability should be restricted to
conduct that aids or abets the formation of the agreement that comprises
the essence of the crime of conspiracy.  In all other cases, a conviction for
conspiracy will not lie absent proof of membership in the conspiracy.  

[44]                         
As I have explained, agreement is a central
element to the offence of conspiracy.  Conversely, an act done in furtherance
of the unlawful object is not an element of the offence of conspiracy. 
Although such acts can serve as circumstantial evidence to support the
existence of a conspiracy, they are not themselves a component of the actus
reus of conspiracy.  Indeed, a conspiracy can be established in the absence
of any overt acts done in furtherance of its unlawful object. In other words,
“[t]he crime of conspiracy is complete once the agreement is reached”: Trieu,
at para. 31.

[45]                         
It follows, in my view, that the broader
approach as endorsed in McNamara must be rejected.  Aiding or abetting
the furtherance of the unlawful object does not establish aiding or abetting
the principal with any element of the offence of conspiracy.  It cannot ground
party liability for conspiracy.

[46]                         
The conclusion I have reached is consistent with
the following observation from a Harvard Law Review article, with which
I agree:

But to aid and abet a crime it
is necessary not merely to help the criminal, but to help him in the commission
of the particular criminal offense.  A person does not aid and abet a
conspiracy by helping the “conspiracy” to commit a substantive offense, for the
crime of conspiracy is separate from the offense which is its object.  It is
necessary to help the “conspiracy” in the commission of the crime of
conspiracy, that is, in the commission of the act of agreement.  Only
then is it justifiable to dispense with the necessity of proving commission of
the act of agreement by the defendant himself.  In all other cases, to convict
the defendant of conspiracy it is necessary to prove not only knowledge on his
part that he was helping in a wrongful enterprise, but also knowledge on
another’s part that he intended to do so, and at least a tacit agreement to
give and accept such help. [Emphasis added; footnotes omitted.]

 

(“Developments
in the Law: Criminal Conspiracy” (1959), 72 Harv. L. Rev. 920, at pp.
934-35)  

[47]                         
In an article entitled “Conspiracies and
Attempts”, in National Criminal Law Program, Substantive Criminal Law (1990),
vol. 1, D. Doherty (then judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario), expressed the
same view:

The aiding
and abetting provisions [s. 21(1)(b) and (c) of the Code]
should apply to conspiracy charges.  They must, however, be applied with
caution.  Those sections require that the assistance be rendered for the
purpose of assisting the commission of the crime.  In the context of a
conspiracy charge, the alleged acts of assistance or encouragement should have
to be done for the purpose of aiding or assisting the act of agreeing. 
Conduct which aids or assists in the achievement of the object of the
conspiracy should not be equated with assistance in the making of the
conspiracy.  [Emphasis added; p. 36.]

(See also M. Manning and
P. Sankoff, Manning, Mewett & Sankoff:  Criminal Law (4th ed.
2009), at p. 316.)

[48]                         
Those who prefer the McNamara approach
fear that persons who have not become members of the conspiracy, but who have
nonetheless done things to further the conspiracy’s unlawful object, will,
despite their moral culpability, slip through the cracks — that is, unless the
unlawful object of the conspiracy is attained or attempted, in which case they
could be charged as parties to the substantive offence or to an attempt to
commit that offence.

[49]                         
Thus, in the case at hand, the fear is that, had
R and T not killed their mother or attempted to do so, the appellant would have
ended up going free, despite his efforts to further the planned killing, unless
the Crown could prove that he entered into the agreement formulated by R and T
and thus became a member of the conspiracy.

[50]                         
Much as I appreciate the concern raised by those
who prefer the more expansive McNamara approach, viewed realistically, I
consider it to be more imaginary than real.  

[51]                         
In R. v. Alexander (2005), 206 C.C.C.
(3d) 233 (Ont. C.A.), a case involving various charges, including conspiracy to
extort, Doherty J.A. stated the following:

The appellants’ submissions stand on firm legal footing.  The actus
reus of the crime of conspiracy lies in the formation of an agreement,
tacit or express, between two or more individuals, to act together in pursuit
of a mutual criminal objective.  Co-conspirators share a common goal borne out
of a meeting of the minds whereby each agrees to act together with the other to
achieve a common goal.

 

It follows from the mutuality of objective requirement of the actus
reus that a conspiracy is not established merely by proof of knowledge of
the existence of a scheme to commit a crime or by the doing of acts in
furtherance of that scheme.  Neither knowledge of nor participation in a
criminal scheme can be equated with the actus reus of a conspiracy:  see
R. v. Lamontagne (1999), 142 C.C.C. (3d) 561 (Que. C.A.), at 575-76; R.
v. Cotroni, supra, at pp. 17-8.  Knowledge and acts in furtherance
of a criminal scheme do, however, provide evidence, particularly where they
co-exist, from which the existence of an agreement may be inferred. 
[Emphasis added; citations omitted; paras. 46-47.]

I agree with the
emphasized comment, but would state it slightly differently and in somewhat
more emphatic terms.

[52]                         
In my view, where a person, with knowledge of a
conspiracy (which by definition includes knowledge of the unlawful object
sought to be attained), does (or omits to do) something for the purpose of
furthering the unlawful object, with the knowledge and consent of one or more
of the existing conspirators, this provides powerful circumstantial evidence
from which membership in the conspiracy can be inferred.  To be precise, it
would be evidence of an agreement, whether tacit or express, that the unlawful
object should be achieved.  Ultimately, that issue is one for the trier of
fact, who must decide whether any inference other than agreement can reasonably
be drawn on the evidence.  But, as I will explain, the case at hand illustrates
how a constellation of such facts can make a finding of membership a virtual
certainty.

[53]                         
In so concluding, I note that conspiracies are
often proved by way of circumstantial evidence.  Direct evidence of an
agreement tends to be a rarity.  However, it is commonplace that membership in
a conspiracy may be inferred from evidence of conduct that assists the unlawful
object.  Justice Rinfret made this basic point in Paradis v. The King,
[1934] S.C.R. 165, some eight decades ago:

Conspiracy, like all other crimes, may
be established by inference from the conduct of the parties. No doubt the
agreement between them is the gist of the offence, but only in very rare cases
will it be possible to prove it by direct evidence.  [p. 168]

[54]                         
Furthermore, it is not necessary that all
members of a conspiracy play, or intend to play, equal roles in the ultimate
commission of the unlawful object.  Indeed, members in a conspiracy need not
personally commit, or intend to commit, the offence which each has agreed
should be committed: R. v. Genser (1986), 39 Man. R. (2d) 203 (C.A.),
aff’d [1987] 2 S.C.R. 685.[2] 
Any degree of assistance in the furtherance of the unlawful object can lead to
a finding of membership as long as agreement to a common plan can be inferred
and the requisite mental state has been established.

[55]                         
I do not gainsay the possibility that someone,
with knowledge of an ongoing conspiracy, could do something for the purpose of
furthering the unlawful object without the knowledge or consent of the existing
conspirators.  An example would be where A and B conspire to kill C.  D learns of the conspiracy and
wishes to facilitate the murder.  Unbeknownst to A or B, D prevents
a warning message from reaching the intended victim, C: W. R. LaFave, Substantive
Criminal Law (2nd ed. 2003), vol. 2, at p. 270.  In
such circumstances, an agreement, tacit or otherwise, between the person
providing the assistance (D) and the existing conspirators (A and B)
would be a fiction as neither A nor B was aware of, or agreed to, D’s efforts.

[56]                         
That situation does not arise here, and I leave
for another day whether a person providing “clandestine” assistance in
furtherance of the unlawful object of an ongoing conspiracy could be found
liable of any crime if the conspirators did not commit or attempt to commit the
substantive crime that formed the object of the conspiracy and if his own
efforts did not rise to the level of an attempt at the substantive offence.  

(3)        Aiding
or Abetting a Pre-Existing Agreement

[57]                         
Beyond the debate between the narrower and
broader approaches, a question arises as to whether, within the narrower
approach, the Trieu model should be limited only to those who aid in the
formation of a new agreement to pursue an unlawful object or whether its
reach should extend to those who aid or abet a pre-existing agreement.  

[58]                         
In support of its position that the latter approach
should be followed, the Crown relied in part on this Court’s recent decision in
R. v. Vu, 2012 SCC 40, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 411.  In particular, the Crown
maintained that because conspiracy has been identified as a continuing offence
(Bell v. The Queen, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 471, at p. 488), party liability can
attach to anyone who aids or abets the agreement at any point during the life
of the conspiracy.

[59]                         
In Trieu, Costigan J.A. opined that
because conspiracy is an ongoing crime, party liability can arise after the
initial agreement is formed if, for example, a person aids in the addition of a
new member to join an existing conspiracy (para. 34).  Justice Doherty also
took the position that party liability attaches to someone who encourages or
assists others to join an existing agreement: “Conspiracies and Attempts”, in
National Criminal Law Program, Substantive Criminal Law (1990), vol. 1,
at p. 37.  These authorities observe, and I agree, that aiding or encouraging
someone to become a member of a pre-existing conspiracy facilitates that new
member’s commission of the offence of conspiracy — that is, the act of
agreement.  To be consistent in principle, party liability should thus extend
to assistance or encouragement that results in the addition of a new member to
a pre-existing conspiracy.

[60]                         
In this case, the Crown argued that the
appellant could become a party to the conspiracy by encouraging the sisters to
continue their conspiracy when there were signs that they might abandon it
(R.F., at para. 34).  As well, at least one American author has suggested that
a person might be found liable as a party to the offence of conspiracy “by
facilitating the continuance of the conspiracy as by ‘providing the group with
a hideout so that it does not have to disband’” (C. R. Williams, “Complicity in
a Conspiracy as an Approach to Conspiratorial Liability” (1968), 16 U.C.L.A.
L. Rev. 155, at p. 162, citing “Developments in the Law: Criminal
Conspiracy”, at pp. 934-35).  The same author suggests that “encouraging one or
more persons to follow through with already formulated conspiratorial plans”
might also attract party liability (p. 162).

[61]                         
I would not give effect to the Crown’s
argument.  As a preliminary matter, the argument goes beyond the limited
situation endorsed by Costigan J.A. in Trieu and by Doherty J. in his
article.  And as to the substance of the Crown’s point, though I acknowledge
that these acts can be viewed as aiding or abetting the agreement itself, such
behaviour is equally if not more consistently characterized as aiding or
abetting the furtherance of the unlawful object, and thus captured by the McNamara
model.  As I explained earlier, the McNamara model should not lead to
party liability for conspiracy.  The Crown should thus not be able to achieve
through the back door what principle has denied from the front.

[62]                         
  In my view, the Crown’s argument in favour of
criminalizing aiding or abetting a pre-existing agreement (short of adding a
new member to the agreement) is a solution in search of a problem.  As I have
explained, these acts, which aid or abet the furtherance of the unlawful
object, provide circumstantial evidence from which membership can be inferred. 
In cases where the circumstantial evidence falls short of establishing
membership, there are other charges open to the prosecution.  In some
instances, the Crown will be able to rely on party liability to charge the
substantive offence that forms the object of the conspiracy, or an attempt to
commit that offence; in other instances, the offence of counselling the
substantive offence may apply.

[63]                         
To sum up, party liability to a conspiracy is
limited to cases where the accused encourages or assists in the initial
formation of the agreement, or when he encourages or assists new members to
join a pre-existing agreement. 

C.     Application to this Case

[64]                         
In light of my conclusion that party liability
does not extend to acts done in furtherance of the unlawful object of the
conspiracy, I agree with the appellant that party liability should not, in the
circumstances, have been left to the jury.  There is no evidence that the
appellant aided or abetted the formation of the agreement to murder A.K. or
aided or encouraged a new member to join the existing conspiracy.  That said,
like the Court of Appeal, I am satisfied that the error, though significant,
could not possibly have affected the verdict.  

[65]                         
The evidence implicating the appellant as a
member of the conspiracy was overwhelming.  The Crown presented a powerful body
of evidence from which the jury could find that the appellant, with knowledge
of the conspiracy between R and T, provided advice and offered assistance to
them, with their knowledge and consent, for the purpose of facilitating the
killing of their mother.  As he said in his MSN conversation with T, shortly
before the murder occurred, “I’m involved this much, I’m willing to help you
out with any of it [T]” (A.R., at p. 197).  That, along with other evidence
which implicated the appellant in providing the Tylenol 3 pills and attending a
restaurant after the killing to provide R and T with an alibi, provided the
jury with all the evidence it needed to find an agreement between the appellant
and R and T that the murder should be carried out.  Nothing more was needed to
establish the appellant’s membership in the conspiracy.  It is immaterial that
the appellant, unlike R and T, took no part in the actual killing of A.K.  Once
the jury rejected his explanation that he was not being serious, as it must
have, a finding of guilt on the basis of membership was inevitable.

[66]                         
I should point out that in the circumstances,
the decision on the part of the Crown to charge the appellant with conspiracy
to commit murder very much softened the blow that could otherwise have befallen
him.  The assistance he provided to R and T in facilitating the murder, which
they eventually committed, could well have led to a charge of first degree
murder against him.

[67]                         
Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal from
conviction.  I do so mindful of two alternate grounds of appeal raised by the
appellant.  

[68]                         
First, the appellant submits that evidence
admitted under the co-conspirators’ exception to the hearsay rule did not
satisfy the principled approach to hearsay.  Specifically, he complains that
statements made by T should not have been admitted for their truth because T
was available as a witness and could have been called by the Crown.  I would
not give effect to this submission.  Defence counsel at trial did not raise
this issue with the trial judge.  Had he done so, the Crown may have chosen to
call T as a witness.  In the circumstances, defence counsel’s decision not to
raise the matter could well have been a tactical choice — and as no issue is
taken with the competence of trial counsel, I see no need to address this
ground further.

[69]                         
Second, the appellant says that the trial judge
failed to instruct the jury that the co-conspirators’ exception applied only to
membership and not to party liability.  Once again, defence counsel at trial
did not raise this issue with the trial judge.  Moreover, the instructions
given by the trial judge on the co-conspirators’ exception referred to use of
that evidence only to prove membership.  There was no suggestion that the
evidence could be used to prove party liability.  That being so, I would not
give effect to this ground.

[70]                         
 Furthermore, in light of my conclusion that the
facts of this appeal do not give rise to party liability for the offence of
conspiracy, this is not an appropriate case to determine how, if at all, the
framework for the co-conspirators’ exception established by R. v. Carter,
[1982] 1 S.C.R. 938, might apply in the case of a party to a conspiracy.

[71]                         
As a final matter, I note that there are
conflicting appellate decisions on the applicability of the co-conspirators’
exception where conspirators are tried separately:  R. v. Naicker, 2007
BCCA 608, 229 C.C.C. (3d) 187, leave to appeal refused, [2008] 1 S.C.R. xi; R.
v. Simpson, 2007 ONCA 793, 230 C.C.C. (3d) 542, leave to appeal refused,
[2008] 2 S.C.R. xi.  This issue, however, was not raised before us or in the
courts below.  Accordingly, I see no need to consider it.

IV.    Conclusion

[72]                         
The aiding and abetting of a conspiracy is an
offence known to Canadian law.  The offence is made out where the accused aids
or abets the actus reus of conspiracy, namely the act of agreeing. 
It follows that the approach adopted in Trieu is the only basis upon
which party liability for the offence of conspiracy may be found.  The McNamara
approach is rejected.

[73]                         
I caution, however, that the behaviour captured
by McNamara may well support a charge of conspiracy.  As indicated,
where a person with knowledge of a conspiracy does (or omits to do) something
for the purpose of furthering the unlawful object, with the knowledge and
consent of one or more of the existing conspirators, this provides powerful
circumstantial evidence of his membership in the conspiracy.

[74]                         
The approach I have adopted brings a measure of
simplicity and clarity to the law.  Party liability to a conspiracy is limited
to cases where the accused encourages or assists in the initial formation of
the agreement, or where he encourages or assists new members to join a
pre-existing agreement.  

[75]                         
For the reasons above, I would dismiss the
appeal from conviction.

V.     Appeal from Sentence

[76]                         
Before this Court, the appellant also sought to
appeal his sentence, even though he did not apply for or receive leave to do
so.  I see no basis for granting leave to appeal from sentence.  Accordingly, I
would not consider the proposed sentence appeal.

                    Appeal
dismissed.

[1]
I should point out that on the Trieu model, if A brings B and C
together in the expectation that they will enter into a conspiracy, but B and C
do not do so, A cannot be found liable of the offence of attempted conspiracy
since no such offence exists at law.  See Déry.

on appeal from the superior court of québec

                    Criminal
law — Evidence — Informer privilege — Individual with informer privilege with
one police force providing information relating to himself and others to second
police force — Whether individual has status of police informer with second
police force — Whether implicit promise of confidentiality by second police
force exists as result of nexus between two police forces.

                    B
approached a first police force to give information about violent crimes and
was promised confidentiality by that police force.  Two days later, the first
police force transferred B and the information he had provided to the Sûreté du
Québec (“SQ”).  Over the next five years, B continued to cooperate with the SQ
and to give information about serious crimes.  At the end of that period, the
Crown ordered the SQ to redact B’s name and any information that could identify
him from all documents and to put those documents under seal.  It also brought
an application to determine if B benefitted from police informer privilege with
the SQ.  The application judge found that B did not have informer status.

                    Held
(Rothstein and Cromwell JJ. dissenting):  The appeal is allowed and
the matter remitted for reconsideration.

                    Per
McLachlin C.J. and LeBel, Fish, Abella, Moldaver and Karakatsanis JJ.:
 While the application judge recognized that a promise of confidentiality could
be either explicit or implicit, he undertook no analysis into whether an
implicit promise could have been inferred.  In particular, the application
judge failed to make any findings about whether B’s transfer from the first
police force to the SQ, the relationship between the two police forces, and the
similarities in B’s relationships with both, could have led someone in B’s
position to believe, on reasonable grounds, that the status he had with the
first police force would continue with the second.

                    The possibility of an implied promise of confidentiality emerges from
this record based on the nexus between the first police force and the SQ and
the SQ’s failure to clarify to B what his status was.  B’s interactions with
the SQ originated in his relationship as a confidential informant with the
first police force and the two police forces cooperated in handling B over the
following years.  In addition, the evidence is undisputed that no one ever told
B that he ceased to be a confidential informant when he was transferred to the
SQ, even though it is also undisputed that he repeatedly asked the SQ to
clarify his status. 

                    B
approached the first police force to provide information about violent crimes. 
He was promised informer privilege with respect to the information that he
provided to that force.  In its investigations, the SQ used confidential
information B had given to the first police force prior to the SQ’s
involvement. 

                    Based
on B’s information, the two police forces worked together and dealt with B interchangeably. 
An SQ officer acknowledged that the first police force and the SQ were
effectively operating together in respect of an investigation that developed
around B’s information.  This interconnection is also reflected in a letter
sent by an officer of the first police force, which acknowledges B’s
confidentiality with the first force and implies that that force believed that
B had a similar status with the SQ. 

                    In
addition to the temporal and operational nexus between the two forces, B insistently asked what his status was and never received a clear
answer.  This may well have led someone in B’s position
to reasonably believe that his identity would be protected.  While the SQ
officers were adamant that they did not think of B as an informer, they
do not appear to have shared this view with B.  B was promised confidentiality
by the first police force because his cooperation put his life at risk.  The
risk did not change when he was transferred to the SQ two days later and there is no doubt that the SQ knew of B’s protected status with the
first police force.  At the very least, the SQ sent mixed signals to B
concerning the confidentiality of his statements.  The net effect of these
mixed signals from the SQ on B’s reasonable expectation of confidentiality must
be decided at a new hearing. 

                    The
fact that one police force has granted informer status to an individual is not,
on its own, a sufficient basis for a claim of informer privilege with another
police force.  However, given the nexus between the
forces in handling B, and given the essential continuity of B’s relationship
with both, B may well have had reasonable grounds to believe that the
protection promised by the first police force would continue with the ongoing
flow of information that he was providing to the SQ.

                    Per
Rothstein and Cromwell JJ. (dissenting):  To decide this case, the
concrete realities of it and the limits of appellate review must first be
assessed.  The realities are that the application judge expressly rejected B’s
evidence that his status as a confidential police informer was ever promised or
even discussed.  He further found that the police had done nothing that would
permit B to understand that he was to become a confidential police informer.  While
it may in some rare cases be theoretically possible for a person to be both a
Crown witness and a confidential police informer, it was not possible in B’s
situation.  The application judge recognized this as does B’s own counsel
before this Court.  The fact that the police have an obligation to protect a
person has nothing to do with whether that person is a confidential police informer. 
Thus, there is nothing inconsistent with the police position that, on the one
hand, they felt obliged to protect B and on the other, that B was not a
confidential police informer. 

                    Any
implication that B inquired about his status as a police informer and was not
given a straight answer is not supported by either the application judge’s
findings or by this record.  In fact, the officers who testified on this issue
repeatedly asserted that a conversation about B’s status as a source or
confidential informer simply never occurred.  Indeed, none of the officers
involved failed to give B a straight answer about whether he was a confidential
source because there were no such discussions.

                    It
is not open to an appellate court to reweigh the evidence in the record or to
draw inferences from the evidence, which the application judge refused to draw,
absent some clear and determinative error on the part of the judge.  Thus, it
is not open to this Court on appeal to draw any inference from this record that
B inquired whether or not he was a source and did not receive a straight answer. 
Such an inference is not only contrary to the evidence that the application
judge accepted but it is also contrary to the judge’s express finding of fact
that the SQ did nothing that could have led B to believe that he would become a
confidential police source. 

                    On
the issue of alleged police promises of confidentiality, the application judge
was alive to and expressly noted that there was inconsistency in the evidence. 
A review of the record shows that there was indeed inconsistency or confusion in
the evidence about what was or was not confidential.  Sorting this out is the
job of the application judge, not of an appellate court.  The judge did so and
there is no basis to interfere with his findings.

                    The
application judge did not fail to consider whether a promise of confidential informer
status could be implicit in this case.  Rather, the judge’s factual findings
and the record amply support the conclusion that he was careful to consider
whether any promise was made implicitly as well as explicitly, even though B’s
evidence was solely to the effect that the SQ had made repeated explicit
promises.  This was the only basis for his professed belief that he had informer
status. 

                    The
judge was alive to B’s dealings with other police agencies.  Having heard that
evidence, however, he found as a fact that the evidence in the case required
that B’s dealings with the SQ be considered differently.  The judge referred to
several differences in support of this conclusion, which is amply supported by
the evidence. 

                    In
light of the application judge’s extensive findings, there is no evidence to
support the view that there may have been some implicit promise in this case.  In
fact, this possibility is inconsistent with B’s own clear
and unequivocal evidence that the claim of informer privilege arose solely from
alleged express promises, which the application judge concluded had never been
made.  Moreover, the judge accepted police evidence that there was never even
any thought of making B a confidential informer and that they did nothing that
could let B understand that he had that status.  The judge also found that it
was some years after B’s initial dealings with the SQ that B started to claim
the status of a confidential police informer.  These findings leave no room for
the imputed or implied promise theory. 

                    Finally,
the judge’s conclusions that B actually knew that he did not have informer
privilege and that B’s claim of that status was an after-the-fact exercise of
opportunism make irrelevant any possibility that some hypothetical person in
B’s circumstances might have thought that the promise was implicit.  B knew he
had no such promise and provided the information anyway.  B was a disappointed
suitor for a potentially lucrative co-operating witness contract and an
opportunist, not a police informer.

                    In
light of the record, there is no reason to interfere with the application
judge’s findings of fact.  Nothing in this case, however, should be taken as
undermining the importance of the police being clear with potential sources about
their status; quite the contrary.  Given the important role that
informer status plays in the detection and prosecution of crime, courts must
not undermine its effectiveness by condoning police actions that leave
potential informers uncertain or confused as to their status.  The application
judge in this case was clearly alive to these concerns, as he ought to have
been, and reached the conclusions he did after a careful and thorough review of
all of the evidence.  His decision should not be disturbed.

                    The
judgment of McLachlin C.J. and LeBel, Fish, Abella, Moldaver and Karakatsanis
JJ. was delivered by

[1]                             
Abella J.  — This appeal involves an individual, “B”,[1] who was guaranteed
confidentiality by one police force and then transferred to another. The second
police force failed to answer B’s repeated questions about his status, nor did
it at any time clarify what that status was.  The disposition of this case
rests on the consequences of the information vacuum created by the second
police force and, in particular, on whether an inference could reasonably have
been drawn that an implicit promise of confidentiality was made based on the
nexus between the two police forces. 

[2]                             
The application judge held that B’s status as a
confidential informant with one police force did not automatically make him a
confidential informant for the other. The application judge also found that B
lied about being expressly promised confidential informer status by the second
police force. But the inquiry should not have ended there.  What remained
unanswered was whether, due to the interaction between the police forces and
other police conduct, there was a nexus between the two police forces and, if
so, whether B was implicitly promised that the confidentiality he enjoyed with
one police force would continue to the other. The application judge accepted
the testimony of officers in the second police force concerning their
interactions with B. Significantly, that testimony included acknowledgments
that B repeatedly asked what his status was, and was never clearly told that he
was not a police informer.

[3]                             
The application judge concluded that B’s status
with each police force was to be treated differently. He never explained why. B placed himself at risk by providing the Sûreté du Québec (“SQ”) with information leading to the investigation and
prosecution of violent crime.  I see an error in the
application judge’s failure to make any findings about whether the
transfer, the relationship between the two police forces, and the similarities
in B’s relationships with both, could have led someone in B’s position to
believe, on reasonable grounds, that the status he had with the first police
force would continue with the police force to which he was transferred.

[4]                             
The record reveals that these are live issues.
None of the application judge’s findings address them, even accepting all of
the findings delineated by Justice Cromwell. This, with respect, leaves a key
question unanswered, namely, whether an implicit promise of confidentiality was
made in these circumstances.

Background

[5]                             
Motivated by fear for his safety and a desire
for vengeance, B met with two officers of the first police force in order to
give them information.  B’s information implicated a number of people who were
involved in violent criminal activity and in which he admitted to having been
involved as well.  B was promised confidentiality and given an informant code
in that police force’s system.  The police force then released B, but because
the criminal activity was outside its authority, the force transmitted the
information it got from B to the SQ.

[6]                             
 Two days later, B was transferred to the SQ and
two SQ officers arrested him for his crimes. B continued to want to cooperate
and to give information both about his crimes and his prior criminal
activities.  In the next several days, B made a number of statements to the SQ
relating to them.

[7]                             
B was given an informant code in the SQ’s system
and, for five years, continued to cooperate with the SQ.  Most of B’s
declarations to the SQ were preceded by a statement promising him that the
information he provided would not be used against him in a proceeding, except
for perjury, but that charges could be brought against him if they were
supported by independent evidence.

[8]                             
During the course of those five years, B pleaded
guilty to one of his violent crimes and was sentenced for it. 

[9]                             
At the end of the five years, the Crown ordered
the SQ to redact B’s name and any information that could identify him from all
documents and to put those documents under seal.   A few months later, two SQ
officers went to the penitentiary to have B sign a document entitled [translation] “Waiver of Informer
Privilege” — a waiver of his right to invoke police informer privilege.  He did
not sign.   Thereafter, B’s name does not appear in any new documents, and was
replaced with the word “source”.

[10]                         
 The Crown brought an application to clarify B’s
status and determine if he benefitted from a police informer privilege that
assured the confidentiality of his identity.  The hearing took place in closed
session, with documents under seal.

[11]                         
At the hearing, B testified that he was told by
the SQ on several occasions that he was an informer.  He relied on the fact
that he was attributed an informant code by the SQ, that he was asked to sign a
“Waiver of Informer Privilege”, and that he was identified as a “source” in any
documents created after the Crown requested the general redaction.  For its
part, the Crown argued that the SQ expected B to become a cooperating witness;
that B was told on many occasions that his statements could be used against
him; that B’s identity was not concealed by the SQ in documents and statements
prior to the sealing of the documents; and that the police had made limited
disclosure of one of B’s statements on one occasion. The Crown suggested that
this was inconsistent with B’s testimony that he had been promised that
his identity would remain protected.    

[12]                         
The application judge found that the first
police force’s officers had promised to keep B’s identity confidential in
exchange for the information he provided.  All of B’s statements to that police
force, therefore, were protected by informer privilege.  This is not contested
by any of the parties.

[13]                         
The application judge concluded, however, that [translation] “[t]he evidence requires
that [B’s] situation be viewed differently depending on whether information was
being disclosed to the [first police force]  or to investigators from the
Sûreté du Québec”.  As to B’s status with the SQ, the application judge saw the
evidence as presenting “two diametrically opposed versions” of events.  The
application judge rejected B’s evidence that the SQ had expressly told him that
he was a confidential informer, and accepted the SQ’s denial that any such
promise was made.    

[14]                         
While he noted that it was [translation] “odd”
that the police would ask a person to renounce his right to invoke police
informer privilege if it had never been offered in the first place, the
application judge nonetheless ultimately accepted the testimony of the Crown’s
witnesses and found that B’s testimony was not credible.  He therefore
concluded that B had never been promised police informer status by the SQ in
exchange for his statements. 

[15]                         
But the application judge undertook no analysis
into whether the promise was implicit in the circumstances because of the nexus
between the first police force, who had expressly granted B informer status,
and the SQ, to whom the first force immediately transferred B because they
lacked jurisdiction over the crimes he was describing. That oversight was based
on the application judge’s conclusion that B’s relationships with the first
police force and the SQ had to be treated differently.  The application judge
therefore ignored B’s relationship with the first force entirely when assessing
his status vis-à-vis the SQ.  

[16]                         
The application judge never explained why the
two forces had to be treated differently, nor did he make any findings related
to the issue. Instead, his analysis unfolded based on this unexplored
assumption. Yet B only became involved with the SQ due to his collaboration
with the first police force as a confidential informer.  The failure to
consider this nexus, in my respectful view, meant that the application judge
did not consider whether the police conduct gave rise to an implicit promise of
protected status.  In other words, would the police conduct have led someone in
B’s position to believe, on reasonable grounds, that his protected status would
continue when he and his information were transferred to the SQ?

[17]                         
I would set aside the application judge’s order
and direct that a new hearing take place to determine B’s status in light of
the nexus between the police forces.

Analysis

[18]                         
In R. v. Barros, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 368,
this Court held that “not everybody who provides
information to the police thereby becomes a confidential informant” (para.
31).  The Court was clear, however, that “the promise [of protection and
confidentiality] need not be express [and] may be implicit in the circumstances”
(para. 31, citing Bisaillon v. Keable, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 60). The legal question is whether, objectively,
an implicit promise of confidentiality can be inferred from the circumstances. 
In other words, would the police conduct have led a person in the shoes of the
potential informer to believe, on reasonable grounds, that his or her identity
would be protected? Related to this, is there evidence from which it can
reasonably be inferred that the potential informer believed that informer
status was being or had been bestowed on him or her? An implicit promise of
informer privilege may arise even if the police did not intend to confer that
status or consider the person an informer, so long as the police conduct in all
the circumstances could have created reasonable expectations of
confidentiality.

[19]                         
The application judge recognized that the
promise of confidentiality could be either explicit or implicit, but he
undertook no analysis into whether an implicit promise could have been inferred
from the circumstances of the relationship between the two police forces. In
fairness, a theory based on an implicit promise of confidentiality was not
specifically argued before the application judge. The arguments before him
centred on B’s claims that SQ officers had expressly and repeatedly told
him that his identity would remain confidential, which the officers denied.
Once the application judge found against B on that point, he effectively
overlooked the possibility that the police conduct, even in the absence of any
express statements, could have amounted to an implicit promise of
confidentiality.

[20]                         
Justice Cromwell states that there is no live
issue as to whether B received an implicit promise of confidentiality,
because the application judge effectively found that B knew that he did
not have informant status with the SQ. With respect, those were not the
application judge’s findings. I agree that if there had been a finding that B
actually knew that he did not have informant status, the inquiry would end
there. But there was no such finding. What the application judge did was to
reject B’s claims that the SQ expressly promised him confidential
informer status. He invoked B’s [translation]
“doubtful credibility . . . and . . . obvious opportunism”. In other words, the
application judge found that B lied in saying that the SQ officers expressly
promised him confidentiality in order to bolster his claim. That does not,
however, amount to a finding that B knew all along that he did not benefit from
confidentiality with the SQ. 

[21]                         
Similarly, B’s failure to testify about an
implicit promise does not necessarily mean that no such promise was made or
that he knew that informer status had been withheld. While B may have been found
not to be credible about receiving explicit promises of confidentiality,
the evidence in the record of a nexus between the police forces leaves open the
possibility of an implicit promise. B’s “obvious opportunism” and lack of
credibility do not, in the circumstances of this case, close the door to
finding an implicit promise of confidentiality, nor do they dispense
with the need for the application judge to examine the nexus between the
investigations and determine whether it gave rise to such a promise.  It is
hard to speculate what the application judge’s findings might have been
had he specifically turned his mind to the issue.

[22]                         
For me, the possibility of an implied promise of
confidentiality emerges from this record based on the nexus between the first
police force and the SQ, and the SQ’s failure to clarify to B what his status
was. First, B’s interactions with the SQ originated in his relationship as a
confidential informant with the first police force and the two police forces
cooperated in handling B over the following years. In addition, the evidence is
undisputed that no one ever told B that he ceased to be a confidential
informant when he was transferred to the SQ, even though it is also undisputed
that he repeatedly asked the SQ to clarify his status. 

[23]                         
The key issue is the nexus between the police
forces. B advanced the argument that all police forces
are “indivisible” with respect to police informer privilege such that, where
one police force extends a promise of confidentiality to an informer, that
status will continue to attach to the person when he or she is transferred to
another force.  I see no need for such a blunt “indivisibility” rule.  The fact
that one police force has granted informer status to an individual is not, on
its own, a sufficient basis for a claim of informer privilege with another
police force.

[24]                         
This is not to say that B’s transfer from one
police force to another is irrelevant to whether B had reason to believe that
he had been given informer privilege by the SQ. Given the interactions between
the two police forces in handling B, and given the essential continuity of B’s
relationship with both forces, in my view B may have had reasonable grounds to
believe that the protection promised by the first police force would continue with
the ongoing flow of information that he was providing to the SQ.

[25]                         
B approached the first police force in order to
provide information about violent crimes.  He was
promised informer privilege with respect to the
information that he provided to that force from their initial meeting onwards.  One of the two officers who had been at that meeting explained
that he perceived a strong need for confidentiality as of that first meeting,
given the risk to B’s safety and the sensitive information he was providing
concerning serious criminal activity:

[translation] We can’t afford to put [his] safety at risk. 
One thing that’s absolutely certain is that we wouldn’t have time to, as we
say, . . . “code” [him] at that time; there’s a coding procedure and
all that.  But in our minds, everything Named Person B told us . . . went into
a classified file to protect [his] . . . shall we say, secrets. 

 

. . . 

 

 

. . . everything that was said .
. . [h]ad to remain highly confidential, and there was evidence there that
related to past investigations, [violent crimes].   We couldn’t afford to
. . . we couldn’t give it a low classification.  It had to be given a
high classification . . . . 

[26]                         
In its investigations, the SQ used confidential
information B had given to the first police force during their initial
meetings, prior to the SQ’s involvement. Significantly, that information was
unrelated to the charges against B, and included a list of
individuals involved in violent criminal activity. In other words, while it is
true that the SQ arrested B for a violent crime that he committed, the SQ
treated B as much more than merely a suspect in a serious crime. B was
expected, and in fact continued to provide the SQ with information about
violent criminal activity, just as he had done with the first police force. 

[27]                         
There is no doubt that the SQ knew of B’s
protected status with the first police force.  One of the SQ officers who
arrested B acknowledged that when the SQ picked B up, they knew that B had
provided [translation] “a lot of
information” to the first police force, that B wanted to cooperate by providing
information, that he was “protected” by that other
force, and that the SQ would have to continue to protect him:

[translation] Well, we knew from the beginning that Named Person B wanted to give
information, there was no secret about it, and when we took charge of Named
Person B, it was because the [first police force] told us [he] was implicated in
[violent criminal activity, for which] the Sûreté du Québec [was] responsible.
. . .  So we met [him] as a [violent crime] suspect, but we knew that this
person . . . wanted to co-operate with the Sûreté.  We knew that
[he]’d given information to the [first police force].  We knew that this was a
person who was protected by the [first police force].  We knew that we were the
ones who would continue to protect [him].  So, we were in a sense [his]
controllers. [Emphasis added.]

[28]                         
 Another SQ officer who had dealt with B from
the beginning acknowledged that he knew that B was coded as a “source” by the
other police force when he first talked to him upon his transfer from that
force.  The exchange at the hearing was as follows:

[translation]

 

Q     Was [he] already classified as a “source” by the Quebec
police?

 

. . .

 

A     I would say, to the best of my knowledge, I would say no.

 

. . .

 

Q     Did you know that [he] had been one for the [first police
force]  or that [he] still was one for the [first police force]?

 

A     A “source” for the [first police force]?

 

Q     Yeah.

 

A     It’d been coded that way . . . . [Emphasis
added.]  

 

[29]                         
Notes taken two years after B’s arrest by an
officer of the first police force following a conversation with an SQ officer
(introduced as fresh evidence), confirm that the first police force put the SQ
on notice that B benefitted from confidentiality:

[translation]

 

[The SQ officer and I]
discussed [B] and the information that source had given [the two officers of
the first police force who first met with B].

 

Informer privilege was
discussed.  On this subject, I said that [B] had the privilege because [he] had
given the information as a source and [he] had an expectation of
confidentiality.

 

I told [the SQ officer] that in
my opinion, though I’m not a lawyer, if the information is confidential and if
it is included in [any document], it should be redacted.  To be confirmed with
a lawyer.

[30]                         
For five years, B continued to provide the SQ
with wide-ranging information dealing with violent crimes. SQ officers kept
going back to him as a source, and his information led to the investigation and
prosecution of many other crimes.

[31]                         
During the years when he was being questioned, B
knew that he was being dealt with interchangeably by both police forces.  At
various points, he stayed under the first police force’s guard or at that
force’s premises and was picked up there by SQ officers. 
On at least three occasions, an officer of the first
force met with B along with SQ officers. 

[32]                         
At the hearing, an SQ officer acknowledged that
the first police force and the SQ were effectively operating together in
respect of an investigation that developed around B’s information. In order to
show his good faith, B had surrendered various items to the SQ, including
thousands of dollars.  The SQ turned the money over to the first police force.
When asked why the SQ turned the money over to that force, the SQ officer noted
that [translation] “[the first force] was on the
case, was . . . participating in the case”.  He referred to the joint
handling of B as “a sort of interorganizational project”. 

[33]                         
This interconnection is also reflected in a
letter sent by an officer of the first police force to the SQ with respect to
the money, which acknowledges B’s confidentiality with the first force and
implies that that force believed that B had a similar status with the SQ. The
officer asked the SQ to return the money to B because
the only evidence that the money was the proceeds of crime was given by B to
the SQ under a promise that it would not be used against him. He indicated that

[translation]
given the status of [B] with the Sûreté du Québec and the [first police force],
and given our obligation to keep this status confidential, we have been
unable to gather any other evidence that could be used.  [Emphasis added.]

[34]                         
In other words, the relationship between B and
the SQ was not only connected to the first police force in an ongoing way, it
was not significantly different from that between B and the first force. Both
police forces warned him that he would receive no immunity in respect of his
own criminal acts, and both forces expected him to become a cooperating witness
in other cases. Based on B’s information, the two police forces worked together
and dealt with B interchangeably. 

[35]                         
This evidence of a close connection between the
first police force and the SQ establishes a foundation upon which
someone in B’s position may reasonably have seen himself as being part of a
joint, ongoing operation between the two police forces: the first force had
given him an express promise of informer privilege, and the SQ, to whom he was
transferred consensually for jurisdictional reasons, took advantage of the
relationship and information that flowed from this protection.

[36]                         
In addition to the temporal and operational
nexus between the two forces, the evidence is
undisputed that B insistently asked what his status was and never received a
clear answer. An SQ officer who had dealt with B since his arrest testified
that around the time of his transfer to the SQ, B [translation] “was
worried about what was going to happen to [him]”, and that he was “deeply
concerned” about this.  It was a source of stress for B, who was “extremely
afraid” that he would be killed.   Another SQ officer testified that B was
asking about his status two years after his transfer. The application judge
found that B was still asking about his status two years after that. 

[37]                         
The SQ’s conduct in failing to clarify B’s
status to him despite being repeatedly asked to do so, may well have led
someone in B’s position to reasonably believe that his identity would be
protected. It bears emphasizing that no one ever told B that he was not
a confidential informant with the SQ.   One of the SQ
officers who arrested B, for instance, testified that he did not discuss B’s
status with him when he first took B into SQ custody, because B had already
“started the process” with the first police force:

[translation]

 

Q     Was [his] testimony as a cooperating witness, [his] status
discussed . . . .

 

A     It was not discussed.

 

Q     . . . at that time?

 

A     No, because [he]’d already started with the [first police
force]. Named Person B, [he] was in a process with [that force], we knew
that [he]’d given a lot of information to the [first force].  We knew that
because we’d met the guys from that force.  So I don’t know what Named Person B
might’ve been thinking at that time.  [He] . . . was in a process
in [his] mind, that’s for sure, for sure . . . because
. . . [he] was cooperating with [the first force].  [Emphasis
added.]

Although this officer was
referring to the process of becoming a cooperating witness, the “process” B had
started with the first police force included a promise of confidentiality made
only two days earlier. 

[38]                         
While the SQ officers were adamant that
they did not think of B as an informer, they do not appear to have shared this
view with B. B was promised confidentiality by the first police force because
his cooperation put his life at risk. The risk did not change when he was transferred
to the SQ two days later. From that point onward, B
repeatedly voiced concerns about his confidentiality, his safety, and the
uncertainty and confusion he felt while waiting for the possibility of a
cooperating witness contract to materialize.

[39]                         
There is no doubt that much of the focus of B’s
questions related to whether the cooperating witness contract was forthcoming
and to the type of protection that he would be given under it. But there is
also no doubt that he voiced inquiries that raised confidentiality concerns.
Where B’s status was in flux and unclear as a result of his transfer from one
police force to another, the SQ’s failure to clarify his status may have given
rise to a reasonable belief in informer status, whether or not he actually asked
a specific question like, “Will I be treated as a police informer in the event
of failure to conclude a cooperating witness contract?” 

[40]                         
In these circumstances, the fact that nobody
clarified for him whether the confidentiality promised by the first police
force continued to apply to his dealings with the SQ could well have led him to
believe that the protection he had with the first force continued pending the
cooperating witness contract.  

[41]                         
The fresh evidence also illustrates the
ambiguity generated by the SQ’s approach to B’s status. Two documents introduced as fresh evidence
were written by one of the SQ officers who had been involved with B since his
transfer. These documents followed a discussion the SQ
officer had two years after B’s arrest with an officer of the first police
force about B’s status. In these documents, B was referred
to as a “source”, as was the practice with informers, rather than by name. Many
other documents prepared by SQ officers refer to B by his name. In other words,
SQ officers inconsistently referred to B, sometimes designating him by his real
name, and sometimes calling him an informer. Their confusion may well have led
B to reasonably assume that his confidential status remained unchanged upon his
transfer from the first police force to the SQ.

[42]                         
Justice Cromwell concludes that B could not
reasonably have believed that the SQ considered him an informer, given the
expectation that he would become a cooperating witness. But informer privilege
is not necessarily inconsistent with being a cooperating witness. B’s position at the hearing was that he believed he would remain a
police informer until he secured a cooperating witness contract with the Crown.
In other words, his identity would remain confidential until the Crown confirmed
that it intended to call him as a witness and provide certain advantages in
exchange for his testimony. 

[43]                         
As this Court recognized
in Barros, the same person can be an informer entitled to privilege in
one matter, and a witness whose identity is disclosable in another:

Once a police informer goes into the
“field” and acts as a police agent, the informer privilege is no longer
applicable to prevent disclosure of his or her identity in respect of the
events in which he or she acted as an agent. . . . This does not mean, of
course, that the informer loses protection in other cases where he or she has
not stepped out of the protected role. [Emphasis added; para. 33.]

Witnesses can even
testify without having to disclose that they supplied confidential information
to the police in that same matter, as this Court noted in R. v. Leipert,
[1997] 1 S.C.R. 281, at para. 17: “[Informer privilege] applies to a witness on
the stand. Such a person cannot be compelled to state whether he or she is a
police informer . . .”. This possibility has been recognized since Attorney-General
v. Briant (1846), 15 M. & W. 169, 153 E.R. 808, in which Pollock C.B.
held that a Crown witness could not be asked, “Did you give the information?”
that led to the institution of penal proceedings. Finally,
while informers typically waive privilege when they agree to testify, nothing
prevents them from keeping their privilege until there is a firm decision to
testify by both the informer and the prosecution.

[44]                         
SQ officers gave B several reassurances that may
have reinforced his view that he was an informer until he became a
cooperating witness. One of the two SQ officers who arrested B explained to him
that he would never have to testify in relation to any of the information he
provided unless a cooperating witness contract was signed: 

[translation]

 

A     . . . And I also explained to [him] that if [he] didn’t sign a
contract, [he] would never have to testify about any of the things [he]’d given
us under a promise. . . .

 

Q     Under a promise of . . . that it couldn’t be used against
[him]?

 

A     That’s it. . . .  [He] wouldn’t have to
testify, because the contract is so that the person will testify . . .
and that’s the point of the contract . . . .  

 

Q     If there was no contract, well, [he] wouldn’t have to
testify. . . . 

 

A     That’s it.

[45]                         
Moreover, another SQ officer testified that he
always made it clear to B that his statements were confidential:

[translation]

 

Q     But Named Person B asked you several times: “Hey, my
statements, what’re you doing with them?  Will they stay confidential?  Don’t
show that to anyone.”

 

A     They were always confidential.

 

Q     They were always confidential?

 

A     Yes.

 

Q     But you were always clear with Named Person B that they were
confidential?

 

A     They were always confidential. The only thing . . . 
When I say confidential, it’s that those statements weren’t shown to other
accused, or potential accused, or even “accusables” . . . .
[Emphasis in original.]

 

He also said that he repeatedly
reassured B that none of his statements had ever been disclosed:

[TRANSLATION]

 

Q     But [he] was told they were confidential?

 

A     As far as I know, [his] statements were never disclosed in any
case.  Except for [one time] . . .  we didn’t disclose any
statements.  In fact, it bothered me at times, and I would tell [him]: “Look, don’t
worry, nothing in the file, nothing’s been disclosed”.

[46]                         
 This officer said that there was only one
exception to the confidentiality which generally applied to B’s statements: on
one occasion, a statement was disclosed in another investigation. The SQ did so
without B’s knowledge or consent. The exceptional use of B’s statements a few
years after the start of his relationship with the SQ is hardly revelatory of
whether B could reasonably have believed that his identity was being protected
throughout that time.

[47]                         
It is true that B gave statements to the SQ
after being cautioned that they could be used as evidence in court against
third parties. But these cautions must be juxtaposed against the repeated
reassurances from SQ officers that B’s statements would remain confidential,
and that B would never have to testify on those subjects unless and until
he became a cooperating witness. At the very least, the SQ sent mixed signals
to B concerning the confidentiality of his statements, and never clearly denied
that he benefitted from confidentiality. In my view, the net effect of these
mixed signals from the SQ on B’s reasonable expectation of confidentiality must
be decided at a new hearing. 

[48]                         
Significantly too, five years after B’s transfer
to the SQ, the Crown ordered the SQ to redact all documents that could identify
B, and asked that a signed waiver of privilege be obtained from B. SQ officers
repeatedly visited B for that purpose. Had there been certainty that B’s status
was not protected, these steps would not have been necessary. The
application judge acknowledged that the Crown’s request for a waiver of
privilege was [translation]
“contradictory” and “odd” given the SQ officers’
position that they had never promised B confidentiality, concluding: “Had the
intention been to confuse, it could not have been done better.” 

[49]                         
All of this, including the uncontradicted
evidence that B was not told by the SQ what his status was, makes it possible
that someone in B’s circumstances could reasonably believe that the confidentiality
he was promised by the first police force continued when they transferred him
to the SQ.  I would therefore allow the appeal and remit the matter for
reconsideration in light of these reasons.

                    The
reasons of Rothstein and Cromwell JJ. were delivered by

                    Cromwell J.  (dissenting) — 

I.  Overview

[50]                         
The appellant, B, provided information about
criminal activity ― his own and that of others ― to the Sûreté
du Québec (“SQ”).[2]  
The issue here is whether B had confidential informer status with respect to
the information.   The application judge, after a hearing at which B and a
number of police officers testified, decided that B did not have that status. 
This appeal challenges that conclusion. 

[51]                         
My colleague Abella J. would hold that the
application judge’s ruling must be set aside and the matter reheard,
essentially for two reasons.   First, the application judge “undertook no
analysis” into whether the promise of confidential informer status was implicit
in the circumstances (paras. 15 and 19).   Second, this issue which the
application judge failed to consider is a live issue on this record because
there is evidence, including new evidence, to support the conclusion that “the
police conduct [would] have led someone in B’s position to
believe, on reasonable grounds, that [his status was] protected” (para. 16).
The failure to consider this live issue therefore requires a new hearing.  I
cannot subscribe to my colleague’s conclusion or the reasons for it.  My
disagreement is based on the following interrelated points.

[52]                         
First, the analysis of the appeal in my view
must take place in the context of the concrete realities of this case and
within the proper limits of appellate review. Respectfully, my colleague’s
analysis is directed towards hypothetical possibilities that are either
contrary to clear findings by the application judge or have no air of reality
on the record before the Court. 

[53]                         
Second, the application judge, as I see it, did
not fail to consider whether a promise of confidential informer status could be
implicit in this case.  In my view, the judge’s factual findings and the
record amply support the conclusion that he considered that possibility.

[54]                         
Third, as I read the record in light of the
application judge’s extensive findings, there is no evidence to support the
view that there may have been some implicit promise in this case.  In fact,
this possibility is inconsistent with B’s own evidence and with the
circumstances under which B was treated by the SQ. Moreover, the application
judge specifically considered whether an implicit promise had been made and
made explicit findings of fact that the SQ never did anything that could
allow B to understand that he would become a confidential police informer. 
As I see it there is no live issue on this point.

[55]                         
Fourth, the application judge found as a fact
that B actually knew from his first dealings, and during his subsequent
dealings, with the SQ that he had no promise that he would be a confidential
source for the SQ and that the claim of informer status was an after-the-fact
exercise in opportunism on B’s part.  This conclusion, amply supported by the
record, makes irrelevant what some hypothetical person in B’s position might
have thought.  B thought no such thing and, knowing he did not have any promise
of confidentiality, supplied information to the SQ for a number of years.  As
the application judge found, B’s assertion of informer privilege came only when
the Crown, in the context of discharging disclosure obligations in another
prosecution, thought it advisable to have B’s status clarified by a judicial
determination.  The judge dismissed B’s after-the-fact claims as showing [translation] “obvious opportunism” on
his part. 

[56]                         
I would dismiss the appeal.

II.     Issues, Facts and Proceedings

A.     Introduction

[57]                         
The appellant, B, provided information about
criminal activity — his own and that of others — over a number of years to the
SQ in the hopes of being retained as a [translation]
“co-operating witness” and of receiving the type of remuneration and other
benefits normally commensurate with this type of co-operation.    Ultimately,
individuals (some of whom are parties to this appeal and are referred to as the
“Other Individuals”) were charged with several violent crimes and it is in the
context of their trial that the question of B’s possible status as a
confidential police informer arises.

[58]                         
If information provided by B met the Stinchcombe
standard, it would normally have to be disclosed: R. v. Stinchcombe,
[1991] 3 S.C.R. 326.  However, B claimed to have confidential police informer
status: therefore, B’s identity as the supplier of the information to the SQ
was privileged and must not be disclosed.  The Crown’s position, however, is
that B has no such status.  

[59]                         
B’s status of course could significantly affect
the scope of the Crown’s disclosure obligation to the Other Individuals at
their trial.  If B is a confidential source with respect to certain information,
then B’s identity as the supplier of that information must be kept
confidential, along with any other information that could reveal B’s identity
as the source in that regard.  None of this confidential information could be
disclosed, subject only to an accused establishing that it falls within the
“innocence at stake” exception or unless both B and the police waive the
privilege.  Otherwise, the confidentiality is absolute and disclosure cannot be
made.  The impact on disclosure is thus potentially considerable.

[60]                         
The Crown applied to the application judge for a
determination of this issue and the application judge held that B was not a
confidential informer with respect to information he supplied to the SQ. 

B.          
Issues

[61]                         
The principal issues, as the appeal has evolved,
are these: 

1.           
What are the concrete realities of this case and
the proper limits of appellate review which form the basis for consideration of
the appeal? In my view, the judge’s express findings of fact, read in light of
the record leave no room for appellate intervention with respect to his
conclusion that B was not a confidential source for the SQ.

2.           
Did the application judge fail to consider
whether a promise of confidential informer status could be implicit in this
case?  In my view he did not.   

3.           
Is there a live issue on this record as to
whether there may have been an implicit promise of informer privilege by the
SQ? In my view there is not.  

4.           
Is the application judge’s finding of fact that
B actually knew that he did not have confidential informer status fatal to B’s
claim?  In my view it is.

C.     Background Facts

         (1)      The Appellant Seeks Out the Police

[62]                         
The appellant, motivated by a desire to avenge
himself against others and to make amends for his past criminal activity,
contacted the police.  He sought to provide information about past crimes and
to assist in their prosecution.  

[63]                         
Soon thereafter, the appellant was put under
arrest by the SQ, cautioned and detained for his criminal activity.  Of course,
that warning would have included advice that anything B said could be used as
evidence.  During the application hearing, Crown counsel read out the warning
given to B by the SQ before taking B’s statements regarding his criminal
activity.  

[translation]

 

Q     And when [he] told you then: My name is . . . . I’m going to
read you a warning.  You can sit down.  I want to inform you that you’re under
arrest. . . .

 

. . .

 

Q     . . . you have the right to remain silent.  We must inform you
that we are police officers.  You are not required to say anything, and you
must understand clearly that if you wish to speak, everything you say will
be taken down . . . and can be used as evidence against you. [Emphasis
added.]

 

[64]                         
The appellant gave a statement to the SQ
regarding his involvement in criminal activity, going so far as to bring SQ
officers to the crime scene.  B was told by the police at the outset that B
would be held to account for his crime.  It was therefore clear to B that those
matters were not subject to any sort of confidentiality obligation.  B’s
arrest, detention and cautioning by the SQ are in every respect consistent with
that advice.

[65]                         
I also underline the application judge’s finding
that B stated that from the beginning of his co-operation with the police, B
both wanted and expected to testify at future trials.  In the circumstances
here, as the application judge found, B could not possibly become a Crown witness
and a confidential police informer with the SQ.  

[66]                         
The next day, the appellant was arrested and
cautioned for another crime.  Again, B freely made a statement discussing
several subjects, including the extent of B’s involvement in that crime.  

[67]                         
I underline the cautions given to B by the SQ to
the effect any statements could be used in evidence.

[68]                         
The appellant’s co-operation subsequently
continued to intensify, as he provided the SQ with further statements
implicating other individuals in serious crimes.  Several of these statements
were made under a promise by the SQ that they would not be used as
incriminating evidence against the appellant.  

[69]                         
The SQ officers involved, realizing that the
appellant could possibly be of great use to them in solving other cases,
started to evaluate whether he could make a suitable co-operating witness.  

[70]                         
As a result of their frequent meetings, they
registered the appellant as an informer in the SQ database, apparently to
enable them to incur secret expenses for him.  Indeed, though this type of code
was normally used to identify confidential informers in its database, the SQ
was clear that it had been attributed to the appellant for purely
administrative imperatives.  As an SQ officer testified, this registration was
warranted because secret expenses could only be reimbursed if incurred for the
benefit of an individual who had such a code assigned to him in the SQ
database.  

[71]                         
Soon after his first meeting with the SQ, the
latter also submitted the appellant to a polygraph test, one of the important
preliminary steps to obtaining co-operating witness status.  

         (2)      The Appellant Shows Signs of Impatience 

[72]                         
While the administration of the polygraph test
could have been interpreted by the appellant as an encouraging sign that a co-operating
witness contract was forthcoming, B was not appeased.  He soon thereafter
became nervous about the Crown’s lateness in formalizing his status as a
co-operating witness and voiced this to the SQ.  He insisted on being promptly
informed of the state of his co-operating witness application and on receiving
clarification about his status in the meantime.  He threatened, at one point,
to starve himself and stop co-operating with the SQ until he was formally
recognized as a co-operating witness.

[73]                         
The appellant testified that his insistence led
the SQ to tell him that he would be considered a confidential police informer
until it received instructions as to whether his co-operating witness candidacy
was approved.  The SQ police officers who testified, on the other hand, denied
ever making such a promise.  Their view of the situation was that he was in the
process of becoming a co-operating witness (and some explicitly told him this)
and that the idea of making him a confidential informer had not crossed their
mind at that time.  The application judge accepted the police evidence and
rejected that of B.  The appellant continued to cooperate with the SQ for a
time after this episode.  

         (3)      The Appellant Continues Co-operation With the
SQ 

[74]                         
Almost a year after being arrested, the
appellant was informed by officers that the Crown had decided against enrolling
the appellant as a co-operating witness.  The Crown had decided against calling
B as a witness in future trials and therefore that status was in the Crown’s
view unnecessary.

[75]                         
The SQ later informed B that there was a
possibility that B would be offered a co-operating witness contract
nonetheless.  The appellant accepted the police’s offer and a co-operative
relationship between the SQ and the appellant was re-established.  

[76]                         
After B resumed active co-operation with the SQ,
he later gave several statements to the SQ.  It is worth noting here that
though it was made clear to the appellant that these statements could not be
used against him in a court of law, it was also made clear that they
could be used as evidence in the trials of third parties. As I shall
discuss and the application judge rightly found, in these circumstances, the
roles of potential witness and police informer were completely inconsistent, as
B would well have understood.  

[77]                         
Subsequently, the appellant had occasional
dealings with the SQ, either in person or by phone, providing additional
information.  On these occasions, the SQ provided assurances that a
co-operating witness contract was probably forthcoming.  

         (4)      Non-completion of the Co-operating Witness
Contract

[78]                         
The following year, SQ officers met with the
appellant to transmit, on behalf of the Crown, a new offer in a case before the
court.  The SQ officers also informed him that he would, for the time being, be
considered a special witness (a witness who benefits from police protection
because of the sensitive nature of the information that he may be called upon
to testify on, but who does not obtain the financial advantages normally
commensurate with being a co-operating witness).  They assured him however that
his co-operating witness application was still pending.  

[79]                         
A few weeks later, the appellant contacted the
SQ, seeking assurances about the progress of his co-operating witness
application.  The appellant testified that he was told by an SQ officer, with
another officer present, that his contract was forthcoming and that, in any
event, he was considered a confidential police informer in the meantime. 
Again, this is denied by the SQ. The officer, on the other hand, claims only to
have told him that he wanted him to testify in court, and assured him that he
was taking care of him and his safety.  According to the officer, the option of
granting the appellant confidential informer status was never contemplated
because he was always sure that the appellant would be given a co-operating
witness contract.  As noted earlier, the application judge accepted the police
evidence.

[80]                         
What is uncontested, however, is that the
evaluation process was progressing.  Officers took the appellant to other
SQ-controlled premises later that same year, where he made full disclosure of
his criminal past — a prerequisite to the signature of a co-operating witness
contract.  He also met with Crown prosecutors a few days later.

[81]                         
A few months later, the appellant was questioned
again with the assurance that his statements would not be used against him in a
court of law.  He was questioned regarding several inconsistencies between
different statements he had made to the police and to Crown prosecutors.  It is
clear that his credibility was being tested, as is often done when evaluating
the suitability of a co-operating witness candidate and his potential for
providing convincing testimony in court.  

[82]                         
However, the Crown ultimately decided against
entering into the arrangement because it did not intend to have him testify for
the moment.  He would therefore not be retained as a co-operating witness.  

         (5)      The Crown Attempts to Clarify Appellant’s
Status

[83]                         
The Crown, having decided not to retain the
appellant as a co-operating witness, sought to clarify the appellant’s status
in order to properly discharge its disclosure obligations.  While this was
being sorted out, the Crown, as a measure of precaution, ordered that the
appellant’s name and any information capable of leading to the discovery of his
identity be redacted from various documents. 

[84]                         
Chief among its concerns was its desire to
clarify whether or not the appellant benefited from informer privilege, for if
he did, much of his statements even if otherwise subject to disclosure would
not be so subject.  In an effort to clear up this issue, the Crown sent a
police officer to meet with the appellant and ask him whether he would agree to
sign a document whereby he would undertake not to seek to invoke informer
privilege regarding the information he had provided the SQ.  The appellant
refused.  The Crown therefore brought a motion before the court seeking to
determine whether or not the appellant benefited from informer privilege. 
After witness testimony and argument by counsel, the judge held that B did not
benefit from informer privilege in regard to that information.  

D.  Judgment Below

[85]                         
After having reviewed this Court’s decisions in Bisaillon
v. Keable, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 60; R. v. Leipert, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 281; Named
Person v. Vancouver Sun, 2007 SCC 43, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 253, and the Ontario
Court of Appeal’s decision in R. v. Babes (2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 465,
the application judge held that in order for informer privilege to apply, the
police had to explicitly or implicitly promise a claimant that his identity as
the provider of information would be kept confidential.  He added that the
burden rested on the individual claiming informer privilege to demonstrate, on
a balance of probabilities, that he was entitled to benefit from it.  

[86]                         
The appellant testified about this issue during
the hearing, admitting that the purpose for initially coming forward to the
police was to get revenge.  B further testified that he hoped to become a
co-operating witness and that B’s statements would not be used against B in a
court of law.  Nevertheless, the appellant testified that he believed he
benefited from informer privilege because he had been assured of this many
times by several SQ officers.  According to B, he had been told that he would
be considered a confidential informer as long as the hoped-for co-operating
witness agreement with the Crown had not been finalized.  B’s position
throughout was that the SQ had made an explicit promise of informer status. 
B’s position in his evidence was never that he had inferred from police conduct
that they were promising B informer status or that anything done by the police
force fed any such inference.

[87]                         
The Crown also called several SQ officers to
testify in that regard.  They all indicated that the appellant had never been considered
a confidential informer and had never been told so.  In fact, they indicated
that they always had in mind that B was in the process of becoming a
co-operating witness and would testify in future court proceedings.  The
prospect of granting B informer privilege had, according to them, simply never
been on their radar.

[88]                         
After having considered the testimonial and
documentary evidence before him, the application judge proceeded to identify
the elements which supported the parties’ respective positions.  

[89]                         
In support of the appellant’s position, the
application judge noted the fact that the SQ in some respects treated B as it
would a confidential informer and had invited him to sign a document whereby he
would undertake not to seek to invoke informer privilege regarding the
information he had provided the SQ.

[90]                         
In support of the opposite conclusion, the
application judge noted, amongst other things, that (1) the appellant wished to
become a police agent and expected to have to testify in future trials, (2) B
was arrested for violent criminal activity and the information that he gave the
SQ in that regard was used against B, (3) B gave a statement soon after his
first meeting with the SQ knowing that this could lead to charges of violent
criminal activity, (4) the SQ never produced any source reports regarding the
information gathered from him, (5) B was offered immunity and an undertaking
not to testify in a prosecution, (6) one of the appellant’s statements was
disclosed in the course of another investigation (this is incompatible with the
confidentiality owed to an individual benefiting from informer privilege), and
that (7) the appellant gave several statements in regards of which he was
warned they could be used as evidence in the trial of others.

[91]                         
Having completed this exercise, the application
judge acknowledged that it was certainly surprising to [translation] “ask someone considered to be a possible
witness to waive [his] police informer privilege [some] years after having
assigned [him] an identifier reserved for sources”.  He also found quite
strange that the Crown asked the appellant to undertake not to seek to invoke a
privilege that only the SQ police officers could have granted and that they
maintained never having granted.  

[92]                         
Nevertheless, the application judge remained of
the view that no express or implied understanding existed between the SQ and
the appellant that he would be conferred confidential informer status. Contrary
to Justice Abella’s suggestion that the key question of whether there was an
implicit promise of confidentiality was left unanswered, this question was in
fact specifically answered in the negative by the application judge. 
Recognizing that the evidence was contradictory, he largely rejected the
appellant’s testimony as lacking credibility, and instead accepted the evidence
of the SQ officers.  

[93]                         
The application judge further found that the
appellant had always, since his first meeting with the SQ, understood
that he would testify in other trials.  B’s insistence on obtaining confidential
informer status was sparked, the application judge found, by disappointment
with not being signed on as a co-operating witness and the fruitlessness of the
negotiations with the witness protection programme. The application judge was
of the view that the appellant seized the opportunity of trying to invoke
informer privilege when the Crown tried to obtain an undertaking not to seek to
invoke informer privilege; on account of this, the appellant’s behaviour, the
application judge opined, was that of an obvious opportunist.  Considering this
express finding that B only sought to assert privilege after the fact, it is my
view that we can conclude that, contrary to my colleague’s statement at para.
20, this does “amount to a finding that B knew all along that he did not
benefit from confidentiality with the SQ”. 

[94]                         
With all that having been said, the application
judge concluded that an analysis of the testimonies and the exhibits leads to
the overriding conclusion that the appellant did not benefit from informer
privilege in regard to the information provided to the SQ, but was rather a
compellable witness in the trial of other individuals. The judge further found
that the SQ had never done anything that would allow B to understand that he
would become a confidential police informer.

III.    Analysis

A.     What Are the Concrete Realities of This Case?

[95]                         
At the outset, I think it is important to note
the concrete realities of the case and the limits of appellate review against
which the appellant’s submissions must be assessed.  As I see it, there are
several matters that must be kept in mind.

[96]                         
First, the application judge expressly rejected
B’s evidence including the evidence that his status as a confidential police
informer was ever promised, or even discussed. He further found that the police
had done nothing that would permit B to understand that he was to become a
confidential police informer. It is worth setting out in full some key parts of
the application judge’s findings in this regard:

           [translation] Officers . . . who were
in regular contact with [B] from [the time of his first meeting with the SQ],
all state that they always dealt with [him] as a witness to crimes and that
they at no time suggested to [him] that they would one day consider [him] a
police informer should [he] not be granted a co-operating witness contract. 
[B] states categorically that the opposite is true and that the officers in
question formally undertook to do so on several occasions.

 

. . .

 

           The Court
accordingly accepts the version of the police witnesses, who have always, since
[B’s first meeting with the SQ], made it clear that they intended to have [B]
testify publicly about [his] disclosures, and who have always told [him] so
without ever suggesting to [him] that [he] might become a police informer
should there be no contract with the Crown.

 

. . .

 

           . . . the Court
must on the basis of the evidence as a whole find that there was no agreement, either
express or tacit, between [B] and the officers . . . under which
[he] had the status of a police informer . . . . [Emphasis added.]

 

[97]                         
Second, while it may in some rare cases be theoretically possible
for a person to be both a Crown witness and a confidential police informer, it
was not possible in B’s situation. The application judge recognized this as
indeed does B’s own counsel before this Court. Moreover, the application judge
specifically rejected as a matter of fact B’s evidence that he was promised
confidential informer status pending the resolution of the co-operating
witness process and accepted the police evidence that they did nothing
that could have led B to understand that he had confidential police informer
status at any point in their dealings.

[98]                         
Third, the fact that the police have an obligation to protect a
person has nothing to do with whether that person is a confidential police
informer. There is nothing inconsistent with the police position that, on the
one hand, they felt obliged to protect B, and on the other that B was not a
confidential police informer.

[99]                         
Fourth, it is not open to an appellate court to
reweigh the evidence in the record or to draw inferences from the evidence
which the application judge refused to draw absent some clear and determinative
error on the part of the application judge. In my respectful view, my colleague
Abella J.’s reasons run afoul of this important principle in more than one
respect.  

[100]                     
Consider, for example, my colleague’s repeated
references to B’s inquiries concerning his “status”.  In effect, my colleague
suggests that B asked repeatedly about whether he was a police informer and was
not given a straight answer.  Respectfully, that is not an inference that may
be fairly drawn from this record or the application judge’s findings of fact. 

[101]                     
B’s testimony that he was assured that he had
the status of a confidential police informer pending the outcome of the
co-operating witness contract process was specifically rejected by the
application judge. On the contrary, the judge found expressly that the police,
since B’s first meeting with the SQ, had always manifested the intention to
call B to testify publicly about his revelations to them and that their
discussions with him never allowed him to understand that he could become a
confidential source. 

[102]                     
According to the police witnesses, whose
evidence the judge accepted, B’s preoccupation was with getting a co-operating
witness contract — a contract that he could reasonably expect would provide
financial and other benefits.  It was about the progress of the process of
being given such a contract, not whether B was a confidential informer, that B
repeatedly inquired and in response to which the police advised that the
process was ongoing and that the Crown had the final decision.  Any implication
that B inquired about his status as a police informer and was not given a
straight answer is, respectfully, not supported by either the application
judge’s findings or by this record. In fact, the officers who testified on this
issue repeatedly asserted that a conversation about B’s status as a “source” or
“confidential informer” simply never occurred. For example, an officer
testified in the following manner:

[translation]

 

Q     But when [he] had these questions, do you remember that Named
Person B asked you: “Yeah, but then, if [he] doesn’t sign, what will you do
with me?

 

A     No.

 

Q     What am I?

 

A     No.

 

Q     . . . What are you doing with the statements?”

 

A     No.  We always worked with the idea that [he] would become a
co‑operating witness.  When I worked with [him], we took down statements,
we went looking for evidence.  It was clear to us that it was going to be given
to Crown prosecutors so that charges would be laid.  But I, anyway, it had been
explained to [him] how [he] would become a co­‑operating witness, that
is, that there were people who would be deciding that.  So we always worked
with the idea that [he] would become a co‑operating witness. 

Another officer’s
testimony on this issue is also instructive:

[translation]

 

Q     And Named Person B, when [he] spoke with you, am I right to
say that [he] told you a number of times: “I want to be a ‘source’, I don’t
want you to give my statements to anyone” . . . .

 

A     No, Named Person B . . . .

 

Q     . . .

 

A     No, Named Person B, [his] statements were targeted, and we
used them . . .  Named Person B, every time [he] was with us,
[he] knew we were using [his] statements.

Yet another officer
provides a similar answer to this question:

[translation]

 

Q     Did you . . . at the beginning of your relationship, if I can
call it that . . . as controller with Named Person B, discuss
possible avenues for Named Person B at the level, to help you out a bit
. . . .  Did you describe [him], did you say “OK, you’re a ‘source’,
special witness or co‑operating witness in any event”?

 

A     Me, I never spoke . . . .   Me, in my work
there, the status of Named Person B, [he] was always going to become a co‑operating
witness, become a witness in the case.  It was always that. 

 

. . .

 

Q     But did you not also answer [him] that, at any rate, in the
meantime, you are a “source”?

 

A     No.  No.  [He] was always regarded as . . . .  In my
mind, [he] was going to testify.  It was a surprise when we learned that [he]
would not be testifying.  It was a surprise. 

In other words, none of
the officers involved failed to give B a straight answer about whether he was a
confidential source because there were no such discussions and the very idea of
B being or becoming a source never even crossed their minds. 

[103]                     
In my view, it is not open to this Court on
appeal to draw any inference from this record that B inquired whether or not he
was a “source” and did not receive a straight answer. Such an inference
is not only contrary to the evidence which the application judge accepted but
it is also contrary to the judge’s express finding of fact that the SQ did
nothing that could have led B to believe that he would become a confidential
police source.

[104]                     
My colleague also, in my respectful view,
oversteps the bounds of appellate review with respect to the issue of alleged
police promises of confidentiality. On this, the application judge was alive to
and expressly noted that there was a lack of clarity and consistency in the
evidence. A review of the record shows that there were indeed some
inconsistencies in the police evidence on this issue and that the term
“confidential” was used in several different senses. The judge even interjected
during the testimony of an officer in order to clarify the sense in which the
officer was using the term confidential. 

[105]                     
The apparent confusion about what was or was not
confidential is evident in the police testimony. For example, an officer — in
the passage cited by my colleague Abella J. at para. 44 — states that if B does
not sign a contract, he will not have to testify and his statements will not be
used against him, implying a certain level of confidentiality. Later, however,
he testified to having on one occasion acted in a way that was inconsistent
with B being a confidential source and insisted that B is not a “source”
because with a “source” you cannot divulge his identity.  Similarly, another
officer is inconsistent in his testimony about confidentiality. While in the
passage cited by my colleague at para. 45, the officer states that B’s
statements were “always confidential”, he also testifies to the fact that B was
never a police informer nor a confidential “source”.  On the other hand, the
evidence of another officer consistently contrasts B’s situation with that of a
police informer — whose identity and statements must be kept secret — and
states that there was no confidentiality. 

[106]                     
Sorting this out was the job of the application
judge, not of an appellate court.  The judge adverted to this issue (among
others) and made findings that the evidence showed that B in this case could
not be at the same time a police informer and prosecution witness, that the police
had consistently manifested the intention to call B as a witness and that the
police had never let B understand that he would become a confidential police
informer. There is in my view no basis to interfere with these clear findings.

[107]                     
With those matters in mind, I turn to the remaining issues.

B.     Did the Application Judge Fail
to Consider Whether a Promise of Confidential Informer Status Could Be Implicit
in This Case?

[108]                     
My colleague Abella J. finds that the
application judge’s ruling ought to be quashed because he did not consider
whether a promise of confidential informer status could be implicit. 
Respectfully, I do not agree that the judge failed to consider the question. 
Several considerations lead me to this view.

[109]                     
The judge was alive to B’s dealings with other
police agencies.  Having heard that evidence, however, he found as a fact that
the evidence in the case required that B’s dealings with the SQ be considered
differently.  The judge referred to several differences in support of this
conclusion, which is amply supported by the evidence. 

[110]                     
B had contacted the police for the purpose of
providing them with information.    During the initial encounter with the SQ, B
was taken into custody and arrested for his crime.  As I have reviewed above, B
made a number of statements.  While in some cases, B was promised that the
statements would not be used as evidence against B, in many cases it was made
perfectly clear to B, and B clearly understood, that they could be used as
evidence in court against others.  That use of B’s statements, of
course, is completely inconsistent with any notion that B’s identity as the
supplier of that information would remain confidential.  In short, the dealings
with the SQ consisted of plea bargaining and protracted negotiations of a
possible co-operating witness contract, which contemplated B testifying for the
Crown in public trials.

[111]                     
These considerations lead me to the view that
the application judge did not fail to consider whether a promise of
confidential informer status could be implicit.  Rather, the judge was careful
to consider whether any promise was made implicitly as well as
explicitly, even though B’s evidence was solely to the effect that the SQ had
made repeated explicit promises. This was the sole basis for his professed
belief that he had informer status. In any event, as I will discuss in the next
section, the existence of a supposed “implicit promise” was never a live issue
on this record. 

C.     Is There a Live Issue on This Record as to Whether There
may Have Been an Implicit Promise of Informer Privilege by the SQ?

[112]                     
I see no basis on this record for thinking that
a reasonable person in the position of B would or could reasonably think his
identity as the supplier of the information would remain confidential.  This
point requires considerable reference to the record as well as to the judge’s
findings of fact.

[113]                     
To begin, it is critical to understand B’s own
evidence before the judge.  B consistently maintained that he had received
numerous, explicit promises from the SQ that he had the status of a
confidential informer pending the negotiation of his “co‑operating
witness” contract.  B’s position in his testimony was never that his perception
of the SQ’s actions led him to believe that his identity was protected.  According
to B’s own testimony, the supposed understanding of the obligation of
confidentiality arose solely from express promises to that effect by officers
of the SQ.  

[114]                     
During the application hearing, the appellant
was very clear about the basis upon which he claimed informer privilege: The
police had explicitly promised him informer privilege status.  Indeed,
at the beginning of his testimony, B indicated asking the SQ what his status
would be shortly after the beginning of his co-operation.  According to him,
this is what happened:

[translation]

 

[B]  Then, after that, I spoke with the police about . . .
. “What will my status be?  Are you going to sign me to a contract?  Are you
going to sign me . . . .”  “No, before the contract Named Person B,
everything you tell me will remain confidential.  There are always
. . . .  There are 3 types of status: a ‘source’, a special witness
or you’re a co‑operating witness.”  OK.  “So now, for now, you’re a
‘source’.”  “Oh yeah?”  “Yeah, so everything you tell us now, for us it’s
. . . you have no charges now, so we take it and that’s all.” 

 

[115]                     
He added that for some months after his first
contact with the SQ, he was regularly told by SQ officers that they could not
tell him whether or not he would be retained as a co-operating witness, but
that, in any event, he was a confidential informer in the meantime:

[translation]

 

[B]  They said: “. . . [W]e can’t say you’re a special witness,
we don’t know that Named Person B, you aren’t a co-operating witness, we don’t
know that.  So you’re a ‘source’”.

[116]                     
Later in his testimony, the appellant identified
the individuals who allegedly expressly told him that he would be considered a
confidential informer until his co-operating witness candidacy was settled.

[117]                     
Never in his testimony did the appellant suggest
that his understanding of his alleged confidential status had its origins in
anything other than repeated express promises by the SQ.  B never suggested in
evidence that his dealings with the SQ had given the impression that he had that
status.  All of the SQ officers testified that not only had no such promises
ever been made but that the possibility of B becoming a confidential informer
had never been discussed with B or considered by them.

[118]                     
The application judge made clear findings of fact
regarding the probative value that he attached to the appellant’s testimony. 
He found that it lacked credibility, and that the appellant himself had always,
since his first meeting with the SQ, understood that he would testify in the
trial of other individuals (and therefore his identity could necessarily not
remain confidential).  This is consistent with the numerous cautions given to
the appellant in relation to the many statements given to the SQ.  The
application judge further found that the appellant’s request for informer
privilege was essentially a vain attempt by a disgruntled individual to get
back at the Crown and the SQ for the unfair treatment he believed he had
experienced in relation to his desire to become a co-operating witness.  The judge
found as a fact that it was only after B was asked to renounce any intention to
claim informer privilege that B started to claim the status of confidential
informer.  Moreover, as noted, the judge also found as a fact that the SQ never
did anything that could have allowed B to understand that he was or might be a
confidential police informer. In short, the application judge disbelieved the
bulk of the appellant’s version of facts, including his allegation that an
explicit promise had been made to him.  Significantly, the appellant does not
contest the application judge’s devastating findings of credibility regarding
his testimony. 

[119]                     
In addition to rejecting the centrepiece of the
appellant’s version of facts, the application judge found as a matter of fact
that the SQ officers had always had in mind to have the
appellant testify and that they had never intended to
make him a confidential informer.  This corresponds largely to what the SQ
officers who testified said and is, in my view, a perfectly defensible finding
of fact, on the record before us.  

[120]                     
To sum up, the appellant’s own testimony was
clear and unequivocal that the claim of informer privilege arose solely from
alleged express promises — promises which the application judge concluded had
never been made.  Moreover, the judge accepted police evidence that there was never
even any thought of making B a confidential informer and that they did
nothing that could let B understand that he had that status. The judge also
found that it was some years after B’s initial dealings with the SQ that B
started to claim the status of a confidential police informer. These findings
leave no room for the imputed or implied promise theory.  

[121]                     
Moreover, as I touched on earlier, we know that
SQ officers arrested the appellant for his criminal activity soon after their
first meeting.  The appellant was cautioned and specifically informed that
anything he would say could be used against him in a court of law.  We also
know that throughout his relationship with the SQ, his statements were
generally accompanied by a warning that either the evidence could be used
against him, or, at the very least, that it could be used in the trial of
others.  The record discloses that the appellant understood this.

[122]                     
Indeed, when cross-examined by the Crown, the
appellant clearly stated that he understood that his first statements to the SQ
could be used against him and entered into evidence in a public trial:

[translation]

 

Q     So you, when they tell you “it can be used as evidence against
you”, what do you understand that to mean?

 

A     Well, it can be used as evidence against me.  That’s what I
understand; it’s clear.

 

Q     In what context can it be used as evidence against you?

 

A     Well, it can be used as evidence against me.  What do you want
me to say? . . .

 

Q     During what?  During the trial?  During a public trial? 
So it means that that statement will be used if they say. . . . 

 

A     Exactly.  Yes, Yes.  

 

Q     Do you understand that clearly?

 

A     Yes.  Yes.  [Emphasis added.]

[123]                     
And later, again during his testimony on
cross-examination, the Crown attorney read to the appellant a portion of the
transcript of one of his interviews conducted after his arrest by the SQ. 
Therein, an SQ officer explained to the appellant that he had a right to
counsel and that anything he would say could be used as evidence in an eventual
trial.  The Crown attorney then asked the appellant if he had properly
understood what the SQ had told him:

[translation]

 

Q     You understood clearly what you were told at that time?  You
knew that it could be used . . . .

 

A     Yes.

 

Q     . . . as evidence in court?

 

A     Yes.  Yes.

 

[124]                     
Not only did the appellant understand that the
statements he gave the SQ could be used against him, he even stated that he
hoped, at first, to get a co-operating witness contract precisely because he
hoped they would not be if he acquired that status:

[translation]

 

Q     Did, did you hope to have a co‑operating witness
contract?

 

A     At first, I hoped to have one, because I didn’t want my
statements to be held against me, since . . . .

 

. . .

 

Yes,
I hoped to at first.  But then, they kept on telling me: “No, Named Person B,
we’ll cross that bridge when we get there.” [Emphasis added.]

 

[125]                     
On account of this evidence, it appears to me
that the application judge did not err in deciding that the appellant
understood that the information he provided the SQ could be used in public
trials and that his identity as the purveyor of that information would not
remain confidential, and therefore that he did not benefit from informer
privilege in regard to that information.  The SQ had
told him that at the time of their first contact with B and reiterated it when
he started making his statements.  

[126]                     
In any event, even had he had such an
expectation, this expectation as well as any belief that the police had acted
on it and guaranteed him confidentiality would have been unreasonable.  Indeed,
the very fact that he was cautioned several times that his statements could at
the very least be entered into evidence against others in public trials is
fundamentally incompatible with an expectation or belief in a guarantee of
confidentiality.  

[127]                     
My colleague Abella J. mentions several elements
which she believes support her position that the appellant could have believed,
on reasonable grounds, that he benefited from informer privilege. 
Respectfully, I find none to be persuasive.

[128]                     
When he was formally charged and cautioned, he
would have known that everything he said from that point on could be used as
evidence in a court of law.  Being treated in that fashion by the police is
absolutely incompatible with any notion that it would have somehow led someone
to believe that his or her identity as the purveyor of statements to them would
be kept confidential.  B of course would have fully understood this.

[129]                     
 I have already discussed my colleague’s
suggestion that B repeatedly asked the SQ about his status and did not receive
a straight answer.  Neither the application judge’s conclusions nor the record
permit any such inference to be drawn.  I have also referred to the police
evidence about confidentiality; the application judge considered this evidence
and found that the SQ had done nothing that would allow B to infer that he was
a confidential police informer.  My colleague also places weight on some
documents to support the possibility that B thought he had been implicitly
promised confidential source status.  The reason that this cannot be so,
however, is that there is no evidence that B was even aware of them.  The
documents could therefore not bear on his belief.  The police officers who were
in a position to provide the appellant with confidential informer status
testified that they never had in mind to make the appellant a confidential
informer.  The only “status” he had with the SQ, in their mind, was that of an
individual in the process of becoming a co-operating witness.  This testimony
was accepted by the application judge.  

[130]                     
My colleague points to the fact that the appellant
was referred to as a source in two documents while having been named in many
others. My colleague concludes that this inconsistent treatment of B may have
led B to reasonably assume that he had confidential status with the SQ.
Respectfully, this is not an inference that is open on this record.  B never
suggested any such thing during his extensive testimony.  Moreover, there is no
evidence that this fact was known by the appellant at the relevant time and it
therefore cannot have given rise to any implied promise in the appellant’s
mind.  If this evidence is seen as undermining the SQ’s evidence that it never
considered giving B confidential source status, that use is directly contrary
to clear findings of fact by the application judge.  Finally, the evidence is
inconsequential placed in the correct factual context.  The appellant is
referred to by name in many documents and this is incompatible with the police
having an actual desire to keep his identity confidential.  The evidence of the
documents provides no basis to set aside the application judge’s finding of
fact that the SQ did not ever treat B as a confidential source.  The fact that
B was not aware of any of this at the time of course means that this could not
have given rise to any implied promise of confidentiality.  

[131]                     
Finally, counsel for the appellant made much of
the fact that the Crown tried to get the appellant to sign a document whereby
he would undertake not to seek to invoke informer privilege regarding the
information he had provided the SQ.  At the outset, it bears mentioning that
the document in question did not assume that the appellant was a confidential
informer.  Rather, it only asked the appellant to provide assurances that he
would not seek confidential informer status in the future.  In any
event, the evidence is clear that this initiative came from the Crown and not
the SQ.  While the Crown may have had its reasons to seek such assurances, I do
not think that this can be used, without supporting evidence, to conclude that
the SQ thought the appellant was a confidential informer or that it gave rise
to a reasonable belief that an implied promise of confidentiality had been
given. This point was fully considered by the application judge and rejected.

[132]                     
To conclude, I am of the view that the implicit
promise of confidentiality was never a live issue on this record.  

D.     Is the Application Judge’s Finding of Fact That B Actually
Knew That He Did Not Have Confidential Informer Status Fatal to B’s Claim? 


[133]                     
The application judge in effect found that B actually
knew that his identity was not protected with respect to the information
given to the SQ. My colleague maintains that there was no such finding, but I
respectfully disagree.  This finding, in my view, is supported by the evidence
and fatal to the suggestion that there could be some implied understanding to
the contrary.  To develop this point, I must touch first on some principles of
the law about confidential informers and then return to examine the application
judge’s findings.

[134]                     
The traditional view is that informer privilege
has “contract-like” elements of offer and acceptance.  The privilege arises
where a police officer promises protection and confidentiality to a prospective
informer in exchange for information.  In a clear case, confidentiality is
explicitly sought and agreed to:  R. v. Barros, 2011 SCC 51, [2011] 3
S.C.R. 368, at paras. 31-32; R. v. Basi, 2009 SCC 52, [2009] 3 S.C.R.
389, at para. 36.  This promise may be express or implied: Bisaillon,
at p. 105. While the subjective intent of the police may be relevant to
assessing the evidence, subjective intent on their part to confer the privilege
is not a necessary element of the test for whether the privilege has been
conferred.  All of the leading cases from this Court put this rule on this
“contract-like” basis.

[135]                     
I therefore agree with my colleague Abella J.
when she says that the test for whether there was an implicit promise of
confidentiality in this case is whether the police conduct would have led
someone in B’s position to believe, on reasonable grounds, that such a promise
had been made in exchange for the information provided.  There is thus both a
subjective and an objective element:  the alleged source must in fact believe
that confidentiality was promised in exchange for the information and that
belief must be reasonable, judged from the point of view of a reasonable person
in the alleged source’s position.  If there is such a belief and it is
reasonable, an implicit promise has been established.

[136]                     
I note that appellant’s counsel in this Court
agrees that the alleged source must believe that the protection has been
accorded. As appellant’s counsel put it, [translation]
“B’s belief and perception as to his status as an informer is of prime
importance”.    

[137]                     
I emphasize this fundamental point because I am
respectfully of the view that my colleague has lost sight of it in her
analysis.  My colleague spends much effort in trying to demonstrate that if B
had believed that he had been promised confidentiality, that belief would have
been reasonable.  I of course do not accept that contention.  But be that as it
may, the reasonableness of the belief of some hypothetical person in B’s
situation is not sufficient to establish the existence of the privilege unless
B also established that he actually believed that the implicit promise had been
made. There can be no such finding here and that is fatal to B’s claim.   

[138]                     
I repeat that B’s position in his extensive
testimony was never that there was some sort of implicit promise. B’s alleged
belief was based solely on alleged express — and repeated — promises of being
given confidential informer status.  There is no basis in fact to support the
conclusion that B in fact believed that he was an informer. Quite the contrary.

[139]                     
The judge correctly noted that the evidence
showed that in the circumstances of this case, B could not be at the same
time a prosecution witness and a police informer with respect to the
information given to the SQ.  The application judge also proceeded on the basis
that in the circumstances here, this would have been clear to B.  The
application judge makes repeated reference to B’s knowledge that he would be a
witness and to the cautions which he had heard and signed that made this
explicit.  This approach cannot be faulted and accords with the evidence.

[140]                     
  So far as I am aware, there is no hard and
fast rule that a confidential informer cannot become a witness to testify
regarding the very information he provided to police in confidence.  However,
as a practical matter, such situations would be extremely rare.  It is hard to
see how an informer could testify about certain things without making it
obvious that he was a source of the police knowledge about those things.  In
other words, such testimony could only rarely if at all be given without
creating a risk that the informer’s identity as the purveyor of the privileged
information would be discovered, an outcome, I would emphasize, the Crown is
under a legal obligation to do all in its power to avoid.  As a practical matter,
unless both the Crown and the witness agree to renounce it, informer
privilege must be seen as barring, for all practical purposes, the Crown from
calling an informer to testify at trial about the very information provided to
the police in confidence.  The two roles are almost invariably incompatible. 
Of course, a potential witness would fully understand this as it will generally
be obvious that the testimony will reveal the source of the information.   The
application judge, as noted, concluded that this was the situation in this
case. It is also important to remember that the application judge specifically
rejected B’s evidence that B was expressly promised the status of confidential
informer pending the decision about the possible co-operating witness contract.

[141]                     
Taking all of the evidence into account, the judge concluded that
B knew he was to be a witness in relation to the information
that he provided to the SQ and this necessarily required B to know that he was
not a confidential informer.  Moreover, and perhaps even more significantly,
the judge found that it was only some years after B’s first dealings with the
SQ and his being told that his evidence would not for the moment be required
that B’s behaviour gradually changed. The judge also found that it was only
after B was requested to sign the renunciation of any intention to claim
informer privilege and the unsuccessful negotiations with the witness
protection service that he asserted confidential informer status.  In short,
the judge concluded that B knew all along that he had no informer protection
and that B’s assertion to the contrary was an after-the-fact exercise of
obvious opportunism.

[142]                     
In my view, these clear and strong findings are
supported by a mountain of evidence, not the least of which is that B in his
testimony before the judge at no time suggested that his belief that informer
protection had been accorded depended on anything other than express promises
by members of the SQ to that effect.  The judge found, of course, that there
were no such express promises and indeed that the SQ officers did nothing that
would let B understand that any such promise was being made.  

[143]                     
  The judge’s conclusions that B actually knew
that he did not have informer privilege and that B’s claim of that status was
an after-the-fact exercise of opportunism make irrelevant any possibility that
some hypothetical person in B’s circumstances might have thought that the
promise was implicit.  B knew he had no such promise and provided the
information anyway.  B was a disappointed suitor for a potentially lucrative
co-operating witness contract and an opportunist, not a police informer.

[144]                     
To conclude on this point, B never claimed to
have a subjective belief that he had been promised confidentiality in exchange
for the information provided to the SQ on any basis other than express
promises. In light of the application judge’s findings, there is no evidence to
support the view that B in fact had any such subjective belief on any basis.
This, to my way of thinking, makes irrelevant what some hypothetical person in
B’s position might reasonably have believed.

[145]                     
In light of the record and the findings of fact
of the application judge in this case, there is, in my view, no reason to
interfere with the application ruling. However, I would underline that I share
the application judge’s view that the police and the prosecution could have
handled this matter in a more satisfactory manner. Nothing that I have said,
therefore, should be taken as undermining the importance of the police being
clear with potential sources about their status; quite the contrary. 

[146]                     
Police informer status plays an important role in the
investigation and prosecution of crimes. As this Court noted in Leipert,
at para. 10, “[t]he rule is of fundamental importance to the workings of a
criminal justice system”. In order for it to be effective, the protection
provided to police informers must be virtually inviolable, subject only to the
narrow innocence at stake exception. Indeed this Court has previously described
the privilege as “absolute”: Vancouver Sun, at para. 4.

[147]                     
Both the police and the public at large benefit from the
existence of this privilege because it encourages people to come forward to
assist in police investigations:

                           Police
work, and the criminal justice system as a whole, depend to some degree on the
work of confidential informers.  The law has therefore long recognized that
those who choose to act as confidential informers must be protected from the
possibility of retribution.  The law’s protection has been provided in the form
of the informer privilege rule, which protects from revelation in public or in
court of the identity of those who give information related to criminal matters
in confidence.  This protection in turn encourages cooperation with the
criminal justice system for future potential informers. 

 

(Vancouver Sun,
at para. 16)

[148]                     
Given the important role that informer status plays in the
detection and prosecution of crime, courts must not undermine its effectiveness
by condoning police actions which leave potential informers uncertain or
confused as to their status. Police actions which amount to deliberate attempts
to confuse a person about his status, or even inadvertent actions that have the
same effect, reduce confidence in the protection provided by informer
privilege. That reduced confidence discourages people with information about
criminal activity from reporting to the police, which erodes a powerful
investigative avenue. 

[149]                     
The application judge in this case was clearly alive to these
concerns, as he ought to have been, and reached the conclusions he did after a
careful and thorough review of all of the evidence. His decision should not be
disturbed.

[150]                     
I must now turn briefly to two further issues.

E.      Should a New Hearing Be Granted on the Basis That the
Application Judge Failed to Pay Heed to the Principles Established by Our Court
in R. v. Basi?

[151]                     
The Other Individuals submit that the
application judge did not follow the principles established in Basi and
therefore disregarded their rights to full answer and defence.  However, as I
find that the appellant does not benefit from informer privilege, the Other
Individuals would be entitled to whatever relevant discloseable evidence came
out of the SQ’s dealings with the appellant.  It follows that any procedural
failings on the part of the application judge, if there were such, did not in
the end prejudice the Other Individuals.  

F.  Would Any Privilege Have
Been Lost Through Disclosure of B’s Identity?

[152]                     
The Other Individuals submit that even if the
privilege arose, it would have been lost through disclosure of B’s identity.  
As in my view, the privilege did not arise, I do not have to address this
issue. I simply note that it seems to me that this issue would have to be
decided if one were of the view that the privilege may have indeed arisen.

IV.  Disposition

[153]                     
I would dismiss the appeal with no order as to
costs.

                    English
version of the judgment of the Court delivered orally by

[1]                            
Wagner J. — The Crown appeals from a judgment in which the Quebec Court
of Appeal reversed the trial judge’s decision and acquitted the respondent of
dangerous operation of his motor vehicle and of thereby causing bodily harm to
Michel Bisson and the death of Michel Rostand, contrary to s. 249  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 .

[2]                            
It is common ground that passing on a double
line does not on its own suffice to establish the respondent’s criminal
liability.  All the circumstances of the case must be considered.

[3]                            
The trial judge made no fatal error in finding
the respondent guilty.

[4]                            
She took the relevant factors and all the
circumstances into account.

[5]                            
The Court of Appeal’s intervention was therefore
not warranted.

[6]                            
For these reasons, the appeal is allowed.  The
judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal dated September 8, 2011 is set aside,
the judgment of the Court of Québec dated September 14, 2010 is restored, and
the case is remanded to the Court of Québec in the judicial district of
Baie-Comeau for sentencing submissions.

                    Judgment accordingly.

2013 SCC 4

File No.:  34720.

2012:  December 6; 2013:  January 24.

Present:  McLachlin C.J. and Fish, Abella, Rothstein,
Moldaver, Karakatsanis and Wagner JJ.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

                    Criminal
law — Appeals — Trial judge convicting accused of several charges involving
physical and sexual abuse — Court of Appeal setting aside convictions and
ordering new trial — Whether appeal raises question of law — Whether Court of
Appeal erred in setting aside convictions and ordering new trial.

 

                    Held
(Fish J. dissenting):  The motion to quash the appeal should be dismissed.
 The appeal should be allowed and the convictions should be restored. 

 

                    Per McLachlin C.J.
and Abella, Rothstein, Moldaver, Karakatsanis and Wagner JJ.:  The trial
judge did not apply wrong legal principles in assessing the reliability of the
complainant’s evidence or in his application of the burden of proof. This
appeal raises a question of law, namely whether the trial judge was required to
self-instruct on the dangers of convicting because the complainant’s evidence
related to events from the distant past; suffered from various frailties; and
stood alone where confirmatory evidence might reasonably have been expected to
exist.

 

                    Per
Fish J. (dissenting):  The reasons of the majority in the Court of Appeal
contain no assertion — either express or implied — that the trial judge was
required as a matter of law to self-instruct on the dangers mentioned by
Justice Karakatsanis.  Moreover, the dissent in the Court of Appeal is not
based on any disagreement, real or imputed, with the majority’s reasons
regarding self-instruction. Rather, it relates to questions of fact or, at
best, questions of mixed fact and law. Pursuant to s. 693(1) (a) of
the Criminal Code , the Crown may only appeal to this Court on any
question of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents, which plainly
is not the case here.

                    The
judgment of McLachlin C.J. and Abella, Rothstein, Moldaver, Karakatsanis and
Wagner JJ. was delivered by

[1]                             
Karakatsanis J. — We are satisfied, for the reasons of
Laskin J.A., that the trial judge did not err, and more particularly, did not
apply wrong legal principles in assessing the reliability of the complainant’s
evidence or in his application of the burden of proof.

[2]                             
The majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal
found that the approach taken by the trial judge in assessing the complainant’s
evidence was based on wrong legal principles (2012 ONCA 117, 288 O.A.C. 164). 
In particular, the majority held that in the circumstances of this case, the
trial judge was required to self-instruct on the dangers of convicting because
the complainant’s evidence related to events from the distant past; suffered
from various frailties; and stood alone where confirmatory evidence might
reasonably have been expected to exist, and his failure to do so constituted a
legal error.

[3]                             
Laskin J.A. disagreed.  In his view, the issue
of whether to self-instruct in this manner was discretionary on the part of the
trial judge and there was no requirement that he do so as a matter of law.  We
agree with his assessment of the matter.  Viewed in that light, his dissenting
reasons raise a question of law:  see R. v. J.M.H., 2011 SCC 45, [2011]
3 S.C.R. 197, at paras. 29-30.

[4]                             
The respondent’s motion to quash the appeal is
dismissed.  The appeal is allowed and the convictions are restored, for the
reasons of Laskin J.A.

                    The following
are the reasons delivered by 

[5]                             
Fish J. (dissenting) — Unlike Justice Karakatsanis, and with the greatest
of respect, I would grant the respondent’s motion to quash this appeal.  

[6]                             
My colleague writes:

. . . the majority [in the Court of
Appeal] held that in the circumstances of this case, the trial judge was
required to self-instruct on the dangers of convicting because the
complainant’s evidence related to events from the distant past; suffered from
various frailties; and stood alone where confirmatory evidence might reasonably
have been expected to exist, and his failure to do so constituted a legal
error. [Emphasis added; para. 2.]

[7]                             
I have three observations in this regard.

[8]                             
First, I am unable to find in the reasons of the
majority any assertion ― express or implied ― that the trial judge
was required as a matter of law to self-instruct on the dangers mentioned by my
colleague.  

[9]                             
Rather, Blair J.A., speaking for the majority,
merely described as “sensible” the “idea that trial judges should consider the
‘need to self-instruct on the frailties of evidence concerning events
from the distant past’ . . . for all of the reasons summarized in McGrath”
(2012 ONCA 117, 288 O.A.C. 164, at para. 41; citing R. v. McGrath,
[2000] O.J. No. 5735 (QL) (S.C.J.), at paras. 11-15 (emphasis added)). 

[10]                         
Moreover, there is no dispute that the factors
set out by my colleague are all present in this case.  And I agree that it is
sensible, as Justice Blair held, for trial judges to “consider the need to
self-instruct” on the frailties of the evidence in cases where these factors
are likewise present.

[11]                         
My second observation is that nothing in the
reasons of Laskin J.A., the dissenting justice in the Court of Appeal, suggests
that he was of a different view in this regard. On the contrary, Justice Laskin
agreed that it may be sensible for trial judges to consider the need to
self-instruct in such cases, but added that they are not legally required to do
so expressly (paras. 70-71). 

[12]                         
Justice Blair did not say that they were. 
Rather, as we have seen, he simply found it logical or prudent ―
“sensible”, as he put it ― for trial judges to consider the
need for a self-instruction of this sort. He then took care to add that “[e]ach
case will depend upon its own circumstances”, and made plain that he did “not
mean to suggest that some type of formal instruction need necessarily be given”
(para. 41).  

[13]                         
Justice Blair’s ensuing statement confirms, in
my view, that an express self-instruction was not legally required by
the majority in the court below, even where the factors mentioned by Justice
Karakatsanis are present, as in this case.

[14]                         
What is required, the majority held, is
that “the trial judge’s reasons should demonstrate that he or she is alert to
the frailties of, and the risks associated with, such evidence, and to the need
to address it with that careful scrutiny” ― and, even then, only “[w]here
. . . there are objective reasons to scrutinize carefully the
reliability of a witness whose testimony is central to the proof of guilt”
(para. 41 (emphasis added)). 

[15]                         
This was so in the present case, according to
Justice Blair, and applied as well “in this type of case generally” (para. 41).

[16]                         
On a fair reading of these passages, and with
respect, I am unable to agree with Justice Karakatsanis that the majority in
the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge was legally required  “to
self-instruct on the dangers of convicting because the complainant’s evidence
related to events from the distant past; suffered from various frailties; and
stood alone where confirmatory evidence might reasonably have been expected to
exist”.  

[17]                         
My third observation ― in itself
dispositive of the present appeal ― is this: Justice Laskin’s dissent was
not based on his disagreement, real or imputed, with the majority’s
reasons regarding self-instruction by the trial judge in this case, or
self-instruction by trial judges generally in cases of this sort.  That is
apparent both from the Order of the Court of Appeal and, perhaps more
significantly, from Justice Laskin’s own reasons.

[18]                         
According to the Order:

        THIS COURT ORDERS
that the appeal is allowed and a new trial ordered. 

 

        THE HONOURABLE
JUSTICE LASKIN DISSENTING HELD that the learned trial judge did not err in
his approach to the assessment of the reliability of the [complainant]’s
evidence.  Further, he held that the trial judge did not err in holding that
the absence of police and school records corroborating the [complainant]’s
evidence that she had reported that sexual abuse had taken place did not create
a reasonable doubt when weighed against the other evidence of the complainant. 
Accordingly he would have dismissed the appeal.  [A.R., vol. I, at p. 106]

[19]                         
The Order of the Court of Appeal is in full
conformity with Justice Laskin’s expressly stated reasons for disagreeing with
the majority.  He sets out the grounds of his dissent in these terms:

I
have read the reasons of my colleague, Blair J.A.  He would allow the appeal,
set aside the convictions and order a new trial.  He would do so for two
reasons.  First, he concludes that the trial judge did not properly assess the
reliability of the complainant’s evidence.  Second, he concludes that the trial
judge failed to consider whether the absence of documentary evidence that might
have corroborated the complainant’s evidence gave rise to a reasonable doubt. 

 

I
respectfully disagree with both of these conclusions.  Throughout his lengthy
reasons, the trial judge considered not just the credibility, but the
reliability of the complainant’s evidence.  Indeed, at several points he did so
expressly.  He addressed various concerns about the complainant’s testimony
that bore on the accuracy of her evidence.  And, perhaps most important, he
held that it would be unsafe to act on two of the alleged incidents of sexual
abuse and disregarded the complainant’s evidence of those incidents.  He did so
not because he found her evidence lacking in credibility, but because he found
that her evidence on those two incidents was not sufficiently reliable. 

 

The
trial judge also considered the effect of the absence of police and school
records, but remained convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the appellant’s
guilt on the basis of the complainant’s evidence.  That was his call to make. 
I would dismiss the appeal. [paras. 64-66] 

[20]                         
Neither the Order of the Court of Appeal nor the
reasons of Justice Laskin are capable of supporting the Crown’s submission that
this appeal raises a question of law.  The grounds of Justice Laskin’s dissent
raise questions of fact or, at best, questions of mixed fact and law.

[21]                         
Pursuant to s. 693(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , the Crown may only appeal to this Court “on any
question of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents”, which
plainly is not the case here. 

[22]                         
With respect for those who are of a different
view, I would therefore quash this appeal for want of jurisdiction.

allowed, Fish J. dissenting.

to kill her husband.  She gave $2,000, an address and a picture of her
husband to the officer.  She was arrested and charged with counselling the
commission of an offence not committed contrary to s. 464 (a) of the
Criminal Code .  The trial judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
that the requisite elements of the offence were established.  The only issue at
trial was whether the defence of duress applied.  The trial judge accepted R’s
evidence that the sole reason for her actions was intense and reasonable fear
arising from her husband’s threats of death and serious bodily harm to herself
and their daughter.  The trial judge found that the common law defence of duress
applied and acquitted R.  On appeal, for the first time, the Crown argued that
duress was not available to R in law. The Court of Appeal upheld the acquittal. 

                    Held (Fish J. dissenting in part):  The
appeal should be allowed and the proceedings should be stayed. 

                    Per
McLachlin C.J. and LeBel, Deschamps, Abella, Rothstein, Cromwell, Moldaver
and Karakatsanis JJ.:  The
defence of duress is only available when a person commits an offence while
under compulsion of a threat made for the purpose of compelling him or her to
commit the offence.  This was not R’s situation and the defence of duress was
not available to her.  If an accused is threatened without compulsion, his or
her only defence is self‑defence.

                    The Court of Appeal erred in law
in finding that there was no principled basis upon which to exclude R from
relying on the defence of duress.  Although the defences of duress and self‑defence
are both based on the idea of normative involuntariness and both apply where
the accused acted in response to an external threat, significant differences
between these defences justify maintaining a meaningful juridical difference
between them.  The rationale underlying each defence is profoundly distinct.  Duress,
like the defence of necessity, is an excuse.  The act, usually committed
against an innocent third party, remains wrong but the law excuses those who
commit the act in a morally involuntary manner, where there was realistically
no choice but to commit the act. Self‑defence, in contrast, is a
justification based on the principle that it is lawful in defined circumstances
to resist force or a threat of force with force.  The victim, also the
attacker, is the author of his or her own misfortune.  Generally, the
justification of self‑defence ought to be more readily available than the
excuse of duress.  Thus, if infliction of harm on
a person who threatened or attacked the accused is not justified by the law of
self‑defence, it would be curious if the accused’s response would
nonetheless be excused by the more restrictive law of duress.  Duress, which is an amalgam of statutory
and common law elements, cannot be extended to apply where the accused meets
force with force in situations where self-defence is not available.  Duress is, and must remain, an applicable defence only in situations
where the accused has been compelled to commit a specific offence under threats
of death or bodily harm. 

                    This
appeal underlines the need for further clarification of the law of duress.  The
statutory version of the defence applies to principals and the common law to
parties.  The statutory version of the offence also excludes a long list of
offences from its operation.  Nonetheless, the defence of duress, in its
statutory and common law forms, is largely the same and both forms share the
following common elements: there must be an explicit or implicit threat of
present or future death or bodily harm — this threat can be directed at the
accused or a third party; the accused must reasonably believe that the threat
will be carried out; there must be no safe avenue of escape,
evaluated on a modified objective standard; there must be a close temporal
connection between the threat and the harm threatened; there must be proportionality
between the harm threatened and the harm inflicted by the accused, also
evaluated on a modified objective standard; and the accused cannot be a party
to a conspiracy or association whereby he or she is subject to compulsion and
actually knew that threats and coercion to commit an offence were a
possible result of this criminal activity, conspiracy or association. 

                    The circumstances of this case are
exceptional and warrant a stay of proceedings.  Although the appeal should be
allowed, it would not be fair to subject R to another trial.  The abuse she
suffered and the protracted nature of these proceedings have taken an enormous
toll on her.  The law of duress was unclear which made resort to the defence at
trial unusually difficult.  Furthermore, the Crown changed its position about
the applicable law between the trial and appeal process, raising a serious risk
that the consequences of decisions made during the
conduct of R’s defence cannot be undone in the context of a new trial. 

                    Per Fish J. (dissenting
in part):  The defence of duress was not available to R and the acquittal must
be set aside.  However, a judicial stay of proceedings is not warranted on the
record.  A stay is a drastic remedy of last resort and available only in the
clearest of cases.  These criteria are not satisfied.  A new trial should be
ordered, leaving it to the Crown to decide whether the public interest requires
a new trial in the particular circumstances of the case.

I.       Introduction

[1]                             
This appeal raises a novel question: may a wife,
whose life is threatened by her abusive husband, rely on the defence of duress
when she tries to have him murdered? The Nova Scotia courts concluded that she
may and acquitted the respondent, Nicole Ryan, of counselling the commission of
her husband’s murder. The Crown appeals. 

[2]                             
As we see it, the defence of duress is available
when a person commits an offence while under compulsion of a threat made for
the purpose of compelling him or her to commit it. That was not Ms. Ryan’s
situation. She wanted her husband dead because he was threatening to kill her
and her daughter, not because she was being threatened for the purpose of
compelling her to have him killed. That being the case, the defence of duress
was not available to her, no matter how compelling her situation was viewed in
a broader perspective. It is also our view, however, that the uncertainty
surrounding the law of duress coupled with the Crown’s change of position
between trial and appeal created unfairness to Ms. Ryan’s defence in this case.
As a result, we would allow the appeal and enter a stay of proceedings. 

[3]                             
The appeal presents an opportunity to bring more
clarity to the law of duress in Canadian criminal law. Some of the relevant law
is statutory, but aspects of the provisions have been found to be
unconstitutional.  Other aspects of the relevant law are judge-made. The
patchwork quilt nature of the present law has given rise to significant
uncertainty about the parameters of both the statutory and common law elements
of the defence and the relationship between them.  In relation to this larger
issue, our view is that the common law and statutory versions of the defence
may be substantially harmonized in the manner we will set out in detail later in
our reasons.

II.  Overview of Facts and
Proceedings

A.  Facts

[4]                             
The respondent, Nicole Ryan, has been the victim
of a violent, abusive and controlling husband.  She believed that he would
cause her and their daughter serious bodily harm or death as he had threatened
to do many times.  

[5]                             
In September of 2007, she began to think about
having her husband murdered. Over the course of the next seven months, she
spoke to at least three men whom she hoped would kill him. In December 2007 or
January 2008, she paid one man $25,000 to carry out the killing, but he then
refused, demanding more compensation. She approached another person and was
contacted by a third, an undercover RCMP officer, posing as a “hit man”. On
March 27, 2008, she met with this individual and agreed to pay him to kill her
husband. The agreed upon price was $25,000, with $2,000 paid in cash that day.
The killing was to take place the coming weekend. Later that same night, she
provided an address and a picture of her husband to the “hit man”. Shortly
after, she was arrested and charged with counselling the commission of an
offence not committed contrary to s. 464 (a) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 .

[6]                             
At trial, there was no issue that the elements
of the offence had been proved and the trial judge, Farrar J. (as he then was),
indicated that he was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the requisite
elements of the offence of counselling the commission of an offence had been
established. He based this conclusion on the respondent’s admission that the
Crown had proved a prima facie case and on the audio and video tapes of
recorded conversations with the undercover officer and a statement made on
arrest (trial judge’s reasons, at paras. 4-6). The only issue at trial was
whether the respondent’s otherwise criminal acts were excused because of
duress. The accused had raised that the common law defence of duress applied.
The Crown argued that on the facts of this case, the components of
duress were not present.  But it did not argue at trial, as it did later on
appeal, that the defence of duress was not available in law to the
respondent (transcript, at pp. 22-23; trial judgment, 2010 NSSC 114 (CanLII), at
paras. 7-8). 

[7]                             
The trial judge accepted the respondent’s
evidence that the relationship and the events she had described relating to
that relationship were true. For example, Mr. Ryan’s violent and threatening
behaviour included outbursts at least once a week, where he would throw things
at the respondent’s head, physically assault her and threaten to kill her (trial
judgment, at para. 17).  The respondent testified that Mr. Ryan often told
her that he would kill her and their daughter if she ever tried to leave him
(para. 33), and that he would “burn the fucking house down” while she and her
daughter were inside (para. 45). 

[8]                             
The trial judge had no difficulty in concluding
that Mr. Ryan was a manipulative, controlling and abusive husband who sought to
control the actions of the respondent, be they social, familial or marital. The
judge found that the respondent’s sole reason for her actions was her fear of
her husband which arose from his threats of death and serious bodily harm to
herself and their daughter (paras. 149-52). He also was satisfied that the
respondent had led evidence to the requisite standard that she reasonably
believed that Mr. Ryan would cause her and her daughter serious bodily injury
and that there was no safe avenue of escape other than having him killed.  

[9]                             
The judge concluded that the respondent was in a
very vulnerable state, had lost a considerable amount of weight, was
dissociated and despondent. She had an intense and reasonable fear of Mr. Ryan,
was feeling helpless, felt she had lost control and felt she was threatened
with annihilation. While she had engaged the police and other agencies in an
effort to assist her in the past, the evidence was that her problems were
viewed as a “civil matter”.  She felt so vulnerable that the phone call of the
undercover police officer appeared to her as the solution to all her problems
(para. 73). On the basis of these findings, the trial judge found that the
common law defence of duress applied, and acquitted the accused.

[10]                         
The Crown appealed but the Court of Appeal
unanimously upheld the trial judge’s verdict of acquittal. On the appeal, for
the first time, the Crown took the position that duress was not available in
law as a defence to the respondent on these facts. Duress, the Crown contended,
applies only when an accused is forced by threats to commit an offence against
a third party (2011 NSCA 30, 301 N.S.R. (2d) 255, at para. 56). MacDonald
C.J.N.S. (Saunders and Oland JJ.A. concurring) rejected the Crown’s submission.
Simply put, the Court of Appeal found that the focus of the defence of duress
is to absolve an accused of criminal liability when his or her conduct is
morally involuntary. Therefore, the analysis should focus on the accused’s
predicament and not on who did what to whom in who’s presence. It followed that
the respondent should not be denied the defence of duress simply because the
victim was not a third party, but the aggressor. The court saw no principled
basis to justify a distinction between the aggressor as opposed to a third
party being the targeted victim.

[11]                         
The court reviewed the case law in this area
which emphasizes the need for triers of fact to fully understand the plight of
battered spouses who, having reacted to threats from their abusive partners,
rely on the defence of duress. MacDonald C.J.N.S. also highlighted the need for
the defence to be sufficiently flexible, when appropriate, to accommodate the
dark reality of spousal abuse. 

III.    Analysis

A.     Issues

[12]                         
The appeal raises three issues:

1.         Is
duress available in law as a defence where the threats made against the accused
were not made for the purpose of compelling the commission of an offence?

2.         If
not, and the appeal must therefore be allowed, what order should be made and,
in particular, in the unusual circumstances of this case, should a stay of
proceedings be entered?

3.         Can
the law of duress be clarified and how?

B.     Is Duress a Possible Defence?

[13]                         
The Crown asserted that the defence of duress is
not open to the accused, on the facts of this case. The Court of Appeal
reasoned that, if the respondent had herself attacked her husband, self-defence
would represent a potential avenue of defence (para. 99).  The court saw “no
principled basis to justify a distinction between the aggressor as opposed to a
third party being the targeted victim” (para. 99). In other words, while duress
has traditionally applied where the person making the threat and the victim are
different, this fact does not justify restricting duress to that sort of
situation. As the Court of Appeal commented, it would be “ironic” that the
respondent might have a defence of self-defence if she had attacked her husband
herself, but no defence where she responded to the same threat by hiring
someone else to kill him (para. 99). In short, the Court of Appeal thought it
appropriate to develop the common law of duress in order to fill a gap in the
law of self-defence.

[14]                         
The Crown argues that the Court of Appeal
wrongly held that there was no principled basis for refusing to extend the
defence of duress to cover these facts. In order to address this argument, we
need to review the state of the common law defence of duress.

[15]                         
We begin our analysis with R. v. Hibbert,
[1995] 2 S.C.R. 973, which touched on the question of the differences and
relationship between duress, necessity and self-defence. One of the issues in
Hibbert was whether the common law defence of duress incorporated the
requirement that no “safe avenue of escape” be available to the accused. Lamer
C.J. approached this question by examining the juristic nature of the defence
of duress and its relationship to other common law defences (para. 46). This
led him to consider the relationship between self-defence, duress and
necessity.  

[16]                         
In this case, unlike in Hibbert, we must
resolve the question of whether the differences between duress and self-defence
justify maintaining a meaningful juridical difference between them. In our
view, and with great respect to the contrary view of the Court of Appeal, they
do. In other words, we conclude that the Court of Appeal erred in law when it
found that there is “no principled basis” upon which the respondent should be
excluded from relying on the defence of duress.

[17]                         
With respect to the relationship between duress
and necessity, Lamer C.J. in Hibbert concluded that the “the
similarities between the two defences are so great that consistency and logic
require that they be understood as based on the same juristic principles” and
that to do otherwise “would be to promote incoherence and anomaly in the
criminal law” (para. 54). Their common foundation is that both are excuses,
“based on the idea of normative involuntariness” (para. 54), as Dickson J. (as
he then was) had found in the case of the defence of necessity in Perka v.
The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 232. The relationship among duress and necessity
on one hand and self-defence on the other was less clear. All three apply in
“essentially similar” situations:  each is concerned with providing a defence
to what would otherwise be criminal conduct because the accused acted in
response to an external threat (para. 60). As the then Chief Justice explained
in Hibbert, 

                            [t]he
defences of self-defence, necessity and duress all arise under circumstances
where a person is subjected to an external danger, and commits an act that
would otherwise be criminal as a way of avoiding the harm the danger presents. 
[para. 50]

[18]                         
However, there are also significant differences
among the defences. As Lamer C.J. explained, 

a distinction can be drawn between
self-defence, on the one hand, and duress and necessity, on the other, that
might well provide a basis for a meaningful juridical difference. In cases of
self-defence, the victim of the otherwise criminal act at issue is himself or
herself the originator of the threat that causes the actor to commit
what would otherwise be an assault or culpable homicide . . . . In this sense,
he or she is the author of his or her own deserts, a factor which arguably
warrants special consideration in the law. In cases of duress and necessity,
however, the victims of the otherwise criminal act . . . are third parties,
who are not themselves responsible for the threats or circumstances of
necessity that motivated the accused’s actions. [Emphasis in original; para.
50.]

[19]                         
In this passage, the Chief Justice alludes to
two differences that “[may] well provide a basis for a meaningful juridical
difference” between duress and self-defence (para. 50). 

[20]                         
First, self-defence is based on the principle
that it is lawful, in defined circumstances, to meet force (or threats of
force) with force: “an individual who is unlawfully threatened or attacked must
be accorded the right to respond” (M. Manning and P. Sankoff, Manning
Mewett & Sankoff: Criminal Law (4th ed. 2009), at p. 532). The
attacker-victim is, as the Chief Justice put it, “the author of his or her own
deserts” (para. 50). On the other hand, in duress and necessity, the victim is
generally an innocent third party (see D. Stuart, Canadian Criminal Law: A
Treatise (6th ed. 2011), at p. 511). Second, in self-defence, the victim
simply attacks or threatens the accused; the motive for the attack or threats
is irrelevant. In duress, on the other hand, the purpose of the threat
is to compel the accused to commit an offence. To put it simply, self-defence
is an attempt to stop the victim’s threats or assaults by meeting force with
force; duress is succumbing to the threats by committing an offence.

[21]                         
However, these are not the only differences
between duress and self-defence. It seems to us that there are two other
significant differences which must be taken into account.

[22]                         
One is that self-defence is completely codified
by the provisions of the Criminal Code .  Thus, Parliament has established
the parameters of self-defence in their entirety. They are no longer found,
even in part, in the common law. Duress, on the other hand, is partly codified
and partly governed by judge-made law as preserved by s. 8(3) of the Code.


[23]                         
Another is that the underlying rationales of the
defences are profoundly distinct. The rationale underlying duress is that of
moral involuntariness, which was entrenched as a principle of fundamental
justice in R. v. Ruzic, 2001 SCC 24, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 687, at
para. 47: “It is a principle of fundamental justice that only voluntary
conduct — behaviour that is the product of a free will and controlled body,
unhindered by external constraints — should attract the penalty and stigma of
criminal liability.” It is upon this foundation that we build the defences of
duress and necessity. As Lamer C.J. put it in Hibbert, the
underlying concept of both defences is “normative involuntariness”, in other
words, that there is “no legal way out” (para. 55). While the test to be
met is not dictated by this generally stated rationale underlying the defence,
its requirements are heavily influenced by it. As was discussed in Perka,
defences built on the principle of moral involuntariness are classified as
excuses. The law excuses those who, although morally blameworthy, acted in a
morally involuntary manner. The act remains wrong, but the author of the
offence will not be punished because it was committed in circumstances in which
there was realistically no choice (Ruzic, at para. 34; Perka, at
p. 248). The principle of moral involuntariness is “[a] concessio[n] to human
frailty” in the face of “agonising choice” (Ruzic, at para. 40; Stuart,
at p. 490). The commission of the crime is “remorselessly compelled by normal
human instincts” (Perka, at p. 249). As LeBel J. put it in Ruzic:
“Morally involuntary conduct is not always inherently blameless” (para. 41).

[24]                         
Despite its close links to necessity and duress,
self-defence, on the other hand, is a justification (Perka, at pp. 246
and 269). It “challenges the wrongfulness of an action which technically
constitutes a crime” (Perka, at p. 246; see also H. Parent, Traité de
droit criminel (2nd ed. 2005), vol. 1, L’imputabilité, at pp. 587-88).
For different views, see S. G. Coughlan, “Duress, Necessity, Self-Defence and
Provocation: Implications of Radical Change?” (2002), 7 Can. Crim. L.R.
147, at p. 158; see also Manning and Sankoff, at p. 342, and K.
Roach, Criminal Law (4th ed. 2009), at p. 294. In determining
whether the defence is available, less emphasis is placed on the particular
circumstances and concessions to human frailty and more importance is attached
to the action itself and the reason why the accused was justified in meeting
force with force. 

[25]                         
We do not, for the present purpose, need to
delve too deeply into the distinction between justifications and excuses and
questions of exactly how and when the distinction is to be drawn in all cases.
For the purposes of this appeal, the distinction simply expresses an underlying
difference in principle between the two defences: while in a case of duress we
excuse an act that we still consider to be wrong, the impugned act in a case of
self-defence is considered right. The question then, is whether these
differences support a principled distinction between duress and self-defence.
In our view they do, for two main reasons.

[26]                         
Given the different moral qualities of the acts
involved, it is generally true that the justification of self-defence ought to
be more readily available than the excuse of duress. And so it is.  Unlike
duress, self-defence does not require that any course of action other than
inflicting the injury was “demonstrably impossible” or that there was “no other
legal way out”.  Under the former self-defence provisions, for example, a person
who is the victim of an unprovoked unlawful assault is entitled to use as much
force as is necessary to defend himself, provided he does not intend to cause
death or grievous bodily harm (s. 34(1); see Parent, pp. 605-6). Under the
recently adopted provisions in Bill C-26, self-defence is available in
circumstances in which a person believes on reasonable grounds that force is
being used against him or her and responds reasonably for the purpose of
self-defence (s. 34(1)).

[27]                         
Thus, if infliction of harm on a person who
threatened or attacked the accused is not justified by the law of self-defence,
it would be curious if the accused’s response would nonetheless be excused by
the more restrictive law of duress. For the sake of the coherence of the
criminal law, the defence of self-defence ought to be more readily available,
not less readily available, than the defence of duress in situations in which
the accused responds directly against the source of the threat. 

[28]                         
These distinctive underlying principles of self-defence
and duress take on added significance when we remember that in Canadian law,
self-defence is exhaustively codified, whereas duress is an amalgam of
statutory and common law elements.  This means that the courts must take care
not to use the flexibility of the common law to develop duress in ways that
circumvent limitations and restrictions imposed by Parliament on the defence of
self-defence. This would amount to judicial abrogation of parts of the Criminal
Code . The courts intervene to interpret and apply the statutory rules
governing self-defence, not to set them aside in the absence of a
constitutional challenge.

[29]                         
Duress cannot be extended so as to apply when
the accused meets force with force, or the threat of force with force in
situations where self-defence is unavailable. Duress is, and must remain, an
applicable defence only in situations where the accused has been compelled to
commit a specific offence under threats of death or bodily harm. This clearly
limits the availability of the offence to particular factual circumstances. The
common law elements of duress cannot be used to “fill” a supposed vacuum
created by clearly defined statutory limitations on self-defence.  

[30]                         
This is even clearer when one considers — as
explained above — the fundamental distinctions between both defences.  Not only
is one a justification and the other an excuse, but they also serve to avoid
punishing the accused in completely different situations. If, for example, the
accused was threatened with death or bodily harm without any element of
compulsion, his or her only remedy is self-defence. If, on the other hand, the
accused was compelled to commit a specific unlawful act under threat of death
or bodily harm, the available defence is duress. In a case where there was a
threat without compulsion, the accused cannot rely on duress simply because he
or she did not employ direct force and thus, was excluded from relying on the
self-defence provisions of the Code. As Glanville Williams’ latest
editor, Dennis J. Baker, wrote about the availability of “pure” duress (as
opposed to duress of circumstances, which is an entirely different defence):
“On principle, the offence must be one expressly or impliedly ordered by the
villain, the order being backed up by his threat. (Or the defendant must have
believed that.) . . . As a matter of justice the defence should only be
available where the defendant commits a crime that he has been directly coerced
to commit” (Textbook of Criminal Law (3rd ed. 2012), at paras. 25-037
and 25-039).

[31]                         
Consider the result arrived at by the Court of
Appeal in this case. The respondent responded to threats against her and her
child of bodily harm and death in ways which, in the view of the Court of
Appeal, would not entitle her to rely on the defence of self-defence. We add
that the appeal to the Court was also presented on the assumption that
self-defence was not potentially open to the respondent on these facts.  For
the purposes of these reasons, we do not need to decide this point. If this is
the case, the extension of the law of duress to meet the respondent’s situation
has made the law incoherent at the level of principle. Following the logic of
the Court of Appeal’s conclusions, duress, which deals with wrongful but
excused conduct would be more readily available than self-defence, which
addresses rightful conduct, in a situation in which the accused responded to
threats by trying to eliminate them. And yet, according to the underlying
rationale, excuses ought to be more restrictively defined than justifications (see,
e.g., Stuart, at p. 511). 

[32]                         
The difficulty that this creates is not, in our
view, limited to a lack of analytical tidiness. The result of this case is in
effect a judicial amendment of the law of self-defence. This point is
underlined by the fact that neither in the sources cited by the parties nor in
our own research has duress been extended to a case in which the threat was not
made for the purpose of compelling the commission of an offence and the victim
was the person making the threat. 

[33]                         
In our opinion, the Court of Appeal erred in law
in finding that duress is a legally available defence on these facts. Duress is
available only in situations in which the accused is threatened for the purpose
of compelling the commission of an offence.

C.     Remedy

[34]                         
The next issue is what order should be made,
given our conclusion that the Court of Appeal erred in law and the appeal of
the Crown should be allowed. In our view, the interests of justice require that
a stay of proceedings be entered as the Court is authorized to do in the
clearest of cases by s. 695 of the Code (see, e.g., R. v. Hinse,
[1995] 4 S.C.R. 597, at para. 23; R. v. Provo, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 3, at pp.
18-23). 

[35]                         
It is apparent that the law of duress was
unclear, which made resort to it as a defence unusually difficult. Coupled with
that consideration is the problem in this case that the Crown changed its
position about the applicable law between the trial and the appeal process. The
trial proceeded on the basis that duress was available as a matter of law to
Ms. Ryan if the facts supported it. She therefore went to trial on the basis
that the issues were mainly the factual ones relating to whether she had
pointed to evidence capable of raising a reasonable doubt about the various
components of duress. Presumably, decisions about the conduct of the defence
were made on this basis and might have been made differently had the legal
position later adopted by the Crown on appeal, that duress was not open to her
in law, been known at the time of trial. There is therefore a serious risk that
some of the consequences of those decisions could not be undone in the context
of a new trial and this raises concern about the fairness of ordering a new
trial.  In addition, the abuse which she suffered at the hands of Mr. Ryan took
an enormous toll on her, as, no doubt, have these protracted proceedings,
extending over nearly five years, in which she was acquitted at trial and
successfully resisted a Crown appeal in the Court of Appeal. There is also the
disquieting fact that, on the record before us, it seems that the authorities
were much quicker to intervene to protect Mr. Ryan than they had been to
respond to her request for help in dealing with his reign of terror over her. A
stay of proceedings is warranted only in the clearest of cases (see R. v.
Power, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 601, at p. 615). In our opinion, Ms. Ryan’s
case falls into the residual category of cases requiring a stay: it is an
exceptional situation that warrants an exceptional remedy. In all of the circumstances,
it would not be fair to subject Ms. Ryan to another trial. In the interests of
justice, a stay of proceedings is required to protect against this oppressive
result (see Power, at pp. 615-16; Canada (Minister of Citizenship and
Immigration) v. Tobiass, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 391, at para. 91).

D.     Can the Law of Duress be
Clarified?

[36]                         
This appeal underlines the need for further
clarification of the law of duress. The statutory version of the defence
applies to principals and the common law to parties. Important aspects of the
statutory version were found to be unconstitutional in Ruzic, and the
provision remains in place with two significant deletions as a result. The
statutory version of the defence excludes a long list of offences from its
operation, but various courts have found some of these exclusions to be
unconstitutional. For example, in R. v. Fraser (2002), 3 C.R. (6th) 308,
the Nova Scotia Provincial Court declared the following:

                        . . . s. 17  of the Criminal Code  in so far as it
eliminates the defence of duress and/or necessity in offences concerning
robbery is of no force and effect as being contrary to the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms  and in particular s. 7  of the Charter . [para.
5]

There is uncertainty
about the similarities and differences between the common law and the statutory
versions of the defence.  Within the limits of the judicial role, in the
development of the law, additional clarification is needed.

[37]                         
In our view, after the decision of the Court in Ruzic,
some reappraisal and some adjustment of both the interpretation of the
statutory version of the defence and of the common law seems necessary. We
begin with a recapitulation of what was decided in Ruzic and then
address the various components of the statutory and common law versions of the
defence.

                 (1)      An Overview of Ruzic

[38]                         
In Ruzic, the Court dealt with the constitutionality of
parts of the statutory defence of duress, located in s. 17  of the Criminal
Code . The accused in Ruzic admitted importing heroin from Serbia
into Canada. She argued that she should be excused from criminal liability
because a third party in Serbia had threatened to harm her mother unless she
committed the offence, and the Serbian police would not have been able to
protect her mother. The accused conceded that her claim of duress did not
satisfy the immediacy and presence preconditions of the statutory defence. She
challenged the constitutionality of s. 17 , which reads as follows:

                        17.       A person who commits an offence under compulsion by threats
of immediate death or bodily harm from a person who is present when the
offence is committed is excused for committing the offence if the person
believes that the threats will be carried out and if the person is not a party
to a conspiracy or association whereby the person is subject to compulsion, but
this section does not apply where the offence that is committed is high treason
or treason, murder, piracy, attempted murder, sexual assault, sexual assault
with a weapon, threats to a third party or causing bodily harm, aggravated
sexual assault, forcible abduction, hostage taking, robbery, assault with a
weapon or causing bodily harm, aggravated assault, unlawfully causing bodily
harm, arson or an offence under sections 280 to 283 (abduction and detention of
young persons). 

[39]                         
In upholding the accused’s acquittal based on
the defence of duress, a unanimous Court in Ruzic held that portions of
s. 17  violated s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and
were not saved by s. 1 .

[40]                         
In its analysis, the Court first addressed the
question of whether it is a principle of fundamental justice that morally
involuntary conduct should not be punished. The principle of moral
involuntariness recognizes that “[a] person acts in a morally involuntary
fashion when, faced with perilous circumstances, she is deprived of a realistic
choice whether to break the law” (Ruzic, at para. 29). In concluding
that the principle of moral involuntariness was indeed a principle of
fundamental justice, the Court noted that the treatment of criminal offenders
as autonomous and freely choosing agents is a key organizing principle of
criminal law. As a result, it is a violation of s. 7  of the Charter  to
convict a person who has no realistic choice and whose behaviour is, therefore,
morally involuntary.

[41]                         
The Court then considered whether the immediacy
and presence requirements in s. 17  infringe the fundamental principle of moral
involuntariness by limiting the defence of duress to a person who commits an offence
under a threat of immediate bodily harm from a person present when the offence
is committed. The Court concluded that the immediacy and presence requirements,
taken together, preclude threats of future harm and thereby infringe the Charter .
The underinclusiveness of s. 17  violates the liberty and security interests
protected under s. 7  because of the potential to convict persons who, placed
under duress by threats of future harm, have not acted voluntarily. This
violation is not justifiable under s. 1 .

[42]                         
The Court clarified that s. 17  requires only
that the threat be made to the accused, not that the object of
the threatened harm be the accused herself. Therefore, under s. 17 , the threat
of harm need not be directed at the accused personally but may be directed
against a third party. Additionally, the Court confirmed its previous decisions
in Paquette v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 189, and Hibbert,
which held that s. 17  applies only to persons who commit offences as
principals, while the common law defence of duress remains available to parties
to an offence. Finally, the Court declined to address the question of whether
the list of excluded offences in s. 17  violates the Charter , as
none of the offences at issue in the appeal was contained in the list (para. 19).

                    (2)      The Statutory Defence of Duress
Post-Ruzic

[43]                         
What, therefore, remains of s. 17  after Ruzic?
The Court did not strike down s. 17  in its entirety; it was found
unconstitutional only “in part” (para. 1). As a result, the following four
requirements of the statutory defence remain intact after the Court’s ruling in
Ruzic:

1.         there
must be a threat of death or bodily harm directed against the accused or a
third party;

2.         the
accused must believe that the threat will be carried out; 

3.         the
offence must not be on the list of excluded offences; and

4.         the
accused cannot be a party to a conspiracy or criminal association such that the
person is subject to compulsion.

[44]                         
However, the Court in Ruzic did not leave
the statutory defence in place simply stripped of its unconstitutional
portions. The Court supplemented the interpretation and application of s. 17 
with elements from the common law defence of duress, which it found to be “more
consonant with the values of the Charter ” (para. 56). In other
words, the Court in Ruzic used the common law standard to interpret the
affirmative requirements of the statute (see D. M. Paciocco, “No-one Wants to
Be Eaten: The Logic and Experience of the Law of Necessity and Duress” (2010),
56 Crim. L.Q. 240, at p. 273). 

[45]                         
Where ambiguities or gaps exist in the partially
struck-down s. 17 , the common law defence of duress operates to clarify and
flesh out the statutory defence:

The analysis of duress in common law
will also be useful as it will shed some light on the appropriate rules which
had to be applied to the defence of the accused in the case at bar and which
will now be applied in all other cases, once s. 17  of the Criminal Code 
is partially struck down. [Emphasis added; Ruzic, at para. 55.]

[46]                         
In Ruzic, the Court articulated and
analyzed the following three key elements of the common law defence of duress,
which now operate in s. 17  cases alongside the four requirements remaining in
the statutory defence: (1) no safe avenue of escape; (2) a close temporal
connection; and (3) proportionality (see Parent, at pp. 549-50).

                    (a)      No Safe Avenue of Escape

[47]                         
The defence of duress “focuses on the search for
a safe avenue of escape” (Ruzic, at para. 61). Following the decision in
Hibbert, the Court in Ruzic concluded that the defence does not
apply to persons who could have legally and safely extricated themselves from
the situation of duress. In order to rely on the defence, the accused must have
had no safe avenue of escape, as measured on the modified objective standard of
the reasonable person similarly situated.

                    (b)      A Close Temporal Connection 

[48]                         
There must be “a close temporal connection
between the threat and the harm threatened” (Ruzic, at para. 96). The
close connection between the threat and its execution must be such that the
accused loses the ability to act voluntarily. The requirement of a close
temporal connection between the threat and the harm threatened is linked with
the requirement that the accused have no safe avenue of escape. As the Court in
Ruzic indicated, a threat that is “too far removed in time . . . would
cast doubt on the seriousness of the threat and, more particularly, on claims
of an absence of a safe avenue of escape” (para. 65).

[49]                         
As long as the immediacy and presence
requirements in s. 17  remained intact, the safe avenue of escape and close
temporal connection factors had little relevance. A threat of immediate death
or bodily harm which the recipient believes will be carried out by a person
present ensured a close temporal connection and would most likely leave no safe
avenue of escape. However, once the immediacy and presence requirements were
struck from s. 17 , the common law requirements of no safe avenue of escape and
the close temporal connection became a critical means of assessing whether the
accused’s actions were morally involuntary. 

[50]                         
In addition, once the immediacy and presence
requirements were struck, it followed that the accused’s belief that the threat
would be carried out must be evaluated on a modified objective standard of the
reasonable person similarly situated. Section 17  provides that a person will be
excused “if the person believes that the threats will be carried out”.
On its face, therefore, the section requires a purely subjective belief, a
lower standard that made sense when the threat was clearly immediate and the
threatener physically present on the scene. Once the immediacy and presence
requirements are removed, however, measuring the accused’s belief that the
threat will be carried out necessarily demands a higher standard of evaluation.
In other words, the accused’s actual belief must also be reasonable.

[51]                         
By reading in the requirements of safe avenue of
escape and close temporal connection, the purely subjective standard becomes an
evaluation based on a modified objective standard. These two elements, in
conjunction with the belief that the threat will be carried out, must be
analyzed as a whole: the accused cannot reasonably believe that the threat
would be carried out if there was a safe avenue of escape and no close temporal
connection between the threat and the harm threatened.  

[52]                         
The addition of the common law requirements to
replace the now defunct immediacy and presence elements of s. 17  thus act to
temper the once purely subjective belief as to the threat.  Furthermore, they
bring the statutory provision in line with the principle of moral
involuntariness. Considering that society’s opinion of the accused’s actions is
an important aspect of the principle, it would be contrary to the very idea of
moral involuntariness to simply accept the accused’s subjective belief without
requiring that certain external factors be present. Citing R. v. Howe,
[1987] A.C. 417 (H.L.), at p. 426, Baker agrees that “[t]he threat ‘must
involve a threat of such a degree of violence that “a person of reasonable
firmness” with the characteristics and in the situation of the defendant could
not have been expected to resist’” (para. 25-015). He specifically mentions
that there must be reasonable grounds for the accused’s belief that the threat
would be carried out (paras. 25-015 and 25-016).

                    (c)      Proportionality

[53]                         
The defence of duress requires proportionality
between the threat and the criminal act to be executed. In other words, the
harm caused must not be greater than the harm avoided. Proportionality is
measured on the modified objective standard of the reasonable person similarly
situated, and it includes the requirement that the accused will adjust his or
her conduct according to the nature of the threat: “The accused should be
expected to demonstrate some fortitude and to put up a normal resistance to the
threat” (Ruzic, at para. 62). 

[54]                         
Proportionality is a crucial component of the
defence of duress because, like the previous two elements, it derives directly
from the principle of moral involuntariness: only an action based on a
proportionally grave threat, resisted with normal fortitude, can be considered
morally involuntary. Furthermore, since the principle of moral involuntariness
was judged to be a principle of fundamental justice in Ruzic, it must be
read into s. 17  in order to comply with the statutory interpretation rule that
courts must prefer the constitutional interpretation of a statute. 

                    (3)     The Common Law Defence of Duress
Post-Ruzic

[55]                         
Following this Court’s analysis in Ruzic,
we can conclude that the common law of duress comprises the following elements:

•                    
an explicit or implicit threat of death or
bodily harm proffered against the accused or a third person. The threat may be
of future harm. Although, traditionally, the degree of bodily harm was
characterized as “grievous”, the issue of severity is better dealt with at the
proportionality stage, which acts as the threshold for the appropriate degree
of bodily harm;

•                    
the accused reasonably believed that the threat
would be carried out; 

•                    
the non-existence of a safe avenue of escape,
evaluated on a modified objective standard; 

•                    
a close temporal connection between the threat
and the harm threatened;

•                    
proportionality between the harm threatened and
the harm inflicted by the accused. This is also evaluated on a modified
objective standard; 

•                    
the accused is not a party to a conspiracy or
association whereby the accused is subject to compulsion and actually knew that
threats and coercion to commit an offence were a possible result of this
criminal activity, conspiracy or association. 

[56]                         
We will discuss these elements in turn.

                    (a)      Threat
of Death or Bodily Harm

[57]                         
For an accused to be able to rely on the common
law defence of duress, there must have been a threat of death or bodily harm.
This threat does not necessarily need to be directed at the accused (Ruzic,
at para. 54). It can be either
explicit or implied (R. v. Mena (1987), 34 C.C.C. (3d) 304 (Ont. C.A.),
at p. 320; see also R. v. McRae (2005), 77 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.)).

[58]                         
The strict immediacy or imminence requirement
found in the defence of necessity was not imported into the common law defence
of duress. Rather, this immediacy requirement is “interpreted as a requirement
of a close connection in time, between the threat and its execution in such a
manner that the accused loses the ability to act freely” (Ruzic, at
para. 65). This position was also held in Langlois, where Fish J.A. (as
he then was) held that the issue is not the immediacy or imminence of the
threat, but whether “the accused failed to avail himself or herself of some
opportunity to escape or to render the threat ineffective” (R. v. Langlois (1993), 80 C.C.C. (3d) 28 (Que. C.A.), at p. 50). The lack of a strict immediacy requirement not only strengthens
the assertion that threats can be made to third parties, but also supports the
conclusion in Ruzic, at para. 86, that the threats made can be of future
harm. 

[59]                         
The harm threatened must be death or bodily
harm. Traditionally, courts have qualified this bodily harm as needing to be
“grievous” or “serious” (see, e.g., Hibbert, at paras. 21 and 23). However, this higher threshold
is not necessary in light of the existence of the proportionality requirement —
inherent in the principle of moral involuntariness — which acts as the ultimate
barrier for those who seek to rely on the defence. 

[60]                         
At section 2, the Criminal Code  defines
the term “bodily harm” as “any hurt or injury to a person that interferes with
the health or comfort of the person and that is more than merely transient or
trifling in nature”. Removing the “grievous” or “serious” element of the bodily
harm requirement and dealing with the requisite degree of harm at the
proportionality stage will not unduly broaden the common law defence of duress.
The two-pronged nature of the proportionality requirement, a concept which we
will more fully develop below, will prevent such an outcome. First, the harm
caused must be measured against the harm threatened. Second, the accused must
meet society’s standards for the reasonable person similarly situated, which
includes a capacity to resist the threat to some degree. 

[61]                         
Theoretically, it could be possible to have
caused less harm than threatened, yet still not be afforded the defence of
duress because the behaviour and reaction of the accused as a whole is judged
unacceptable for that individual in that particular circumstance. For example,
inflicting quite minor harm in reaction to the threat of quite minor harm might
fulfill the “equal or lesser harm” requirement, but would certainly not
constitute a situation where society would be ready to excuse the act as
morally involuntary. 

[62]                         
If the threat is of insufficient seriousness,
the offence committed in reaction to that threat cannot be proportional. The
voluntariness of an act depends on its proportionality: an individual cannot
claim to have lost the ability to act freely when the harm threatened does not
meet society’s threshold. For these reasons, the degree of bodily harm that
will make the defence available is best dealt with at the proportionality
stage. 

[63]                         
Therefore, in order to fulfill this first
requirement of the common law defence of duress, there must have been an
explicit or implicit, present or future threat of death or bodily harm,
directed at the accused or a third person. 

                    (b)      Reasonable Belief that Threat Will
Be Carried Out

[64]                         
In addition, the accused must have reasonably
believed that the threat would be carried out. This element is analyzed on a
modified objective basis, that is, according to the test of the reasonable
person similarly situated. 

                    (c)      No Safe Avenue of Escape

[65]                         
This element of the common law defence was
specifically addressed in Ruzic, at para. 61. Once again, the test,
evaluated on a modified objective basis, is that of a reasonable person
similarly situated:

The courts will take into consideration
the particular circumstances where the accused found
himself and his ability to perceive a reasonable alternative to committing a
crime, with an awareness of his background and essential characteristics. The
process involves a pragmatic assessment of the position of the accused,
tempered by the need to avoid negating criminal liability on the basis of a
purely subjective and unverifiable excuse. 

In other words, a
reasonable person in the same situation as the accused and with the same
personal characteristics and experience would conclude that there was no safe
avenue of escape or legal alternative to committing the offence. If a
reasonable person similarly situated would think that there was a safe
avenue of escape, the requirement is not met and the acts of the accused cannot
be excused using the defence of duress because they cannot be considered as
morally involuntary. 

                    (d)      Close Temporal Connection

[66]                         
The element of close temporal connection between
the threat and the harm threatened, mentioned above, serves to restrict the
availability of the common law defence to situations where there is a
sufficient temporal link between the threat and the offence committed. 

[67]                         
This requirement in no way precludes the
availability of the defence for cases where the threat is of future harm. For
example, the accused in Ruzic was able to rely on the defence even
though the threat was to harm her mother in the event that she did not smuggle
the drugs from Belgrade to Toronto as ordered, a task that would take several
days to accomplish.

[68]                         
The first purpose of the close temporal
connection element is to ensure that there truly was no safe avenue of escape
for the accused. If the threat is too far removed from the accused’s illegal
acts, it will be difficult to conclude that a reasonable person similarly
situated had no option but to commit the offence. The temporal link between the
threat and the harm threatened is necessary to demonstrate the degree of
pressure placed on the accused. 

[69]                         
The second purpose of the close temporal
connection requirement is to ensure that it is reasonable to believe that the
threat put so much pressure on the accused that between this threat and the
commission of the offence, “the accused los[t] the ability to act freely” (Ruzic,
at para. 65). It thus serves to determine if the accused truly acted in an
involuntary manner. 

                    (e)      Proportionality

[70]                         
Proportionality is inherent in the principle of
moral involuntariness. “[T]his involuntariness is measured on the basis
of society’s expectation of appropriate and normal resistance to pressure” (Perka,
at p. 259). Part of the analysis involves making a determination of whether the
harm threatened is equal to or greater than the harm caused. 

[71]                         
The test for determining whether an act was
proportional is therefore two-pronged, and was set out by Dickson J. in Perka,
at p. 252:

There must
be some way of assuring proportionality. No rational criminal justice system,
no matter how humane or liberal, could excuse the infliction of a greater
harm to allow the actor to avert a lesser evil. . . . According to
Fletcher, this requirement is also related to the notion of voluntariness [(G.
P. Fletcher, Rethinking Criminal Law (1978), at p. 804)]:

. . . if the gap between the
harm done and the benefit accrued becomes too great, the act is more likely to
appear voluntary and therefore inexcusable. . . . Determining this threshold is
patently a matter of moral judgment about what we expect people to be able
to resist in trying situations. A valuable aid in making that judgment is
comparing the competing interests at stake and assessing the degree to which
the actor inflicts harm beyond the benefit that accrues from his action. [Emphasis added.]

[72]                         
In other words, the “moral voluntariness” of an
act must depend on whether it is proportional to the threatened harm. To
determine if the proportionality requirement is met, two elements must be
considered: the difference between the nature and magnitude of the harm
threatened and the offence committed, as well as a general moral judgment
regarding the accused’s behaviour in the circumstances. These elements are to
be evaluated in conjunction on a modified objective basis. 

[73]                         
The first element of proportionality requires
that the harm threatened was equal to or greater than the harm inflicted
by the accused (Ruzic, at para. 62; see also R. v.
Latimer, 2001 SCC 1, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 3, at
para. 31). The second element of proportionality requires a more
in-depth analysis of the acts of the accused and a determination as to whether
they accord with what society expects from a reasonable person similarly
situated in that particular circumstance. It is at this stage that we examine
if the accused demonstrated “normal” resistance to the threat. Given that the defence of duress “evolved
from attempts at striking a proper balance between those conflicting interests
of the accused, of the victims and of society” (Ruzic, at para. 60),
proportionality measured on a modified objective standard is key.

[74]                         
The evaluation of the proportionality
requirement on a modified objective standard differs from the standard used in
the defence of necessity, which is purely objective. While the defences of
duress and necessity share the same juristic principles, according to Lamer
C.J. in Hibbert, this does not entail that they must employ the same
standard when evaluating proportionality. The Court in Ruzic noted that
the two defences, although both categorized as excuses rooted in the notion of moral or normative
involuntariness, target different types of situations. 
Furthermore, the temporality requirement for necessity is one of imminence,
whereas the threat in a case of duress can be carried out in the future. It is
therefore not so anomalous that the courts have attributed differing tests for
proportionality, especially when we consider that the defences may apply under
noticeably different factual circumstances. 

                    (f)       Participation in a Conspiracy or
Criminal Association 

[75]                         
This statutory element has been recognized as
also relevant to the common law.  Recent jurisprudence has concluded that those
who seek to rely on the common law defence of duress cannot do so if they knew
that their participation in a conspiracy or criminal association came with a
risk of coercion and/or threats to compel them to commit an offence (see R.
v. Li (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 360 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 20-33; R. v.
Poon, 2006 BCSC 1158 (CanLII), at para. 7; R. v. M.P.D., 2003 BCPC
97, [2003] B.C.J. No. 771 (QL), at para. 61). 

[76]                         
In Li, the Ontario Court of Appeal stated
that voluntarily joining a conspiracy or criminal organization also has an
impact on whether there was a safe avenue of escape. In that case, the accused
persons had approached a criminal organization of their own volition and had
later been threatened by this same group. In its analysis on the presence of an
air of reality, the court stated the following:

As can be
seen, the Supreme Court [in Ruzic] recognized the juxtaposition
between a safe avenue of escape and the voluntary assumption of the risk in the
first place. Both are front and centre in the case in appeal. In
considering the appellants’ claim that calling the local police would have been
ineffective because they not only feared for themselves but also for their
families in China and elsewhere, the court should be reminded of their
initiative in approaching the Snakeheads in the first place, and the fact that
the threats of retaliation against them and their families was sweetened by the
inducement of retiring their debts to this organization. [Emphasis added; para.
32.]

[77]                         
The Court of Appeal’s conclusion stands for the
proposition that courts must take into account the accused’s voluntary
assumption of risk, a natural corollary of the unavailability of the defence of
duress to those who wilfully engage in criminal conspiracies or organizations.
This is consistent with the principle of moral involuntariness. An accused
that, because of his or her criminal involvement, knew coercion or threats were
a possibility cannot claim that there was no safe avenue of escape, nor can he
or she truly be found to have committed the resulting offence in a morally
involuntary manner.  

[78]                         
Therefore, to rely on the common law defence of
duress, the accused must not be a party to a conspiracy or association whereby
he or she is subject to compulsion and actually knew that threats and
coercion to commit an offence were a possible result of this criminal activity,
conspiracy or association. In Ruzic, at para. 70, LeBel J. states:
“Like s. 17 of the Criminal Code ,
the English jurisprudence has precluded resort to the defence where the threats
are made by a criminal organization which the accused voluntarily joined and knew
might pressure him to engage in criminal activity (R. v. Lewis (1992),
96 Cr. App. R. 412 ; R. v. Heath, [1999] E.W.J. No. 5092 (QL))” (emphasis
added).  

[79]                         
There is division of
opinion as to whether the accused’s knowledge of potential threats or coercion
is evaluated on a subjective or objective standard. According to Yeo,
the above-cited conclusion in Ruzic is consistent with Australian law,
which only denies the defence of duress to those who were actually aware of the
risk of being coerced by the criminal association (S. Yeo,
“Defining Duress” (2002), 46 Crim. L.Q. 293, at p. 315). A subjective
standard is also applied in the United States (United States v.
Burnes, 666 F.Supp.2d 968 (D. Minn. 2009); United States v. Gamboa,
439 F.3d 796 (8th Cir. 2006); United States v. Montes, 602 F.3d 381 (5th
Cir. 2010)). Baker, however, seems to reject a purely
subjective standard. According to him, the test should be whether the accused “[r]ecklessly
or negligently placed himself in a situation in which it was probable that he
would be forced to commit a criminal act” (para. 25-044). 

[80]                         
We think that the subjective standard is more in
line with the principle of moral involuntariness. If the accused voluntarily
puts him or herself in a position where he or she could be coerced, then we
cannot conclude that there was no safe avenue of escape and that the ensuing
actions were morally involuntary. 

IV.    Summary

[81]                         
The defence of duress, in its statutory and common law forms, is
largely the same.  The two forms share the following common elements:

•                    
There must be an explicit or implicit threat of present or future
death or bodily harm. This threat can be directed at the accused or a third
party. 

 

•                    
The accused must reasonably believe that
the threat will be carried out. 

 

•                    
There is no safe avenue of escape. This element
is evaluated on a modified objective standard. 

•                    
A close temporal connection between the threat
and the harm threatened.

•                    
Proportionality between the harm threatened and
the harm inflicted by the accused. The harm caused by the accused must be equal
to or no greater than the harm threatened. This is also evaluated on a modified
objective standard. 

•                    
The accused is not a party to a conspiracy or
association whereby the accused is subject to compulsion and actually knew that
threats and coercion to commit an offence were a possible result of this
criminal activity, conspiracy or association. 

[82]                         
Certain differences remain.  

[83]                         
The first is that, as was established in Paquette
and confirmed in Ruzic, the statutory defence applies to
principals, while the common law defence is available to parties to an offence.
The second is that the statutory version of the defence has a lengthy list of
exclusions, whereas it is unclear in the Canadian common law of duress whether
any offences are excluded. This results in the rather incoherent situation that
principals who commit one of the enumerated offences cannot rely on the defence
of duress while parties to those same offences, however, can. 

[84]                         
This is an unsatisfactory state of the law, but
one which we think we are not able to confront in this case.  Although we had
the benefit of extensive argument about the parameters of the common law and
statutory defences of duress, understandably no argument was presented about
the statutory exclusions. In addition, some courts have found some of these
exclusions to be constitutionally infirm. We accordingly leave to another day
the questions of the status of the statutory exclusions and what, if any,
exclusions apply at common law.

V.     Disposition

[85]                         
We would allow the appeal and enter a stay of
proceedings. 

                    The following are the reasons delivered by

[86]                         
Fish J. (dissenting in part) — I agree with Justices LeBel and Cromwell,
for the reasons they have given, that the defence of duress was not available
to the respondent in this case.  As a result, the respondent’s acquittal must
be set aside. 

[87]                         
With respect, however, I am not persuaded that a
judicial stay of proceedings is warranted on the record before us.

[88]                         
The criteria for granting a stay ― a
drastic remedy of last resort ― are well established (see Charkaoui v.
Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 SCC 38, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 326, at paras. 75-76; R. v. Regan,
2002 SCC 12, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 297, at paras. 53-54; Canada (Minister of
Citizenship and Immigration) v. Tobiass, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 391, at paras. 53
and 86; and R. v. O’Connor, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, at para. 82).  The
Court has made clear that a stay of proceedings is available only in “the
clearest of cases” (Charkaoui, at para. 76; O’Connor, at para. 82).  

[89]                         
These criteria, in my view, are
not satisfied in this case.

[90]                         
Accordingly, I would instead order a new trial,
leaving it to the Crown to determine, in the exercise of its discretion,
whether the public interest requires that a new trial be had.  In making this
determination, the Crown should bear in mind the particular circumstances of
the case: On one hand, the trial judge’s factual findings favourable to the
respondent; on the other, uncontested evidence that the respondent considered
for seven months having her husband killed, paid a “hit man” $25,000 to do the
job and, when that failed, attempted twice more to arrange for her husband’s
demise.

on appeal from the court of appeal for manitoba

                    Criminal
law — Offences — Uttering threats — Elements of offence — Mens rea — Respondent
repeatedly telling ex‑girlfriend that he would kill her — Ex‑girlfriend
testifying that words uttered by accused did not intimidate her or cause her
fear as accused frequently talked in that manner — Whether trial judge erred in
law in determining that accused did not have requisite mens rea — Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, s. 264.1(1) (a).

                    While
the accused was incarcerated, he had a telephone conversation with his ex‑girlfriend
during which he repeatedly told her that he would kill her upon his release if
she proceeded with her planned abortion of their child.  The accused was
charged with uttering threats.  At trial, the ex‑girlfriend testified
that the words uttered by the accused had not intimidated her or caused her
fear as the accused frequently talked in that manner.  The accused was
acquitted, the trial judge having a reasonable doubt whether the accused
intended his words to intimidate or be taken seriously.  The Court of Appeal
dismissed the Crown’s appeal. 

                    Held
(McLachlin C.J. and Abella and Rothstein JJ. dissenting):  The appeal
should be dismissed.

                    Per
Fish, Cromwell, Moldaver and Wagner JJ.:  It is an essential element of
the offence under s. 264.1(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  that
the accused intended his or her words to intimidate or to be taken seriously. 
The trial judge properly considered the words uttered in the context of the
evidence of the recipient of the threats and concluded that the evidence left
her with a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused had the requisite
intent.  There is no basis on which to conclude that the trial judge committed
any error of law in concluding as she did. 

                    Per
McLachlin C.J. and Abella and Rothstein JJ. (dissenting):  The trial
judge erred in making the perception of the recipient of the threat the
determinative factor in the assessment of the accused’s intent.  The nature of
the relationship between the accused and the recipient of a threat forms part
of the circumstances surrounding the offence.  However, whether the recipient
of a threat takes that threat seriously is not an element of the mens rea
of the accused.

                    The
judgment of Fish, Cromwell, Moldaver and Wagner JJ. was delivered by

I

[1]                             
Fish J. — This appeal from a judgment of the
Manitoba Court of Appeal comes to us as of right, pursuant to s. 693(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code . 

[2]                             
In virtue of that provision, the Attorney
General may appeal to this Court “on any question of law on which a judge of
the court of appeal dissents”.  Here, the question is whether the trial judge,
in acquitting the respondent Kelly Joseph O’Brien, erred in law as to the mens
rea of the offence with which he was charged.  I agree with the majority in
the Court of Appeal that she did not (2012 MBCA 6, 275 Man. R. (2d) 144).

[3]                             
I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

II

[4]                             
The respondent was charged with uttering a threat
to cause death or bodily harm to another person, contrary to s. 264.1(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 .   He was charged as well, in
a separate count, with threatening to damage that person’s property, contrary
to s. 264.1(1) (b).

[5]                             
In her brief reasons for judgment, delivered
orally, the trial judge held ― correctly, in my view ― that the actus
reus of the offence created by s. 264.1(1) (a) is “the actual
speaking or uttering of the threats of death or serious bodily harm”.  And,
again correctly, the trial judge held that the mens rea “is that the
words are meant [to convey] a threat.  In other words they are meant to
intimidate”.

[6]                             
This understanding of the essential elements of
a charge under s. 264.1(1) (a) conforms fully with the governing
decisions of this Court. 

[7]                             
Speaking for the Court in R. v. Clemente,
[1994] 2 S.C.R. 758, at p. 763, Cory J. stated:

                        Under
the present section the actus reus of the offence is the uttering of
threats of death or serious bodily harm. The mens rea is that the words
be spoken or written as a threat to cause death or serious bodily harm; that
is, they were meant to intimidate or to be taken seriously. [Emphasis deleted.]

See, to the same effect,
R. v. McCraw, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 72, at p. 82.

[8]                             
Moreover, before rendering judgment, the trial
judge took care to recess the proceedings for the express purpose of reviewing
the decision of this Court in Clemente.  In her reasons for judgment, as
I have already mentioned, she then proceeded to set out her understanding of
the law in full conformity with that decision.

III

[9]                             
At no point in her reasons did the trial judge
state, as the Crown contends, that she was acquitting the accused solely
because the recipient of the threats did not take them seriously. 

[10]                         
Rather, after setting out the law correctly, the
trial judge quite properly felt bound “to consider the words [uttered by Mr.
O’Brien] in the context of the evidence of [the person to whom they were
directed]”.  That evidence was relevant and therefore admissible for the purpose
of assessing the context in which the words were spoken. 

[11]                         
As Cory J. explained in Clemente, at p. 762:

                        .
. . the question of whether the accused had the intent to intimidate, or that
his words were meant to be taken seriously will, in the absence of any
explanation by the accused, usually be determined by the words used, the
context in which they were spoken, and the person to whom they were directed.

[12]                         
Manifestly, the trial judge asked herself the
right question.  Her answer was that the evidence left her with a reasonable
doubt whether Mr. O’Brien had acted with the requisite mens rea of the
offence with which he was charged.  And she entered an acquittal for that
reason.

IV

[13]                         
I agree with the Crown that it is not an
essential element of the offence under s. 264.1(1) (a) that the recipient
of the threats uttered by the accused feel intimidated by them or be shown to
have taken them seriously.  All that needs to be proven is that they were intended
by the accused to have that effect. 

[14]                         
Here, the trial judge was left with a reasonable
doubt in that regard.  Another judge might well have decided otherwise, but for
the reasons given, I am not persuaded that the trial judge committed the error
of law imputed to her by the Crown in concluding as she did.

[15]                         
I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

                    The reasons of
McLachlin C.J. and Abella and Rothstein JJ. were delivered by

[16]                         
Rothstein J. (dissenting) —  Kelly O’Brien was charged
with two counts of uttering threats contrary to s. 264.1(1)  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985,
c. C-46 , and two counts of breach of probation. 

[17]                         
The charges arose as a result of statements made
by Mr. O’Brien during a telephone call to his ex-girlfriend, Ms. W, while he
was incarcerated. Ms. W was pregnant with his child and was planning to have an
abortion because she suspected him of having had an affair with another woman.
Mr. O’Brien told Ms. W that he would kill her if she went through with the
abortion. 

[18]                         
The actus reus of uttering threats has
been conceded by Mr. O’Brien and is not in issue in this appeal. The only issue
before this Court is whether the trial judge properly assessed the mens rea of
the offence of uttering threats. 

[19]                         
At trial, Mr. O’Brien’s counsel submitted that
if “at the end of the day [the recipient of the threats] simply just didn’t
feel threatened . . . just didn’t feel scared it’s my respectful
submission that the offence at law has not been made out” (A.R., at p. 57). On
the other hand, the Crown submitted that “in law . . . it matters not
that the words were not taken seriously” (A.R., at p. 57). 

[20]                         
 The learned trial judge, referring to R. v.
Clemente, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 758, said in the course of argument that while
“the comments have to be uttered with the intent to intimidate or instill
. . . fear. . . . The case also indicates that such threats
have to be taken seriously” (A.R., at p. 59). The trial judge then retired to
review Clemente.

[21]                         
After a short adjournment, she returned to the
courtroom to deliver her oral reasons. In dealing with the mental element, the
trial judge stated that she had a reasonable doubt about “the mens rea
of the offence because of the evidence of Ms. [W], the fact she did not take
[the threats] seriously” (A.R., at p. 4).

[22]                         
Respectfully, the trial judge’s holding
misinterprets the mens rea of the offence of uttering threats as set out
in Clemente and R. v. McCraw, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 72. The Clemente
test asks the question: “Looked at objectively, in the context of all the
words written or spoken and having regard to the person to whom they were
directed, would the questioned words convey a threat of serious bodily harm to
a reasonable person?” (p. 762, quoting McCraw, at p. 83).

[23]                         
The trial judge did not ask herself what a
reasonable person would objectively perceive. Rather, she asked herself what
Ms. W perceived.  According to Clemente, the trial judge was
required to determine whether the reasonable person would consider that the
words were uttered as threats by “regard[ing] them objectively, and review[ing] them in light of the
circumstances in which they were uttered, the manner in which they were spoken,
and the person to whom they were addressed” (p. 763). Accordingly, the relationship between Mr.
O’Brien and Ms. W is not irrelevant. It forms part of the context and
circumstances surrounding the offence. However, whether
the recipient of a threat takes the threat seriously is not, in and of itself,
an element of the mens rea of the accused.

[24]                         
Here, the trial judge erred in making Ms. W’s
perception the determinative factor in assessing the accused’s intent to
instill fear in her and to intimidate her so that she would not have the
abortion. 

[25]                         
I am not unmindful of the “cautio[n] [to]
appellate judges not to dissect, parse, or microscopically examine the reasons
of a trial judge” (R. v. C.L.Y., 2008 SCC 2, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 5, at para.
11, referring to R. v. Morrissey (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont. C.A.),
at pp. 203-5). However, in my respectful opinion, the error of law made by the
trial judge is self-evident.

[26]                         
I would accordingly allow the appeal, enter a
conviction and remit the matter to the Provincial Court of Manitoba for
sentencing.

on appeal from the court of appeal for quebec

                    Criminal law — Forfeiture
orders — Accused who had previously been convicted for multiple alcohol‑related
driving offences and breaches of probation orders and undertakings pleading guilty
to the charge of driving a motor vehicle while impaired by drugs or alcohol — Crown
requesting order of forfeiture of motor vehicle — Whether trial judge erred in
refusing to issue order.

Held:  The appeal
should be allowed and the forfeiture order granted.

                    In applying s. 490.41(3)  of
the Criminal Code , the trial judge held that he was bound to consider
the objectives and principles of sentencing set out in s. 718  and
following of the Code.  This error is fatal to his conclusion.  The respondent
failed to satisfy this Court that the impact of forfeiture would be
“disproportionate” within the meaning of s. 490.41(3) .  The order of
forfeiture sought by the Crown should therefore be granted.

                    The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

[1]                             
Fish J. — Alphide Manning,
the respondent on this appeal, pleaded guilty at trial to impaired driving and
the Crown, upon his conviction, sought forfeiture of the truck driven by Mr.
Manning at the time of his arrest.  

[2]                             
The trial judge declined to grant the order of
forfeiture requested by the Crown.

[3]                             
Our sole concern here is with s. 490.41(3)  of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , which, in its relevant part,
reads as follows:

                                     .
. . if a court is satisfied that the impact of an order of forfeiture made
under subsection 490.1(1) or 490.2(2) would be disproportionate to the nature
and gravity of the offence, the circumstances surrounding the commission of the
offence and the criminal record, if any, of the person charged with or
convicted of the offence, as the case may be, it may decide not to order the
forfeiture of the property or part of the property and may revoke any restraint
order made in respect of that property or part.

[4]                             
In applying that provision here, the trial judge
held that he was bound to consider the objectives and principles of sentencing
set out in s. 718 and following of the Criminal Code .  

[5]                             
We agree with the Quebec Court of Appeal (2011
QCCA 900 (CanLII)) that the trial judge erred in this regard: see R. v.
Craig, 2009 SCC 23, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 762, at para.  13. 

[6]                             
Unlike the Court of Appeal, however, and with
the greatest of respect, we believe that the trial judge’s error is fatal to
his conclusion.  

[7]                             
Moreover, on the record as we have it, we are
not satisfied that the impact of the order of forfeiture sought by the Crown
was “disproportionate”, within the meaning of s. 490.41(3)  of the Criminal
Code .  In concluding otherwise, the trial judge erroneously emphasized Mr.
Manning’s personal circumstances and failed to give appropriate weight, as
required by s. 490.41(3) , to Mr. Manning’s criminal record, including five convictions
for alcohol-related driving offences and three for breaches of probation
orders or undertakings. 

[8]                             
Accordingly, we would allow the appeal and grant
the order of forfeiture sought by the Crown.

                    The
following is the judgment delivered orally by

[1]                             
LeBel J. — Speaking
for a majority of the Court, I am of the opinion that the Court of Appeal of
Quebec did not err when, for the reasons given by Chamberland J.A., it
dismissed the appellant’s application for an extension of time, and for those
reasons, the appeal is dismissed.

[2]                             
Justice Cromwell, dissenting, essentially for the reasons given by
Dalphond J.A. in dissent in the Court of Appeal, would have allowed the appeal,
granted the extension of time and returned the matter to the Court of Appeal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for alberta 

                    Criminal
law — Defences — Provocation — Whether objective and subjective elements of
provocation established, lending an air of reality to this defence — Whether
victim’s provoking comments were sudden, in the sense that accused was caught
unprepared and surprised by them — Whether defence of provocation should have
been submitted to jury — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, s. 
232 . 

                    In
2006, K’s lifeless body was discovered.  He had been shot twice.  Days later, P
was arrested.  He confessed to killing K.  According to P, K had been extorting
money from him for 18 months by threatening to reveal details about his
offshore investments to the Canada Revenue Agency, and by threatening to harm
his mother if he chose to stop paying or went to the police.  P decided that he
had had enough.  He went to K’s home to end the extortion and threats.  He
brought along a loaded handgun in order to intimidate K but did not immediately
take out his gun.  Rather, he attempted to get K to agree to put an end to the
extortion.  K responded that he would continue the extortion and that he had
“great fucking insurance”, a comment that P took as an implied threat against
his mother.  At this point, P said he “snapped”.  He retrieved his gun and shot
K in the back and then in the head.

                    P
was charged with second degree murder.  At the trial by jury, P admitted to
killing K but argued that the defence of provocation applied.  Finding that
there was some evidence on the objective and subjective elements of the defence
of provocation, the trial judge left the defence with the jury.  The jury
rejected the defence, and found P guilty of second degree murder.  He appealed
his conviction, arguing inter alia that the trial judge erred in her
instructions to the jury on provocation.  The majority of the Court of Appeal
dismissed the appeal, holding that the defence of provocation was properly left
with the jury and that there were no errors in the instructions to the jury. 

                    Held: 
The appeal should be dismissed.

                    Per
McLachlin C.J. and Abella, Rothstein, Cromwell, Moldaver and Wagner JJ.: 
On the evidence in this case, there was no air of reality to the defence
of provocation and the defence should not have been left to the jury.  The
conviction for second degree murder, however, is affirmed.

                    Where
the evidence requires the drawing of inferences in order to establish the
objective or subjective elements of the defence of provocation, the trial judge
may engage in a limited weighing to determine whether the elements of the
defence can reasonably be inferred from the evidence.  For the purposes of the
application of the air of reality test, we must assume that the version of
events described in an accused’s confession is true.  That said, an air of
reality cannot spring from bare, unsupported assertions by the accused. 
Defences supported only by bald assertions that cannot reasonably be borne out
by the evidence, viewed in its totality, should be kept from the jury.

                    K’s
threat against the safety of P’s mother and the history of the relations
between K and P, provide a minimal evidential foundation for the objective
element of the defence.  However there was no air of reality to the subjective
element of the defence of provocation.  That element includes a requirement of
“suddenness” which applies to both the act of provocation and the accused’s
reaction to it.  The trial judge committed an error of law by only considering
whether there was evidence to support the contention that P had killed K before
there was time for his passion to cool.  She did not examine whether the record
could support a finding that K’s provoking comments were sudden, in the sense
that P was subjectively caught unprepared and surprised by them.

                    The
record cannot reasonably support an inference that P was caught unprepared by K’s
statements as K had made similar statements repeatedly in the past.  Viewed in
its totality, the evidence suggests that before setting out to visit K, P
contemplated the possibility that K would persist with his extortion and
threats, and that in that case, he would need to kill K to end them.  A
contention that P was caught unprepared is outside the range of reasonable
inferences that can be drawn from this evidence.  It is supported by little
more than P’s bald assertions that he “snapped” and “everything was just
automatic”.  

                    Per
Fish J.:  The trial judge did not err in leaving to the jury the defence
of provocation, nor did she commit a reviewable error in instructing the jury
as she did.

                    Where
there is direct evidence as to all elements of a defence, the trial judge must
put the defence to the jury.  Whether the evidence is true, or at least raises
a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, is a matter ultimately
reserved to the jury.  In this case, the accused’s evidence at trial
constitutes direct evidence and relates the facts upon which his defence of
provocation rests.  Accordingly, the appellant discharged his evidentiary
burden with respect to both the objective and subjective components of his
defence of provocation.  The mere fact that the deceased had made similar
threats in the past does not mean that the accused would have anticipated, or
been prepared for, subsequent threats of the same sort.  A reiterated threat or
insult can cause a previously unprovoked person to “snap”.  Here, the alleged
provocative act was not the deceased’s failure to end the extortion; rather, it
was his sudden utterance — “I got great fucking insurance” — which P understood
as a threat to his mother’s life.  P’s detailed evidence of the circumstances
surrounding the alleged provocation can hardly be equated with a “bare
assertion” that he was provoked.  The passages in P’s confession identified by
the Chief Justice as supporting a loss of self‑control constitute direct
evidence of the suddenness of the provocation and must be taken as true. 
Whether those passages are inconsistent with other evidence, however, is a
determination that must properly be left to the jury.  In the result, the
appeal fails for the reasons of the majority in the Court of Appeal.

the respondent.

                    The judgment of McLachlin
C.J. and Abella, Rothstein, Cromwell, Moldaver and Wagner JJ. was delivered by

                    The Chief Justice — 

I.    Background

[1]                             
On November 10, 2006, Brian Kullman’s body was
discovered in the Elbow Falls area southwest of Calgary, Alberta.  He had been
shot twice — once in the back, and once in the head. 

[2]                             
Five days later, the appellant, Bill Pappas, was
arrested as he was about to board a plane for London, England.  The police
interrogated him and he confessed to killing Kullman.  

[3]                             
Pappas explained to the police his version of
the events leading to Kullman’s death.  Pappas contended that Kullman had been
extorting money from him for approximately 18 months by threatening to reveal
details about his offshore investments to the Canada Revenue Agency, and by
threatening to harm his mother if he chose to stop paying or went to the
police. According to Pappas, two of Kullman’s associates had visited his mother
as a threatening gesture, and had thereafter told him, “You say no to Brian —
you say no to Brian and next time it won’t be a social visit”: A.R., vol. II,
at p. 239.  

[4]                             
Pappas, as he put it, decided that he had had
enough.  He loaded his 9 millimetre handgun with four hollow point bullets and
went to Kullman’s condominium.  The ostensible purpose of the visit was to
store a bicycle in Kullman’s basement.  The real purpose was to end the
extortion and threats.  Pappas told the police that he brought the gun along
only to intimidate Kullman.  But he also explained that he chose this kind of
bullet because it was particularly lethal.  

[5]                             
During his visit to the condominium, Pappas
raised the subject of extortion several times with Kullman, attempting to get
him to agree to put an end to it.  He did not immediately take out his gun, but
instead kept it concealed on his hip. On the way to the basement where the bike
would be stored, Pappas tried one more appeal, saying, “Brian, just please —
let’s just end this”.  In response, Kullman said, “Buddy, why the fuck should
I? You’re the best cash out I have and I got great fucking insurance”:  A.R.,
vol. II, at p. 241.

[6]                             
Pappas took the reference to “insurance” as an
implied threat against his mother.  At this point, he said, he just “snapped”,
his “mind shut down and everything was just automatic”:  A.R., vol. III, at p.
64, and vol. II, at p. 304.  He retrieved the gun, cocked the hammer, and shot
Kullman in the back at close range.  Kullman screamed and began to fall, and
Pappas fired again.  Finally, as the victim lay on the floor in distress,
Pappas moved the handgun to within 7 or 8 inches of Kullman’s head and shot him
in the left side of his head. 

[7]                             
Pappas pulled Kullman’s body up the stairs and
loaded it in Kullman’s car.  After returning to the basement and setting a fire
to cover his tracks, he drove to Elbow Falls where he rolled the body down an
embankment.  Several days later, he also disposed of Kullman’s credit card and
of bloodstained clothes in the garbage cans behind a convenience store and a
gas station.

[8]                             
In his confession, Pappas admitted that he had
forged a cheque from Kullman to himself for $2,500 and deposited it into his
bank account, and that he had used Kullman’s credit card.

[9]                             
Throughout, Pappas insisted that he had murdered
Kullman to save his mother from harm. 

[10]                         
Pappas was charged with second degree murder for
the killing of Kullman.

II.  The Trial and Appeal

[11]                         
At the trial by jury, Pappas’ confession was
entered by the Crown as evidence.  Pappas did not testify, but relied on his
confession as evidence on the issue of provocation.  Maintaining that he
“snapped” and killed Kullman following the implied threat to harm his mother,
he argued that the defence of provocation applied to reduce the verdict from
murder to manslaughter.

[12]                         
The trial judge initially took the view that the
provocation defence lacked an air of reality.  However, after hearing defence
submissions on the matter, she concluded: 

I am satisfied that if the
jury were to believe the evidence of Mr. Pappas on this issue of provocation
properly, there is some evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly
instructed could find there has been provocation. I acknowledge that the
evidence on the objective and subjective test is not strong. But it is there. 
[A.R., vol. I, at p. 5]

 

[13]                         
The jury rejected the defence of provocation,
and found Pappas guilty of second degree murder. 

[14]                         
Pappas appealed his conviction, arguing inter
alia that the trial judge’s instructions to the jury on provocation
contained several errors.  The Crown argued that the instructions were
error-free.  In addition, the Crown contended that there was no air of reality
to the defence and that it never should have been left with the jury.

[15]                         
The majority of the Court of Appeal, per
O’Brien and Rowbotham JJ.A., dismissed the appeal.  It held that the defence of
provocation was properly left with the jury and that there were no errors in
the instructions to the jury: 2012 ABCA 221, 533 A.R. 294.

[16]                         
Berger J.A., dissenting, agreed with the
majority that the defence was properly left with the jury but found several
errors in the instructions to the jury.

[17]                         
Mr. Pappas now appeals to this Court.  Before
us, four issues arise:

(1) Was the defence
of provocation properly left to the jury? (The Crown contends it was not,
making it unnecessary for this Court to consider whether the charge on the
defence was in error.)

(2) Did the trial
judge fail to adequately instruct the jury that the post-offence conduct had no
bearing on the issue of provocation?

(3) Did the trial
judge misstate the accused’s motive?

(4) Did the trial judge err by stating the suddenness instruction
disjunctively, requiring rejection of the defence if either the extortion or
the threat was not sudden?

[18]                         
For the reasons that follow, I would accept the
Crown’s argument that there was no air of reality to the defence of
provocation.  This makes it unnecessary for me to consider the other issues
raised by the appellant.

III.  Discussion

[19]                         
For ease of reference, I set out s. 232  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 :

232. (1) Culpable homicide that otherwise would be murder may be reduced
to manslaughter if the person who committed it did so in the heat of passion
caused by sudden provocation.

 

(2)
A wrongful act or an insult that is of such a nature as to be sufficient to
deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control is provocation for the
purposes of this section if the accused acted on it on the sudden and before
there was time for his passion to cool.

 

(3)
For the purposes of this section, the questions

 

(a)
whether a particular wrongful act or insult amounted to provocation, and

     

(b)
whether the accused was deprived of the power of self-control by the
provocation that he alleges he received, 

 

are
questions of fact, but no one shall be deemed to have given provocation to
another by doing anything that he had a legal right to do, or by doing anything
that the accused incited him to do in order to provide the accused with an
excuse for causing death or bodily harm to any human being.

 

(4)
Culpable homicide that otherwise would be murder is not necessarily
manslaughter by reason only that it was committed by a person who was being
arrested illegally, but the fact that the illegality of the arrest was known to
the accused may be evidence of provocation for the purpose of this section.

Was the Defence of Provocation
Properly Left to the Jury?

[20]                         
The Crown contends that on the evidence in this
case, there was no air of reality to the defence of provocation.  I agree.  I
will first discuss the air of reality test, and then the objective and
subjective elements of the defence of provocation.

(1) The Air of Reality Test

[21]                         
As discussed in the companion case R. v.
Cairney, 2013 SCC 55, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 420, before leaving the defence to the jury, the trial judge must find
that there is an air of reality on both the objective and subjective elements
of the defence.  The question is whether a properly instructed jury acting
reasonably could be left in a state of reasonable doubt as to whether the
accused is guilty of murder, on the basis of the defence of provocation.  There
must be an evidential foundation for both the objective and subjective elements
of the defence, which s. 232(3)  of the Criminal Code  states are
questions of fact.

[22]                         
The air of reality test requires courts to tread
a fine line: it requires more than “some” or “any” evidence of the elements of
a defence, yet it does not go so far as to allow a weighing of the substantive
merits of a defence: R. v. Mayuran, 2012 SCC 31, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 162, at
para. 21.  A trial judge applying the air of reality test cannot consider
issues of credibility and reliability, weigh evidence substantively, make
findings of fact, or draw determinate factual inferences:  R. v. Cinous,
2002 SCC 29, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 87; R. v. Fontaine, 2004 SCC
27, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 702, at para. 12.  However, where appropriate, the trial
judge can engage in a “limited weighing” of the evidence, similar to that
conducted by a preliminary inquiry judge when deciding whether to commit an
accused to trial: see R. v. Arcuri, 2001 SCC 54, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 828,
cited by McLachlin C.J. and Bastarache J. in Cinous, at para. 91. 

[23]                         
The ability of the trial judge to engage in
“limited weighing” depends on the type of evidence on the record.  “If there is
direct evidence as to every element of the defence, whether or not it is
adduced by the accused, the trial judge must put the defence to the jury”: Cinous,
at para. 88.  The trial judge may not engage in any weighing of direct
evidence, since this would require a consideration of the inherent reliability
of the evidence. 

[24]                         
“Direct evidence is evidence which, if believed,
resolves a matter in issue”: Cinous, at para. 88, citing D. Watt, Watt’s
Manual of Criminal Evidence (2001), at § 8.0.  However, “the mere
assertion by the accused of the elements of a defence does not constitute
direct evidence, and will not be sufficient to put the defence before a jury”: Cinous,
at para. 88.  An air of reality “cannot spring from what amounts to little more
than a bare, unsupported assertion by the accused”, which is otherwise
inconsistent with the totality of the accused’s own evidence: R. v. Park,
[1995] 2 S.C.R. 836, at para. 35, per L’Heureux-Dubé J. For example, in R.
v. Gauthier, 2013 SCC 32, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 403, this Court, per Wagner J., suggested that a single
statement made by an accused that is otherwise inconsistent with the accused’s
“principal narrative” is insufficient to give an air of reality to a defence:
paras. 60-61.

[25]                         
Where the evidence instead requires the drawing
of inferences in order to establish the elements of a defence, the trial judge
may engage in a limited weighing to determine whether the elements of the
defence can reasonably be inferred from the evidence.  “The judge does not draw
determinate factual inferences, but rather comes to a conclusion about the
field of factual inferences that could reasonably be drawn from the evidence”: Cinous,
at para. 91.  In conducting this limited weighing, the trial judge must examine
the totality of the evidence: Cinous, at para. 53; Park, at para.
13, per L’Heureux-Dubé J. 

[26]                         
As discussed in Cairney, in cases where
there is a real doubt as to whether the air of reality test is met, the defence
of provocation should be left to the jury.  However, this principle does not
exempt the trial judge from engaging in a limited weighing of the evidence,
where appropriate.  The fact remains that the trial judge exercises a
gatekeeper role in keeping from the jury defences that have no evidential
foundation.  Defences supported only by bald assertions that cannot reasonably
be borne out by the evidence, viewed in its totality, should be kept from the
jury.  

[27]                         
In the present appeal, Pappas relies upon his
confession as providing the grounds for the defence of provocation.  For the
purposes of the application of the air of reality test, we must assume that the
version of events described in that confession is true: Cinous, at
paras. 53 and 119.  The question is whether a properly instructed jury acting
reasonably could be left in a state of reasonable doubt as to the presence of
each of the elements of the defence of provocation.  There must be an
evidential foundation for both the objective and subjective elements of the
defence.  I will now examine each of these in turn.

(2) The Objective Element

[28]                         
The objective element asks whether there was a
wrongful act or insult by the deceased, sufficient to deprive an ordinary
person of the power of self-control.  Pappas argues that his confession
provides evidence of a wrongful act or insult, in the form of Kullman’s
statement that he had “great fucking insurance”.  Pappas’ confession describes
a sequence of events in which he had been consistently extorted for an 18-month
period and in which his mother had been the target of threats.  He contends
that Kullman’s reference to insurance caused him to finally snap. 

[29]                         
Unlike the companion case Cairney, this
appeal does not raise the issue of self-induced provocation.  Pappas did not
initiate an aggressive confrontation.  He did not confront Kullman at gunpoint;
his weapon remained concealed on him until the moment when he was allegedly
provoked.  Nor did he approach Kullman in an otherwise aggressive manner that
could predictably have induced threatening behaviour.  Rather, Pappas contends
that he tried to reason with Kullman, by asking him if the extortion could
cease.

[30]                         
The relevant question is thus whether an
ordinary person, placed in Pappas’ circumstances, would have been deprived of
self-control upon being told, “You’re the best cash out I have and I got great
fucking insurance”.

[31]                         
On the one hand, the ordinary person standard
must be contextualized to take into account the history of the relations
between Pappas and Kullman.  Pappas had been the target of ongoing extortion
and the safety of his mother had repeatedly been threatened. 

[32]                         
On the other hand, the ordinary person standard
seeks to ensure that only “behaviour which comports with contemporary society’s
norms and values will attract the law’s compassion”:  R. v. Tran, 2010
SCC 58, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 350, at para. 30.  The particular circumstances in
which the accused finds himself are relevant in determining the appropriate
standard of human behaviour against which to measure the accused’s conduct: Tran,
at para. 34.  Pappas had engaged in tax evasion that Kullman was threatening to
reveal to the Canada Revenue Agency.  He did not go to the police with respect
to Kullman’s extortion or threats.  Rather, he armed himself and attempted to dissuade
Kullman in person.  Arguably, this behaviour runs contrary to the ordinary
person standard.

[33]                         
Nevertheless, as discussed in the companion case
Cairney, what would suffice to cause an ordinary person to lose
self-control is a question of degree that the jury is well placed to decide,
and one which, in cases of doubt, should be left to the jury.  The nature of
Kullman’s comments — a perceived threat against the safety of Pappas’ mother —
and the history of the relations between Kullman and Pappas, provide a minimal
evidential foundation for the objective element of the defence.

(3) The Subjective Element

[34]                         
In my view, there was no air of reality to the
subjective element of the defence of provocation.  The subjective element is
two-fold: “. . . (1) the accused must have acted in response to the
provocation; and (2) on the sudden before there was time for his or her passion
to cool”:  Tran, at para. 36.  

[35]                         
Of particular relevance to this appeal is the
requirement of “suddenness”.  The defence of provocation does not apply to
killings that are purely the result of vengeance or of anger, without any
attendant loss of self-control:  Tran, at para. 38; R. v. Parent,
2001 SCC 30, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 761, at para. 10.  To determine whether there was
an actual loss of self-control, the common law has long asked whether the
accused acted “on the sudden”.  The requirement of suddenness has two
dimensions: (i) the wrongful act or insult must be sudden, in that the accused
is subjectively unprepared for it and is caught by surprise, and (ii) the
accused must kill “on the sudden”, before there is time for his passion to cool:
Tran, at para. 38; R. v. Tripodi, [1955] S.C.R. 438, at p. 443.

[36]                         
In my view, the trial judge committed an error of law by only
considering one of the two dimensions of “suddenness”.  She considered whether
there was evidence to support the contention that Pappas had killed Kullman
suddenly, before there was time for his passion to cool.  Indeed, the trial
judge reasoned that there was an air of reality to the subjective element on
the following basis:

Mr. Pappas did say that it was the
word “insurance” that set him off, and he reacted immediately to that.  It is not up to me to weigh the sufficiency of that evidence.  I
am satisfied that there is an air of reality to the defence.  [Emphasis added;
A.R., vol. I, at p. 5.]

However, she did not examine
whether the record could support a finding that Kullman’s provoking comments
were sudden, in the sense that Pappas was subjectively caught unprepared and
surprised by them.  This is an error of law, as “suddenness applies to
both the act of provocation and the accused’s reaction to it”: Tran, at
para. 38.  

[37]                         
The record cannot reasonably support an inference that Pappas was
caught unprepared by Kullman’s statement that he would continue the extortion
and that he had “great fucking insurance”.  Kullman had made similar statements
repeatedly in the past.  Viewed in its totality, the evidence suggests that
before setting out to visit Kullman, Pappas contemplated the possibility that
Kullman would persist with his extortion and threats, and that, in that case,
he would need to kill Kullman to end them.

[38]                         
The principal narrative of Pappas’ confession is that he had
resolved to put an end to the extortion and to the threats against his mother,
through whatever means necessary.  He brought a gun loaded with hollow point
bullets to his encounter with Kullman.  When asked why he chose these bullets,
he explained:

If you want to stop someone you use a
hollow point. You don’t use a regular ball round ‘cause that goes through them.
It doesn’t do any kind of damage. . . . It wasn’t supposed to be like that but
it kept building up. So, I bought them.  [A.R., vol. II, at p. 262]

[39]                         
 At several points in his confession, Pappas referenced his
decision to do whatever was necessary to end the extortion and the threats to
his mother.  He described that he felt that the threats left him with little
choice other than to confront Kullman:

You can’t imagine what it feels like
being put in [a] corner and then having to choose.  I didn’t wanna hurt him. I
didn’t care about me but it was my mom.  What was I supposed to? [sic]
He gave me no choice when he sent his friends — when he sent his friends
there.  He gave me no choice after that.  I started — I made — I made my
decision.  [A.R., vol. II, at p. 255]

He described how the ongoing extortion and threats
led him to make the “choice”, and how “[a]fter 18 months [of extortion] it
became very simple” — “[i]t was either [Kullman] or my mom”: A.R., vol. II, at
p. 259-61.  He went on to explain how, when he was standing outside the door to
Kullman’s condominium, he flashed back to the moment when Kullman’s associates
visited his mother.  He said, “So, as soon as that image crossed my mind that’s
it, ‘Gun’s staying with me’. . . . [Kullman] made his choice, I made mine right
there”: A.R., vol. II, at p. 294.  He described in detail how Kullman’s
repeated refusals to put an end to the extortion gradually made it clear he
would have to resort to using the gun he had brought:

We just started talking about things and I was
trying to tell him — I was trying to literally put my foot down right there,
trying to draw the line right there. . . . And, ah, he’s going, “Well, like I
say, you know, I mean I’ve got really good insurance”, you know? “And I’ve got
a good pay day coming up”, you know? . . . or so and he had good insurance. And
it just, you know, I’m trying to talk him out of it or so. It’s like I’m trying
to, you know, “Don’t go there, Brian.  Come on, man. Don’t go there”, because I
had something here on my hip . . . and I’m trying to do everything I can to
keep — to steer Brian away from that . . . .

 

. . .

 

I mean literally every time he would open his
goddamned mouth he would take one step closer to making me do what I had to do
and I didn’t want to go there.  [Emphasis added; A.R., vol. II, at pp. 299
and 302.]

[40]                         
The only passages in Pappas’ confession that
support a loss of self-control are the ones in which he describes his reaction
upon hearing Kullman once again make reference to the fact that he had
“insurance”:

It — it was just the way he said it. It
was just the way he said the word “insurance”. I knew what that meant. . . .
[A]fter that it was just my mind shut down and everything was just automatic. I
drew my gun, I chambered a round, I fired.  [A.R., vol. II, at p. 303]

At this point, Pappas said that he
“snapped”.  

[41]                         
 The contention that Pappas was caught
unprepared by Kullman’s comments is outside the range of reasonable inferences
that can be drawn from this evidence.  It is supported by little more than
Pappas’ bald assertions that he “snapped” and “everything was just automatic”.  Viewed in its totality, the evidence suggests that Pappas’ mind
was prepared for the possibility that Kullman might reject his pleas to end the
extortion, “making [him] do what [he] had to do”.  His narrative, viewed as a
whole, describes a progressive building up of the resolve to kill Kullman. 
Accepting Pappas’ evidence that he “snapped” as true, this was not the result
of a sudden insult striking an unprepared mind.  It was simply the final stage
of doing what he had come to do — killing Kullman if that was necessary to stop
the extortion and threats.

[42]                         
For these reasons, I conclude that there was no
air of reality to the subjective element of the defence of provocation on the
evidence.  The defence should not have been left to the jury.  Any errors in
the trial judge’s instructions to the jury regarding provocation were thus
irrelevant, and I need not examine the appellant’s other grounds of appeal.

IV.  Conclusion

[43]                         
I would dismiss the appeal and affirm the
conviction for second degree murder.

                    The following are the reasons
delivered by

                    Fish J. — 

I

[44]                         
Like the Chief Justice, but for different
reasons, I would dismiss this appeal and affirm the appellant’s conviction at
trial. 

[45]                         
Unlike the Chief Justice, however, and with the
greatest of respect, I agree with the Court of Appeal’s unanimous conclusion
that the trial judge did not err in leaving to the jury the appellant’s defence
of provocation (2012 ABCA 221, 533 A.R. 294).  

[46]                         
The Court of Appeal divided only as to the
adequacy of the trial judge’s charge to the jury.  In this regard, I agree with
the majority that the trial judge committed no reviewable error in instructing
the jury as she did.

[47]                         
In the result, the appeal fails.

II

[48]                         
There is no dispute that trial judges must leave
for the jury’s consideration every defence available on the record, subject
only to exceptional circumstances which have no application here.  To do
otherwise is to usurp the function of the jury and to deprive the accused of an
enshrined right under our system of justice.  

[49]                         
This is not new law.  In Henderson v. The
King, [1948] S.C.R. 226, for example, Kellock J. recognized that “[i]t is a
paramount principle of law that when a defence, however weak it may be, is
raised by a person charged, it should be fairly put before the jury” (p. 241;
see also Taschereau J., at p. 237).   

[50]                         
For some offences, the accused may choose trial
by jury; for others, as in this case, trial by jury is mandatory.  In either
instance, absent a directed verdict of acquittal, the determination of guilt or
innocence falls exclusively within the province of the jury.  That bedrock
principle is violated whenever a trial judge withholds from the jury a defence
that it is entitled — indeed, required by law — to consider. 

[51]                         
This case hardly invites concern over the
submission of weak defences to juries.  On the contrary, it illustrates why our
system of justice supposes that juries, properly instructed by judges, can be
trusted to reject defences that do not raise in their minds a reasonable doubt
as to the guilt of the accused.  That is what happened here.  The trial judge
felt bound to put to the jury the appellant’s defence of provocation — though
she found, understandably, that the evidence in support of the defence was “not
strong”.  And the jury, properly instructed and acting reasonably, rejected the
defence. 

[52]                         
In determining whether a defence must be
submitted to the jury, trial judges must take care not to infuse what has come
to be known as the “air of reality” test with any significance beyond the
governing standard that has prevailed for centuries.  That standard, though not
always formulated in identical terms, has never varied in substance:  A defence
must be put to the jury if there is any evidence upon which a properly
instructed jury, acting reasonably, could be left with a reasonable doubt as to
the guilt of the accused.  

[53]                         
The phrase “air of reality” connotes neither
plausibility nor likelihood.  The “air of reality test [is not] intended to
assess whether the defence is likely, unlikely, somewhat likely, or very likely
to succeed at the end of the day”:  R. v. Buzizi, 2013 SCC 27, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 248, at para. 16, citing R.
v. Cinous, 2002 SCC 29, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 54.  Moreover, in
determining whether to leave a defence to the jury, the trial judge assumes
that the evidence relied upon by the accused is true:  R. v. Fontaine,
2004 SCC 27, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 702, at para. 72; Cinous, at para. 53.  

[54]                         
The trial judge is not permitted to make
determinations about the credibility of witnesses, weigh the evidence, make
findings of fact, or draw determinate factual inferences:  R. v. Gauthier,
2013 SCC 32, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 403, at para. 25; Fontaine, at para. 72; Cinous, at para.
54.  Indeed, the “air of reality” test has been found by this Court to be
“reasonable” and “valid” precisely because the trial judge does not
weigh the evidence and thus “cannot be accused of usurping the role of the
jury or violating the accused’s rights”:  R. v. Osolin, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at p. 691.

[55]                         
In the present
context, I find particularly apt this passage from the concurring reasons of
Sopinka J. in Osolin, at pp. 653-54:  

With respect
to the defence of mistaken belief, I agree with Cory J. that s. 265(4) “simply
sets out the basic requirements which are applicable to all defences” (p. 676)
and that it requires no more of the accused than the discharge of an
evidentiary burden to adduce or point to some evidence on the basis of which a
reasonable jury properly instructed could acquit.  I believe we are all in
agreement in this respect.  Indeed, this is the basis for our determination
that it is constitutional.  The term “evidentiary burden” and the definition I
have set out are well known to trial judges and well accepted.  I cannot
understand how the addition of the term “air of reality” helps in understanding
the duty of a trial judge with respect to this defence.  I am concerned that
when an attempt is made to add to the definition of a basic concept in the
criminal law, it only creates confusion.

[56]                         
While the Court has recognized that a “limited
weighing” of the evidence will be permitted, exceptionally, where the evidence
relied on by the accused is circumstantial, no weighing is permitted with
respect to direct evidence.  As the Chief Justice explains, “[t]he trial judge
may not engage in any weighing of direct evidence, since this would require a
consideration of the inherent reliability of the evidence” (para. 23).  

[57]                         
Accordingly, where there is direct evidence as
to all elements of a defence, the trial judge must put the defence to the jury
since, “[b]y definition, the only conclusion that needs to be reached in such a
case is whether the evidence is true” (Cinous, at para. 88).  And
whether the evidence is true, or at least raises a reasonable doubt as to the
guilt of the accused, is a matter ultimately reserved to the jury.  

[58]                         
In this case, the appellant’s evidence at trial
constitutes direct evidence and relates the facts upon which his defence of
provocation rests.  Where an accused gives evidence as to all the elements of
the defence, as the appellant did in this case, the trial judge is bound to
leave the assessment of that evidence to the jury:  R. v. Faid, [1983] 1
S.C.R. 265, at p. 276.

[59]                         
According to the Chief Justice, “[t]he air of reality test . . . requires more
than ‘some’ or ‘any’ evidence of the elements of a defence” (para. 22 (emphasis
added)).  In my respectful view, one should not impute to this passage a
meaning that it cannot have been intended to bear.  

[60]                         
As the Court made plain
in Cinous:

The full question is whether there is
evidence (some evidence, any evidence) upon which a properly instructed jury
acting judicially could acquit.  If there is any or some such
evidence, then the air of reality hurdle is cleared.  If there is no
such evidence, then the air of reality hurdle is not cleared. [Emphasis in
original; para. 62.]

And, leaving no room for
doubt in this regard, the Court later reiterated “the full question, which is
whether there is evidence (some evidence, any evidence) on the basis of
which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could base an acquittal if
it believed the evidence to be true” (para. 83 (emphasis added)).

[61]                         
I recognize that the Court, in R. v. Mayuran,
2012 SCC 31, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 162, at para. 21, stated that “[i]t is not enough
for there to be ‘some evidence’ supporting the defence (Cinous, at para.
83).”  This passage must be read in line with established authority, including
the paragraph in Cinous to which it refers.  As appears from that very
paragraph, the Court has consistently held that the decisive question is
whether there is evidence upon which a properly instructed jury could
reasonably acquit:  Fontaine, at para. 71; Cinous, at para.
83; R. v. Thibert, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 37, at para. 7; Faid,
at p. 276; Parnerkar v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 449, at p. 454. 

[62]                         
These principles are well settled.  They align
with the trust our criminal justice system places in the collective good sense
of juries.  And, they breathe life into the accused’s Charter  rights to
be presumed innocent (s. 11 (d)) and to have the benefit of a jury trial
where the maximum punishment for the alleged offence is at least five years
imprisonment (s. 11 (f)).

III

[63]                         
I turn now to the application of these
principles to the facts of this case.

[64]                         
I agree with the Chief Justice that the
appellant discharged his evidentiary burden on the objective component
of his defence of provocation.  In my respectful view, he met his evidentiary
obligation on the subjective component as well.  

[65]                         
The subjective component (or “element”) of the
defence of provocation requires that the accused acted (1) in response
to the provocative act or conduct; and (2) on the sudden before there was time
for his or her passion to cool:  Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 232 ; see also R. v. Tran, 2010 SCC
58, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 350, at
para. 36.  The Chief Justice emphasizes that the second, “suddenness” portion
of the inquiry applies to both the provocation itself and the accused’s
reaction to it (para. 36).  In her opinion, there is no evidentiary basis upon
which a jury could reasonably conclude that the wrongful provocation was
sudden, in the sense that it surprised Mr. Pappas by catching his mind
unprepared.

[66]                         
The appellant’s evidence was that the deceased
had been extorting him for 18 months leading up to the killing (A.R., vol. II,
at p. 238).  When Mr. Pappas resisted, the deceased implied that he was
prepared to have Mr. Pappas’s mother killed (p. 239).  On the night in
question, the appellant did carry a concealed weapon.  He testified, however,
that he did not intend to use it (pp. 242, 245 and 292-93).  The deceased
responded to Mr. Pappas’s overtures by again implicitly threatening to kill his
mother (p. 303).  At this point, according to Mr. Pappas, his “mind shut down
and everything was just automatic. I drew my gun, I chambered a round, I fired”
(p. 304).

[67]                         
The sudden and unexpected nature of the
deceased’s provocative act emerges from the timeline of events on the night of
the killing.  Describing the deceased’s offer to give him money for a plane
ticket, and the deceased’s subsequent veiled threat to kill his mother, Mr.
Pappas testified:

He does me a favour from his point of
view one minute . . . and then the next minute he just told me what’s going to
happen . . . if I don’t get back and [indiscernible]
his fucking expensive toys. [A.R., vol. II, at p. 244]

[68]                         
Accepting this evidence as true, Mr. Pappas
plainly acted “on the sudden” — he “didn’t think about it” (A.R., vol. II, at
p. 241), but reacted immediately to the deceased’s provocation before there was
time for his passion to cool.  Indeed, the Chief Justice accepts that this
satisfies one dimension of the subjective “suddenness” inquiry.

[69]                         
According to the Chief Justice, however, the
record cannot support a finding that the provocation itself was sudden
because the deceased “had made similar statements repeatedly in the past”
(para. 37).

[70]                         
In R. v. Cairney, 2013 SCC 55, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 420, Justice Abella
addresses the manifest difficulties presented by a “predictability of
consequences” approach with regard to the objective element of provocation. 
The same holds true for the subjective element — the mere fact that the
deceased had made similar threats to the accused in the past does not mean that
the accused would have anticipated, or been prepared for, subsequent threats of
the same sort.  Plainly, a reiterated threat or insult can cause a previously
unprovoked person to “snap”.

[71]                         
The Court explicitly addressed this very
possibility in Thibert.  In considering whether a provocation is
“sudden” in the sense that it strikes upon a mind unprepared for it, the Court
held that

the background and history of
the relationship between the accused and the deceased should be taken into
consideration.  This is particularly appropriate if it reveals a long history
of insults, leveled at the accused by the deceased. . . . “[T]he last affront
may be comparatively trivial, merely the last straw that makes the worm turn,
so to speak”.  [para. 20]

 

(Citing
G. Williams, Textbook of Criminal Law (2nd ed. 1983).)

[72]                         
In this regard, the Chief Justice focuses on
whether Mr. Pappas’s “mind was prepared for the possibility that Kullman might
reject his pleas to end the extortion” (para. 41).  With respect, however, the
alleged provocative act was not the deceased’s failure to end the
extortion; rather, it was his sudden utterance — “I got great fucking
insurance” — which Mr. Pappas understood as a threat to his mother’s life
(A.R., vol. II, at p. 241).  This is amply supported by Mr. Pappas’s evidence
that he shot the deceased in order to protect his mother (A.R., vol. II, at pp.
240-42, 247 and 254-55).

[73]                         
Nor am I able to share the Chief Justice’s
characterization as “little more than . . . bald assertions” the appellant’s
evidence that he was unprepared for the deceased’s comments (para. 41).  

[74]                         
In Osolin, this Court affirmed that, in
order for a defence to be put to the jury, there must be “evidence beyond [a]
mere assertion” of the elements of the defence (pp. 686-87).  Using the defence
of provocation as an example, the Court held that while a “bare assertion” by
the accused — “I was provoked” — would not suffice, the “requisite evidence may
come from the detailed testimony of the accused alone” (p. 687 (emphasis
added)).

[75]                         
Read in this light, Mr. Pappas’s detailed
evidence of the circumstances surrounding the alleged provocation, including
his perceptions and explanations for his actions, can hardly be equated with a
“bare assertion” that he was provoked. 

[76]                         
Neither can Mr. Pappas’s description of the
provoking act be considered a single statement that is inconsistent with his
“principal narrative”:  Gauthier, at para. 61, cited by the Chief
Justice, at para. 24.  

[77]                         
I agree with the Chief Justice that the “only
passages in [Mr.] Pappas’ confession that support a loss of self-control are
the ones in which he describes his reaction upon hearing Kullman once again
make reference to the fact that [Kullman] had ‘insurance’” (para. 40).  These
descriptions constitute direct evidence of the suddenness of the provocation
and must be taken as true.  As such, they demonstrate that the appellant
discharged his evidentiary burden on the “sudden provocation” element of the
defence.

[78]                         
Whether these passages are “inconsistent” with
other evidence, however, necessarily requires a weighing of the evidence and an
assessment of its reliability.  That determination must properly be left to the
jury.  And the trial judge’s decision whether to leave the defence to the jury
must, in any event, be based on “the construction of the evidence most favourable
to the accused’s position” (Cinous, at para. 98).  The trial judge in
this case therefore committed no error in finding that Mr. Pappas’s evidence —
if accepted as true in whole or in part — was capable of supporting the
inference that the deceased’s comments constituted a sudden and unexpected act
of provocation.

IV

[79]                         
For the foregoing reasons, I am unable to agree
with the Chief Justice that the trial judge committed a reviewable error in
leaving the appellant’s defence of provocation to the jury.  As mentioned at
the outset as well, I would nevertheless dismiss the appeal for the reasons of
the majority in the Court of Appeal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for alberta

                    Criminal
law — Defences — Provocation — Self‑induced provocation — Whether fact
that accused induced act or words said to constitute provocation precludes defence
of provocation from being left to jury — Whether objective and subjective elements
of provocation established, lending an air of reality to this defence — Whether
defence of provocation should have been submitted to jury — Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, s. 232 .

                    C
shot and killed his long‑time friend F.  At the time, C was living with F
and R, who was C’s cousin and F’s common law spouse.  F had a history of
physically abusing R.  On the day in question, F was drinking, became angry
with R and started to verbally abuse her.  C overheard F tell R that if her
back had not been sore, he would have thrown her across the kitchen.  At F’s
request, C left the room.  He retrieved a loaded shotgun.  Disturbed by the
argument that he was overhearing, C sat in another room, contemplating what to
do.  He decided to scare F to teach him a lesson and deter future aggression
against R.  He walked up to F, who was talking on the telephone and struck the
phone with the muzzle of the shotgun.  He then began to lecture F on his abuse
of R.  F reacted by saying, “What are you gonna do, shoot me? You don’t have
the guts to shoot me.”  F then started to leave the apartment.  When C called
out to F to “get back here”, F said: “Fuck you, you goof.  This is none of your
business, I’ll do with [R] whatever I want.”  F then walked out of the
apartment.  C followed him into the stairwell, where he shot F, killing him.  C
was charged with second degree murder and tried before a jury.  He argued that
he lacked the necessary intention to be guilty of murder, and in the
alternative that he had been provoked by F’s words to him.  The trial judge,
apparently concluding that there was some evidence to support all the elements
of the defence of provocation, charged the jury on that defence.  The jury
acquitted C of second degree murder and convicted him of manslaughter.  The
Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal and ordered a new trial.

                    Held
(Fish and Abella JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed.

                    Per
McLachlin C.J. and Rothstein, Cromwell, Moldaver and Wagner JJ.:  The
trial judge erred in leaving the defence of provocation with the jury as there
was no air of reality to the defence.

                    The
air of reality test is intended to assess whether a properly instructed jury
acting reasonably could have a reasonable doubt as to whether the subjective
and objective elements of the defence of provocation are made out.  The
objective element of the defence of provocation asks whether there was some
evidence upon which a jury could have a reasonable doubt that an ordinary
person in C’s circumstances — which include having initiated a confrontation at
gunpoint — would be deprived of the power of self‑control by F’s
insults.  The history and background of the relationship between the victim and
the accused is relevant and pertinent to the “ordinary person” test, as are all
factors that would give the act or insult special significance to an ordinary
person.  However, that does not change the fact that a certain threshold level
of self‑control is always expected of the “ordinary person”.

                    While
the cases on self‑induced provocation do not always distinguish between
the objective and subjective elements of the defence, read generally they
confirm that the accused’s conduct may be relevant to both elements of the
defence and that it must be considered with other contextual factors to
determine whether there is an air of reality to the defence.  Self‑induced
provocation is not a special category of the defence attracting special
principles.  Rather, it describes a particular application of the general
principles that govern the defence of provocation.  There is no absolute rule
that a person who instigates a confrontation cannot rely on the defence of
provocation.  The fact that the victim’s response to the accused’s
confrontational conduct fell within a range of reasonably predictable reactions
may suggest that an ordinary person would not have lost self‑control,
although it must be weighed together with all other relevant contextual
factors.  As in all cases where the defence is raised, whether it goes to the
jury depends on whether the evidence provides an air of reality to it.

                    In
this case, there was evidence sufficient to support the subjective element —
that C in fact acted in response to the provocation before his passion had time
to cool.  However, there was no air of reality to the objective element of the
defence.  C argues that F’s words constituted a threat of imminent domestic
abuse sufficient to cause an ordinary person to lose self‑control.  However,
F was no longer behaving aggressively towards R when C approached.  His moment
of anger against R had passed.  The record simply does not support the
contention that an ordinary person would have viewed the victim’s words as a
threat of imminent domestic violence against R, leading to a loss of self‑control.

                    What
is left is a concern on C’s part to prevent future abuse against R and C’s
declared intention to achieve this by extracting a promise at gunpoint from F
to stop abusing her.  An ordinary person who seeks to extract a promise at
gunpoint would not be surprised if the person confronted rebuffs the overture
as did F here.  There is nothing on the record to support the element of sudden
shock required to cause an ordinary person to lose self‑control.  It
follows that a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could not have had a
reasonable doubt about whether F’s conduct was sufficient to deprive an
ordinary person of self‑control.

                    Per Fish and Abella JJ.
(dissenting):  The trial judge must determine whether the evidence is
reasonably capable of supporting the inferences necessary to make out the defence
of provocation.  In relation to the objective element, the judge must determine
whether there is evidence that could raise a reasonable doubt about whether the
accused was faced with a wrongful act or insult sufficient to deprive an
ordinary person of self‑control.  To determine how the “ordinary” person
would react to a particular insult, it is necessary to take the relevant
context and circumstances into account, including the history and background of
any relationship between the victim and the accused.  The assessment of the
evidence relevant to the objective element should not be skewed by placing
predominant emphasis on the aggressive conduct of the accused at the
determinative expense of the whole context.

                    F’s
words and the reaction they would elicit from an ordinary person cannot be
appreciated without considering the whole context, and, in particular, the
history of the relationship between C and F.  F and C were close friends.  The
only source of conflict between them was F’s long history of domestic violence
against R, C’s cousin whom he thought of as his “little sister”.  F had been
attacking R for over a decade. The assaults were frequent — often weekly.  They
were also severe.  C knew all about the assaults since R had repeatedly taken refuge
with C and his wife, and R was sometimes so badly injured that she was unable
to go to work.

                    Removing
the defence of provocation from the jury turns on the characterization that C
initiated an “aggressive confrontation”.  On another view of these facts,
however, F initiated the confrontation when he started verbally abusing and
threatening C’s cousin — acts that could, in light of F’s history of relentless
domestic abuse, readily and reasonably be interpreted as a prelude to another
brutal assault.  A jury might well conclude that the objective element of
provocation was met based on a credible threat that F would again abuse C’s
cousin, R.

                    While
F’s dismissive attitude towards C might have been predictable, a jury
could infer from the full context of this case that an ordinary person would
not predict F’s response that he would keep beating R if he felt like
it.  The objective element of the defence of provocation should be informed by
contemporary norms, including Charter values.  These do not include
aggressively proprietary attitudes about a spouse.  It is therefore troubling
to conclude, as the majority does, that it was “predictable” for F to react to
C’s warning by confirming his intention to continue inflicting domestic
violence.  It is difficult to accept that an expressed intention to continue
assaulting a spouse could ever be considered “predictable”.

                    The
trial judge’s decision to leave the provocation defence with the jury was
therefore proper.

                    The judgment of McLachlin C.J.
and Rothstein, Cromwell, Moldaver and Wagner JJ. was delivered by

                    The Chief justice — 

I.    Background

[1]                             
The law has long recognized that murder may be
reduced to manslaughter if the deceased provoked the attack by a wrongful act
or insult, causing the accused to act in the heat of passion.  This is called
the partial defence of provocation.

[2]                             
But what happens if the act of provocation by
the deceased was in response to an aggressive confrontation initiated by the
accused?  That is the problem at the heart of this case — sometimes referred to
as the problem of self-induced provocation.

A.  The Facts

[3]                             
The accused, Michael John Cairney, shot and
killed his long-time friend Stephen Ferguson.  At the time, Cairney was living
with Ferguson and Frances Rosenthal, who was Cairney’s cousin and the common
law spouse of Ferguson.  Ferguson had a history of drinking and physically
abusing Rosenthal.

[4]                             
On the day in question, Ferguson, who had been
drinking, became angry with Rosenthal because she had put a roast in the oven
that he wanted to cook himself.  Ferguson started to verbally abuse Rosenthal. 
Cairney overherd Ferguson tell Rosenthal that if her back had not been sore, he
would have thrown her across the kitchen.

[5]                             
At Ferguson’s insistence and Rosenthal’s
request, Cairney left the room. He retrieved a loaded shotgun from a duffle bag
in the closet.  Disturbed by the argument that he was overhearing, he sat in
the bathroom for five to ten minutes, contemplating what to do.  He decided to
scare Ferguson using the shotgun in order to teach him a lesson and deter
future aggression against Rosenthal.  He walked up to Ferguson, who was having
a conversation on the telephone, and smashed the phone with the muzzle of the
shotgun.  He then began to lecture Ferguson on his abuse of Rosenthal.

[6]                             
Ferguson reacted by saying, “What are you gonna
do, shoot me? You don’t have the guts to shoot me.” He then started to leave
the apartment. Cairney called out to Ferguson, “Get back here, I want to talk
to you.” At this point, Ferguson said the words relied on by the defence as
provocation, “Fuck you, you goof. This is none of your business, I’ll do with
Fran whatever I want”: A.R., vol. II, at p. 384. He then walked out of the
apartment.  Cairney followed him out of the apartment and to the stairwell.  He
shot Ferguson in the stairwell, killing him.

B.  The Trial

[7]                             
Cairney was charged with second degree murder
and tried before a jury.  He argued that he lacked the necessary intention to
be guilty of murder, and in the alternative that he had been provoked by
Ferguson’s words to him.

[8]                             
The Crown objected to the defence of provocation
going to the jury, maintaining that the defence had no air of reality in the
circumstances. After several exchanges with counsel, the trial judge inquired:

And so the
issue for me is whether there’s some evidence on each of the four questions,
the four components of provocation. And I can’t weigh that evidence.  I just
have to — if there is any evidence, then the issue has to be left to the jury.
[A.R., vol. I, at p. 129]

[9]                             
The trial judge then held that since there was
no evidence that Cairney had set Ferguson up deliberately to be able to advance
a provocation defence, she would leave the defence to the jury:

There’s
nothing in the evidence to suggest that Mr. Cairney planned in advance to
murder Mr. Ferguson and to set him up so that he would be in a position to
advance a provocation defence to turn murder into manslaughter; therefore, I
will allow provocation to go to the jury. [A.R., vol. I, at p. 151]

[10]                         
The trial judge, apparently concluding that
there was some evidence to support all the elements of the defence of
provocation, charged the jury on that defence.  The jury acquitted Cairney of
second degree murder and convicted him of manslaughter.

C.  The Court of Appeal

[11]                         
The Crown appealed the acquittal on second
degree murder, arguing, among other things, that there was no air of reality to
the defence of provocation.  The Alberta Court of Appeal agreed and ordered a
new trial: 2011 ABCA 272, 513 A.R. 345.

[12]                         
The Court of Appeal reviewed the test for
provocation, which consists of an objective element (that the act or insult was
of a nature to deprive an ordinary person of self-control) and of a subjective
element (that it actually deprived the accused of self-control), and concluded
that the objective element was not met.  Ferguson’s dismissive behaviour and
insulting remarks were not enough to provoke a loss of control in an ordinary
person:

Measured by an objective standard, and with concerns for the
encouragement of reasonable and non-violent behaviour, we are satisfied that
the victim’s oral retorts to Cairney’s threats of violence were not of
sufficient gravity to cause a loss of control.  Having initiated the unlawful
confrontation which led to Ferguson’s retorts, Cairney ought reasonably to have
understood that his conduct would elicit such a reaction on the victim’s part. 
Cairney had no reason to anticipate docile acquiescence from Ferguson in the
circumstances.  The reaction was foreseeable and, in any event, not of sufficient
gravity to provoke a murderous response. [para. 45]

[13]                         
The Court of Appeal also found that the
subjective element was not satisfied.  Cairney had not acted “suddenly”: para.
47.  He may have been angry that Ferguson had dismissed him so casually, but
the ensuing act of shooting Ferguson in the stairwell was not committed in the
heat of uncontrollable passion, in its view.

[14]                         
Since neither element was met, the trial judge
erred in leaving the defence of provocation to the jury.  The Court of Appeal
acknowledged the trial judge’s conclusion that the defence of provocation was
only one of the routes by which the jury could have reduced murder to
manslaughter; it could also have done so because it did not find intent to
kill.  It was impossible to know what factors entered into the mind of each of
the jurors.  It followed that the instruction with respect to provocation may
reasonably be viewed as having a material bearing on the deliberations of the
jurors and the jury’s verdict, and a new trial should be ordered.

D.  Legislation

[15]                         
Section 232  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1985, c. C-46 , provides:

232. (1) Culpable homicide that otherwise would be murder may be reduced
to manslaughter if the person who committed it did so in the heat of passion
caused by sudden provocation.

 

(2)
A wrongful act or an insult that is of such a nature as to be sufficient to
deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control is provocation for the purposes of this section if the
accused acted on it on the sudden and before there was time for his passion to
cool.

 

(3)
For the purposes of this section, the questions

 

(a)
whether a particular wrongful act or insult amounted to provocation, and

 

(b)
whether the accused was deprived of the power of self-control by the
provocation that he alleges he received,

 

are questions of fact, but no
one shall be deemed to have given provocation to another by doing anything that
he had a legal right to do, or by doing anything that the accused incited him
to do in order to provide the accused with an excuse for causing death or
bodily harm to any human being.

 

(4) Culpable homicide that otherwise would be murder is not
necessarily manslaughter by reason only that it was committed by a person who
was being arrested illegally, but the fact that the illegality of the arrest
was known to the accused may be evidence of provocation for the purpose of this
section.

II.  Discussion

[16]                         
The appellant says that the defence of
provocation had an air of reality on the evidence and that the trial judge
correctly left it to the jury. The Court of Appeal wrongly interfered with the
jury’s acquittal on murder, he asserts.

[17]                         
While the arguments are variously stated, the
case presents one basic issue: What is required to give an air of reality to
the defence of provocation where the provocative conduct of the deceased came
about as a result of the accused initiating an aggressive confrontation?

[18]                         
This in turn raises two questions.  First, when
must the defence be submitted to the jury? This is the threshold air of reality
question.  Second, does the fact that the accused induced the act or words said
to constitute provocation preclude the defence from being raised successfully?

A.  When Must the Defence Be
Submitted to the Jury — The “Air of Reality” Question

[19]                         
The trial judge appears to have acted on the
view that, provided there was any evidence supporting the elements of
the defence of provocation, she was required to leave the defence to the jury.

[20]                         
The Court of Appeal, by contrast, conducted a
detailed examination of the evidence that went into the merits of the defence.

[21]                         
Neither of these approaches is strictly correct.
“[T]he air of reality test [is not] intended to assess whether the defence is
likely, unlikely, somewhat likely, or very likely to succeed at the end of the
day”: R. v. Cinous, 2002 SCC 29, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 54, quoted
by Fish J. in R. v. Buzizi, 2013 SCC 27, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 248, at para.
16.  The question is whether a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could
have a reasonable doubt as to whether the elements of the defence of
provocation are made out: R. v. Tran, 2010 SCC 58, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 350,
at para. 41; R. v. Mayuran, 2012 SCC 31, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 162, at para.
21.  The trial judge may engage in a limited weighing of the totality of the
evidence to determine if a jury acting reasonably on that evidence could draw
the inferences necessary to have a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused
is guilty of murder, on the basis of the defence of provocation; see the
companion case R. v. Pappas, 2013 SCC 56, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 452. This
Court, per Abella J., described the appropriate approach to the air of
reality test in Mayuran:

In
determining whether a defence has an air of reality, there must be an
examination into the sufficiency of the evidence. It is not enough for there to
be “some evidence” supporting the defence (Cinous, at para. 83). The
test is “whether there is (1) evidence (2) upon which a properly instructed
jury acting reasonably could acquit if it believed the evidence to be true” (Cinous,
at para. 65). For defences that rely on indirect evidence or defences like
provocation that include an objective reasonableness component, the trial judge
must examine the “field of factual inferences” that can reasonably be drawn
from the evidence (Cinous, at para. 91). [para. 21]

[22]                         
If this air of reality test is met, the judge
should leave the defence to the jury.  While judges must ensure that there is
an evidential foundation for the defence, they should resolve any doubts as to
whether the air of reality threshold is met in favour of leaving the defence to
the jury.

[23]                         
This appeal turns on the application of the air
of reality test to the objective element of the defence of provocation. As will
be discussed further below, one of the requirements of the defence is that an
ordinary person placed in the circumstances of the accused would have been
deprived of self-control. Thus, the question is whether there was some evidence
upon which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could have a reasonable
doubt that an ordinary person in Cairney’s circumstances — which
include having initiated a confrontation at gunpoint — would
be deprived of the power of self-control by Ferguson’s insults.

B.  The Elements of the Defence of
Provocation

          (1)   Historical Development of the Defence

[24]                         
At common law, as under s. 232  of the Criminal
Code , the defence of provocation consists of two elements — one subjective and one objective.

[25]                         
Historically, the first requirement was that the
accused have lost self-control as a result of the act or acts of the deceased. 
This was called the subjective element; the issue was simply whether the
accused in fact (i.e. subjectively) lost his self-control as a result of the
deceased’s acts.

[26]                         
The second requirement, which emerged
progressively as a means of limiting the availability of the defence, was that
the provoking act be capable of depriving a reasonable man (or ordinary person)
of his self-control.  This was called the objective element.

[27]                         
In the early cases, it was enough to establish
the subjective element. The defence originated in the 16th century concept of
“chance-medley” killings. These killings occurred “by chance (without
premeditation) upon a sudden brawle, shuffling, or contention”: E. Coke, The
Third Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England: Concerning High Treason,
and Other Pleas of the Crown, and Criminal Causes (1809, first published in
1644), at p. 57; G. Coss, “‘God is a righteous judge, strong and patient: and
God is provoked every day’. A Brief History of the Doctrine of Provocation in
England” (1991), 13 Sydney L. Rev. 570, at pp. 573-74.  They were not
premeditated and occurred in the heat of passion. They thus carried a lower
degree of moral culpability than premeditated, cold-blooded killings: Tran,
at para. 13.

[28]                         
However, the common law soon developed a means
of restraining the situations in which the defence was available. This
historical development was described in Tran:

. . .
the courts set out to create greater certainty by establishing specific
categories of “provocative events” that were considered “significant” enough to
result in a loss of self-control. In the seminal case, R. v. Mawgridge
(1707), Kel J. 119, 84 E.R. 1107, Lord Holt C.J. set out four categories of
provocation. [para. 15]

The use of limited categories in which the defence
was available reflected the belief that “people ought not to yield to
certain types of provocation, and that if they did the law should offer no
concession to them”: A. J. Ashworth, “The Doctrine of Provocation” (1976), 35 Cambridge
L.J. 292, at p. 295 (emphasis in original).

[29]                         
The use of categories as a means of limiting the availability of the
defence eventually gave way to a formal standard — individuals raising the defence were held to the
standard of self-control expected to be exercised by the “reasonable man”: R.
v. Welsh (1869), 11 Cox C.C. 336; Tran, at para. 16.

[30]                         
In addition, the common law precluded the defence from being raised
successfully in cases where the accused had intentionally sought a provocative
act in order to manufacture a pretense for killing: Mason’s Case (1756),
Fost. 132, 168 E.R. 66; A. J. Ashworth, “Self-Induced Provocation and the
Homicide Act”, [1973] Crim. L.R. 483, at pp. 484-85. For example, in Mason’s
Case, the accused lost a fight to his victim in a tavern. He thereafter
returned, wearing a concealed knife, and again challenged his victim to a
fight. The victim attempted to hit the accused, who pulled out his concealed
knife. The court held that the accused was not truly provoked by the victim’s
blows, but rather had sought out the provocation in order to have a pretense to
commit a murder.

[31]                         
In Canada, these common law approaches to restricting the availability
of the defence were both incorporated in the codification of the defence of
provocation: The Criminal Code, 1892, S.C. 1892, c. 29, s. 229. They
survive to this day. Section 232(2)  of the Criminal Code  contains the
common law’s objective requirement: only a wrongful act or an insult that is
“of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the
power of self-control” can constitute provocation. Section 232(3)  precludes
“manufactured” provocation from grounding the defence, by providing that “no
one shall be deemed to have given provocation to another . . . by doing
anything that the accused incited him to do in order to provide the accused
with an excuse for causing death or bodily harm to any human being”.

          (2)   The
Modern Defence of Provocation

[32]                         
The elements of the defence of provocation were described by this Court
in Tran.

[33]                         
First, there is a two-fold objective element: “. . . (1) there must be a
wrongful act or insult; and (2) the wrongful act or insult must be sufficient
to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control”: Tran, at para.
25.

[34]                         
Second, there is a two-fold subjective element: “. . . (1) the accused
must have acted in response to the provocation; and (2) on the sudden before
there was time for his or her passion to cool”: Tran, at para. 36.

[35]                         
The bulk of the argument by the parties centred on the ordinary person
requirement: Would an ordinary person lose self-control after having initiated
a confrontation at gunpoint?  Cairney argues that the ordinary person standard
must be contextualized to the circumstances of this appeal, taking into account
the fact that for years he had been a powerless witness to Ferguson’s physical
abuse of his cousin Rosenthal, whom he loved like a sister.  The Crown, on the
other hand, contends that no ordinary person would seek out a confrontation at
gunpoint, and thereafter be surprised and lose self-control when the person who
is being threatened reacts dismissively.

          (a)   The
Purpose of the Ordinary Person Standard

[36]                         
The “ordinary person” element of the defence of provocation is something
of a paradox. The ordinary person does not lose control and kill someone in the
first place. However, the defence of provocation recognizes human frailties
that can lead to violence. As Professor Renke writes:

The
reality is that individuals will, in (what should be) extreme circumstances,
respond to provocations with homicidal violence. For centuries, the courts have
consistently recognized the potential for violence in our hearts and have
explained the provocation excuse as a concession to our human frailty — not just the frailty of the accused, but our frailty.
[Emphasis in original.]

 

(“Calm
Like a Bomb: An Assessment of the Partial Defence of Provocation” (2009), 47 Alta.
L. Rev. 729, at p. 769)

[37]                         
The law seeks to recognize this human weakness,
without going so far as to condone socially unacceptable acts of violence. The
“ordinary person” element serves to ensure that only losses of self-control
which comport “with contemporary society’s norms and values will attract the
law’s compassion”: Tran, at para. 30. As this Court underscored in R.
v. Thibert, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 37, per Cory J., the “ordinary person”
element implicitly entails a balancing exercise:

.
. . I think the
objective element should be taken as an attempt to weigh in the balance those
very human frailties which sometimes lead people to act irrationally and
impulsively against the need to protect society by discouraging acts of
homicidal violence. [para. 4]

          (b)   Contextualizing the Ordinary Person Standard

[38]                         
The “ordinary person” requirement limits the
availability of the defence of provocation, in order “to ensure that the
criminal law encourages reasonable and responsible behaviour”: Thibert,
at para. 14. The downside of the “ordinary person” standard is that, if applied
rigidly and in the abstract, it runs the risk of rendering the defence
unavailable in virtually all situations. As discussed, the truly ordinary
person in Canadian society does not kill a person who insults him or her. In response
to the potential unfairness that could result from a purely abstract conception
of the “ordinary person”, this Court has held that the standard must be applied
in a contextual manner:

.
. . the ordinary person must be taken to be of the same age, and sex, and must
share with the accused such other factors as would give the act or insult in
question a special significance. In other words, all the relevant background
circumstances should be considered.

 

(Thibert,
at para. 14)

[39]                         
As the appellant emphasizes in his submissions, “the history and
background of the relationship between the victim and the accused is relevant
and pertinent to the ‘ordinary person’ test”: Thibert, at para. 17.
Indeed, all contextual factors that would give the act or insult special
significance to an ordinary person must be taken into account: Thibert,
at para. 18.

[40]                         
However, the consideration of background
circumstances that contribute to the significance that an ordinary person would
attribute to an act or insult does not change the fact that a certain threshold
level of self-control is always expected of the “ordinary person”. For example,
characteristics of the accused such as “a propensity to drunken rages or short
tempered violence” are not relevant to the ordinary person test: Thibert,
at para. 15.  Only factors which contribute to the significance of an act or insult
should be taken into account when contextualizing the standard: Ashworth, “The
Doctrine of Provocation”, at p. 300.  The standard should not be adapted to
accommodate a particular accused’s innate lack of self-control; as “there is an
important distinction between contextualizing the objective standard, which is
necessary and proper, and individualizing it, which only serves to defeat its
purpose”: Tran, at para. 35.  As Professor Renke underscores,
“[p]rovocation should be recognized only at that point where the ordinary
person’s control has been taken to its limit, and that limit has been passed”: p.
772.

[41]                         
By appropriately contextualizing the ordinary person standard, the law
on provocation strikes a balance between recognizing human frailties that lead
to outbursts of violence, on the one hand, and the need to protect society by
discouraging acts of homicidal violence, on the other: Thibert, at para.
4.

          (c)   Self-Induced
Provocation

[42]                         
Self-induced provocation refers to the situation where the accused initiates
or invites the act or insult he says provoked him.  It is not a special
category of the defence of provocation.  The fact that the accused initiated or
invited the provocation is simply a contextual factor in determining whether
the subjective and objective elements of the defence are met.

[43]                         
The subjective component of the defence requires that “[t]he wrongful
act or insult must itself be sudden, in the sense that it ‘must strike upon a
mind unprepared for it’”: Tran, at para. 38, citing R. v. Tripodi,
[1955] S.C.R. 438, at p. 443. The subjective component is not met where the
accused in fact subjectively expected the victim’s response and, as a result,
did not act on the sudden. Depending on the circumstances, where the accused
precipitated the provocation, there may be no basis in the evidence for any
reasonable doubt as to whether the accused acted on the sudden.

[44]                         
The objective component asks whether the provoking act would cause an
“ordinary person” to lose his self-control, having regard to all the relevant
circumstances.  Again, depending on the circumstances, where the accused
precipitated the victim’s wrongful act or insult by aggressively confronting
him or her, there may be no basis in the evidence for any doubt as to whether
that act or insult would cause an ordinary person to lose self-control. The
fact that the victim’s response to the accused’s confrontational conduct fell
within a range of reasonably predictable reactions may suggest that an ordinary
person would not have lost self-control, although it must be weighed together
with all other relevant contextual factors.

[45]                         
It has been suggested that “the defence [of provocation] will not be
available where the accused is prepared for an insult or initiates a
confrontation and receives a predictable response”:  M. Manning and P.
Sankoff, Manning, Mewett & Sankoff: Criminal Law (4th ed.
2009), at p. 770 (emphasis added); see also D. Stuart, Canadian Criminal
Law: A Treatise (6th ed. 2011), at p. 590; H. Parent, Traité de droit
criminel, t. 1, L’imputabilité (3rd ed. 2008), at pp. 734-35.  This
is best understood not as an absolute rule, but as the usual result of
application of appropriate contextual factors to the question of whether an
ordinary person would have lost control.

[46]                         
The matter is always one of context, and in cases of
doubt, the question of whether the accused’s confrontational conduct undermines
the defence should be left to the jury.   In the case of Edwards v. The
Queen, [1973] A.C. 648, in which it was alleged that the accused’s acts of
blackmail gave rise to the victim’s provocative conduct, Lord Pearson
acknowledged that “[o]n principle it seems reasonable to say that . . .  a
blackmailer cannot rely on the predictable results of his own blackmailing
conduct as constituting provocation sufficient to reduce his killing of the
victim from murder to manslaughter”: p. 658. However, he went on to hold that
whether the inciting act would have this effect is a matter of fact that “would
in many cases be a question of degree to be decided by the jury”: p. 658; see
also Ashworth, “Self-Induced Provocation and the Homicide Act”, at p. 486.

          (d)  The
Cases on Self-Induced Provocation

[47]                         
While the cases on self-induced provocation do not always distinguish
between the objective and subjective elements of the defence, read generally
they confirm that the accused’s conduct in inciting provocation may be relevant
to both elements of the defence, and that it must be considered with other contextual
factors to determine whether there is an air of reality to the defence.

[48]                         
The accused’s conduct in inciting the alleged provocation was held to
deprive the defence of any air of reality in Salamon v. The Queen,
[1959] S.C.R. 404.  The accused had quarreled with the deceased, Joyce
Alexander, at an acquaintance’s house. The accused then returned alone to his
house, and waited for the deceased to come home as well. When the deceased
arrived, the accused started a confrontation during which he assaulted the
deceased, threw dishes at her and called her “a dirty name”: p. 407.
Eventually, the deceased retaliated by also calling the accused a dirty name,
at which point the accused shot her. This Court held that the defence of
provocation should not have been put to the jury:

The
evidence shows that from the time Joyce Alexander entered her home to that of
the fatal shot, the appellant, and not she, took, and kept throughout, the
initiative of the events leading to her death. He was evidently waiting for her
arrival. He started the quarrel during which she retaliated. . . . 

 

On
this evidence, [the] appellant cannot justify or excuse his actions in saying
that he was facing a situation characterized with suddenness, unexpectedness or
lack of premonition.
. . . There was no sudden provocation on the part of Joyce Alexander causing
sudden retaliation on his part. [Emphasis added; pp. 409-10.]

[49]                         
In R. v. Louison (1975), 26 C.C.C. (2d)
266 (Sask. C.A.), aff’d [1979] 1 S.C.R. 100, the accused sequestered a taxi
driver in the trunk of his own taxi. When he later opened the trunk, the driver
sprung out and hit him with a hammer. The accused grabbed the hammer away, and
proceeded to smash the driver’s skull with it, killing him. At trial, the
accused argued that he acted in the heat of the passion aroused by the hammer
attack. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, per Culliton C.J., held that
the provocation was self-induced and that the driver’s attempt to escape was
objectively predictable:

In
my view there could not be a situation in which the appellant had and kept the
initiative throughout more completely than in the present case. . . . 

 

. . .

 

.
. . I am satisfied that any reasonable person who had treated the deceased
as did the appellant, would expect that person to use any means at his disposal
to try and effect his escape if the occasion to do so arose. The striking
of the appellant by the deceased is not an act for which his mind would be
unprepared or would take his understanding by surprise, or that would set his
passions aflame. Such an act was one that was not only foreseeable and
predictable, but was one to be expected if the deceased was afforded any
opportunity to escape. [Emphasis added; pp. 286-87.]

[50]                         
Similarly, in R. v. Squire, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 13, this Court found
that an off-duty police officer who had gone out looking to pick fights in bars
could not raise the defence of provocation, as no jury acting reasonably could
conclude that the accused had been provoked in such a manner as to deprive an
ordinary person of the power of self-control:

It must
be remembered that on the evidence the respondent was, throughout the
disgraceful incidents of the evening, a bad-tempered aggressor and that he
seized on the slightest confrontation by [the deceased] to again become the
aggressor. If, during the fight which followed . . . he suffered a couple of
kicks of indefinite violence, the provocation resulting therefrom could not
possibly have caused a police officer to draw his gun and fire five shots at
his assailant. [pp. 21-22]

[51]                         
More recent cases have also confirmed that the defence of
provocation may lack an air of reality when the accused initiated an aggressive
confrontation which resulted in predictable acts of provocation. In R. v.
Gibson, 2001 BCCA 297, 153 B.C.A.C. 61, the accused initiated a physical
fight with the deceased. He lost the physical confrontation. The deceased
pushed the accused away and made a dismissive gesture. The accused felt
humiliated and stabbed the deceased with a knife as he was walking away from
the scene of the confrontation. The British Columbia Court of
Appeal held that there was no air of reality to the defence of provocation,
since the provocation was not sudden and would not have caused an ordinary
person to have lost his self-control.  Ryan J.A. suggested that an ordinary
person who initiates a fist fight would not lose control when he receives blows
in retaliation:

. . . the
sequelae of a lost match (as in Squire, the not unexpected blows
exchanged during a consensual fight) are not such as to deprive the ordinary
person of his power of self-control. . . .  [T]he ordinary
person standard is adopted to fix the degree of self-control and restraint
expected of all in society. It recognizes human frailty when the threshold test
is passed and a person is provoked beyond the level of tolerance of the
ordinary person. Based on the evidence in this case no jury could find that
under the same circumstances an ordinary young man in the appellant’s place
would have been provoked by the actions, words and gestures of the deceased so
as to cause him to lose his power of self-control. [para. 86]

[52]                         
Implicit in the appellate court’s reasoning is
the conclusion that the victim’s response — inflicting
minor damage in the fight the accused had initiated and then walking away — was within the range of reasonably anticipated responses. No
other contextual factors suggested that an ordinary person would have lost
self-control in the circumstances.  Accordingly, there was no air of reality to
the defence.

[53]                         
In the Tran case, this Court held that an accused who knew
that his wife was seeing another man could not claim that finding her in bed
with that man had “str[uck] upon a mind unprepared for it”:  para. 45. The
accused in Tran had maintained the initiative throughout: he had entered
his estranged wife’s apartment unexpectedly, without being invited, and
proceeded to attack his wife and her lover when he found them in bed together.
Although this Court analyzed the predictability of the allegedly provocative
act only under the subjective component of the test, there was an implied objective
dimension to the analysis. An “ordinary person” who burst into his estranged
wife’s apartment — and who knew
that she had taken a new lover — could reasonably anticipate that he would
discover the wife and her lover in bed.

[54]                         
Finally, I come to the case Thibert. In Thibert, a
majority of this Court held that the defence of provocation was properly left
to the jury, notwithstanding evidence that the accused’s conduct had
precipitated the wrongful act or insult relied on as provocation.  The accused,
Thibert, who was distraught because his wife wanted to leave him and had begun
seeing another man, went to his wife’s workplace in an attempt to convince her
to stay with him. He had placed a loaded rifle in his car. He met his wife in
the parking lot adjacent to her workplace. The wife’s lover interrupted the
conversation. The accused took the rifle out of his car and pointed it at him. 
The deceased began walking towards the accused, with his hands on the wife’s
shoulders and swinging her back and forth, all the while challenging the
accused to shoot him. The accused shot him, and raised the defence of
provocation at trial.

[55]                         
A majority of this Court, per Cory J., held that the trial judge
had not erred in leaving the defence of provocation with the jury.  The majority
reasons focused predominantly on whether the accused could have subjectively
lost control as a result of the victim’s taunts. The majority concluded that,
since the accused did not expect to see his wife’s lover at the meeting, the
confrontation with the deceased was unforeseen. Accordingly, the majority held
that the subjective element could be met and that, by extension, there was an
air of reality to the defence: Thibert, at para. 27. The accused could
not be said to have sought out the confrontation, according to the majority’s
reasoning.  The reasons also referred to the significance that an ordinary
person in the accused’s circumstances would attribute to the taunts, but did
not explore how the objective element of the defence, as analyzed in this case,
would be met in a situation of self-induced provocation.  The majority appears
to have relied heavily on the fact that, although the case was close to the
line, deference should be shown to the trial judge who had left the defence to
the jury: para. 33. Thibert is distinguishable from the present case, in
which Cairney sought out a confrontation with Ferguson at gunpoint.

[56]                         
Taken as a whole, the cases support the view that the fact that
provocation is “self-induced” by the accused may be relevant to both the
objective and subjective components of the defence.   Self-induced provocation
is not a special category of the defence attracting special principles. 
Rather, it describes a particular application of the general principles that
govern the defence of provocation.  There is no absolute rule that a person who
instigates a confrontation cannot rely on the defence of provocation.  As in
all cases where the defence of provocation is raised, whether the defence goes
to the jury depends on whether the evidence provides an air of reality to it. 
However, the fact that an accused sought out an aggressive confrontation and
received a predictable response is a factor which may deprive the defence of an
air of reality.

III. Application

[57]                         
The question is whether on the evidence
Cairney’s defence of provocation possessed an air of reality. The trial judge
left the matter to the jury, although she appears to have applied a “some
evidence” test instead of the air of reality test.  The Court of Appeal
disagreed, finding that there could be no reasonable doubt as to whether the
objective or subjective elements of the defence were present.

[58]                         
In my view, this appeal can be resolved on the objective element of the
test, which asks whether there was a wrongful act or insult by
the victim, sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of
self-control.

[59]                         
The alleged wrongful act or insult was the deceased’s
words to Cairney when Cairney confronted him at gunpoint: “Fuck you, you goof. 
This is none of your business, I’ll do with Fran whatever I want.”

[60]                         
Cairney argues that these words constituted a threat of
imminent domestic abuse sufficient to cause an ordinary person to lose
self-control.  The record does not support this contention. Ferguson was
having a conversation on the telephone when Cairney approached.  He was no
longer behaving aggressively towards Rosenthal —
his moment of anger against Rosenthal had passed.  Moreover, Ferguson was
attempting to leave the apartment when he spoke those words. The record, as the
Court of Appeal concluded, simply does not support the contention that an
ordinary person would have viewed the victim’s words as a threat of imminent
domestic violence against Rosenthal, leading to a loss of self-control.

[61]                         
What we are left with is a concern on Cairney’s part to prevent future
abuse against Rosenthal, and Cairney’s declared intention to achieve this by
extracting a promise at gunpoint from Ferguson to stop abusing her.  An
ordinary person who seeks to extract a promise at gunpoint would not be
surprised if the person confronted rebuffs the overture, in words like those
used by the victim here.  Ferguson’s response fell within a range of
predictable responses. There is nothing on the record to support the element of
sudden shock required to cause an ordinary person to lose self-control.  It
follows that a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could not have had a
reasonable doubt about whether Ferguson’s conduct was sufficient to deprive an
ordinary person of the power of self-control.

[62]                         
There was evidence, provided by Cairney’s
testimony, sufficient to support the subjective element — that Cairney in fact
acted in response to the provocation before his passion had time to cool. The
Court of Appeal entered into a minute weighing of the evidence that went into
the merits of the defence, by examining whether Cairney’s passions had time to
cool during the time that he followed Ferguson to the apartment building’s
stairwell. This approach went well beyond the requirements of the air of
reality test — the test only requires that there be an
evidential foundation on which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably
could find that there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused is
guilty of murder, on the basis of the defence of provocation. However, the
Court of Appeal’s error in assessing the subjective element does not change the
outcome of this appeal, since there is no air of reality to the objective
element of the defence.

[63]                         
In this case deference to the trial judge is not
appropriate, since she appears not to have applied the correct test in deciding
whether to leave the defence of provocation to the jury.

[64]                         
I add the following, from the perspective of
policy as it applies to cases such as this. Violent confrontations like the
gunpoint lecture that led to the death of Ferguson are to be discouraged. Where
conduct of this nature occurs, it will generally play a role in assessing
whether the defence of provocation meets the air of reality test, particularly under
the objective element of the defence. The law does not condone the initiation
of gunpoint lectures, regardless of the cause that led the accused to pick up a
weapon.

[65]                         
Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal and
affirm the order for a new trial.

                    The
reasons of Fish and Abella JJ. were delivered by

[66]                         
Abella J. (dissenting) — I have had the benefit of reading the Chief
Justice’s reasons and agree that there was evidence to support the subjective
element of the provocation defence. With great respect, however, I disagree
with her conclusions on the objective element of the defence. In my view, the
trial judge did not err in leaving the defence with the jury.

[67]                         
The role of the trial judge in deciding what
defences to put to the jury is to act as gatekeeper and “review the evidence
[to] determine whether, if believed, it could permit a properly
instructed jury acting reasonably to acquit” (R. v. Cinous, 2002 SCC 29,
[2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 87 (emphasis in original)).  This threshold
determination “is not aimed at deciding the substantive merits of the defence”,
and the trial judge must not make determinations of credibility, weigh
evidence, make findings of fact, or draw determinate factual inferences (Cinous,
at paras. 54 and 87).

[68]                         
For defences like provocation, the trial judge
must determine whether the evidence is reasonably capable of supporting the
inferences necessary to make out the defence (R. v. Tran, 2010 SCC 58,
[2010] 3 S.C.R. 350, at para. 41). When carrying out this “limited weighing” of
the evidence, the trial judge “does not draw determinate factual inferences,
but rather comes to a conclusion about the field of factual inferences that
could reasonably be drawn from the evidence” (Cinous, at para. 91; see
also R. v. Mayuran, 2012 SCC 31, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 162, at para. 21).

[69]                         
In relation to the objective element of
provocation, the judge must determine whether there is evidence that could
raise a reasonable doubt about whether the accused was faced with a wrongful
act or insult sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of self-control (Tran,
at para. 25).  To determine how the “ordinary” person would react to a
particular insult, it is necessary to take the relevant context and
circumstances into account, but without going so far as to accept idiosyncratic
characteristics of the accused that would subvert the objective standard (Tran,
at paras. 31-35). One clearly relevant contextual circumstance that informs the
inquiry is the history and background of any relationship between the victim
and the accused (R. v. Thibert, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 37, at paras. 16-19).

[70]                         
In this case, Ferguson’s words and the reaction
they would elicit from an ordinary person cannot be appreciated without
considering the whole context, and, in particular, the history of the
relationship between Cairney and Ferguson. The majority’s approach concentrates
mainly on one aspect of the evidence — Cairney confronting Ferguson with a gun
— to the exclusion of other evidence that could well have led the jury to
conclude that the objective element of provocation was met based on a credible
threat that Ferguson would again abuse Cairney’s cousin, Fran Rosenthal.

[71]                         
The predictability of the alleged provocation is
certainly relevant to the analysis. But the assessment of the evidence relevant
to the objective element should not be skewed by placing predominant emphasis
on the aggressive conduct of the accused at the determinative expense of the
whole context. An analysis that overwhelmingly focuses on whether the victim’s
acts were the predictable consequence of the accused’s aggressive conduct
appears to me to be too restrictive. It is noteworthy that two of the
commentators cited by the majority in support of denying the defence of
provocation “where the accused . . . initiates a confrontation and receives a
predictable response” in fact criticise such an approach (Morris Manning
and Peter Sankoff, Manning, Mewett & Sankoff: Criminal Law (4th
ed. 2009), at pp. 770-72; Don Stuart, Canadian Criminal Law: A Treatise (6th
ed. 2011), at p. 592).

[72]                         
Ferguson and Cairney were close friends. The
only source of conflict between them, which ultimately led to the killing, was
Ferguson’s long history of domestic violence against Fran Rosenthal, whom
Cairney thought of as his “little sister”.

[73]                         
Ferguson had been attacking Fran Rosenthal for
over a decade. The assaults were frequent — often weekly. They were also
severe: Rosenthal testified about incidents such as Ferguson hitting her in the
head with a golf club.  Cairney knew all about the assaults since Rosenthal had
repeatedly taken refuge with him and his wife.  She would show up bruised and
injured, sometimes so badly that she was unable to go to work.

[74]                         
Less than a year before the shooting, Cairney
had witnessed one of the attacks. He had found Ferguson kneeling on Fran Rosenthal’s
throat, choking her to the point of unconsciousness. Cairney had to push
Ferguson off of Rosenthal, and spent that entire night with Ferguson to ensure
that he did not attack her again. A few weeks before the shooting, Rosenthal
told Cairney that she had thought she was going to die that time.

[75]                         
The incident leading to the shooting had the
potential to turn into another assault. Ferguson suddenly became enraged and
started screaming at Fran Rosenthal. He called her a “fuckin’ bitch” and a
“fuckin’ cunt” and threatened her with: “If it wasn’t for your sore back, I’d
be throwing you against the walls right now.” He ordered Rosenthal to tell
Cairney to leave. When she did, Cairney expressed his concern to her that
Ferguson was going to start beating her. She did not deny it. In
cross-examination, she admitted that she wanted Cairney to leave because danger
to her was imminent and she did not want him to see it.

[76]                         
While the majority suggests that Ferguson was
“no longer behaving aggressively towards Rosenthal” and that “his moment of
anger against Rosenthal had passed” by the time Cairney confronted him, the
opposite inference can also be drawn from this record. Notably, Cairney’s
evidence about the progression of the fight between Ferguson and Rosenthal is
that it continued to escalate after Cairney left the room at Rosenthal’s
request. Cairney testified during cross-examination, for instance, that hearing
Ferguson screaming threats at Rosenthal was what led him to come back in and
confront Ferguson:

Q    And then in spite of your concerns about the potential for
violence then, you actually do leave the two alone for a while, in spite of
that explosive, you know, kind of powder keg situation. Right?

 

A    Right.

 

Q    And you come back with the gun, smash the phone. Right?

 

A    After I heard the argument escalating and Steve [Ferguson]
screaming at her.

 

Q    Oh, okay. What was Steve saying then in terms of the
argument escalating?

 

A    I believe the words were, You never fucking listen, you
fucking cunt. I heard Frannie yelling back at Steve. That’s when I had enough.
And all I wanted to do was scare Steve. I did not want to shoot him. [Emphasis
added.]

[77]                         
At that point, Cairney confronted Ferguson with
the gun and said:

Do you think you own her? Do you think
that she’s your property? Do you think that you can beat the shit out of her
anytime you want? I said, I had it up to here, buddy. I said, listen, here you
are all those months, when you’re not working and she’s buying your beer and
whatever and toting [sic] to your every whim, and whenever you get
pissed off about anything, you use her as your punching bag.

[78]                         
The response that caused Cairney to snap,
according to his testimony, was this: “Fuck you, you goof. This is none of your
business. I’ll do with Fran whatever I want.” The provocative act was not
Ferguson responding dismissively to Cairney pointing the gun. It was
his emphatic assertion that he would continue the conduct towards Fran
Rosenthal that Cairney had just confronted him about — “beat[ing] the shit out
of her” and using her as his “punching bag”.

[79]                         
The facts of this case illustrate the frailty of
making the availability of the provocation defence hinge on a “who started it?”
inquiry in circumstances involving a back-and-forth between the victim and the
accused. Removing the defence from the jury turns on the characterization that
Cairney initiated an “aggressive confrontation”. On another view of these
facts, however, Ferguson initiated the confrontation when he started verbally
abusing and threatening Cairney’s cousin — acts that could, in light of
Ferguson’s history of relentless domestic abuse, readily and reasonably be
interpreted as a prelude to another brutal assault.

[80]                         
Bielby J.’s decision to leave provocation to the
jury was therefore a proper one. Her review of the evidence relevant to the
objective element of provocation was flawless:

The event which Mr. Cairney
testified caused him to lose control was Mr. Ferguson telling him he was a goof
and that he would do what he wanted to with Fran, said as he walked away from
Mr. Cairney who had just told him to come back. That event must be considered
in the context of what occurred just before and in the context of Mr. Cairney’s
knowledge of the history of domestic violence between Mr. Ferguson and Ms.
Rosenthal. . . .

 

. . .

 

You must take into account
everything that was said or done at the time and must also consider Mr. Cairney
and Mr. Ferguson’s relationship and history. This includes evidence of Mr.
Cairney’s knowledge of prior incidents when Mr. Ferguson had struck or been
violent toward Ms. Rosenthal, including the one he personally witnessed the
prior summer when he saw Mr. Ferguson place his knee on her neck, leaving her
almost unconscious, where Mr. Cairney intervened to pull Mr. Ferguson off her,
the fact that she told Mr. Cairney she thought she was going to die that night
in a conversation held with him in January 2007 and the fact Mr. Cairney was
attempting to scold Mr. Ferguson over his demeaning and violent treatment of
Fran over the years.

[81]                         
The majority would, however, remove the defence
of provocation from the jury solely because Ferguson’s words “fell within a
range of predictable responses” to what it calls a “gunpoint lecture”.  While
Ferguson’s dismissive attitude towards Cairney might have been predictable,
it would, in my view, be open for a jury to infer from the full context of this
case that an ordinary person would not predict Ferguson’s response that
he would keep beating Rosenthal if he felt like it.

[82]                         
This Court said in Tran that the objective
element of the defence of provocation should be informed by contemporary norms,
including Charter values. These do not include aggressively proprietary
atavistic attitudes. It is therefore troubling, with respect, to
conclude that it was “predictable” for Ferguson to react to Cairney’s warning
by confirming his intention to continue inflicting domestic violence. It is
difficult to accept that an expressed intention to continue assaulting a spouse
could ever be considered “predictable”.

[83]                         
It is true that “[t]he law does not condone the
initiation of gunpoint lectures”, as the majority observes. The law never
condones the conduct that gives rise to the defence of provocation. That is why
provocation is only a partial defence, reducing the offence from murder to
manslaughter and why the defence of provocation in the circumstances of this
case in no way absolves the accused. Cairney’s nine-year prison sentence was
based on the fact that he caused Ferguson’s death by using a firearm in the
dispute.

[84]                         
I would allow the appeal and restore the
conviction and nine-year sentence for manslaughter.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

                    Criminal law — Charge to jury — Eyewitness
evidence — Whether trial judge instructed jury that it could convict accused
based on eyewitness evidence alone — If so, whether such an instruction would
constitute an error.

                    Criminal law — Evidence — Fresh evidence — Hair
clipping evidence relied upon by Crown to explain accused’s appearance at time
of arrest as well as after‑the‑fact change of appearance — New
forensic evidence reports and testimony to the effect that most hair clippings
did not originate from scalp — Whether accused’s motion to adduce fresh evidence
should be granted.

                    In
the early morning of July 6, 2002, two men, one wearing a blue/green
shirt, shot and killed C.M. in a Toronto nightclub.  E was seen leaving the
club in a car registered to the appellant H’s mother, with whom H lived.  Multiple
witnesses were able to confidently identify E as the shooter.  Given H’s
connection to the residence and a database lookup that revealed he had a prior
firearm conviction, the police considered him a suspect as well.  L.M., who
witnessed the shooting, was shown a lineup which included one photo of H that
was taken roughly two years earlier.  When asked about the identity of the
shooter in the blue/green shirt, she selected H’s photo.  Three weeks after the
shooting, L.M. participated in a second photo lineup which contained the photo
of H taken on the day of his arrest.  L.M. did not select any photo from this
sequence.  E and H were subsequently charged with the first degree murder of
C.M. and the attempted murder of his brother. 

                    The
Crown’s case against H consisted of testimony from L.M. and four pieces of
physical evidence: bullets found in a sock in a laundry hamper in H’s bedroom;
a white T‑shirt in the same hamper with one granule of gunshot residue on
it; hair clippings from a newspaper in the garbage of the bathroom nearest to
H’s bedroom; and hair clippings in an electric razor found in H’s nightstand. 
The Crown’s theory was that H shaved his head upon returning home from the
shooting.  This was necessary to explain the discrepancy between the eyewitness
testimony, which indicated that the second shooter had dreadlocks that were two
inches or longer, and the length of H’s hair when he was arrested, which was
very short.  It was also used to explain why L.M. was not able to identify H
based on the arrest photo shown to her three weeks after the shooting.  The
Crown also suggested that the haircut represented an after‑the‑fact
attempt by H to change his appearance to cover up his involvement in the
shooting.  The jury found E and H guilty of first degree murder of C.M. and
attempted murder of his brother.  In the Court of Appeal, H challenged his
conviction on the bases that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable and that the
trial judge erred in instructing the jury on eyewitness identification.  The
court found that the trial judge did not instruct the jury that it could
convict on L.M.’s testimony alone and held that the jury’s verdict was not
unreasonable because, despite weaknesses in L.M.’s eyewitness testimony, there
was other confirmatory evidence presented to the jury. 

                    While
the application for leave to appeal was pending before this Court, H filed a
motion to compel the Crown to release hair clipping
evidence for forensic testing.  H sought to forensically examine the hair
clippings to determine from what part of the body the clippings came.  This
Court allowed the motion.  H subsequently filed a motion to adduce the reports
and testimony of experts who conducted the forensic examination.

                    Held:
 The appeal should be allowed, the motion to adduce fresh evidence should be
granted and the matter should be remanded for retrial.

                    Per McLachlin C.J. and LeBel, Abella, Rothstein, Cromwell and
Wagner JJ.:  It would have been an error to instruct the jury that it
could convict H based on L.M.’s testimony alone.  Where the Crown relies on an
eyewitness identification, the trial judge has a duty to caution the jury
regarding the well‑recognized frailties of identification evidence.  However,
a properly instructed jury may conclude, notwithstanding the frailties of
eyewitness identification, that the eyewitness’ testimony is reliable and may
enter a conviction on those grounds.  This may be so even where the Crown has
relied on only a single eyewitness.  However, where the Crown’s case consists
solely of eyewitness testimony that would necessarily leave reasonable doubt in
the mind of a reasonable juror, the trial judge must direct an acquittal upon a
motion for directed verdict.  L.M.’s testimony, in and of itself, would not
have permitted a reasonable juror to conclude without reasonable doubt that H
was one of the shooters and therefore, it would have been an error for the
trial judge to instruct the jury that it could convict H based solely on L.M.’s
evidence.  While L.M.’s
testimony on its own could not have supported an inference of guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt, the trial judge’s instruction, read as a whole, did not
instruct the jury that it could convict H based solely on her testimony.  Rather, in reviewing L.M.’s testimony, the trial judge described each
of the specific problems with her identification and instructed the jury that
it must look to confirmatory evidence.  The trial judge was not circumscribed
to instruct the jury as to the sufficiency of L.M.’s testimony using any
particular words and he must be afforded some latitude in determining the best
way to convey to the jury the relevant legal principles and how they apply to
the evidence adduced at trial.  The trial judge put great care into his jury
charge and, in particular, into the instructions as to eyewitness evidence.  L.M.’s
testimony in conjunction with the confirmatory evidence was sufficient to
support the conclusion that H was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and, thus,
there was no error in the jury charge.

                    The
motion to adduce fresh evidence should be granted and a new trial should be
ordered.  H’s fresh evidence consists of affidavits and cross‑examinations
of two forensic experts, in which each expert provides an opinion as to the
percentage of hairs in the newspaper and the razor that came from H’s scalp, as
opposed to his face or trunk.  The experts agreed that the samples taken were
predominantly facial hairs.  The Crown’s experts conducted a paper review and
testified that there was no evidence to support the proposition that the hair
clippings represented a head shave.  The overriding consideration upon a motion
to adduce fresh evidence is “in the interests of justice” and this requires
consideration of the principles enunciated in Palmer v. The Queen.  The
Crown has conceded that the expert evidence H seeks to adduce is credible.  Mere
lack of knowledge on the part of H’s trial counsel without any indication that
he inquired into the possibility of obtaining and presenting the evidence is a
factor against admitting the evidence for the first time on appeal.  However,
in view of the fact that this is a criminal case, involving charges of the most
serious nature, the evidence should not be excluded solely on the basis of a
lack of diligence.  It cannot reasonably be disputed that H’s fresh evidence
bears on a decisive issue.  The
evidence of hair clippings was used to explain the discrepancy between the
eyewitness description of the shooter and H’s actual appearance at the time of
arrest.  This was also how the Crown explained L.M.’s
inability to identify H based on his arrest photo.  The hair clippings were also adduced as evidence that
H had attempted an after‑the‑fact change of his appearance.  The evidence was directly relevant to whether H was in fact the
shooter in the blue/green shirt.  The fresh evidence that H seeks to adduce could
reasonably be expected to have affected the jury’s verdict.  The Crown relied
heavily on the haircut evidence at trial.  The significance of the hair
clippings was also reflected in the jury charge.  The Court of Appeal too
recognized that the hair clipping evidence was significant to the Crown’s case
and noted that the hair clippings allowed for a powerful inference of guilt.  Given
the significance of the haircut to the Crown’s case, the fresh evidence could
reasonably be expected to have affected the result.  For these reasons, H’s
motion to adduce fresh evidence should be granted.  The appropriate remedy here
is a new trial.

                    Per Fish J.:  There is agreement that the appellant’s motion to adduce
fresh evidence should be granted, that the appeal should be allowed and that a
new trial should be ordered.  However, the trial judge made a fatal error by
instructing the jury that it could convict the appellant on the evidence of L.M.
alone.  

                    Crown
counsel asked the judge to instruct the jury that they could convict the
appellant on the evidence of one eyewitness alone.  Counsel made clear that he
was referring specifically to the testimony of L.M.  In his closing address,
Crown counsel proceeded on the understanding that the trial judge would charge
the jury to that effect. At no point in his charge did the trial judge correct
these assertions by the Crown.  Pursuant to the Crown’s closing argument, the
jury would thus have assumed that it was entitled to convict the appellant
based solely on L.M.’s eyewitness identification.  This misapprehension of the
law was reinforced by the trial judge in his instructions to the jury.  Although
the trial judge urged caution, he informed the jury in unmistakable terms that
the testimony of one eyewitness could properly ground a conviction.  The jury
would therefore have understood that this rule applied unless instructed
otherwise for a particular witness.  No such instruction was ever given.  On
the contrary, the trial judge explained that identification evidence is
stronger if the accused was previously known to the witness.  This was
indisputably a direct reference to L.M.’s evidence implicating the appellant.  The
trial judge’s subsequent instructions regarding L.M.’s evidence further
reinforced Crown counsel’s uncorrected statement to the jury that they could
convict the appellant on her photo identification alone.  It is not possible in
light of this record to conclude that the trial judge did not instruct the jury
that it could convict the appellant on the evidence of L.M. alone.

Introduction

[1]                             
Leighton Hay was convicted of first degree
murder and attempted murder for a shooting that took place in a Toronto
nightclub.  He appeals his conviction on two grounds.  First, he argues that
the trial judge erred by instructing the jury that he could be convicted based
solely on the testimony of the one eyewitness who implicated him at trial. 
Second, he has filed a motion in this Court to adduce fresh evidence, which, he
says, warrants acquittal or a new trial.  

[2]                             
I agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial
judge did not err in instructing the jury.  The eyewitness testimony against
Mr. Hay on its own could not have supported an inference of guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt; however, the trial judge’s instruction, read as a whole, did
not instruct the jury that it could convict Mr. Hay based solely on her
testimony.  

[3]                             
However, Mr. Hay’s motion to adduce fresh
evidence should be granted.  He has asked this Court to consider evidence from
two experts who have forensically examined hair clipping exhibits that the
Crown relied on at trial to establish that Mr. Hay shaved his head after the
shooting.  The evidence was used to explain the discrepancy between the
eyewitness description of the shooter and Mr. Hay’s actual appearance at the
time of arrest.  It was also adduced as evidence that Mr. Hay had attempted an
after-the-fact change of his appearance.  The fresh evidence indicates that the
hair clippings did not originate from Mr. Hay’s scalp.  In my view, Mr. Hay has
satisfied the standard for adducing fresh evidence articulated in Palmer v.
The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, at p. 775, and the appropriate remedy is a
new trial. 

II.      
Factual Background

[4]                             
In the early morning of July 6, 2002, two men
shot and killed Collin Moore in a Toronto nightclub.  The men also shot at
Collin’s brother, Roger Moore, who escaped with a graze to his forehead.  

[5]                             
The evidence at trial established that Collin
was hosting a monthly fundraising event at the nightclub.  Sometime after
midnight, three or four men arrived at the club and refused to pay the entry
fee.  Two of the intruders were Gary Eunick, who was seen wearing an orange
vest, and his brother, both of whom were known by multiple witnesses at the
club.  The intruders pushed their way into the lobby of the club.  When Collin
and Roger intervened, a fight broke out in which beer bottles were broken and
the glass door of the club was smashed.  

[6]                             
Following the fight in the lobby, Collin and
Roger retreated to the nightclub’s kitchen.  The intruders exited the club, at
which point Mr. Eunick was seen fidgeting with a gun in the parking lot. 
Minutes later, he and two of the other intruders, one wearing a blue/green
shirt, returned to the nightclub.  Mr. Eunick was armed with a semi-automatic
handgun and the man in the blue/green shirt carried a long barrel revolver. 
Mr. Eunick and the man in the blue/green shirt entered the kitchen, where they
shot Collin eight times, killing him.  They also shot at Roger, who was grazed
by a bullet and only slightly wounded.  

[7]                             
The owner of the nightclub saw Mr. Eunick
leaving the club in a green Honda and recorded the licence plate number.  The
car was registered to Lydia Hay, who resided at 6927 Chigwel Court, with her
daughter Lisa Hay, who was Gary Eunick’s girlfriend, and her son Leighton Hay,
the appellant.  The police arrived at the Chigwel residence within
approximately half an hour of the shooting, where they found the green Honda in
the driveway.  They surveilled the residence for approximately the next 10 hours.

[8]                             
While the police were surveilling the home, several
witnesses from the nightclub were shown photo lineups at the police station. 
Multiple witnesses were able to confidently identify Gary Eunick as the shooter
in an orange vest with the semi-automatic gun.  Given Mr. Hay’s connection to
the Chigwel residence and a database lookup that revealed he had a prior
firearm conviction, the police considered him a suspect.  Leisa Maillard, an
acquaintance of Collin Moore who was in the kitchen at the time the intruders
entered to shoot him, was shown a lineup containing a photo of Mr. Hay.  When
asked about the identity of the shooter in the blue/green shirt, she selected
Mr. Hay’s photo.  The details of that selection are discussed in more detail
later.  

[9]                             
Neither party proffered evidence as to whether
Mr. Hay’s photo was included in the lineups shown to witnesses other than Ms.
Maillard.  

[10]                         
At approximately noon, following the shooting,
Lisa Hay, Mr. Hay’s sister, emerged from the Chigwel residence and appeared as
though she was prepared to clean the green Honda.  At this point, the police
moved in, secured the residence, and arrested Gary Eunick and Leighton Hay. 
The men were subsequently charged with the first degree murder of Collin Moore
and the attempted murder of Roger Moore.

III.   
Procedural History

A.      
Trial Proceedings

[11]                         
Mr. Eunick and Mr. Hay were tried together on
both counts.  The Crown’s theory at trial was that Mr. Eunick and Mr. Hay were
the two men who entered the kitchen and shot at the Moore brothers. 

[12]                         
The identity of Mr. Eunick as one of the
shooters was never in serious doubt.  Mr. Eunick was identified by multiple
witnesses at the nightclub, including Collin Moore’s wife, who knew him, and
the club owner, who named him during his initial 911 call that night.  The
physical evidence connecting Mr. Eunick to the shooting was also overwhelming. 
The Crown introduced evidence of a palm print and blood found on the front door
of the nightclub that matched Mr. Eunick.  It also introduced evidence of
several items found scattered around the Chigwel residence that implicated Mr.
Eunick, including:  a shopping bag recovered from the back of the house
containing the orange vest he wore at the club, which had Mr. Eunick’s blood
and gunshot granules on it; a backpack containing a white T-shirt and blue
jeans, which had Mr. Eunick’s blood and gunshot residue on them; shoes in Lisa
Hay’s closet, which had glass shards in the treads from the broken door at the
club; bullets found in a sock in a hamper at the entrance to Mr. Hay’s bedroom,
one of which may have been cycled through (i.e. was at some point loaded in the
chamber of the semi-automatic handgun fired by Mr. Eunick); and Mr. Eunick’s
blood in the front passenger area of the Honda Civic.  

[13]                         
The Crown’s theory was that Mr. Hay was the
second shooter ― the man with the long barrel revolver wearing a
blue/green shirt.  Mr. Hay’s defence was that he never went to the club with
Mr. Eunick that night and was instead at home sleeping during the relevant
period.  

[14]                         
The Crown’s case against Mr. Hay consisted of
testimony from Ms. Maillard and four pieces of physical evidence: (1) the
aforementioned bullets in a sock, which were found in a laundry hamper at the
entrance of Mr. Hay’s bedroom; (2) a white T-shirt, which contained a particle
of gunshot residue, found in the same hamper; (3) hair clippings found in a
newspaper in the bathroom garbage; and (4) hair clippings found in an electric
razor in Mr. Hay’s nightstand.  An understanding of the relevance of each piece
of evidence and the overall strength of the Crown’s case is necessary to
evaluate Mr. Hay’s arguments on appeal. 

(1)     
Ms. Maillard’s Eyewitness Evidence

[15]                         
Ms. Maillard was the only eyewitness who
implicated Mr. Hay as one of the shooters.  She testified that she was in the
kitchen when the two shooters entered and that she focused her attention on the
shooter who was wearing the blue/green plaid button-up shirt with a white
T-shirt underneath and who carried a long barrel revolver.  She described him
as having two-inch long “picky” dreadlocks: A.R., vol. II, at p. 832.  According
to her testimony, she said to the shooter: “You don’t have to do this, you
know.  If you guys want to fight, just fight.  He has a wife and kids” (p. 835). 
At that point, the man turned to her, pointed his gun, and said, “Shut your
blood clot before I kill you” (ibid.).  Ms. Maillard continued to
focus on the man in the blue/green shirt, who moved further into the kitchen
and began firing at the Moore brothers.  After the fourth shot, she left the
kitchen and hid in the hallway.

[16]                         
As mentioned above, following the shooting, the
police suspected that Mr. Hay might be the second shooter and included his
picture in a photo lineup shown to Ms. Maillard.  The evidence at trial
established that the lineup contained 12 photos, one photo of Mr. Hay that was
taken roughly two years earlier and 11 photos depicting men with similar
features.

[17]                         
 Detective Derek Young provided Ms. Maillard
with a series of cautions before showing her the photo lineup.  In particular,
he informed her that he would be showing her a page with 12 photos on it that
may or may not include a photo of the suspect.  He informed her that she should
go through each of the 12 photos before selecting anyone and that she should
not rely heavily on facial features that might change.  He told her that if she
was able to identify the shooter with 100 percent positivity, she should say
so, and if not, she should provide a percentage on the likelihood that the
person she has selected was the suspect.

[18]                         
Det. Young’s and Ms. Maillard’s testimony
established that Ms. Maillard looked at each photo in the lineup and that when
she reached the photo depicting Mr. Hay, she became shaken up.  She pointed at
the photo and stated: “Out of all of these pictures this gentleman most fits
the description of the gentlemen I saw shooting”: A.R., vol. III, at p. 999. 
She stated to the investigating officer that in her belief, the photo of Mr.
Hay depicted the shooter in the blue/green shirt and on “a percentage scale I
would probably say maybe 80 percent” (pp. 979-80).  Det. Young then sought to
clarify her statement with the following exchange:

[Det. Young:]      Are you saying that this photograph depicts the
likeness about 80 percent of the person?

 

. . .

 

[Ms. Maillard:]     That’s
correct.

 

. . .

 

[Det. Young:]      That did
the shooting?

 

. . .

 

[Ms. Maillard:]     That’s
correct.

 

. . .

 

[Det. Young:]      But are you saying this is the person that did
the shooting?  I have to have a yes or no.

 

. . .

 

[Ms. Maillard:]     No, the photograph is about 80 percent . . . of
what depicts the likeness of the person that did the shooting. 

 

. . .

 

[Det. Young:]      Okay. 

 

. . .

 

[Ms. Maillard:]     I wish I could. [A.R., vol. III, at pp. 1014-16]

[19]                         
At trial, Ms. Maillard took the position that
she did intend to identify Mr. Hay as the shooter in the blue/green shirt.  She
explained her comment that the photo shared 80 percent of the likeness of the
shooter as follows:

I meant that
the photograph being a photocopy, about not being able to pick up the facial
hair, not being able to see, you know, knowing that it might not be a current
photograph of him, noting that his hair might be different, taking into account
all those factors that I was told and being — seeing someone get shot and
knowing that this is something very important that I was doing, picking
somebody, you know, out of a line-up that was responsible for a man dying, I
was being cautious.  [A.R., vol. II, at pp. 856-57]

[20]                         
According to Ms. Maillard’s testimony, a day or
two after the shooting, she called the police station “to find out whether or
not [her] I.D. was pretty much the right person or not”: A.R., vol. II, at pp.
893-94. 

[21]                         
Three weeks after the shooting, Ms. Maillard
participated in a second photo lineup, in which she was shown a number of
photographs in sequence and asked if any matched the shooter in the blue/green
shirt.  The photo sequence contained the photo of Mr. Hay taken on the day of
his arrest, following the shooting.  However, Ms. Maillard did not select any
photo from the sequence.  Ms. Maillard testified at trial that she just
“flipped through” the photos and stated that the arrest photo did not have a
gaunt face, as she had recalled the shooter at the club: A.R., vol. II, at p.
895. 

[22]                         
Finally, defence counsel elicited testimony from
Ms. Maillard that at the preliminary inquiry, she repeatedly identified Mr.
Eunick, not Mr. Hay, as the shooter in the blue/green shirt.  Ms. Maillard
testified that she erroneously pointed out Mr. Eunick because she was nervous
and scared, and because Mr. Hay had bulked up since the shooting.  

[23]                         
Ms. Maillard was not asked at trial if she could
make an in-court identification of Mr. Hay.  

(2)     
Physical Evidence:  Bullets, White T-Shirt and
Hair Clippings 

[24]                         
As mentioned above, the Crown introduced the
following physical evidence implicating Mr. Hay: (1) bullets found in a sock in
a laundry hamper in his bedroom, one of which may have been cycled through the
semi-automatic handgun fired by Mr. Eunick; (2) a white T-shirt in the same
hamper with one granule of gunshot residue on it; (3) hair clippings from a
newspaper in the garbage of the bathroom nearest to Mr. Hay’s bedroom; and (4)
hair clippings in an electric razor found in Mr. Hay’s nightstand.  

[25]                         
The bullets and white T-shirt implicated Mr. Hay
in the crime based on the location in which they were found ― the hamper
in his bedroom ― and the expert testimony associating them with the
shooting.  With respect to the bullets, the Crown’s firearms expert testified that
one of the unfired bullets found in the sock had been cycled through the
semi-automatic gun used by Mr. Eunick in the shooting.  Mr. Hay’s firearm
expert did not dispute the methodology or assumptions made by the Crown expert,
but testified that he was unable to reach the same conclusion.  It was
undisputed that if the bullets in the sock had any connection to the shooting,
it was to the semi-automatic gun fired by Mr. Eunick and not the long barrel
revolver used by the shooter in the blue/green shirt. 

[26]                         
The white T-shirt was tied to the shooting by
virtue of the eyewitness testimony that the shooter in the blue/green shirt was
wearing a white T-shirt underneath and the fact that the T-shirt was found on
the top of Mr. Hay’s laundry hamper with one speck of gunshot residue on it. 
The Crown’s theory was that Mr. Hay put the bullets and his white T-shirt in
the hamper upon returning home from the shooting.  

[27]                         
The defence argued that Mr. Eunick, who had
testified that he used the bathroom next to Mr. Hay’s bedroom upon returning
from the club, placed the bullets in Mr. Hay’s hamper, which was located just
inside the entrance to the bedroom.  In the process of doing so, Mr. Eunick
contaminated the white T-shirt on the top of the hamper with a single granule
of gunshot residue.  According to the defence, this was supported by the fact
that there was no gunshot residue found on any of the other items in the
hamper.  

[28]                         
The other physical evidence introduced by the
Crown was hair clippings obtained from two places: (1) a crumpled page of
newspaper dated three weeks earlier found in the waste basket in the bathroom
near Mr. Hay’s bedroom and (2) an electric razor found in the nightstand next
to Mr. Hay’s bed.  The evidence established that the hairs in the newspaper and
the razor were less than a centimeter long.  The hair was not submitted to a
forensic expert for trial and no expert testified regarding the hair.  

[29]                         
The Crown’s theory with respect to the hair
clippings was that Mr. Hay shaved his head upon returning home from the shooting. 
This was necessary to explain the discrepancy between the eyewitness testimony
― which indicated that the second shooter had dreadlocks that were two
inches or longer ― and the length of Mr. Hay’s hair when he was arrested
― which was very short.  It was also used to explain why Ms. Maillard was
not able to identify Mr. Hay based on the arrest photo shown to her three weeks
after the shooting.  The Crown also suggested that the haircut represented an
after-the-fact attempt by Mr. Hay to change his appearance to cover up his
involvement in the shooting.  

[30]                         
In addition to this physical evidence, the Crown
also introduced a videotape of the Chigwel Court residence recorded after Mr.
Eunick and Mr. Hay were arrested.  One scene in the video depicts a blue shirt
draped on a bunk bed in a second bedroom in the home.  However, the record does
not indicate that the Crown ever sought to seize the shirt, let alone submit it
for testing or present it to one of the eyewitnesses to make the case that it
was the blue/green shirt worn by the second shooter.  

(3)     
Jury Verdict

[31]                         
Based on the evidence described above, the jury
found Mr. Eunick and Mr. Hay guilty of first degree murder of Collin Moore and
attempted murder of Roger Moore.  

B.      
Ontario Court of Appeal, 2009 ONCA 398, 249 O.A.C. 24

[32]                         
In the Court of Appeal, Mr. Hay challenged his
conviction on the bases that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable and that the
trial judge erred in instructing the jury on eyewitness identification. 
Moldaver J.A., as he then was, wrote for a unanimous panel and dismissed the
appeal.  

[33]                         
The court held that the jury’s verdict was not
unreasonable because, despite weaknesses in Ms. Maillard’s eyewitness
testimony, there was other confirmatory evidence presented to the jury,
including the bullets and shirt found in Mr. Hay’s hamper and the hair
clippings, which allowed for the “powerful inference” that Mr. Hay shaved his
head after the murder to disguise his appearance (para. 36).  The court
acknowledged that the jury could have drawn multiple inferences from the
evidence presented, but concluded that this confirmatory evidence “put this
case over the unreasonable verdict threshold” (ibid.). 

[34]                         
With respect to the trial judge’s instruction to
the jury on eyewitness identification, Mr. Hay raised three arguments.  First,
he argued that the trial judge erroneously instructed the jury that it could
convict Mr. Hay on the evidence of Ms. Maillard alone.  The Court of Appeal
disagreed.  In its view, the trial judge did not instruct the jury that it
could convict on Ms. Maillard’s testimony alone.  Rather, the trial judge
instructed the jury that it must look to confirmatory evidence. 

[35]                         
Mr. Hay raised two other challenges regarding
the trial judge’s instruction on eyewitness evidence and challenged the trial
judge’s instruction on the planning and deliberation requirement for first degree
murder.  These challenges were rejected by the Court of Appeal and have not
been reargued before this Court.  

C.      
Motion for an Order to Release Exhibits 

[36]                         
While the application for leave to appeal was
pending before this Court, Mr. Hay filed a motion to compel the Crown to
release two pieces of evidence for forensic testing:  the hair clippings found
in the crumpled newspaper and the hair clippings found in the electric razor. 
Mr. Hay sought to forensically examine the hair clippings to determine from
what part of the body the clippings came.  This Court allowed the motion; see R.
v. Hay, 2010 SCC 54, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 206, at para. 10.  However, it
deferred consideration of any motion to adduce fresh evidence to be considered
with the appeal (para. 9).  

[37]                         
On December 1, 2010, the parties submitted a
proposed protocol for releasing the hair clippings and having them examined by
the Centre of Forensic Sciences.  This Court ordered that the hairs be released
and examined in accordance with that protocol.  Mr. Hay subsequently filed a
motion under s. 683  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , to
adduce the reports and testimony of experts who conducted the forensic
examination.

IV.       Issues

[38]                         
This appeal presents two issues:

(1)        Whether the trial judge erred by instructing the jury
that it could convict Mr. Hay based on Ms. Maillard’s eyewitness evidence
alone. 

(2)        Whether Mr. Hay’s motion to adduce fresh evidence should
be granted and if so, what is the appropriate remedy? 

V.      
Analysis

A.      
Jury Charge Regarding Eyewitness Testimony

[39]                         
Mr. Hay argues that the trial judge erred by
instructing the jury that it could convict him on Ms. Maillard’s eyewitness
testimony alone.  Like the Court of Appeal, I am of the view that Mr. Hay’s
argument should be rejected.  As I explain below, it would have been an error
to instruct the jury that it could convict Mr. Hay based on Ms. Maillard’s
testimony alone because it was too weak to establish Mr. Hay’s guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt.  However, read as a whole, the trial judge’s jury charge did
not instruct the jury that it could convict based on Ms. Maillard’s testimony
alone.  Rather, it instructed the jury that it must look to confirmatory
evidence.  It is not disputed that Ms. Maillard’s testimony in conjunction with
the confirmatory evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion that Mr. Hay
was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and, thus, there was no error in the jury
charge. 

(1)      Whether It Would Have Been an Error to Instruct the Jury That It
Could Convict Mr. Hay Based on Ms. Maillard’s Testimony Alone

[40]                         
The credibility and weight that should be given
to eyewitness testimony is an issue committed to the ultimate trier of fact
― here, the jury: R. v. Mezzo, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 802, at pp.
844-45.  It is well established that where the Crown relies on an eyewitness
identification, the trial judge has a duty to caution the jury regarding the
well-recognized frailties of identification evidence; see Mezzo, at p.
845, citing R. v. Turnbull, [1976] 3 All E.R. 549 (C.A.); R. v.
Hibbert, 2002 SCC 39, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 445, at paras. 78-79 (per Bastarache
J., dissenting, although not on this point); R. v. Canning, [1986] 1
S.C.R. 991.  However, a properly instructed jury may conclude, notwithstanding
the frailties of eyewitness identification, that the eyewitness’ testimony is
reliable and may enter a conviction on those grounds.  This may be so even
where the Crown has relied on only a single eyewitness; see Mezzo, at p.
844; R. v. Nikolovski, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1197, at para. 23.

[41]                         
Although the duty to assess the credibility and
weight of an eyewitness’ evidence sits with the jury and, in some
circumstances, the testimony of one eyewitness will support a conviction, the
jury should not be permitted to convict on the basis of eyewitness testimony
that could not support an inference of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  In other
words, a jury should not be instructed that it may convict based on eyewitness
testimony alone where that testimony, even if believed, would necessarily leave
reasonable doubt in the mind of a reasonable juror; see R. v. Arcuri,
2001 SCC 54, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 828, at paras. 21-25; R. v. Reitsma, [1998]
1 S.C.R. 769, rev’g (1997), 97 B.C.A.C. 303; R. v. Zurowski, 2004 SCC
72, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 509; United States of America v. Shephard, [1977] 2
S.C.R. 1067, at p. 1080.  Indeed, where the Crown’s case consists solely of
eyewitness testimony that would necessarily leave reasonable doubt in the mind
of a reasonable juror, the trial judge must direct an acquittal upon a motion
for directed verdict (Arcuri, at para. 21).  

[42]                         
In my view, it would have been unreasonable for
the jury to convict Mr. Hay based solely on Ms. Maillard’s eyewitness
testimony.  In addition to the usual frailties associated with eyewitness
identification and photo lineups, the evidence at trial established several other
problems with Ms. Maillard’s ability to identify Mr. Hay as the shooter.  As
described above, Ms. Maillard’s initial selection of Mr. Hay from the photo
lineup was accompanied by a statement that she was not identifying him as the
shooter, but as someone who shared 80 percent of the likeness of the shooter. 
Furthermore, within a couple of days of the shooting, Ms. Maillard called the
police to confirm whether the person she had selected was “pretty much the
right person or not”: A.R., vol. II, at pp. 893-94.  Also, the evidence
established that three weeks after the shooting Ms. Maillard was not able to
select Mr. Hay as the shooter based on his arrest photo taken the day of the
crime and that, at the preliminary inquiry, Ms. Maillard repeatedly identified
Mr. Eunick, not Mr. Hay, as the shooter in the blue/green shirt.  Each of these
events raised some doubt as to Ms. Maillard’s ability to identify Mr. Hay as
the second shooter.

[43]                         
To be sure, the Crown did adduce evidence to
address some of the problems with Ms. Maillard’s testimony.  It elicited
testimony from Ms. Maillard that, despite her statements to the contrary when
she selected Mr. Hay’s photo on the morning of the shootings, she did
intend to identify Mr. Hay as the shooter.  Furthermore, the Crown introduced
hair clippings found in Mr. Hay’s bathroom and electric razor to explain that
Ms. Maillard was unable to identify Mr. Hay based on his arrest photo because
he had cut his hair.  

[44]                         
In my view, however, this evidence does not
support the conclusion that Ms. Maillard’s testimony, on its own, provided a
basis for conviction.  Ms. Maillard’s testimony that she intended to identify
Mr. Hay as the shooter could not erase the reasonable doubt created by her
confirmation at the time of the photo lineup that she could not identify him as
the shooter and by her inability to identify Mr. Hay at the subsequent photo
lineup and at the preliminary inquiry.  Furthermore, although the Crown’s
explanation that Mr. Hay cut his hair after the shooting gave the jury a basis
for reconciling Ms. Maillard’s difficulty in identifying Mr. Hay in the second
photo lineup, the explanation itself relied on confirmatory evidence ―
the hair clippings.  It thus does not change the fact that Ms. Maillard’s
testimony, in and of itself, would not have permitted a reasonable juror
to conclude without reasonable doubt that Mr. Hay was one of the shooters.  

[45]                         
For these reasons, in my view, it would have
been an error for the trial judge to instruct the jury that it could convict
Mr. Hay based solely on Ms. Maillard’s evidence.  Indeed, in this appeal, the
Crown has not attempted to argue otherwise.  The Crown has instead argued that
the trial judge made no error because he never instructed the jury that it
could have convicted Mr. Hay based on Ms. Maillard’s testimony alone.  I turn
to that argument next. 

(2)     
Whether the Trial Judge Erred in Instructing the
Jury 

[46]                         
In my view, the Court of Appeal correctly held
that the trial judge made no error in instructing the jury regarding Ms.
Maillard’s eyewitness testimony. 

[47]                         
When reviewing a jury charge, “[a]n appellate
court must examine the alleged error in the context of the entire charge and of
the trial as a whole”:  R. v. Jaw, 2009 SCC 42, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 26, at
para. 32.  Where an impugned reference in a jury charge in isolation could be
understood to be an incorrect statement of the law, an appeal court will not
interfere if it is evident that, considering the charge as a whole, the jury
would have been properly instructed: ibid., at paras. 3 and 24.  

[48]                         
Furthermore, although appeal courts will
interfere when a jury has not been adequately instructed, a trial judge must be
afforded a certain degree of flexibility in instructing the jury; see R. v.
Avetysan, 2000 SCC 56, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 745, at para. 9.  A trial judge is
not required to use “any particular form of words” in instructing the jury
regarding the frailties of eyewitness evidence and, rather, must be afforded
considerable latitude in deciding how best to apprise the jurors about those
frailties: Turnbull, at p. 552; R. v. Candir, 2009 ONCA 915,
257 O.A.C. 119, at para. 110.  

[49]                         
In the present case the trial judge made the
following general remarks about the reliability of eyewitness evidence, prior
to revisiting in detail the evidence against Mr. Eunick and Mr. Hay: 

There
has been eyewitness testimony from a number of witnesses.  You must be very
cautious about relying on eyewitness testimony to find either of the two
accused persons guilty.  That caution is required because experience has taught
us that all identification evidence suffers from an inherent frailty.  Human
observations and recollections are notoriously unreliable in this area.

 

Indeed,
many cases of miscarriage of justice have been due to mistaken identification
by one or more responsible witnesses whose honesty was not challenged and who
had ample opportunity for observation, but whose identifications subsequently
proved to be erroneous.

 

You
may have no doubt that a witness or witnesses are certain in their own minds
that they observed and recognized the proper identifying characteristics, but a
convincing witness, who is perfectly honest, may also be mistaken.  A person
can be sure in his or her own mind about an identification and yet be
mistaken.  In that context, you must bear in mind the distinction between
credibility or truthfulness, as opposed to reliability or accuracy.

 

So
I repeat, ladies and gentlemen, you must be very cautious about relying on
eyewitness testimony alone to find either of the defendants guilty of any
crime.  In the past, there have been miscarriages of justice. Persons have been
wrongly convicted because eyewitnesses have made mistakes in identifying the
persons whom they saw committing the crime.

 

As
a result, you should look for confirmatory evidence to support the eyewitness
identification evidence.  If you find other evidence to support the eyewitness
identification evidence, you may decide that the frailties associated with a
conviction based only on identification evidence has been discounted.  It will
be up to you.

 

But
even if you find no confirmatory evidence ― even though you are to
exercise caution because of the frailties of eyewitness identification evidence
― you are, nevertheless, entitled to convict on the evidence of even a
single eyewitness if you accept that witness’ identification and find that it
proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  But you should exercise real caution
before convicting on this type of evidence alone. [Emphasis added; A.R., vol. V, at pp. 2145-46.]

Mr. Hay contends that the
last paragraph of this excerpt would have left the jury with the understanding
that it could have convicted him based on Ms. Maillard’s testimony alone.  

[50]                         
Taken in isolation, the statement that the jury
was “entitled to convict on the evidence of even a single eyewitness” may
appear to do that.  However, I agree with the Court of Appeal that such an
interpretation of the trial judge’s instruction is belied when the full context
of the jury charge is considered.  

[51]                         
As the Court of Appeal observed, the impugned
instruction was, as a general matter, a correct statement of the law.  As mentioned
above, a jury may convict on the basis of a single eyewitness’ testimony,
notwithstanding the frailties of eyewitness identifications, if the witness’
testimony could support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 

[52]                         
Furthermore, the impugned instruction was made
in the context of general instructions that applied to both Mr. Hay and his
co-defendant, Mr. Eunick.  With respect to Mr. Eunick, there were multiple
witnesses whose testimony could have supported a finding of guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt.  Witnesses Jennifer Moore and Hugh Robinson, for instance,
were both able to recognize Mr. Eunick from their past dealings and identify
him as one of the shooters during and immediately after the shooting. 

[53]                         
After the general instruction excerpted above,
the trial judge provided additional cautions regarding the frailties of
eyewitness testimony and then reviewed the evidence against each defendant. 
The trial judge’s instruction regarding the evidence against Mr. Hay did not
convey to the jury that it could convict Mr. Hay based solely on Ms. Maillard’s
testimony.  Rather, in reviewing Ms. Maillard’s testimony, the trial judge
described each of the specific problems with her identification, including her
inability to identify Mr. Hay at the second, sequential photo lineup ―
which he described as “a better way of showing photographs” than the first
photo lineup (A.R., vol. V, at p. 2178) ― and Ms. Maillard’s
misidentification at the preliminary inquiry.  After reviewing these problems
the trial judge stated:

You must be
very careful of the evidence of Ms Maillard because of the problems that I have
pointed out.  You should look for other evidence confirming her
identification. [Emphasis added; A.R., vol. V, at p. 2181.]

In addition, the trial
judge distinguished Ms. Maillard’s eyewitness account from the stronger
eyewitness evidence against Mr. Eunick: 

In the case
of Leisa Maillard, unlike Hugh Robinson and Jennifer Moore, she had never seen
the person she picked out of the lineup ― Leighton Hay ― before. 
Her evidence must, therefore, be approached with greater caution.  [A.R., vol.
V, at p. 2186]

[54]                         
I agree with the Court of Appeal that “[i]n the
face of those instructions, it is fanciful to think that the jury would have
convicted Hay solely on the eye-witness testimony of Ms. Maillard” (para. 48). 
Mr. Hay’s argument boils down to a contention that the trial judge was required
to say words such as “you may not convict Mr. Hay based on Leisa Maillard’s
testimony alone”.  However, the trial judge was not circumscribed to instruct
the jury as to the sufficiency of Ms. Maillard’s testimony using those
particular words.  He had a duty to “convey to the jury as trier of fact the
relevant legal principles and how they apply to the evidence adduced at trial”,
and he must be afforded some latitude in determining the best way to do so:  R.
v. Pickton, 2010 SCC 32, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 198, at para. 61.  A reasonable
juror instructed in the manner described above would not have interpreted the
impugned statement as an instruction that the jury could render a conviction
based solely on Ms. Maillard’s testimony; see Jaw, at para. 24.  

[55]                         
The record establishes that the trial judge put
great care into his jury charge and, in particular, into the instructions as to
eyewitness evidence.  The trial judge, for instance, gave a mid-trial
instruction to the jury regarding the frailties of eyewitness testimony
immediately after Ms. Maillard testified, in which he reiterated the problems
with her evidence.  At that time, he gave both parties an opportunity to object
and make submissions requesting additional instructions, but neither counsel
did so.  Furthermore, prior to instructing the jury at the end of the trial,
the judge held a pre-charge hearing, in which he accepted submissions on the
instructions relating to eyewitness testimony.  During that hearing, counsel
for the Crown and both defendants were all asked to consider the paragraph Mr.
Hay now impugns, and all counsel expressed satisfaction with its language. 
Counsel for Mr. Hay made several submissions regarding the problems with Ms.
Maillard’s identification, each of which the trial judge made note of and
subsequently included in his instructions to the jury.  At no time during any
of these hearings did any party express the view that the trial judge’s
instruction would convey to the jury that it could convict based on Ms.
Maillard’s testimony alone.  

[56]                         
For these reasons, I am of the view that the
trial judge did not err in instructing the jury and would dismiss this ground
of appeal. 

B.      
Motion to Adduce Fresh Evidence

[57]                         
As mentioned above, Mr. Hay has filed a motion
to adduce expert evidence regarding the forensic testing of the hair clippings
that the Crown introduced at trial.  Mr. Hay argues that the fresh evidence
establishes that the hair clippings did not come from a shave of Mr. Hay’s
scalp and that, as a result, acquittal or a new trial is warranted.  I explain
below that the motion to adduce fresh evidence should be granted and a new trial
should be ordered.  

(1)     
The Fresh Evidence

[58]                         
Mr. Hay’s fresh evidence consists of affidavits
and cross-examinations of two forensic experts, in which each expert provides
an opinion as to the percentage of hairs in the newspaper and the razor that
came from Mr. Hay’s scalp, as opposed to his face or trunk.  

[59]                         
Johanne Almer, a scientist at the Centre of
Forensic Sciences, examined the hairs introduced at trial.  In her initial
report, she concluded, based on an examination of the diameter and shape of the
individual hairs, that 68 percent of the hairs in the newspaper and 48 percent
of the hairs in the razor were indicative of facial or trunk origin.  The
remaining hairs could have been facial, trunk or scalp hair. 

[60]                         
Scientist Richard Bisbing, a second expert,
endorsed the methodology used by Ms. Almer.  After examining the hairs and Ms.
Almer’s work, he concluded that “the samples from the two items are
predominantly comprised of facial hairs” and that “[a]lthough the presence of
some scalp hairs cannot be excluded, there is no indication of a large number
of scalp hairs in either sample”: Application Record, vol. I, Tab D, at p. 3.

[61]                         
Mr. Bisbing recommended that a representative
scalp hair be obtained from Mr. Hay to improve the accuracy of the testing.  The
Crown consented.  After a representative scalp hair was obtained, Ms. Almer
conducted further examination and produced a second report affirming her
earlier conclusions.  She reported that if a particular outlier hair from Mr.
Hay’s scalp sample was excluded from her calculations, she would conclude that
at least 91 percent of the hairs from the newspaper and 70 percent of the hairs
from the razor did not originate from Mr. Hay’s scalp.  Mr. Bisbing also
conducted a second examination and agreed with Ms. Almer’s findings.  He
concluded: 

It can now be stated with a reasonable
degree of scientific certainty that the hairs from the clipper (Item 87) and
from the newspaper (Item 88) are populations of facial (beard) hair. Neither
sample contains a significant number of scalp (head) hairs to challenge this
conclusion.  [Application Record, vol. I, Tab E, at p. 3]

[62]                         
The Crown also hired two experts: David Exline,
a hair analyst, and Dr. Jeffrey Rosenthal, a professor of statistics.  Both
experts conducted a paper review of Ms. Almer’s and Mr. Bisbing’s reports
without personal examination of the hairs.  Much of the Crown experts’ analysis
focused on whether it was proper to exclude a hair obtained from Mr. Hay’s
scalp that Ms. Almer and Mr. Bisbing considered to be an outlier.  Both Mr.
Exline and Dr. Rosenthal testified that they would have included the outlier
hair.  However, both also testified that such inclusion would not have a
significant impact on the results and they would thus have reached conclusions
similar to Ms. Almer and Mr. Bisbing.  Consistent with Ms. Almer and Mr.
Bisbing, Mr. Exline testified that although he could not say with absolute
certainty that there were no scalp hairs among the hair clippings, there was,
as a scientific matter, no evidence to support the proposition that the hair
clippings represented a head shave.

(2)     
Whether the Motion to Adduce Fresh Evidence
Should Be Granted 

[63]                         
This Court considered the discretion of an
appellate court to admit fresh evidence under s. 610 of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, the predecessor of s. 683 , in Palmer.  The
overriding consideration upon a motion to adduce fresh evidence is “the
interests of justice”: Criminal Code, s. 683 ; Palmer,
at p. 775.  This requires consideration of the following principles: 

(1)   The evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due
diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that this general
principle will not be applied as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases:
see McMartin v. The Queen, [1964] S.C.R. 484.

 

(2)   The evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon
a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial.

 

(3)   The evidence must be credible in the sense that it is
reasonably capable of belief, and 

 

(4)   It must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when
taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected
the result. [p. 775]

Here, the Crown has
conceded that the expert evidence Mr. Hay seeks to adduce is credible and thus
satisfies the third factor.  As I explain below, the consideration of the
remaining factors leads to the conclusion that the fresh evidence should be
admitted. 

(a)      
Due Diligence

[64]                         
The due diligence criterion exists to ensure
finality and order — values essential to the integrity of the criminal process:
R. v. G.D.B., 2000 SCC 22, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520, at para. 19 (citing R.
v. M. (P.S.) (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (Ont. C.A.), per Doherty
J.A., at p. 411).  The due diligence requirement calls for an appellate court
to consider the reason why the evidence was not presented at trial: G.D.B.,
at para. 20.  However, this Court has recognized that “due diligence is not an
essential requirement of the fresh evidence test, particularly in criminal
cases” and that the “criterion must yield where its rigid application might
lead to a miscarriage of justice” (para. 19).  Nonetheless, it is an important
factor to be considered in the totality of the circumstances (ibid.).

[65]                         
Here, Mr. Hay submits that the fresh evidence
was not adduced at trial because his trial counsel was unaware that it was
feasible to perform forensic testing to determine whether hair clippings
originate from an individual’s scalp or another part of the body.  Mr. Hay has
submitted an affidavit from his trial counsel to that effect. 

[66]                         
In his reasons granting the order to release the
two exhibits for forensic testing, Cromwell J. inferred from the evidence
before him that it simply did not occur to any of the experienced criminal
lawyers that forensic testing of this nature was feasible:

This sort of forensic testing was not
conducted by the Crown in preparation for trial and was not requested on behalf
of the defence until several months after the appeal to the Court of Appeal had
been dismissed.  Defence counsel at trial indicates in his affidavit that he
was unaware that forensic analysis could distinguish between scalp and facial
hairs.  There is a letter in the record indicating that the applicant’s counsel
on the appeal to the Court of Appeal was similarly unaware of the feasibility
of such testing.  There is no evidence that the Crown was aware of this
possibility.  Given that it appears that no one requested such testing and the
potential importance of the result which might be obtained, I would infer that
it simply did not occur to any of the experienced criminal lawyers involved
that this testing was available.  [para. 8]

The parties have not
provided any reason why this conclusion should be reconsidered. 

[67]                         
In general, mere lack of knowledge on the part
of trial counsel without any indication that he inquired into the possibility
of obtaining and presenting the evidence is a factor against admitting the
evidence for the first time on appeal: McMartin, at pp. 490-91. 
However, in view of the fact that this is a criminal case, involving charges of
the most serious nature, I would not allow the evidence to be excluded solely
on the basis of a lack of diligence.    

(b)     
Whether the Evidence Bears on a Decisive or Potentially
Decisive Issue

[68]                         
It cannot reasonably be disputed that Mr. Hay’s
fresh evidence bears on a decisive issue.  As described above, the hair
clippings from Mr. Hay’s waste basket and electric razor were used in two
ways.  First, they were used to explain the discrepancy between the
eyewitnesses’ description of the shooter as having dreadlocks and the short
length of Mr. Hay’s hair at the time of his arrest.  This was also how the Crown
explained Ms. Maillard’s inability to identify Mr. Hay based on his arrest
photo.  Second, the hair clippings were used to implicate Mr. Hay by suggesting
that he had cut his hair immediately after the shooting as evidence of an
after-the-fact attempt to change his appearance.  

[69]                         
The evidence was therefore directly relevant to
whether Mr. Hay was in fact the shooter in the blue/green shirt.  

(c)      
Whether the Evidence Could Reasonably Be
Expected to Have Affected the Result

[70]                         
The fresh evidence that Mr. Hay seeks to adduce
could reasonably be expected to have affected the jury’s verdict.  The import
of the hair clippings is evident from comments made by the trial judge and
Crown counsel, the jury charge and the Court of Appeal’s analysis, each of
which I describe below. 

[71]                         
Although the Crown has sought to downplay the
significance of the hair evidence in this appeal, it relied heavily on the
haircut evidence at trial.  In his closing address, for instance, Crown counsel
painted the following picture for the jury:

When
they came home, they convened at the back of the house. Mr. Hay took off his
shirt and they began to task divide. They took Eunick’s bloody clothes to wash
them. At some point, an old piece of newspaper was laid out, and Leighton
Hay's short, short dreads were shaved off, possibly by himself but more likely
by Mr. Eunick because he knows how to cut hair. They were then dumped into the
toilet. They were taken off, and only the small hairs that weighed the least
stuck to that newspaper, and he crumpled it up and threw it in the garbage, and
that’s where it was, right on top, the last thing put in. Everything else was
flushed. 

 

Mr.
House makes something of the date of that newspaper. If I understood his
submission, the last time Leighton Hay would have shaved was June 18th. But
he keeps his hair shears for shaving in his night table. He shaved his head
that night. He threw the short dreads down the toilet. He left just the small
clippings in that piece of newspaper. 

 

Mr.
House, if he suggested to you ― and I thought he did ― that they
were all over the newspaper, they weren’t; they were wrapped up inside it.
Detective Sergeant Tony Smith testified to that. And he threw them in the
garbage. And the reason was to alter his appearance. There wouldn’t be much point
in hiding clothes and bullets, and leaving hair in the waste bin. It was in the
toilet. [Emphasis added; A.R., vol. VI, at pp. 128-29.]

[72]                         
Further, in comments made during the trial in
the absence of the jury and witnesses, the trial judge recognized that if the
Crown could establish that Mr. Hay shaved his head in the morning following the
shootings, it would be “powerful evidence” of his “identity” as the shooter and
that “he did it to alter his appearance”: A.R., vol. II, at p. 928.

[73]                         
The significance of the hair clippings was also
reflected in the jury charge.  The trial judge instructed the jury that because
Mr. Hay had a shaved head at the time of his arrest, the jury “must consider
whether the evidence establishes that Leighton Hay shaved his head that night
after he got home”: A.R., vol. V, at p. 2153 (emphasis added).  He
instructed the jury that it must consider confirmatory evidence before relying
on Ms. Maillard’s eyewitness testimony, given the frailties of eyewitness
identifications and her inability to identify Mr. Hay at the second photo
lineup and the preliminary inquiry.  He repeated multiple times that the
Crown’s explanation for Ms. Maillard’s inability to identify Mr. Hay based on
his arrest photo hinged on proving that Mr. Hay had cut his hair after the
murder, for which the only evidence was the hair clippings. 

[74]                         
The Court of Appeal too recognized that the hair
clipping evidence was significant to the Crown’s case.  In concluding that the
jury’s verdict was not unreasonable, the Court of Appeal explained that the
hair clippings allowed for a “powerful inference” of guilt which was sufficient
to “tip the scales and put this case over the unreasonable verdict threshold” (para.
36).  Given the significance of the haircut to the Crown’s case, Mr. Hay’s
fresh evidence indicating that the hair clippings did not come from a scalp
shave could reasonably be expected to have affected the result. 

[75]                         
For these reasons, I would grant Mr. Hay’s
motion to adduce fresh evidence.   

(3)     
The Appropriate Remedy

[76]                         
Having concluded that Mr. Hay’s motion to adduce
fresh evidence should be granted, I turn to the appropriate remedy.  This Court
has explained that where an appeal court is of the view that fresh evidence
would be conclusive of the issues in the case, it should dispose of the matter
accordingly: R. v. Stolar, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 480, at p. 492.  However,
where the fresh evidence is not so decisive that it would allow an immediate
disposition of the matter, but it nonetheless has sufficient probative force
that, if accepted by the trier of fact, it might have altered the result of the
trial, an appeal court should admit the evidence and direct a new trial: ibid.;
Palmer, at pp. 776-77.

[77]                         
The appropriate remedy here is a new trial.  As
I have explained above, the expert evidence indicating that the hair clippings
did not result from a scalp shave could reasonably be expected to have affected
the verdict.  However, it is not so decisive as to allow an immediate
disposition in the form of an acquittal.  The Crown, in its submissions on the
motion to adduce fresh evidence, has raised the possibility of certain
limitations or gaps in the expert evidence adduced in this appeal.  The
interests of justice require that the Court remit the matter for a new trial,
in which the Crown would have the opportunity to adduce evidence challenging
the reliability of the fresh evidence. 

VI.       Conclusion

[78]                         
For the foregoing reasons, Mr. Hay’s motion to
adduce fresh evidence is granted and the appeal is allowed.  The matter is remanded
for retrial.

                    The following are the reasons
delivered by

                    Fish J. — 

I

[79]                         
Like Justice Rothstein, and for the reasons he
has given, I would grant the appellant’s motion to adduce fresh evidence and
order a new trial.

[80]                         
Our sole disagreement relates to the trial
judge’s charge concerning the evidence of Leisa Maillard.  Justice Rothstein
finds that the trial judge did not instruct the jury that it could convict the
appellant, Leighton Hay, on the evidence of Ms. Maillard alone.  With respect,
I believe that he did.  

[81]                         
As we shall see, the trial judge and counsel
evidently thought so too.  The jury can hardly have understood the judge’s
charge differently.

[82]                         
This error is in my view fatal, though the
judge’s charge was otherwise flawless and eminently fair.  And I think it right
to add that the law in this regard is more certain now than it was at the time
of trial.

II

[83]                         
Leighton Hay stands convicted of first degree
murder and attempted murder.  Leisa Maillard was the only eyewitness who
implicated Mr. Hay in the fatal shooting of the victim.  In a photo lineup
conducted by the police, Ms. Maillard said she was “about 80 percent” sure that
Mr. Hay was the shooter, but could not answer that question “yes or no”.  She
did not identify Mr. Hay in court.  Other significant frailties in her evidence
are well set out in the reasons of Justice Rothstein (notably at paras. 15-23
and, compendiously, at para. 42).

[84]                         
In his pre-charge submissions, Crown counsel
nonetheless asked the judge to instruct the jury that they could convict Mr.
Hay on the evidence of one eyewitness alone (A.R., vol. V, at pp. 2004, 2008
and 2011).  Counsel made clear that he was referring specifically to the
testimony of Ms. Maillard (pp. 2008 and 2014).  Indeed, he could hardly have
been referring to anyone else: As mentioned earlier, no other eyewitness
implicated Mr. Hay.

[85]                         
Quite properly, Crown counsel assured the trial
judge that he “want[ed] to be able to fashion [his] closing address to the jury
in a way that’s responsible and consistent with what you’re going to be
telling them” (A.R., vol. V, at p. 2014; unless otherwise indicated,
the emphasis throughout is mine).  The trial judge replied that he “[did not]
have a problem” with the Crown’s request and indicated that he would charge the
jury to that effect, though not necessarily in the wording proposed (pp. 2011
and 2014).

[86]                         
In his closing address, Crown counsel proceeded
on that understanding. This was apparent from the very outset:

I suspect
His Honour will also tell you, after considering the strength of eyewitness
testimony you’re entitled to convict on it alone if it persuades you,
beyond a reasonable doubt, that the person identified was the shooter.  [A.R.,
vol. VI, at p. 111]

[87]                         
The Crown then emphasized to the jury that this
principle applied to the testimony of Leisa Maillard:

The
lawyer [for Mr. Hay] has made much of the fact that [Ms. Maillard] said 80
percent.  She explained to you what she meant.  80 percent is of the picture,
because it may be an older picture. . . . If you accept her explanation —
there’s no reason not to — you can convict on the photo lineup and [her]
visceral reaction [to it] all alone.  If you’re troubled by it, then your
troubles will be wiped away by the overwhelming confirmatory evidence in this
case, which under Canadian law makes up for any frailties you might find in the
photo lineup. [A.R., vol. VI, at p. 117]

 

And again:

 

You
could, in this case, convict Leighton Hay on Leisa Maillard’s photo lineup . . . . [p. 119]

[88]                         
At no point in his charge did the able and
experienced trial judge correct these assertions by the Crown.  This confirms
to me, particularly in light of the pre-charge discussions, that they conformed
to the judge’s own understanding of the law.

[89]                         
Pursuant to the Crown’s closing argument, the
jury would thus have assumed that it was entitled to convict Mr. Hay based
solely on Ms. Maillard’s eyewitness “identification”.

[90]                         
Unfortunately, this misapprehension of the law
was soon to be reinforced by the trial judge in his own instructions to the
jury.

[91]                         
Early in his charge, the trial judge made clear
to the jury that “the main issue in this trial is the identity of the people
who murdered Collin Moore” (A.R., vol. V, at p. 2144).  He then explained the
dangers associated with reliance on eyewitness evidence to establish guilt. 
Then, in some measure echoing Crown counsel’s prior submission, he instructed
the jury as follows: 

. .
. you should look for confirmatory evidence to support the eyewitness
identification evidence.  If you find other evidence to support the eyewitness
identification evidence, you may decide that the frailties associated with a
conviction based only on identification evidence [have] been discounted.  It
will be up to you.

 

But
even if you find no confirmatory evidence — even
though you are to exercise caution because of the frailties of eyewitness
identification evidence — you are, nevertheless, entitled to convict on the
evidence of even a single eyewitness if you accept that witness’
identification and find that it proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. [A.R.,
vol. V, at p. 2146]

[92]                         
Thus, although the trial judge urged caution, he
informed the jury in unmistakable terms that the testimony of one eyewitness
could properly ground a conviction.  The jury would therefore have understood
that this rule applied unless instructed otherwise for a particular witness. 
No such instruction was ever given.

[93]                         
More particularly, the trial judge never told
the jury that his general instructions that I have just quoted did not apply to
the testimony of Leisa Maillard.  On the contrary, soon afterward, he explained
that identification evidence is stronger if the accused was previously known to
the witness.  And he related this instruction specifically to “the
evidence against Leighton Hay” (A.R., vol. V, at p. 2148).  This was
indisputably a direct reference to Ms. Maillard’s evidence implicating Mr. Hay.

[94]                         
In any event, there could be no confusion
regarding which defendant the trial judge was referring to when he instructed
the jury that it was “entitled to convict on the evidence of even a single
eyewitness” (A.R., vol. V, at p. 2146).  Several eyewitnesses identified Mr.
Hay’s co-accused, Gary Eunick, as one of the shooters.  Only Mr. Hay was
identified by “a single eyewitness” — Ms. Maillard (ibid.). 
Accordingly, the only meaningful application of this general instruction was in
regard to Ms. Maillard’s testimony.

[95]                         
The judge’s subsequent instructions regarding
Ms. Maillard’s evidence, if anything, reinforced Crown counsel’s uncorrected
statement to the jury that they could convict Mr. Hay on her photo
identification alone — and reinforced as well the judge’s own instruction to
the same effect (reproduced above at para. 91).

[96]                         
For example, in terms virtually identical to the
judge’s general caution regarding eyewitness identification evidence, he later
instructed the jury that it “should look for other evidence confirming
her identification” (A.R., vol. V, at p. 2181).  Manifestly, the term “should”
deprives this instruction of imperative force.  And, with respect, I am unable
to find in this or any other passage that the trial judge “instructed the jury
that it must look to confirmatory evidence” (my colleague’s reasons, at
para. 39).

[97]                         
Finally, near the very end of his charge, the
trial judge once again indicated to the jury that they could convict Mr. Hay on
the evidence of Ms. Maillard alone.  Without any suggestion that this was wrong
in law, the trial judge referred to Crown counsel’s submission that “just based
on Leisa Maillard’s evidence alone you should be sure that the shooter
was Leighton Hay” (A.R., vol. V, at p. 2245).

[98]                         
As mentioned at the outset and with the greatest
of respect, I am unable in light of this record to conclude that the trial
judge did not instruct the jury that it could convict Mr. Hay on the evidence
of Ms. Maillard alone.

III

[99]                         
The Court of Appeal held, at para. 48, that
“[i]n the face of [the jury] instructions, it is fanciful to think that the
jury would have convicted Hay solely on the eye-witness testimony of Ms.
Maillard.”  My colleague Justice Rothstein agrees (para. 54).

[100]                     
Though patently speculative and certainly
unverifiable, that may in fact be so.  In light of the trial judge’s effort to
make clear to the jury that it should be cautious before convicting Mr. Hay
based solely on Ms. Maillard’s identification, it does appear unlikely that the
jury convicted Mr. Hay without any regard to the confirmatory evidence. 
Whether that is the case, however, is a question that we are neither called
upon nor entitled to resolve.

[101]                     
Rather, the issue that concerns us here is
whether the trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury, and not with why
the jury decided as it did — a matter beyond our ken.

IV

[102]                     
As stated at the outset, I agree with Justice
Rothstein that the appellant’s motion to adduce fresh evidence should be
granted, that the appeal should be allowed and that a new trial should be
ordered.

on appeal from the court of appeal for british columbia

                    Criminal law — Sentencing — Sentencing procedure — Guilty
plea — Joint submission on sentence from Crown and defence counsel — Whether
trial judge erred in departing from joint submission — Proper legal test trial
judges should apply in deciding whether it is appropriate in a particular case
to depart from joint submission.

                    A‑C
attended a drop‑in centre which provided assistance to people suffering
from mental health and addiction problems. He had a long‑standing mental
health disorder and substance abuse issues. On February 9, 2013, A‑C
punched a regular volunteer at the drop‑in centre, G, who fell, hit his
head on the pavement, and died. A‑C was 28 years old and had a prior
criminal record. After his arrest, he was taken to a mental health facility.
Following his discharge, A‑C breached his bail conditions and was held in
custody thereafter until his sentencing hearing, a period of approximately
11 months. After several days of trial, A‑C pleaded guilty to manslaughter
for his role in the death of G. The Crown and the defence made a joint
submission on sentence, proposing a further 18 months in custody with no
period of probation to follow. The trial judge applied a “fitness test” to the
joint submission and rejected it. He concluded that an appropriate sentence was
two years less a day, factoring in deductions for pre‑sentence custody,
and added a three year probation order. The Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed A‑C’s sentence appeal on the basis
that the sentence imposed was fit in the circumstances.

                    Held: The appeal should be allowed and the sentence varied to bring it
into conformity with the joint submission.

                    Joint
submissions on sentence — that is, when Crown and defence counsel agree to
recommend a particular sentence to the trial judge, in exchange for the accused
entering a plea of guilty — are vitally important to the well‑being of
the criminal justice system, as well as the justice system at large. Generally,
such agreements are unexceptional and they are readily approved by trial judges
without any difficulty. Occasionally, however, a joint submission may appear to
be unduly lenient, or perhaps unduly harsh, and trial judges are not obliged to
go along with them (Criminal Code, s. 606(1.1) (b)(iii)). 

                    There
is a lack of consensus regarding the legal test trial judges should apply in
deciding whether it is appropriate in a particular case to depart from a joint
submission. There are four possible approaches: the
fitness test; the demonstrably unfit test; the public interest test; and, the
approach that treats the fitness and public interest tests as essentially the
same. The public interest test is the proper legal test that trial
judges should apply. Under the public interest test, a trial judge should not
depart from a joint submission on sentence unless the proposed sentence would bring
the administration of justice into disrepute or would otherwise be contrary to
the public interest. For joint submissions to be possible, the parties must
have a high degree of confidence that they will be accepted. The public interest test, by being more stringent than the other tests proposed, best reflects
the many benefits that joint submissions bring to the criminal justice system
and the corresponding need for a high degree of certainty in them. 

                    Crown
and defence counsel are well placed to arrive at a joint submission that
addresses the interests of both the public and the accused. Trial judges should
not reject a joint submission lightly. They should only do so where the
proposed sentence would be viewed by reasonable and informed persons as a
breakdown in the proper functioning of the justice system. A lower threshold
than this would cast the efficacy of resolution agreements into too great a
degree of uncertainty. 

                    Where
the joint submission is contentious and raises concerns with the trial judge,
the following procedures should be followed. First, the trial judge should
approach the joint submission on an “as‑is” basis. Second, the
public interest test should be applied when a trial judge is considering going
above or below the sentence proposed in the joint submission, although
different considerations may inform the public interest in each context. Third,
the trial judge may inquire about the circumstances leading to the joint
submission — and, in particular, any benefits obtained by the Crown or
concessions made by the accused. Fourth, the trial judge should notify counsel
of any concerns and invite further submissions on those concerns, including the
possibility of allowing the accused to withdraw his or her guilty plea. Fifth,
if the trial judge’s concerns are not alleviated, the judge may allow the
accused to withdraw his or her guilty plea. Finally, if the trial judge remains
unsatisfied by counsel’s submissions, he or she should provide clear and cogent
reasons for departing from the joint submission.

                    In
the present case, the trial judge applied the fitness test, a less stringent
test than he should have applied, and in doing so, he erred in principle. In
view of the trial judge’s error, deference is not owed. Applying the proper
legal test — the public interest test — the sentence proposed by the parties
did not, in the circumstances, warrant a departure from the joint submission.
Indeed, it was close to the range of sentence identified by the trial judge.
Moreover, A‑C gave up his right to a trial and any self‑defence
argument he may have had. In the end, the trial judge’s deviation from the
recommended custodial sentence — by only six months — amounts to little more
than tinkering. In addition, the probation order should not have been made.
Counsel’s view that the probation order was duplicative and therefore
unnecessary to protect the public was reasonable in the circumstances.

The judgment of the
Court was delivered by 

[1]                             
Moldaver J. — Resolution discussions between Crown and
defence counsel are not only commonplace in the criminal justice system, they
are essential.  Properly conducted, they permit the system to function smoothly
and efficiently.

[2]                             
Joint submissions on sentence — that is, when
Crown and defence counsel agree to recommend a particular sentence to the
judge, in exchange for the accused entering a plea of guilty — are a subset of
resolution discussions.[1] 
They are both an accepted and acceptable means of plea resolution.  They occur
every day in courtrooms across this country and they are vital to the efficient
operation of the criminal justice system.  As this Court said in R. v. Nixon,
2011 SCC 34, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 566, not only do joint submissions “help to
resolve the vast majority of criminal cases in Canada”, but “in doing so,
[they] contribute to a fair and efficient criminal justice system” (para. 47). 

[3]                             
But joint submissions on sentence are not
sacrosanct.  Trial judges may depart from them.  That is what happened here. 
The appellant, Mr. Anthony-Cook, entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter on
the basis of a joint submission as to sentence.  The trial judge rejected the
joint submission and imposed a longer custodial sentence than the sentence
proposed by Crown and defence counsel.  He also imposed a probation order for
three years, even though the joint submission did not contemplate a period of
probation.  

[4]                             
The narrow issue before us is whether the trial
judge erred in departing from the joint submission proposed by the parties. 
The broader issue concerns the legal test trial judges should apply in deciding
whether it is appropriate in a particular case to depart from a joint
submission.

[5]                             
For the reasons that follow, I am respectfully
of the view that the trial judge in the present case applied a less stringent
test than he should have in choosing to depart from the joint submission — and
in doing so, he erred in principle.  The test he applied was a “fitness of sentence”
test.  The test he should have applied is whether the proposed sentence would
bring the administration of justice into disrepute, or would otherwise be
contrary to the public interest. 

[6]                             
In view of the trial judge’s error, deference is
not owed and we can look at the matter afresh, using the correct test to
determine whether the joint submission on sentence should have been accepted. 
Applying that test, I am satisfied that the sentence proposed by the parties
did not, in the circumstances, warrant a departure from the joint submission. 
Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and vary the sentence to bring it into
conformity with the joint submission.

I.             
Facts

[7]                             
On June 16, 2014, the appellant entered a plea
of guilty to manslaughter for his role in the death of Michael Gregory.  The
facts underlying his plea are as simple as they are tragic.

[8]                             
The Kettle Friendship Society is a society in
Vancouver, British Columbia, that provides services to individuals with mental
health and addictions issues.  The appellant has a long history of such
problems and from time to time, he turned to the Society’s drop-in centre for
assistance.  So too did Mr. Gregory although, in his case, in addition to
receiving assistance, he acted as a volunteer.

[9]                             
On the morning of February 9, 2013, Mr. Gregory
attended the centre but left at around 10:30 a.m. because he was feeling ill. 
At about the same time, the appellant was in the centre’s computer room.  One
of the other attendees complained about him causing a disturbance.  Staff found
him swearing and punching at a board near a computer.  They told him to leave,
which he did.  On his way out, he shouted at the staff and appeared angry and
upset.

[10]                         
As the appellant walked away from the drop-in
centre, he saw Mr. Gregory crossing the street, heading away from him.  The
appellant called out to Mr. Gregory, shouting words to the effect that he would
“kick his head in”.

[11]                         
Mr. Gregory shouted back, telling the appellant
to “smarten up” or “dummy up”.  He then changed direction and after catching up
with the appellant, grabbed him by the shoulder and began pushing him.  The two
men pushed each other.  Mr. Gregory continued yelling, and the appellant threw
three or four punches, none of which connected.

[12]                         
Mr. Gregory then backed away from the appellant
with his hands raised.  The appellant moved forward and threw two more punches,
striking Mr. Gregory in and around the head and neck.  The first blow stunned
Mr. Gregory, and the second knocked him unconscious.  Mr. Gregory fell
backwards.  His skull fractured when it hit the pavement.  He never regained
consciousness, and was pronounced dead at the hospital.  All of the punches
occurred within a matter of 10 to 20 seconds.

[13]                         
After Mr. Gregory fell, the appellant fled.  He
was located and arrested by the police about five hours later.  He was released
without charge the following day but was detained at a mental health facility
pursuant to a Director’s warrant issued under the Mental Health Act,
R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 288.  He remained in detention at a mental health facility
for about two months, until April 4, 2013, when he was taken into police
custody and charged with manslaughter. 

[14]                         
Four days later, the appellant was released on
bail with conditions.  One condition required that he reside at a mental health
facility unless discharged by his physicians.  In early July 2013, after
spending three months in a facility, the appellant’s physicians discharged him
into the community.  However, on July 19, 2013, he was arrested for breaching
the curfew condition of his bail order and his bail was revoked.  He was held
in custody thereafter until his sentencing hearing in June 2014, a period of
approximately 11 months.

[15]                         
Initially, the appellant entered a plea of not
guilty to the charge of manslaughter.  He changed his plea to guilty after
several days of trial.  He did so following a resolution agreement with the
Crown, under which the appellant would serve a further 18 months in custody —
in addition to the period of about a year he had spent in pre-trial custody — with
no period of probation to follow.  In exchange, the appellant would plead
guilty to manslaughter, thereby giving up his right to a trial, and with it,
the possibility of raising the defence of self-defence.

[16]                         
The appellant was 28 years old at the time of
his plea.  He has a criminal record dating back to 2007.  It includes
convictions for breaking and entering, theft, mischief, and failing to comply
with probation orders.  His criminal record does not reflect a history of
violence, apart from one conviction involving a minor assault.  The appellant
also has long-standing mental health and drug use problems.  He suffers from a
refractory psychotic disorder (schizoaffective disorder).  While there is no
suggestion that drug use played a role in the present offence, it has been a
factor in some of his prior offences.

[17]                         
At the sentencing hearing, the trial judge put
the Crown and defence on notice that he had serious reservations about the
joint submission.  He asked for further submissions.  He also invited the appellant
to apply to withdraw his guilty plea, if he wished to do so.  The appellant
declined the trial judge’s invitation.

[18]                         
The trial judge expressed two concerns with the
joint submission.  First, he noted that counsel had mistakenly overestimated by
some six months the amount of credit to which the appellant was entitled for
time spent in pre-sentence custody.  Crown counsel acknowledged the error, but
stated that it did not alter his position on the joint submission and he
continued to seek a further custodial sentence of 18 months.

[19]                         
Second, the trial judge was concerned that
without a probation order, the sentence would not adequately protect the
public.  In particular, he considered it important that the appellant refrain
from using non-medically prescribed drugs.  Counsel informed the trial judge
that a probation order would not be appropriate for two reasons.  First, it
would be duplicative because the appellant remained certified under the Mental
Health Act, and he would be supervised by his treatment team while living
in the community.  If his psychosis worsened or he failed to take his
medications, a warrant could issue requiring that he be returned to the
hospital, where he would remain until his team felt he was suitable for
release.  Second, counsel maintained that a probation order would set the
appellant up for failure because, in the past, he had experienced difficulty
complying with multiple reporting obligations due to his mental illness.

II.          
Decisions Below

A.          
Supreme Court of British Columbia (Ehrcke J.),
2014 BCSC 1503

[20]                         
The trial judge rejected the joint submission. 
While giving it “very careful consideration”, he concluded that it did not
“give adequate weight to the principles of denunciation, deterrence, and
protection of the public” (para. 68 (CanLII)).  In its place, instead of
sentencing the appellant to a further term of 18 months in custody, as
requested, he sentenced him to a custodial term of two years less a day (after
credit for pre-sentence custody) — a six month differential.  In addition, he
placed the appellant on probation for three years.

[21]                         
In departing from the joint submission, the
trial judge considered the circumstances of the appellant and the offence, and
various sentencing authorities provided by counsel.  He determined that three
years would be a fit sentence (before credit for pre-sentence custody), and
that any sentence below that “would be an unfit sentence” (para. 43).  In view
of his conclusion that the appellant was entitled to less credit for time spent
in pre-sentence custody than counsel had recommended, he increased the proposed
custodial sentence by six months in order to achieve the effective three-year
sentence he considered “fit”.

[22]                         
The trial judge also rejected the joint
submission to the extent that it did not include an order for probation.  He
considered that such an order was necessary to protect the public because the
treatment team could not control the appellant’s use of street drugs. 
Accordingly, he imposed a three-year probation order, which included a term
prohibiting the appellant from possessing or consuming non-medically prescribed
drugs.

B.           
Court of Appeal for British Columbia (Neilson,
Bennett and Garson JJ.A.), 2015 BCCA 22, 367 B.C.A.C. 96

[23]                         
The Court of Appeal for British Columbia
unanimously dismissed the appellant’s sentence appeal.  Justice Garson, writing
for the court, concluded that the sentence imposed was “fit in the
circumstances” (para. 1).

[24]                         
The court accepted the Crown’s position that it
was unnecessary to decide the test for departing from a joint submission.  In
its view, the trial judge did not err in his assessment of the appropriate
range of sentence, and it was open to him to decline to give the appellant any
credit for time spent in a mental health facility.  Reading the trial judge’s
reasons as a whole, it was clear that he viewed the joint submission as neither
fit, nor in the public interest, having regard to the risk to the public the
appellant posed should he use illegal drugs and fail to comply with his
treatment regime.  In short, the court found no error in the trial judge’s
reasoning or in the sentence he imposed.  

III.       
Analysis

[25]                         
It is an accepted and entirely desirable
practice for Crown and defence counsel to agree to a joint submission on
sentence in exchange for a plea of guilty.  Agreements of this nature are
commonplace and vitally important to the well-being of our criminal justice
system, as well as our justice system at large.  Generally, such agreements are
unexceptional and they are readily approved by trial judges without any
difficulty.  Occasionally, however, a joint submission may appear to be unduly
lenient, or perhaps unduly harsh, and trial judges are not obliged to go along
with them (Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 606(1.1) (b)(iii)). 
In such cases, trial judges need a test against which to measure the
acceptability of the joint submission.  The question is: What test?  

[26]                         
Not unexpectedly, the answer is contentious. 
Provincial appellate courts across the country do not agree on a uniform test,
nor do the parties or the various interveners who appeared before us.  Minor
variations aside, four possible tests or approaches emerge from the submissions
we received.  

[27]                         
The first of these is the “fitness” test.  Under
this test, trial judges should give joint submissions serious consideration,
but may depart from them if, having regard to the circumstances of the case and
the applicable sentencing principles, they conclude that the proposed sentence
is not “fit”.  Some provincial appellate courts use this test, most commonly in
the western provinces (see, for example, R. v. G.W.C., 2000 ABCA
333, 277 A.R. 20, at paras. 17-18; R. v. Bezdan, 2001 BCCA 215, 154
B.C.A.C. 122, at para. 15; R. v. MacIvor, 2003 NSCA 60, 215 N.S.R. (2d)
344, at para. 31).  Crown counsel for the respondent urged us to adopt this
test, arguing that it best reflects the trial judge’s duty to come to an
independent decision regarding the appropriate sentence.  

[28]                         
The second test is also a “fitness” test,
although of a different kind.  It resembles the standard of review that
appellate courts apply on sentencing appeals in circumstances where the
sentence imposed by the trial judge is entitled to deference.  Under this test,
trial judges should not depart from a joint submission unless they conclude
that the sentence proposed is “demonstrably unfit” (R. v. Lacasse, 2015
SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, at para. 11).  This is clearly a more stringent
test than the simple “fitness” test.  However, the parties did not point us to
any appellate decisions that have adopted it, and I am aware of none.

[29]                         
The third test, commonly referred to as the
“public interest” test, was developed in the Report of the Attorney
General’s Advisory Committee on Charge Screening, Disclosure, and Resolution
Discussions (1993) (the “Martin Committee Report”).[2]  Under this test, trial
judges “should not depart from a joint submission unless the proposed sentence
would bring the administration of justice into disrepute, or is otherwise not
in the public interest” (p. 327 (emphasis deleted)).  This test has also been
adopted by a number of provincial appellate courts (see, for example, R. v.
Dorsey (1999), 123 O.A.C. 342, at para. 11; R. v. Druken, 2006 NLCA
67, 261 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 271, at para. 29; R. v. Nome, 2002 BCCA
468, 172 B.C.A.C. 183, at paras. 13-14).  The appellant supports this test,
largely because it provides “a high threshold and is intended to foster
confidence in an accused, who has given up his right to a trial, that the joint
submission he obtained in return for a plea of guilty will be respected by the
sentencing judge” (R. v. Cerasuolo (2001), 151 C.C.C. (3d) 445 (Ont.
C.A.), at para. 8). 

[30]                   
And, finally,
some courts, most notably in Quebec, treat the fitness and public interest
tests as essentially the same, and use the language of the two tests
interchangeably (though in Quebec “reasonableness” is used in place of
“fitness”: see, for example, R. v. Douglas (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 37
(C.A.), at para. 51; R.
v. Dion, 2015 QCCA 1826, at para. 14 (CanLII); R. v. Dumont, 2013
QCCA 576, at para. 12 (CanLII); R. v. Mailhot, 2013 QCCA 870, at para. 7 (CanLII)).  Perhaps the best example of
this is found in Douglas, an oft-referred to decision of the Quebec Court
of Appeal in which Fish J.A. (as he then was) said: 

     In my
view, a reasonable joint submission cannot be said to “bring the administration
of justice into disrepute”.  An unreasonable joint submission, on the
other hand, is surely “contrary to the public interest”.  Accordingly,
though it is purposively framed in striking and evocative terms, I do not
believe that the [public interest test] departs substantially from the test of
reasonableness articulated by other courts, including our own.  Their
shared conceptual foundation is that the interests of justice are well served
by the acceptance of a joint submission on sentence accompanied by a negotiated
plea of guilty ― provided, of course, that the sentence jointly proposed
falls within the acceptable range and the plea is warranted by the facts
admitted.  [Endnote omitted; para. 51.]

[31]                         
Having
considered the various options, I believe that the public interest test, as
amplified in these reasons, is the proper test.  It is more stringent than the
other tests proposed and it best reflects the many benefits that joint
submissions bring to the criminal justice system and the corresponding need for
a high degree of certainty in them.  Moreover, it is distinct from the
“fitness” tests used by trial judges and appellate courts in conventional
sentencing hearings and, in that sense, helps to keep trial judges focused on
the unique considerations that apply when assessing the acceptability of a
joint submission.  To the extent Douglas holds otherwise, I am
respectfully of the view that it is wrongly decided and should not be followed.

A.          
The Proper Test

[32]                         
Under the public interest test, a trial judge
should not depart from a joint submission on sentence unless the proposed
sentence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute or is
otherwise contrary to the public interest.  But, what does this threshold
mean?  Two decisions from the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal are
helpful in this regard.

[33]                         
In Druken, at para. 29, the court held
that a joint submission will bring the administration of justice into disrepute
or be contrary to the public interest if, despite the public interest
considerations that support imposing it, it is so “markedly out of line with
the expectations of reasonable persons aware of the circumstances of the case
that they would view it as a break down in the proper functioning of the
criminal justice system”.  And, as stated by the same court in R. v. B.O.2,
2010 NLCA 19, at para. 56 (CanLII), when assessing a joint submission, trial
judges should “avoid rendering a decision that causes an informed and
reasonable public to lose confidence in the institution of the courts”. 

[34]                         
In my view, these powerful statements capture
the essence of the public interest test developed by the Martin Committee. 
They emphasize that a joint submission should not be rejected lightly, a
conclusion with which I agree.  Rejection denotes a submission so unhinged from
the circumstances of the offence and the offender that its acceptance would
lead reasonable and informed persons, aware of all the relevant circumstances,
including the importance of promoting certainty in resolution discussions, to
believe that the proper functioning of the justice system had broken down. 
This is an undeniably high threshold — and for good reason, as I shall explain.

B.           
Why a Stringent
Test Is Required 

[35]                         
Guilty pleas in exchange for joint submissions
on sentence are a “proper and necessary part of the administration of criminal
justice” (Martin Committee Report, at p. 290).  When plea resolutions are
“properly conducted [they] benefit not only the accused, but also victims,
witnesses, counsel, and the administration of justice generally” (ibid.,
at p. 281 (emphasis deleted)).

[36]                         
Accused persons benefit by pleading guilty in
exchange for a joint submission on sentence (see D. Layton and M. Proulx, Ethics
and Criminal Law (2nd ed. 2015), at p. 436).  The most obvious benefit is
that the Crown agrees to recommend a sentence that the accused is prepared to
accept.  This recommendation is likely to be more lenient than the accused
might expect after a trial and/or contested sentencing hearing.  Accused
persons who plead guilty promptly are able to minimize the stress and legal
costs associated with trials.  Moreover, for those who are truly remorseful, a
guilty plea offers an opportunity to begin making amends.  For many accused,
maximizing certainty as to the outcome is crucial — and a joint submission,
though not inviolable, offers considerable comfort in this regard.

[37]                         
The Martin Committee recognized this.  As it
noted at p. 328 of its report, the most important factor in the “ability to
conclude resolution agreements, thereby deriving the benefits that such
agreements bring, is that of certainty”.  Generally speaking, accused persons
will not give up their right to a trial on the merits, and all the procedural
safeguards it entails, unless they have “some assurance that [trial judges]
will in most instances honour agreements entered into by the Crown” (Cerasuolo,
at para. 9).

[38]                         
The Crown also relies on the certainty of joint
submissions.  Agreements that are certain are attractive to the Crown “because
there is less risk that what Crown counsel concludes is an appropriate
resolution of the case in the public interest will be undercut” (Martin Committee
Report, at p. 328).

[39]                         
From the Crown’s perspective, the certain or
near certain acceptance of joint submissions on sentence offers several
potential benefits.  First, the guarantee of a conviction that comes with a
guilty plea makes resolution desirable (Martin Committee Report, at pp.
285-86).  The Crown’s case may suffer from flaws, such as an unwilling witness,
a witness of dubious worth, or evidence that is potentially inadmissible —
problems that can lead to an acquittal.  By agreeing to a joint submission in
exchange for a guilty plea, the Crown avoids this risk.  Second, the accused
may have information or testimony to offer the Crown that can prove invaluable
to other investigations or prosecutions.  But this information may not be
forthcoming absent an agreement as to a joint submission.  Third, the Crown may
consider it best to resolve a particular case for the benefit of victims or
witnesses.  When an accused pleads guilty in exchange for a joint submission on
sentence, victims and witnesses are spared the “the emotional cost of a trial”
(R. v. Edgar, 2010 ONCA 529, 101 O.R. (3d) 161, at para. 111). 
Moreover, victims may obtain some comfort from a guilty plea, given that it
“indicates an accused’s acknowledgement of responsibility and may amount to an
expression of remorse” (ibid.).

[40]                         
In addition to the many benefits that joint
submissions offer to participants in the criminal justice system, they play a
vital role in contributing to the administration of justice at large.  The
prospect of a joint submission that carries with it a high degree of certainty
encourages accused persons to enter a plea of guilty.  And guilty pleas save
the justice system precious time, resources, and expenses, which can be
channeled into other matters.  This is no small benefit.  To the extent that
they avoid trials, joint submissions on sentence permit our justice system to
function more efficiently.  Indeed, I would argue that they permit it to
function.  Without them, our justice system would be brought to its knees, and
eventually collapse under its own weight. 

[41]                         
But as I have said, for joint submissions to be
possible, the parties must have a high degree of confidence that they will be
accepted.  Too much doubt and the parties may choose instead to accept the
risks of a trial or a contested sentencing hearing.  The accused in particular
will be reluctant to forgo a trial with its attendant safeguards, including the
crucial ability to test the strength of the Crown’s case, if joint submissions
come to be seen as an insufficiently certain alternative.  

[42]                         
Hence, the importance of trial judges exhibiting
restraint, rejecting joint submissions only where the proposed sentence would
be viewed by reasonable and informed persons as a breakdown in the proper
functioning of the justice system.  A lower threshold than this would cast the
efficacy of resolution agreements into too great a degree of uncertainty.  The
public interest test ensures that these resolution agreements are afforded a
high degree of certainty.

[43]                         
At the same time, this test also recognizes that
certainty of outcome is not “the ultimate goal of the sentencing process. 
Certainty must yield where the harm caused by accepting the joint submission is
beyond the value gained by promoting certainty of result” (R. v. DeSousa,
2012 ONCA 254, 109 O.R. (3d) 792, per Doherty J.A., at para. 22). 

[44]                         
Finally, I note that a high threshold for
departing from joint submissions is not only necessary to obtain all the
benefits of joint submissions, it is appropriate.  Crown and defence counsel
are well placed to arrive at a joint submission that reflects the interests of
both the public and the accused (Martin Committee Report, at p. 287).  As a
rule, they will be highly knowledgeable about the circumstances of the offender
and the offence and the strengths and weaknesses of their respective
positions.  The Crown is charged with representing the community’s interest in
seeing that justice is done (R. v. Power, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 601, at p.
616).  Defence counsel is required to act in the accused’s best interests,
which includes ensuring that the accused’s plea is voluntary and informed (see,
for example, Law Society of British Columbia, Code of Professional Conduct
for British Columbia (online), rule 5.1-8).  And both counsel are bound
professionally and ethically not to mislead the court (ibid., rule
2.1-2(c)).  In short, they are entirely capable of arriving at resolutions that
are fair and consistent with the public interest (Martin Committee Report, at
p. 287).

[45]                         
Bearing in mind these benefits and the need for
certainty, I turn to the other tests proposed by the respondent Crown and some
of the interveners.

C.           
The Fitness of Sentence and Demonstrably Unfit
Tests Should Be Rejected

[46]                         
As indicated, the position of the respondent is
that while trial judges should give serious consideration to joint submissions,
such submissions may be rejected on a simple “fitness” test.  With respect,
this test is not sufficiently stringent.  Under it, trial judges must ask what
a fit or appropriate sentence would be, instead of asking whether the
sentence proposed would be viewed by reasonable and informed persons as a
breakdown in the proper functioning of the justice system.  In short, the
“fitness” test does not direct trial judges to approach joint submissions from
a position of restraint.  Rather, it sends a different, and in my view, a wrong
signal: that they may interfere if they have a different view of what a “fit”
sentence would be.  If trial judges were free to interfere on this basis, the
result would be to “effectively eliminate the use of plea bargaining as part of
the criminal prosecution process” (R. v. Oxford, 2010 NLCA 45, 299 Nfld.
& P.E.I.R. 327, at para. 55).  

[47]                         
While the “demonstrably unfit” test used by
appellate courts is undoubtedly a higher threshold than the simple “fitness”
test, in rare cases, this threshold may not be sufficiently robust for the
joint submission context.  I would not rule out the possibility that a sentence
which would otherwise be considered demonstrably unfit absent a joint
submission may nonetheless be acceptable in the context of one.  For example,
take the case of an accused involved in a very serious crime that the Crown may
have difficulty proving because of deficiencies in its case.  The accused
agrees to plead guilty, and to assist the Crown in prosecuting his co-conspirators
for this and other more serious offences.  The Crown might reasonably conclude
that it is in the public interest to agree, by way of a joint submission, to a
very lenient sentence in order to obtain the accused’s guilty plea and his
assistance.  In short, a very lenient, even “demonstrably unfit” sentence may,
in a particular case, serve the greater good. 

[48]                         
Further, both the fitness test and the appellate
“demonstrably unfit” test suffer from a similar flaw: they are designed for
different contexts.  As such, there is an appreciable risk that the approaches
which apply to conventional sentencing hearings or sentencing appeals will be
conflated with the approach that must be adhered to on a joint submission.  In
conventional sentencing hearings, trial judges look at the circumstances of the
offender and the offence, and the applicable sentencing principles.  They are
not asked to consider the critical systemic benefits that flow from joint
submissions, namely, the ability of the justice system to function fairly and
efficiently.  Similarly, appellate courts are not bound to consider these
systemic benefits on a conventional sentencing appeal.  The public interest
test avoids these pitfalls.

D.          
Guidance for Trial Judges 

[49]                         
Finally, I would offer some brief guidance to
trial judges on the approach they should follow when they are troubled by a
joint submission on sentence.

[50]                         
Courts across the country are generally in
agreement on the procedure judges should follow when they are inclined to
depart from a joint submission (see, for example, B.O.2, at paras.
74-82; R. v. Sinclair, 2004 MBCA 48, 185 C.C.C. (3d) 569,
at para. 17; G.W.C., at para. 26).  The parties and interveners
emphasize the importance of procedure.  It ensures that joint submissions are
given proper consideration, and that accused persons — who have already entered
a plea of guilty — are treated fairly.  The following procedures reflect
practical wisdom gained from the experience of our trial and appellate courts. 
They are meant to apply only to those cases where the joint submission is
contentious and raises concerns with the trial judge.  As I mentioned earlier,
most joint submissions are unexceptional and are readily approved by trial
judges without any difficulty.[3]


[51]                         
First, trial judges should approach the joint
submission on an “as-is” basis.  That is to say, the public interest test
applies whether the judge is considering varying the proposed sentence or
adding something to it that the parties have not mentioned, for example, a
probation order.  If the parties have not asked for a particular order, the
trial judge should assume that it was considered and excluded from the joint
submission.  However, if counsel have neglected to include a mandatory order,
the judge should not hesitate to inform counsel.  The need for certainty in
joint submissions cannot justify failing to impose a mandatory order.

[52]                         
Second, trial judges should apply the public
interest test when they are considering “jumping” or “undercutting” a joint
submission (DeSousa, per Doherty J.A.). That is not to say that the
analysis will be the same in either case.  On the contrary, from the accused’s
perspective, “undercutting” does not engage concerns about fair trial rights or
undermine confidence in the certainty of plea negotiations. In addition, in assessing whether the severity of a
joint submission would offend the public interest, trial judges should be
mindful of the power imbalance that may exist between the Crown and defence,
particularly where the accused is self-represented or in custody at the time of
sentencing. These factors may temper the public interest in certainty and
justify “undercutting” in limited circumstances. At the same time, where the trial judge is considering “undercutting”, he or she
should bear in mind that the community’s confidence in the administration of
justice may suffer if an accused enjoys the benefits of a joint submission
without having to serve the agreed-upon sentence (see DeSousa, at paras.
23-24).

[53]                         
Third, when faced with a contentious joint
submission, trial judges will undoubtedly want to know about the circumstances
leading to the joint submission — and in particular, any benefits obtained by
the Crown or concessions made by the accused.  The greater the benefits
obtained by the Crown, and the more concessions made by the accused, the more
likely it is that the trial judge should accept the joint submission, even
though it may appear to be unduly lenient.  For example, if the joint
submission is the product of an agreement by the accused to assist the Crown or
police, or an evidentiary weakness in the Crown’s case, a very lenient sentence
might not be contrary to the public interest.  On the other hand, if the joint
submission resulted only from the accused’s realization that conviction was
inevitable, the same sentence might cause the public to lose confidence in the
criminal justice system. 

[54]                         
Counsel should, of course, provide the court
with a full account of the circumstances of the offender, the offence, and the
joint submission without waiting for a specific request from the trial judge. 
As trial judges are obliged to depart only rarely from joint submissions, there
is a “corollary obligation upon counsel” to ensure that they “amply justify
their position on the facts of the case as presented in open court” (Martin
Committee Report, at p. 329).  Sentencing — including sentencing based on a
joint submission — cannot be done in the dark.  The Crown and the defence must
“provide the trial judge not only with the proposed sentence, but with a full
description of the facts relevant to the offender and the offence”, in order to
give the judge “a proper basis upon which to determine whether [the joint
submission] should be accepted” (DeSousa, at para. 15; see also Sinclair,
at para. 14).

[55]                         
This is not to say that counsel must inform the
trial judge of “their negotiating positions or the substance of their
discussions leading to the agreement” (R. v. Tkachuk, 2001 ABCA 243, 293
A.R. 171, at para. 34).  But counsel must be able to inform the trial judge why
the proposed sentence would not bring the administration of justice into
disrepute or otherwise be contrary to the public interest.  If they do not,
they run the risk that the trial judge will reject the joint submission. 

[56]                         
There may, of course, be cases where it is not
possible to put the main considerations underlying a joint submission on the
public record because of safety or privacy concerns, or the risk of
jeopardizing ongoing criminal investigations (see Martin Committee Report, at
p. 317).  In such cases, counsel must find alternative means of communicating
these considerations to the trial judge in order to ensure that the judge is
apprised of the relevant considerations and that a proper record is created for
appeal purposes.  

[57]                         
A thorough justification of the joint submission
also has an important public perception component.  Unless counsel put the
considerations underlying the joint submission on the record, “though justice
may be done, it may not have the appearance of being done; the public may
suspect, rightly or wrongly, that an impropriety has occurred” (C. C. Ruby, G.
J. Chan and N. R. Hasan, Sentencing (8th ed. 2012), at p. 73).  

[58]                         
Fourth, if the trial judge is not satisfied with
the sentence proposed by counsel, “fundamental fairness dictates that an
opportunity be afforded to counsel to make further submissions in an attempt to
address the . . . judge’s concerns before the sentence is imposed” (G.W.C.,
at para. 26).  The judge should notify counsel that he or she has concerns, and
invite further submissions on those concerns, including the possibility of
allowing the accused to withdraw his or her guilty plea, as the trial judge did
in this case.  

[59]                         
Fifth, if the trial judge’s concerns about the joint
submission are not alleviated, the judge may allow the accused to apply to
withdraw his or her guilty plea.  The circumstances in which a plea may be
withdrawn need not be settled here.  However, by way of example, withdrawal may
be permitted where counsel have made a fundamental error about the legality of
the proposed joint submission, for example, where a conditional sentence has
been proposed but is unavailable. 

[60]                         
Finally, trial judges who remain unsatisfied by
counsel’s submissions should provide clear and cogent reasons for departing
from the joint submission.  These reasons will help explain to the parties why
the proposed sentence was unacceptable, and may assist them in the resolution
of future cases.  Reasons will also facilitate appellate review.

IV.       
Application 

[61]                         
The Crown submits that on any test, the trial
judge was entitled to depart from the joint submission.  Respectfully, I cannot
agree.  Setting aside that the trial judge failed to apply the proper test — he
asked only whether the joint submission was fit — he failed to take into
account the important systemic benefits of joint submissions, and the
corresponding need for them to be reasonably certain.  

[62]                         
In terms of the custodial sentence, it appears
the trial judge treated the joint submission as though it was a conventional
sentencing hearing.  With respect, he erred in doing so.  The parties made a
clear and firm recommendation on the appropriate sentence.  Importantly, the
Crown did not resile from the joint submission, but maintained his position
that he was seeking a further period of 18 months in custody even after he
learned of the calculation error.  

[63]                         
In my respectful view, there was no basis for
the trial judge to substitute his opinion for the considered agreement of
counsel.  The custodial term proposed, while low, was not so low as to bring
the administration of justice into disrepute or be contrary to the public
interest.  It was close to the range of sentence identified by the trial judge,
and, as I have said, joint submissions promote the smooth operation of the
criminal justice system.  The appellant gave up his right to a trial and any
self-defence argument he may have had.  In the end, the trial judge’s deviation
from the recommended custodial sentence — by only six months — amounts to
little more than tinkering.  

[64]                         
The probation order raises more difficult
questions, but, in my view, it should not have been made.  While the trial
judge had reason to be concerned about how the appellant would manage in the
community, these concerns were addressed by counsel (see para. 19, above).  

[65]                         
Normally a probation order requiring that the
accused refrain from the use of non-medically prescribed drugs would be, if not
essential, certainly warranted where it is shown that an accused’s drug addiction
has contributed to his offending.  However, the failure to impose such an order
in the context of a joint submission is not necessarily fatal, particularly in
a case like this, where the reason for the order is somewhat attenuated by the
Director’s warrant and the likelihood that the order would be self-defeating.  

[66]                         
The Crown, having considered the public
interest, obviously felt that society would be adequately protected without a
probation order.  Counsel’s view that the probation order was duplicative and
therefore unnecessary to protect the public was reasonable in the
circumstances.  In fact, counsel appear to have come to a practical decision on
how best to further the appellant’s rehabilitation while ensuring the public’s
protection. 

V.          
Conclusion

[67]                         
I would allow the appeal, and vary the
appellant’s sentence to bring it into conformity with the joint submission,
namely, that the appellant serve an additional 18 months in custody, with no
period of probation to follow.  The sentence jointly proposed by the Crown and
defence was not one that would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute, nor was it otherwise contrary to the public interest.

REGINA




v.




IRELAND 
(APPELLANT) 


ON 24 JULY 1997





LORD GOFF OF CHIEVELEY
 



My Lords, 


    I have had an opportunity of reading in draft the 
speeches prepared by my noble and learned friends, Lord Steyn and Lord Hope of 
Craighead. I agree with them, and for the reasons they give I would dismiss both 
appeals. 




LORD SLYNN OF HADLEY
 



My Lords, 


    I have had the advantage of reading the draft of the 
speech prepared by my noble and learned friend, Lord Steyn. For the reasons he 
gives I too would dismiss both appeals. I would, however, reiterate that in 

Ireland
 the question as to whether there was a fear of immediate violence 
for the purposes of section 47 of the Act and the question as to how the concept 
of immediacy is to be applied, in a case where words or silence by someone using 
the telephone are relied on as constituting the assault, did not arise for 
decision. 




LORD STEYN
 



My Lords,


    It is easy to understand the terrifying effect of a 
campaign of telephone calls at night by a silent caller to a woman living on her 
own. It would be natural for the victim to regard the calls as menacing. What 
may heighten her fear is that she will not know what the caller may do next. The 
spectre of the caller arriving at her doorstep bent on inflicting personal 
violence on her may come to dominate her thinking. After all, as a matter of 
common sense, what else would she be terrified about? The victim may suffer 
psychiatric illness such as anxiety neurosis or acute depression. Harassment of 
women by repeated silent telephone calls, accompanied on occasions by heavy 
breathing, is apparently a significant social problem. That the criminal law 
should be able to deal with this problem, and so far as is practicable, afford 
effective protection to victims is self evident. 


    From the point of view, however, of the general 
policy of our law towards the imposition of criminal responsibility, three 
specific features of the problem must be faced squarely. First, the medium used 
by the caller is the telephone: arguably it differs qualitatively from a 
face-to-face offer of violence to a sufficient extent to make a difference. 
Secondly, ex hypothesi the caller remains silent: arguably a caller may avoid 
the reach of the criminal law by remaining silent however menacing the context 
may be. Thirdly, it is arguable that the criminal law does not take into account 
""mere"" psychiatric illnesses. 


    At first glance it may seem that the legislature has 
satisfactorily dealt with such objections by section 43(1) of the 
Telecommunications Act 1984 which makes it an offence persistently to make use 
of a public telecommunications system for the purpose of causing annoyance, 
inconvenience or needless anxiety to another. The maximum custodial penalty is 
six months imprisonment. This penalty may be inadequate to reflect a culpability 
of a persistent offender who causes serious psychiatric illness to another. For 
the future there will be for consideration the provisions of sections 1 and 2 of 
the Protection from the Harassment Act 1997, not yet in force, which creates the 
offence of pursuing a course of conduct which amounts to harassment of another 
and which he knows or ought to know amounts to harassment of the other. The 
maximum custodial penalty is six months imprisonment. This penalty may also be 
inadequate to deal with persistent offenders who cause serious psychiatric 
injury to victims. Section 4(1) of the Act of 1997 which creates the offence of 
putting people in fear of violence seems more appropriate. It provides for 
maximum custodial penalty upon conviction on indictment of five years 
imprisonment. On the other hand, section 4 only applies when as a result of a 
course of conduct the victim has cause to fear, on at least two occasions, that 
violence 
will
 be used against her. It may be difficult to secure a 
conviction in respect of a silent caller: the victim in such cases may have 
cause to fear that violence 
may
 be used against her but no more. In my 
view, therefore, the provisions of these two statutes are not ideally suited to 
deal with the significant problem which I have described. One must therefore 
look elsewhere. 


    It is to the provisions of the Offences against the 
Person Act 1861 that one must turn to examine whether our law provides effective 
criminal sanctions for this type of case. In descending order of seriousness the 
familiar trilogy of sections (as amended) provide as follows: 


 ""18. Whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously by any means 
  whatsoever . . . cause any grievous bodily harm to any person . . . with 
  intent . . . to do some grievous bodily harm to any person, . . . shall be 
  guilty of felony and being convicted thereof shall be liable . . . to 
  [imprisonment] for life . . . . 


 ""20. Whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously . . . inflict 
  any grievous bodily harm upon any other person, either with or without any 
  weapon or instrument, shall be guilt of a misdemeanour, and being convicted 
  therefore shall be liable [to imprisonment . . . for not more than five 
  years.] 


 ""47. Whosoever shall be convicted upon an indictment of any 
  assault occasioning actual bodily harm shall be liable . . . [to imprisonment 
  for not more than five years]."" 
Making due allowance for the incongruities in these provisions, the sections 
can be described as ""a ladder of offences graded in terms of relative 
seriousness"": 
Ashworth
, 
Principles of Criminal Law
, 2nd ed. 
(1995), at p. 313. An ingredient of each of the offences is ""bodily harm"" to a 
person. In respect of each section the threshold question is therefore whether a 
psychiatric illness, as testified to by a psychiatrist, can amount to ""bodily 
harm."" If the answer to this question is no, it will follow that the Act of 1861 
cannot be used to prosecute in the class of cases which I have described. On the 
other hand, if the answer to the question is yes, it will be necessary to 
consider whether the persistent silent caller, who terrifies his victim and 
causes her to suffer a psychiatric illness, can be criminally liable under any 
of these sections. Given that the caller uses the medium of the telephone and 
silence to terrify his victim, is he beyond the reach of these sections? 


    Similar problems arise in the case of the so called 
stalker, who pursues a campaign of harassment by more diffuse means. He may 
intend to terrify the woman and succeed in doing so, by relentlessly following 
her, by unnecessarily appearing at her home and place of work, photographing 
her, and so forth. Is he beyond the reach of the trilogy of sections in the Act 
of 1861? 


The two appeals before the House
 


    There are two appeals before the House. In 

Ireland
 the appellant was convicted on his plea of guilty of three 
offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, contrary to section 47 of 
the Act of 1861. The judgment of the Court of Appeal dismissing his appeal is 
reported: 
Reg. v. Ireland
 [1997] Q.B. 114. The case against Ireland was 
that during a period of three months in 1994 covered by the indictment he 
harassed three women by making repeated telephone calls to them during which he 
remain silent. Sometimes, he resorted to heavy breathing. The calls were mostly 
made at night. The case against him, which was accepted by the judge and the 
Court of Appeal, was that he caused his victim to suffer psychiatric illness. 
Ireland had a substantial record of making offensive telephone calls to women. 
The judge sentenced him to a total of three years imprisonment. 


    Before the Court of Appeal there were two principal 
issues. The first was whether psychiatric illness may amount to bodily harm 
within the meaning of section 47 of the Act of 1861. Relying on a decision of 
the Court of Appeal in 
Reg. v. Chan-Fook
 
[1994] 1 WLR 689
 the Court of Appeal in 
Ireland's
 case concluded that psychiatric 
injury may amount to bodily harm under section 47 of the Act of 1861. The second 
issue was whether Ireland's conduct was capable of amounting to an assault. In 
giving the judgment of the court in Ireland's case Swinton Thomas L.J. said (at 
p. 119): 


 ""It has been recognised for many centuries that putting a person in 
  fear may amount to an assault. The early cases predate the invention of the 
  telephone. We must apply the law to conditions as they are in the 20th 
  century."" 
The court concluded that repeated telephone calls of a menacing nature may 
cause victims to apprehend immediate and unlawful violence. Given these 
conclusions of law, and Ireland's guilty plea, the Court of Appeal dismissed the 
appeal. The Court of Appeal certified the following question as being of general 
public importance, namely ""As to whether the making of a series of silent 
telephone calls can amount in law to an assault."" But it will also be necessary 
to consider the question whether psychiatric illness may in law amount to bodily 
harm under section 47 of the Act of 1861. Those are the issues of law before the 
House in the appeal of 
Ireland
.


    In 
Reg. v. Burstow
 the appellant was indicted 
on one count of unlawfully and maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, 
contrary to section 20 of the Act of 1861. The facts are fully set out in the 
reported judgment of the Court of Appeal: 
Reg. v. Burstow
 [1997] 1 
Cr.App.R. 144. I can therefore describe the facts shortly. Burstow had a social 
relationship with a woman. She broke it off. He could not accept her decision. 
He proceeded to harass her in various ways over a lengthy period. His conduct 
led to several convictions and periods of imprisonment. During an eight month 
period in 1995 covered by the indictment he continued his campaign of 
harassment. He made some silent telephone calls to her. He also made abusive 
calls to her. He distributed offensive cards in the street where she lived. He 
was frequently, and unnecessarily, at her home and place of work. He 
surreptitiously took photographs of the victim and her family. He sent her a 
note which was intended to be menacing, and was so understood. The victim was 
badly affected by this campaign of harassment. It preyed on her mind. She was 
fearful of personal violence. A consultant psychiatrist stated that she was 
suffering from a severe depressive illness. In the Crown Court counsel asked for 
a ruling whether an offence of unlawfully and maliciously inflicting grievous 
bodily harm contrary to section 20 may be committed where no physical violence 
has been applied directly or indirectly to the body of the victim. The judge 
answered this question in the affirmative. Burstow thereupon changed his plea to 
guilty. The judge sentenced him to three year's imprisonment. Burstow applied 
for leave to appeal against conviction. The Court of Appeal heard full oral 
argument on the application, and granted the application for leave to appeal but 
dismissed the appeal. Two questions of law were canvassed before the Court of 
Appeal. First, there was the question whether psychiatric injury may amount to 
bodily harm under section 20. The Court of Appeal regarded itself as bound by 
the affirmative decision in 
Reg. v. Chan-Fook
 
[1994] 1 WLR 689
. The second issue was whether in the absence of physical violence 
applied directly or indirectly to the body of the victim an offence under 
section 20 may be committed. The Court of Appeal concluded that this question 
must be answered in the affirmative. The concluding observations of Lord Bingham 
of Cornhill C.J. were as follows, at p. 149:


 ""It is not straining language to speak of one person inflicting 
  psychiatric injury on another. It would in our judgment be an affront to 
  common sense to distinguish between section 18 and section 20 in the way 
  contended for by the applicant. It would also, we think, introduce extreme and 
  undesirable artificiality into what should be a very practical area of the law 
  if we were to hold that, although grievous bodily harm includes psychiatric 
  injury, no offence against section 20 is committed unless such psychiatric 
  injury is the result of physical violence applied directly or indirectly to 
  the body of the victim. The decision in 
Chan-Fook
 is in our view fatal 
  to the applicant's submission."" 
In the result the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal against conviction. 
The court certified the following point as of general importance, namely: 


 ""Whether an offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm under section 
  20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 can be committed where no 
  physical violence is applied directly or indirectly to the body of the 
  victim."" 
    It will be noted that in neither appeal is there an 
issue on mens rea: the appeals focus on questions of law regarding the actus 
reus. 


The common question: Can psychiatric illness amount to bodily 
harm?
 


    It will now be convenient to consider the question 
which is common to the two appeals, namely, whether psychiatric illness is 
capable of amounting to bodily harm in terms of sections 18, 20 and 47 of the 
Act of 1861. The answer must be the same for the three sections. 


    The only abiding thing about the processes of the 
human mind, and the causes of its disorders and disturbances, is that there will 
never be a complete explanation. Psychiatry is and will always remain an 
imperfectly understood branch of medical science. This idea is explained by 
Vallar's psychiatrist in 
Iris Murdoch's 
The Message to the Planet
: 



 ""Our knowledge of the soul, if I may use that unclinical but 
  essential word, encounters certain seemingly impassable limits, set there 
  perhaps by the gods, if I may refer to them, in order to preserve their 
  privacy, and beyond which it may be not only futile but lethal to attempt to 
  pass and though it is our duty to seek for knowledge, it is also incumbent on 
  us to realise when it is denied us, and not to prefer a fake solution to no 
  solution at all.""
But there has been progress since 1861. And courts of law can only act on the 
best scientific understanding of the day. Some elementary distinctions can be 
made. The appeals under consideration do not involve structural injuries to the 
brain such as might require the intervention of a neurologist. One is also not 
considering either psychotic illness or personality disorders. The victims in 
the two appeals suffered from no such conditions. As a result of the behaviour 
of the appellants they did not develop psychotic or psychoneurotic conditions. 
The case was that they developed mental disturbances of a lesser order, namely 
neurotic disorders. For present purposes the relevant forms of neurosis are 
anxiety disorders and depressive disorders. Neuroses must be distinguished from 
simple states of fear, or problems in coping with every day life. Where the line 
is to be drawn must be a matter of psychiatric judgment. But for present 
purposes it is important to note that modern psychiatry treats neuroses as 
recognisable psychiatric illnesses: see 
Liability for 
Psychiatric 
Injury,
 Law Commission Consultation paper No. 137 (1995) Part III (
The 
Medical Background)
; 
Mullany and Hanford,
 
Tort Liability for 
Psychiatric
 
Damages
, (1993), discussion on ""The Medical Perspective,"" 
at pp. 24-42, and particular at 30, footnote 88. Moreover, it is essential to 
bear in mind that neurotic illnesses affect the central nervous system of the 
body, because emotions such as fear and anxiety are brain functions. 


    The civil law has for a long time taken account of 
the fact that there is no rigid distinction between body and mind. In 

Bourhill v. Young
 
[1943] AC 92
, 103 
Lord Macmillan said: 


 ""The crude view that the law should take cognisance only of physical 
  injury resulting from actual impact has been discarded, and it is now well 
  recognised that an action will lie for injury by shock sustained through the 
  medium of the eye or the ear without direct physical contact. The distinction 
  between mental shock and bodily injury was never a scientific one. . . 
.""
This idea underlies the subsequent decisions of the House of Lords regarding 
post-traumatic stress disorder in 
McLoughlin v. O'Brian
 
[1983] 1 AC 410
, 
418, 
per
 Lord Wilberforce; and 
Page v. Smith
 
[1996] AC 155
, 
181A-D, 
per
 Lord Browne-Wilkinson. So far as such cases are concerned 
with the precise boundaries of tort liability they are not relevant. But so far 
as those decisions are based on the principle that the claimant must be able to 
prove that he suffered a recognisable psychiatric illness or condition they are 
by analogy relevant. The decisions of the House of Lords on post-traumatic 
stress disorder hold that where the line is to be drawn is a matter for expert 
psychiatric evidence. By analogy those decisions suggest a possible principled 
approach to the question whether psychiatric injury may amount to bodily harm in 
terms of the Act of 1861.


    The criminal law has been slow to follow this path. 
But in 
Reg. v. Chan-Fook
 
[1994] 1 WLR 689
 the Court of Appeal squarely addressed the question whether psychiatric 
injury may amount to bodily harm under section 47 of the Act of 1861. The issue 
arose in a case where the defendant had aggressively questioned and locked in a 
suspected thief. There was a dispute as to whether the defendant had physically 
assaulted the victim. But the prosecution also alleged that even if the victim 
had suffered no physical injury, he had been reduced to a mental state which 
amounted to actual bodily harm under section 47. No psychiatric evidence was 
given. The judge directed the jury that an assault which caused an hysterical 
and nervous condition was an assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The 
defendant was convicted. Upon appeal the conviction was quashed on the ground of 
misdirections in the summing up and the absence of psychiatric evidence to 
support the prosecution's alternative case. The interest of the decision lies in 
the reasoning on psychiatric injury in the context of section 47. In a detailed 
and careful judgment given on behalf of the court Hobhouse L.J. said (at p. 
695G-H)): 


  ""The first question on the present appeal is whether the 
  inclusion of the word 'bodily' in the phrase 'actual bodily harm' limits harm 
  to harm to the skin, flesh and bones of the victim. . . . The body of the 
  victim includes all parts of his body, including his organs, his nervous 
  system and his brain. Bodily injury therefore may include injury to any of 
  those parts of his body responsible for his mental and other faculties."" 

In concluding that ""actual bodily harm"" is capable of including psychiatric 
injury Hobhouse L.J. emphasised (at p. 696C) that ""it does not include mere 
emotions such as fear or distress nor panic nor does it include, as such, states 
of mind that are not themselves evidence of some identifiable clinical 
condition."" He observed that in the absence of psychiatric evidence a question 
whether or not an assault occasioned psychiatric injury should not be left to 
the jury.


    The Court of Appeal, as differently constituted in 

Ireland
 and 
Burstow
, was bound by the decision in 

Chan-Fook
. The House is not so bound. Counsel for the appellants in both 
appeals submitted that bodily harm in Victorian legislation cannot include 
psychiatric injury. For this reason they argued that 
Chan-Fook
 was 
wrongly decided. They relied on the following observation of Lord Bingham of 
Cornhill C.J. in 
Burstow
 [1997] 1 Cr.App.R. 144, 148: 


 ""Were the question free from authority, we should entertain some 
  doubt whether the Victorian draftsman of the 1861 Act intended to embrace 
  psychiatric injury within the expressions 'grievous bodily harm' and 'actual 
  bodily harm'."" 
Nevertheless, the Lord Chief Justice observed that it is now accepted that in 
the relevant context the distinction between physical and mental injury is by no 
means clear cut. He welcomed the ruling in 
Chan-Fook
: at p. 149B. I 
respectfully agree. But I would go further and point out that, although out of 
considerations of piety we frequently refer to the actual intention of the 
draftsman, the correct approach is simply to consider whether the words of the 
Act of 1861 considered in the light of contemporary knowledge cover a 
recognisable psychiatric injury. It is undoubtedly true that there are statutes 
where the correct approach is to construe the legislation ""as if one were 
interpreting it the day after it was passed:"" 
The
 
Longford
 (1889) 
14 P.D. 34. Thus in 
The Longford
 the word ""action"" in a statute was held 
not to be apt to cover an Admiralty action in rem since when it was passed the 
Admiralty Court ""was not one of His Majesty's Courts of Law:"" (see pp. 37, 38.) 
Bearing in mind that statutes are usually intended to operate for many years it 
would be most inconvenient if courts could never rely in difficult cases on the 
current meaning of statutes. Recognising the problem Lord Thring, the great 
Victorian draftsman of the second half of the last century, exhorted draftsmen 
to draft so that ""An Act of Parliament should be deemed to be always speaking"": 

Practical Legislation
 (1902), p. 83; see also 
Cross
, 
Statutory 
Interpretation
, 3rd ed. (1995), p. 51; 
Pearce and Geddes
, 

Statutory Interpretation in Australia
, 4th ed. (1996), pp. 90-93. In 
cases where the problem arises it is a matter of interpretation whether a court 
must search for the historical or original meaning of a statute or whether it is 
free to apply the current meaning of the statute to present day conditions. 
Statutes dealing with a particular grievance or problem may sometimes require to 
be historically interpreted. But the drafting technique of Lord 
Thring
 
and his successors have brought about the situation that statutes will generally 
be found to be of the ""always speaking"" variety: see 
Royal College of Nursing 
of the United Kingdom v. Department of Health and Social Security
 
[1981] AC 800
 for 
an example of an ""always speaking"" construction in the House of Lords.


    The proposition that the Victorian legislator when 
enacting sections 18, 20 and 47 of the Act 1861, would not have had in mind 
psychiatric illness is no doubt correct. Psychiatry was in its infancy in 1861. 
But the subjective intention of the draftsman is immaterial. The only relevant 
enquiry is as to the sense of the words in the context in which they are used. 
Moreover the Act of 1861 is a statute of the ""always speaking"" type: the statute 
must be interpreted in the light of the best current scientific appreciation of 
the link between the body and psychiatric injury.


    For these reasons I would, therefore, reject the 
challenge to the correctness of 
Chan-Fook
 
[1994] 1 WLR 689
. In my view the ruling in that case was based on principled and cogent 
reasoning and it marked a sound and essential clarification of the law. I would 
hold that ""bodily harm"" in sections 18, 20 and 47 must be interpreted so as to 
include recognizable psychiatric illness. 


Reg. v. Burstow: the meaning of ""inflict"" in section 20
 


    The decision in 
Chan-Fook
 opened up the 
possibility of applying sections 18, 20 and 47 in new circumstances. The appeal 
of Burstow lies in respect of his conviction under section 20. It was conceded 
that in principle the wording of section 18, and in particular the words ""cause 
any grievous bodily harm to any person"" do not preclude a prosecution in cases 
where the actus reus is the causing of psychiatric injury. But counsel laid 
stress on the difference between ""causing"" grievous bodily harm in section 18 
and ""inflicting"" grievous bodily harm in section 20. Counsel argued that the 
difference in wording reveals a difference in legislative intent: inflict is a 
narrower concept than cause. This argument loses sight of the genesis of 
sections 18 and 20. In his commentary on the Act of 1861 Greaves, the draftsman, 
explained the position: 
The Criminal Law Consolidation and Amendment 
Acts
, 2nd ed. (1862). He said (at pp. 3-4):


  


  ""If any question should arise in which any comparison may be 
  instituted between different sections of any one or several of these Acts, it 
  must be carefully borne in mind in what manner these Acts were framed. None of 
  them was re-written; on the contrary, each contains enactments taken from 
  different Acts passed at different times and with different views, and 
  frequently varying from each other in phraseology, and . . . these enactments, 
  for the most part, stand in these Acts with little or no variation in their 
  phraseology, and, consequently, their differences in that respect will be 
  found generally to remain in these Acts. It follows, therefore, from hence, 
  that any argument as to a difference in the intention of the legislature, 
  which may be drawn from a difference in the terms of one clause from those in 
  another, will be entitled to no weight in the construction of such clauses; 
  for that argument can only apply with force where an Act is framed from 
  beginning to end with one and the same view, and with the intention of making 
  it thoroughly consistent throughout.""


The difference in language is therefore not a significant factor.


    Counsel for Burstow then advanced a sustained 
argument that an assault is an ingredient of an offence under section 20. He 
referred your Lordships to cases which in my judgment simply do not yield what 
he sought to extract from them. In any event, the tour of the cases revealed 
conflicting 
dicta
, no authority binding on the House of Lords, and no 
settled practice holding expressly that assault was an ingredient of section 20. 
And, needless to say, none of the cases focused on the infliction of psychiatric 
injury. In these circumstances I do not propose to embark on a general review of 
the cases cited: compare the review in 
Smith and Hogan,
 
Criminal 
Law
, 8th ed. (1996), pp. 440-441. Instead I turn to the words of the 
section. Counsel's argument can only prevail if one may supplement the section 
by reading it as providing ""inflict 
by assault
 any grievous bodily harm."" 
Such an implication is, however, not necessary. On the contrary, section 20, 
like section 18, works perfectly satisfactorily without such an implication. I 
would reject this part of counsel's argument.


    But counsel had a stronger argument when he submitted 
that it is inherent in the word ""inflict"" that there must be a direct or 
indirect application of force to the body. Counsel cited the speech of Lord 
Roskill in 
Reg. v. Wilson (Clarence)
 [1984] A.C. 942, 259E-260H, in which 
Lord Roskill quoted with approval from the judgment of the full court of the 
Supreme Court of Victoria in 
Reg. v. Salisbury
 [1976] V.R. 452. There are 
passages that give assistance to counsel's argument. But Lord Roskill expressly 
stated (at p. 260H) that he was ""content to accept, as did the [court in 

Salisbury
] that there can be the infliction of grievous bodily harm 
contrary to section 20 without an assault being committed."" In the result the 
effect of the decisions in 
Wilson
 and 
Salisbury
 is neutral in 
respect of the issue as to the meaning of ""inflict."" Moreover, in 
Burstow
 
[1997] 1 Cr.App.R. 144, 149, the Lord Chief Justice pointed out that in 
Reg. 
v. Mandair
 [1995] 1 A.C. 208, 215, Lord Mackay of Clashfern L.C. observed 
with the agreement of the majority of the House of Lords: ""In my opinion . . . 
the word 'cause' is wider or at least not narrower than the word 'inflict'"". 
Like the Lord Chief Justice I regard this observation as making clear that in 
the context of the Act of 1861 there is no radical divergence between the 
meaning of the two words.


    That leaves the troublesome authority of the decision 
Court for Crown Cases Reserved in 
Reg. v. Clarence
 (1888) 22 Q.B.D. 23. 
At a time when the defendant knew that he was suffering from a venereal disease, 
and his wife was ignorant of his condition, he had sexual intercourse with her. 
He communicated the disease to her. The defendant was charged and convicted of 
inflicting grievous bodily harm under section 20. There was an appeal. By a 
majority of nine to four the court quashed the conviction. The case was 
complicated by an issue of consent. But it must be accepted that in a case where 
there was direct physical contact the majority ruled that the requirement of 
infliction was not satisfied. This decision has never been overruled. It assists 
counsel's argument. But it seems to me that what detracts from the weight to be 
given to the dicta in 
Clarence
 is that none of the judges in that case 
had before them the possibility of the inflicting, or causing, of psychiatric 
injury. The criminal law has moved on in the light of a developing understanding 
of the link between the body and psychiatric injury. In my judgment 

Clarence
 no longer assists.


    The problem is one of construction. The question is 
whether as a matter of current usage the contextual interpretation of ""inflict"" 
can embrace the idea of one person inflicting psychiatric injury on another. One 
can without straining the language in any way answer that question in the 
affirmative. I am not saying that the words cause and inflict are exactly 
synonymous. They are not. What I am saying is that in the context of the Act of 
1861 one can nowadays quite naturally speak of inflicting psychiatric injury. 
Moreover, there is internal contextual support in the statute for this view. It 
would be absurd to differentiate between sections 18 and 20 in the way argued on 
behalf of Burstow. As the Lord Chief Justice observed in 
Burstow
 [1997] 1 
Cr.App.R. 144, 149F, this should be a very practical area of the law. The 
interpretation and approach should so far as possible be adopted which treats 
the ladder of offences as a coherent body of law. Once the decision in 

Chan-Fook
 
[1994] 1 WLR 689
 is accepted the realistic possibility is opened up of prosecuting under 
section 20 in cases of the type which I described in the introduction to this 
judgment. 


    For the reasons I have given I would answer the 
certified question in 
Burstow
 in the affirmative. 


Reg. v. Ireland: Was there an assault?
 


    It is now necessary to consider whether the making of 
silent telephone calls causing psychiatric injury is capable of constituting an 
assault under section 47. The Court of Appeal, as constituted in 
Ireland
 
case, answered that question in the affirmative. There has been substantial 
academic criticism of the conclusion and reasoning in 
Ireland
: see 

Archbold News
, Issue 6, 12 July 1996; 
Archbold's Criminal Pleading, 
Evidence & Practice,
 (1995), Supplement No. 4 (1996), pp. 345-347; 

Smith and Hogan, Criminal Law
, 8th ed., 413; Herring, ""Assault by 
Telephone"" by Jonathan Herring [1997] C.L.J. 11; ""Assault"" [1997] Crim.L.R. 434, 
435-436. Counsel's arguments, broadly speaking, challenged the decision in 

Ireland
 on very similar lines. Having carefully considered the literature 
and counsel's arguments, I have come to the conclusion that the appeal ought to 
be dismissed. 


    The starting point must be that an assault is an 
ingredient of the offence under section 47. It is necessary to consider the two 
forms which an assault may take. The first is battery, which involves the 
unlawful application of force by the defendant upon the victim. Usually, section 
47 is used to prosecute in cases of this kind. The second form of assault is an 
act causing the victim to apprehend an imminent application of force upon her: 
see 
Fagan v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner
 [1969] 1 Q.B. 439, 444D-E. 



    One point can be disposed of, quite briefly. The 
Court of Appeal was not asked to consider whether silent telephone calls 
resulting in psychiatric injury is capable of constituting a battery. But 
encouraged by some academic comment it was raised before your Lordships' House. 
Counsel for Ireland was most economical in his argument on the point. I will try 
to match his economy of words. In my view it is not feasible to enlarge the 
generally accepted legal meaning of what is a battery to include the 
circumstances of a silent caller who causes psychiatric injury.


    It is to assault in the form of an act causing the 
victim to fear an immediate application of force to her that I must turn. 
Counsel argued that as a matter of law an assault can never be committed by 
words alone and therefore it cannot be committed by silence. The premise depends 
on the slenderest authority, namely, an observation by Holroyd J. to a jury that 
""no words or singing are equivalent to an assault"": 
Meade's
 and
 

Belt's
 case 1 (1823) 1 Lew. C.C. 184. The proposition that a gesture may 
amount to an assault, but that words can never suffice, is unrealistic and 
indefensible. A thing said is also a thing done. There is no reason why 
something said should be incapable of causing an apprehension of immediate 
personal violence, e.g. a man accosting a woman in a dark alley saying ""come 
with me or I will stab you."" I would, therefore, reject the proposition that an 
assault can never be committed by words.


    That brings me to the critical question whether a 
silent caller may be guilty of an assault. The answer to this question seems to 
me to be ""yes, depending on the facts."" It involves questions of fact within the 
province of the jury. After all, there is no reason why a telephone caller who 
says to a woman in a menacing way ""I will be at your door in a minute or two"" 
may not be guilty of an assault if he causes his victim to apprehend immediate 
personal violence. Take now the case of the silent caller. He intends by his 
silence to cause fear and he is so understood. The victim is assailed by 
uncertainty about his intentions. Fear may dominate her emotions, and it may be 
the fear that the caller's arrival at her door may be imminent. She may fear the 

possibility
 of immediate personal violence. As a matter of law the caller 
may be guilty of an assault: whether he is or not will depend on the 
circumstance and in particular on the impact of the caller's potentially 
menacing call or calls on the victim. Such a prosecution case under section 47 
may be fit to leave to the jury. And a trial judge may, depending on the 
circumstances, put a common sense consideration before jury, namely what, if not 
the possibility of imminent personal violence, was the victim terrified about? I 
conclude that an assault may be committed in the particular factual 
circumstances which I have envisaged. For this reason I reject the submission 
that as a matter of law a silent telephone caller cannot ever be guilty of an 
offence under section 47. In these circumstances no useful purpose would be 
served by answering the vague certified question in 
Ireland
.


    Having concluded that the legal arguments advanced on 
behalf of 
Ireland
 on section 47 must fail, I nevertheless accept that the 
concept of an assault involving immediate personal violence as an ingredient of 
the section 47 offence is a considerable complicating factor in bringing 
prosecutions under it in respect of silent telephone callers and stalkers. That 
the least serious of the ladder of offences is difficult to apply in such cases 
is unfortunate. At the hearing of the appeal of 
Ireland
 attention was 
drawn to the Bill which is annexed to Law Commission report, 
Legislating the 
Criminal Code: Offences Against the Person and General Principles,
 
Consultation Paper (Law Com. No. 218) (1993) (Cmnd 2370). Clause 4 of that Bill 
is intended to replace section 47. Clause 4 provides that ""A person is guilty of 
an offence if he intentionally or recklessly causes injury to another."" This 
simple and readily comprehensible provision would eliminate the problems 
inherent in section 47. In expressing this view I do not, however, wish to 
comment on the appropriateness of the definition of ""injury"" in clause 18 of the 
Bill, and in particular the provision that ""injury"" means ""impairment of a 
person's mental health."" 


The disposal of the appeals
 


    The legal arguments advanced on behalf of Burstow 
have failed. The appeal must be dismissed. 


    The legal arguments advanced on behalf of Ireland 
have also failed. But counsel for the appellant submitted that the appeal should 
be allowed because on an examination of the statements there was no prima facie 
case against him. I reject this submission. The prosecution case was never fully 
deployed because Ireland pleaded guilty. The fact of his plea demonstrated his 
mens rea. It was said, however, that the ingredient of psychiatric injury was 
not established on the statements. It is true that the statement from the 
psychiatrist is vague. But I would not accept that read in context it was 
insufficient to allow the case to go before a jury. It would be an exceptional 
course, in the face of an unequivocal and deliberate plea of guilty, to 
entertain an appeal directed exclusively to the sufficiency of evidence. Such a 
course is not warranted in the present case. I would therefore dismiss the 
appeal of Ireland. 




LORD HOPE OF CRAIGHEAD
 



My Lords, 


    I have had the advantage of reading in draft the 
speech which has been prepared by my noble and learned friend, Lord Steyn. I 
agree with it, and for the reasons which he gives I also would dismiss both 
appeals. I should like however to add a few words on the point which arises in 

Reg. v. Burstow
 as to the meaning of the word ""inflict"" in section 20 of 
the Offences against the Person Act 1861, and on the point which arises in 

Reg. v. Ireland
 as to whether the making of a series of silent telephone 
calls can amount in law to an assault within the meaning of section of section 
47 of that Act. 


Reg.
 
v.
 
Burstow
:
 ""
inflict
"" 


    In this case the appellant changed his plea to guilty 
after a ruling by the trial judge that the offence of unlawfully and maliciously 
inflicting grievous bodily harm contrary to section 20 of the Act of 1861 may be 
committed where no physical violence has been applied directly or indirectly to 
the body of the victim. Counsel for the appellant accepted that if 
Reg. v. 
Chan-Fook
 
[1994] 1 WLR 689
 was correctly decided, with the result that ""actual bodily harm"" in 
section 47 is capable of including psychiatric injury, the victim in this case 
had suffered grievous bodily harm within the meaning of section 20. But he 
submitted that no offence against section 20 had been committed in this case 
because, although the appellant might be said to have ""caused"" the victim to 
sustain grievous bodily harm, he had not ""inflicted"" that harm on her because he 
had not used any personal violence against her.


    Counsel based his submission on the decision in 

Reg. v. Clarence
 (1888) 22 Q.B.D. 23. In that case it was held that some 
form of direct personal violence was required for a conviction under section 20. 
The use of the word ""inflict"" in the section was said to imply that some form of 
battery was involved in the assault. The conviction was quashed because, 
although the venereal infection from which the victim was suffering was the 
result of direct physical contact, there had been no violence used and thus 
there was no element of battery. It seems to me however that there are three 
reasons for regarding that case as an uncertain guide to the question which 
arises where the bodily harm which has resulted from the defendant's conduct 
consists of psychiatric injury.


    The first is that the judges in 
Clarence 
were 
concerned with a case of physical, not psychiatric, injury. They did not have to 
consider the problem which arises where the grievous bodily harm is of a kind 
which may result without any form of physical contact. The second is that the 
intercourse had taken place with consent, as the defendant's wife was ignorant 
of his venereal disease. So there was no question in that case of an assault 
having been committed, if there was no element of violence or battery. Also, as 
Lord Roskill pointed out in 
Reg. v. Wilson (Clarence)
 [1984] A.C. 242, 
260C the judgments of the judges who formed the majority are not wholly 
consistent with each other. This casts some doubt on the weight which should be 
attached to the judgment when the facts are entirely different, as they are in 
the present case.


    In 
Reg. v. Wilson,
 Lord Roskill referred at 
pp. 259E-260B, with approval to the judgment of the Supreme Court of Victoria in 

Reg. v. Salisbury
 [1976] V.R. 452, in which the following passage 
appears, at p. 461: 


 "" . . . although the word 'inflicts' . . . does not have as wide a 
  meaning as the word 'causes' . . . the word 'inflicts' does have a wider 
  meaning than it would have if it were construed so that inflicting grievous 
  bodily harm always involved assaulting the victim."" 


At p. 260H Lord Roskill said that he was content to accept, as was the full 
court in 
Salisbury
, that there can be an infliction of grievous bodily 
harm contrary to section 20 without an assault being committed. But these 
observations do not wholly resolve the issue which arises in this case, in the 
context of grievous bodily harm which consists only of psychiatric injury.


    The question is whether there is any difference in 
meaning, in this context, between the word ""cause"" and the word ""inflict"". The 
fact that the word ""caused"" is used in section 18, whereas the word used in 
section 20 is ""inflict,"" might be taken at first sight to indicate that there is 
a difference. But for all practical purposes there is, in my opinion, no 
difference between these two words. In 
Reg. v. Mandair
 [1995] 1 A.C. 208, 
215B Lord Mackay of Clashfern L.C., said that the word ""cause"" is wider or at 
least not narrower than the word ""inflict."" I respectfully agree with that 
observation. But I would add that there is this difference, that the word 
""inflict"" implies that the consequence of the act is something which the victim 
is likely to find unpleasant or harmful. The relationship between cause and 
effect, when the word ""cause"" is used, is neutral. It may embrace pleasure as 
well as pain. The relationship when the word ""inflict"" is used is more precise, 
because it invariably implies detriment to the victim of some kind.


    In the context of a criminal act therefore the words 
""cause"" and ""inflict"" may be taken to be interchangeable. As the Supreme Court 
of Victoria held in 
Salisbury
 [1976] V.R. 452, it is not a necessary 
ingredient of the word ""inflict"" that whatever causes the harm must be applied 
directly to the victim. It may be applied indirectly, so long as the result is 
that the harm is caused by what has been done. In my opinion it is entirely 
consistent with the ordinary use of the word ""inflict"" in the English language 
to say that the appellant's actions ""inflicted"" the psychiatric harm from which 
the victim has admittedly suffered in this case. The issues which remain are 
issues of fact and, as the appellant pled guilty to the offence, I would dismiss 
his appeal. 


Reg. v. Ireland: ""assault""
 


    In this case the appellant pled guilty to three 
contraventions of section 47 of the Act of 1861. He admitted to having made 
numerous telephone calls to three women, during which he remained silent when 
the women answered the telephone. These calls lasted sometimes for a minute or 
so, and sometimes for several minutes. On some occasions they were repeated over 
a relatively short period. There is no doubt that this conduct was intended to 
distress the victims, each of whom suffered as a result from symptoms of such a 
kind as to amount to psychiatric injury. But, for the appellant to be guilty of 
an offence contrary to section 47 of the Act of 1861, he must be held to have 
committed an act which amounts to an assault.


    Plainly there was no element of battery --although 
counsel for the respondent made brief submissions to the contrary--as at no time 
was there any kind of physical contact between the appellant and his victims. As 
Swinton Thomas L.J. observed in the Court of Appeal [1997] Q.B. 114, 119D, that 
is a fact of importance in this case. But it is not an end of the matter, 
because as he went on to say it has been recognised for many centuries that 
putting a person in fear may amount to what in law is an assault. This is 
reflected in the meaning which is given to the word ""assault"" in 
Archbold 
Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice
 (1997), p. 1594 para. 19-66, namely 
that an assault is any act by which a person intentionally or recklessly causes 
another to apprehend immediate and unlawful violence. This meaning is well 
vouched by authority: see 
Reg. v. Venna
 
[1976] QB 421
; 
Reg. v. 
Savage 
[1992] 1 AC 699
, 
740F, 
per
 Lord Ackner.


    The question is whether such an act can include the 
making of a series of silent telephone calls. Counsel for the appellant said 
that such an act could not amount to an assault under any circumstances, just as 
words alone could not amount to an assault. He also submitted that, in order for 
there to be an assault, it had to be proved that what the victim apprehended was 
immediate and unlawful violence, not just a repetition of the telephone calls. 
It was not enough to show that merely that the victim was inconvenienced or 
afraid. He said that the Court of Appeal had fallen into error on this point, 
because they had proceeded on the basis that it was sufficient that when the 
victims lifted the telephone they were placed in immediate fear and suffered the 
consequences which resulted in psychiatric injury. The court had not 
sufficiently addressed the question whether the victims were apprehensive of 
immediate and unlawful violence and, if so, whether it was that apprehension 
which had caused them to sustain the bodily injury.


    I agree that a passage in the judgment of the Court 
of Appeal [1997] Q.B. 114, 122C-G suggests that they had equated the 
apprehension of immediate and unlawful violence with the actual psychiatric 
injury which was suffered by the victims. I also agree that, if this was so, it 
was an incorrect basis from which to proceed. But in the penultimate sentence in 
this passage Swinton Thomas L.J. said that in the court's judgment repetitive 
telephone calls of this nature were likely to cause the victim to apprehend 
immediate and unlawful violence. Furthermore, as the appellant pled guilty to 
these offences, the question whether that apprehension caused the psychiatric 
injury did not need to be explored in evidence. The important question therefore 
is whether the making of a series of silent telephone calls can amount in law to 
an assault.


    There is no clear guidance on this point either in 
the statute or in the authorities. On the one hand in 
Meade's and Belt's
 
case (1823) I Lew C.C. 184 Holroyd J. said that no words or singing can amount 
to an assault. On the other hand in 
Reg. v. Wilson
 [1955] 1 W.L.R. 493, 
494 Lord Goddard C.J. said that the appellant's words, ""Get out knives"" would 
itself be an assault. The word ""assault"" as used in section 47 of the Act of 
1861 is not defined anywhere in that Act. The legislation appears to have been 
framed on the basis that the words which it used were words which everyone would 
understand without further explanation. In this regard the fact that the statute 
was enacted in the middle of the last century is of no significance. The public 
interest, for whose benefit it was enacted, would not be served by construing 
the words in a narrow or technical way. The words used are ordinary English 
words, which can be given their ordinary meaning in the usage of the present 
day. They can take account of changing circumstances both as regards medical 
knowledge and the means by which one person can cause bodily harm to 
another.


    The fact is that the means by which a person of evil 
disposition may intentionally or recklessly cause another to apprehend immediate 
and unlawful violence will vary according to the circumstances. Just as it is 
not true to say that every blow which is struck is an assault--some blows, which 
would otherwise amount to battery, may be struck by accident or in jest or may 
otherwise be entirely justified--so also it is not true to say that mere words 
or gestures can never constitute an assault. It all depends on the 
circumstances. If the words or gestures are accompanied in their turn by 
gestures or by words which threaten immediate and unlawful violence, that will 
be sufficient for an assault. The words or gestures must be seen in their whole 
context.


    In this case the means which the appellant used to 
communicate with his victims was the telephone. While he remained silent, there 
can be no doubt that he was intentionally communicating with them as directly as 
if he was present with them in the same room. But whereas for him merely to 
remain silent with them in the same room, where they could see him and assess 
his demeanour, would have been unlikely to give rise to any feelings of 
apprehension on their part, his silence when using the telephone in calls made 
to them repeatedly was an act of an entirely different character. He was using 
his silence as a means of conveying a message to his victims. This was that he 
knew who and where they were, and that his purpose in making contact with them 
was as malicious as it was deliberate. In my opinion silent telephone calls of 
this nature are just as capable as words or gestures, said or made in the 
presence of the victim, of causing an apprehension of immediate and unlawful 
violence.

My Lords, 


    I have had the advantage of reading in draft the

gives I would dismiss the appeals. 


    Whether this requirement, and in particular that of 
immediacy, is in fact satisfied will depend on the circumstances. This will need 
in each case, if it is disputed, to be explored in evidence. But that step was 
not necessary in this case as the appellant was prepared to plead guilty to 
having committed the offence. I would therefore answer the certified question in 
the affirmative and dismiss this appeal also.",1997-07-24 00:00:00,UK House of Lords

LADY HALE AND LORD TOULSON: (with whom Lord Clarke and Lord Wilson agree)



	By these proceedings, a mother seeks to prevent a father from publishing a book about his life containing certain passages which she considers risk causing psychological harm to their son who is now aged 12. Mother and son now live in the United States of America and so the family court in England and Wales has no jurisdiction to grant orders protecting the child's welfare. Instead, these proceedings have been brought in his name, originally by his mother and now by his godfather as his litigation friend, alleging that publication would constitute a tort against him. The tort in question is that recognised in the case of 
Wilkinson v Downton 
[1897] 2 QB 57
 and generally known as intentionally causing physical or psychological harm. What, then, is the proper scope of the tort in the modern law? In particular, can it ever be used to prevent a person from publishing true information about himself?



 



	As the object of the proceedings has been to protect the child from harm, all the parties have until now been anonymous, as has the country where the child now lives. This court has decided that the tort does not have the scope contended for on the child's behalf and hence that the book may be published including the specific passages to which objection is taken. This means that the book will inevitably be published in the very near future. In those circumstances there can be no justification for keeping secret the information contained in the book. This includes, obviously, the author's name and also the country where mother and son are now living. The book, however, uses pseudonyms for both the mother and the child and so this judgment will continue to do so. But this court is now able to describe the book and its contents more fully than the lower courts were able to do. In this way, the reasons why both the mother and the father have been motivated to act as they have should become much clearer than perhaps they have been hitherto.



 



The book



	The father is James Rhodes, the concert pianist, author and television filmmaker. The book is entitled 
Instrumental
. The author believes that ""music has, quite literally saved my life and, I believe, the lives of countless others. It has provided company where there is none, understanding where there is confusion, comfort where there is distress, and sheer, unpolluted energy where there is a hollow shell of brokenness and fatigue"". He wants to communicate some of what music can do, by providing a sound track to the story of his life. ""And woven throughout is going to be my life story. Because it's a story that provides proof that music is the answer to the unanswerable. The basis for my conviction about that is that I would not exist, let alone exist productively, solidly – and, on occasion, happily – without music."" So the book juxtaposes descriptions of particular pieces of music, why he has chosen them, what they mean to him, and the composers who wrote them, with episodes of autobiography. He wants the reader to listen to the 20 music tracks while reading the chapters to which they relate.



 



	Thus far, there would be nothing for anyone to worry about. But the author's life has been a shocking one. And this is because, as he explains in the first of the passages to which exception is taken, ""I was used, fucked, broken, toyed with and violated from the age of six. Over and over for years and years"". In the second of those passages, he explains how he was groomed and abused by Mr Lee, the boxing coach at his first prep school, and how wrong it is to call what happened to him ""abuse"":



 



""Abuse. What a word. Rape is better. Abuse is when you tell a traffic warden to fuck off. It isn't abuse when a 40 year old man forces his cock inside a six-year-old boy's ass. That doesn't even come close to abuse. That is aggressive rape. It leads to multiple surgeries, scars (inside and out), tics, OCD, depression, suicidal ideation, vigorous self-harm, alcoholism, drug addiction, the most fucked-up of sexual hang-ups, gender confusion ('you look like a girl, are you sure you're not a little girl?'), sexuality confusion, paranoia, mistrust, compulsive lying, eating disorders, PTSD, DID (the shinier name for multiple personality disorder) and so on and on and on.



I went, literally overnight, from a dancing, spinning, gigglingly alive kid who was enjoying the safety and adventure of a new school, to a walled-off, cement shoed, lights-out automaton. It was immediate and shocking, like happily walking down a sunny path and suddenly having a trapdoor open and dump you into a freezing cold lake.



You want to know how to rip the child out of a child? Fuck him.



Fuck him repeatedly. Hit him. Hold him down and shove things inside him. Tell him things about himself that can only be true in the youngest of minds before logic and reason are fully formed and they will take hold of him and become an integral, unquestioned part of his being.""



	He describes how he learnt to dissociate himself from what was happening, to block it out of his memory, how when he moved to other schools he had learnt to offer sexual favours to older boys and teachers in return for sweets and other treats. He gives a searing account of the physical harms he suffered as a result of the years of rape and of the psychological effects, which made it hard for him to form relationships and left him with an enduring sense of shame and self-loathing.



 



	He recounts the ups and downs of his adult life: a year at Edinburgh University filled with drugs and alcohol, leading to his first admission to a psychiatric hospital; a year working and sobering up in Paris; three years studying psychology at University College London, leading to a highly successful career as a salesman in financial publishing; meeting and marrying the mother, whom he calls Jane, an American novelist then living in London; making a ""perfect home"" with her. He is kind about his wife – ""The poor thing didn't stand a chance"" – and hard upon himself:



 



""I've honestly no idea what I was thinking, beyond that rather sad hope that if I continued to do what normal people did then I would somehow become normal. But the idea that a man like me could not only get married, but maintain, nurture, commit to a marriage was fucking ridiculous. My whole concept of love was skewed.""



	Then their child, whom he calls Jack, was born: ""My son was and is a miracle. There is nothing I will experience in my life that will ever match the incandescent atomic bomb of love which exploded in me when he was born."" He wanted to be a perfect father, but ""I don't think that I will ever be able to make my peace with the fact that the ripples of my past became tidal waves when he was born"". His past had installed ""an unshakeable belief that all children suffer through childhood in the most abominable ways and that nothing and no-one can protect them from it"". Eventually, he looked for professional help from a charity specialising in helping victims of child sexual abuse and was told that he must tell his wife about the abuse. So he did. Their child was then four years old. ""It is, apparently, very common for the world to spin completely off its axis when your child approaches the age you were when the abuse began"".



 



	Instead of returning to drink and drugs he resorted to self-harm: ""That's the thing about cutting – not only do you get high, but you can express your disgust at yourself and the world, control the pain yourself, enjoy the ritual, the endorphins, the seedy, gritty self-violence privately and hurt no-one other than yourself"". But his wife found out and he was persuaded to go into hospital again. Among the passages which have not been challenged is a graphic account of the effect of the psychotropic drugs which he was forced to take in hospital. He tried to commit suicide, escaped from the hospital, planned a second attempt at suicide but rang his wife for a last word with his son, and was persuaded to meet her. So he was returned to hospital. He worked hard at being a model patient so that he could be let out. But it was not a cure. ""Even out of hospital, off meds, physically present for my family, I was a ghost."" A friend offered him a life-line, treatment in a hospital in the United States, where he spent two months. ""By the end of it I had, miraculously, stopped hating myself quite so much. I'd put on weight, cleared away a lot of the wreckage of the past, repaired some relationships and found a way to live with myself that, most days, left me relatively calm and composed."" There is a moving passage about rebuilding his relationship with his son: ""That's the weird thing about kids – they have a capacity for forgiveness that most adults can only aspire to. He has always loved me – it was inbuilt and immutable – and I him. After a few weeks of playing, singing, hanging out, we felt absolutely connected and back to normal.""



 



	But the marriage could not be repaired. Mother and father agreed to a trial separation and he moved out. Things ""started to get more and more wobbly"", not helped by his going to the police for the first time in the hope of exorcising some of the past horrors, where he found the process ""brutal, shaming, vile"". He began self-harming once more. Eventually, the mother decided to move back to the United States. Once again, he is generous: ""She had, understandably and justifiably, had enough. There had been so much destruction, so much uncertainty and pain, and clearly Jane had decided that Jack's needs had to come first. She was a mother first and foremost and not some patron saint of lost causes."" They got into a routine. He would go over there twice a year, she would bring him over here twice a year, they would Skype twice a week.



 



	Interwoven with this painful story is the story of his relationship with music. He discovered music, specifically, Bach's Chaconne for solo violin in D minor, transcribed for piano by Busoni, while still at the preparatory school where he was being so brutally abused:



 



""… that piece became my safe place. Any time I felt anxious (any time I was awake) it was going round in my head. Its rhythms were being tapped out, its voices played again and again, altered, explored, experimented with. I dove inside it as if it were some kind of musical maze and wandered around happily lost. It set me up for life; without it I would have died years ago, I've no doubt. But with it, and with all the other music that it led me to discover, it acted like a force field that only the most toxic and brutal pain could penetrate.""



	At his next preparatory school he largely taught himself to read music and play the piano. At Harrow, he had his first proper teacher, who was ""awesome"". He discovered that ""literally the only thing in the universe I realised I wanted was to travel the world, alone, playing the piano in concert halls"". Then he gave it up during the ten years of university, building a career and getting married. But after his son was born and the demons returned, ""I looked for distractions. I looked for a way out that didn't involve homicide or suicide"". He found it in music. He set about building a business partnership with the agent of ""the greatest pianist in the world"", but was persuaded instead to train as a pianist himself. He worked hard. And when he had begun to resort to self-harm, he decided to organise his first public concert. He rented a hall on the South Bank, the hall was filled, and the concert went well: ""I realise that all those fantasies about giving concerts that I had as a kid, that kept me alive and safe in my head, were accurate. It really is that powerful. And I knew I wanted to do it forever. No matter what"".



 



	Then the suicidal ideas and attempts and hospitalisation took over. But a friend visiting him in hospital brought him an iPod nano loaded with music inside a giant bottle of shampoo (toiletries being the only gifts allowed). Once again music was his salvation. It persuaded him to do what he needed to do to get out. After separating from his wife, he started to get more involved in the piano again. And in a café he met the man who was to become his manager. Together they arranged for him to record his first CD, 
Razor Blades, Little Pills and Big Pianos
. He found a sponsor to enable him to concentrate on his music. He did a documentary about Chopin for the BBC. His manager arranged concerts at the Roundhouse and the Queen Elizabeth Hall. Together they devised a new sort of concert, in which the pianist talked about the music, the composer and what it meant to him, in an informal way quite unlike the usual classical music concert. It was a success. Through his manager he met the woman who was to become his second wife.



 



	The concerts led to some press interest, including an interview with the Sunday Times in which he mentioned the abuse which had happened at school. This prompted the head of the junior school in his first school, who had known that something was wrong but not what it was, to get in touch and to provide a police statement. Mr Lee was found, still coaching small boys boxing, and prosecuted. But he died before he could stand trial:



 



""Maybe one day I will forgive Mr Lee. That's much likelier to happen if I find a way to forgive myself. But the truth, for me at any rate, is that the sexual abuse of children rarely, if ever, ends in forgiveness. It leads only to self-blame, visceral, self-directed rage and shame …



But shining a light on topics like this is hugely important. And getting hundreds of supportive and grateful messages from people who had also gone through similar experiences was an indicator to me that it needs to be talked about even more.""



	From then his career went from strength to strength. There have been many concerts, all over the world. There have been four more albums. There was a television series for Sky Arts, 
Piano Man
. There was even talk, though it came to nothing, of his appearing in the Royal Variety Show. He and his manager had found a new and different way of presenting classical music to the world and it worked.



 



	There have been bad times since as well as good times – ""Sadly I am only ever two weeks away from a locked ward"" – but the overall message is one of hope:



 



""I lost my childhood but gained a child. I lost a marriage but gained a soulmate. I lost my way but gained a career and a fourth or fifth chance at a life which is second to none.""



These proceedings



	During their divorce, the mother and father agreed to include the following recital, recital K, in a residence and contact order made in London on 15 June 2009:



 



""And upon the parties agreeing to use their best endeavours to protect the child from any information concerning the past previous history of either parent which would have a detrimental effect upon the child's well-being""



	A first draft of the book was sent to the publishers in December 2013. In February 2014 it was leaked to the mother and some changes were made as a result, including the use of pseudonyms for mother and child. The mother did not consider that those changes had gone far enough. In June 2014, she launched these proceedings on behalf of the child, claiming against the father and the publishers an injunction prohibiting publication without the deletion of a large number of passages. The causes of action alleged were misuse of private information, negligence and the intentional infliction of harm. An anonymity order was made at the same time, prohibiting the publication of any information which might lead to the identification of the child as a party to the proceedings or the subject of the information to which the proceedings related. All parties have since filed evidence but there have been no findings on the factual matters in dispute.



 



	The mother has filed a report from Dr Christine Tizzard, a consultant child psychologist who interviewed the child in June 2014. Her opinion was that he ""is likely to suffer severe emotional distress and psychological harm in the event that he is exposed to the material in the publication"". The child has been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, dyspraxia and dysgraphia. He qualifies for an Individualised Educational Program in the United States and receives specialist support and counselling. In her view, the information in the book would be inappropriate for any 11 year old child to read and have access to, but it would be even more devastating for this child, because of his difficulties in processing information: his psychological schemas are not malleable, he receives information in a literal way and is unable to conceptualise it in an alternative way, and he would view himself as responsible for some of his father's distress and an extension of his father. He is already prone to self-harm and emotional outbursts and these would probably increase.



 



	Both parties accept that it is most unlikely that the child will come into possession of the book itself. The publishers plan to publish it in hard copy in the UK and much of the rest of the English-speaking world, and to retail it in shops and on-line, but there are no plans at present to publish it in the USA. It will also be available for purchase as an e-book.



 



	The father accepts that knowing what happened to him would upset and embarrass the child, but not that it will be harmful if dealt with in the right way and at the right time. The bare bones of his story have already appeared in articles and interviews which are available on-line. The mother is concerned that the child who is proud of his father, has ""googled"" him in the past. If he did so in future he would be likely to come across reviews and references to the book.



 



	The application for an interim injunction came before Bean J in private in July 2014. His judgment has not been published. He dismissed the application and struck the proceedings out on the basis that the child had no cause of action in tort against the father or the publishers. He said that there was no precedent for an order preventing a person from publishing their life story for fear of its causing psychiatric harm to a vulnerable person, nor should there be. He held that a cause of action under 
Wilkinson v Downton 
did not extend beyond false or threatening words.



 



	The child's appeal was heard in August 2014 and judgment given in October: 
[2014] EWCA Civ 1277
. The Court of Appeal held that there was no claim in misuse of private information or in negligence, but that the claim for intentionally causing harm should go for trial. The factual issues would be the father's intention in publishing the book, the level of harm which the child was likely to suffer and the cause of such harm.



 



	The leading judgment was given by Arden LJ. She held that the action under 
Wilkinson v Downton 
was not limited to false or intimidatory statements, but she considered other ways in which the tort might be kept within acceptable limits. She said that it was ""inconceivable that the law would render all intentional statements which cause psychiatric harm actionable in damages. In some cases a person may have to tell bad news which is liable to cause psychiatric harm. But there may be many ways in which the court could draw the line between acceptable intentional statements or acts which cause psychiatric harm, and those which are actionable under this head"" (para 68). She added (para 69) that it had to be shown that the act was unjustified ""in the sense that the defendant was not entitled to do it 
vis-à-vis the particular claimant
"" (original emphasis). Thus she met the objection that many disturbing publications may foreseeably cause psychiatric harm to someone of sufficient vulnerability by treating the cause of action as confined to the person at whom the act was directed, and therefore the question of justification was similarly confined. Arden LJ had noted at the outset of her judgment that the book was dedicated to the child, and the fact that the father had ""accepted a responsibility to use his best endeavours to ensure that OPO is protected from harmful information"" was sufficient in her judgment ""to mean that there is no justification for his words, if they are likely to produce psychiatric harm"".



 



	As to the mental element of the tort, Arden LJ held that the necessary intent to cause harm could be imputed to the father, since he was aware of the psychiatric evidence about the harm which his son would be likely suffer if he read some of the contents of the book. She said, correctly, that there was a consistent line of authority from 
Wilkinson v Downton
 that even if a person did not intend to cause such harm, an intent to do so could be imputed to him if that was the likely consequence.



 



	In a short concurring judgment Jackson LJ said that for a statement to give rise to liability under 
Wilkinson v Downton
 it need not be false. Rather, it must meet the essential characteristics that ""the statement is unjustified and that the defendant intends to cause or is reckless about causing physical or psychiatric injury to the claimant"". Jackson LJ considered that the following facts were sufficient to establish that the claimant had a good prospect of success for the purposes of granting an interlocutory injunction:



 



i)	The book contained graphic descriptions of the abuse which the appellant had suffered and his incidents of self-harm.



ii)	Those passages were likely to be quoted by reviewers or newspapers who serialised the book.



iii)	On the uncontradicted expert evidence those passages were likely to cause psychological harm to the claimant.



iv)	The book was dedicated to the claimant and partly addressed to him.



v)	The appellant knew of the risks posed to the claimant because of his vulnerabilities and had for that reason subscribed to Recital K.



McFarlane LJ agreed with both judgments. The form of order was the subject of a supplemental judgment after a further hearing in private.



	The court granted an interim injunction, restraining the defendants from making ""generally available to the public by any means all or any part of the information referred to in Confidential Schedule 2 to this Order ('the information') whether by publishing the particular extracts identified in Confidential Schedule 3 or by publishing any substantially similar words to like effect"". Confidential Schedule 2 reads thus:



 



""
Information referred to in the Order



(1) The information or purported information that the respondents intended to publish in a book entitled 'Instrumental' ('the Book') (extracts of which are particularised in Confidential Schedule 3) which give graphic accounts of the First defendant's account of sexual abuse he suffered as a child; his suicidal thoughts and attempts; his history of and treatment for mental illness and incidents of self-harming; his thoughts about killing the appellant; his fears that the appellant would also be a victim of sexual abuse and linking this account to the appellant.



(2) Any information liable to or which might lead to the identification of the appellant (whether directly or indirectly) as the subject of these proceedings or the material referred to above.""



	In the judgment about the form of order Arden LJ emphasised the use of word ""graphic"" in the order, which she explained as follows:



 



""We take the word ""graphic"" to mean vividly descriptive. In judging what is vividly descriptive, we have borne in mind that the person to be protected is a vulnerable child. In these circumstances, we consider that what should be injuncted is that which we consider to be seriously liable to being understood by a child as vividly descriptive so as to be disturbing.""



	Confidential Schedule 3 contains some 40 extracts from the book. Some fall within the general description in Confidential Schedule 2 as explained by Arden LJ and some do not. By no means all the passages in the book which might be thought to fall within that general description are included. Nowhere in the listed extracts or in the current version of the book is there mention of thoughts about killing the child. Some of the quotations in paras 3 to 15 above are among the 40 extracts listed; many are not.



 



	The prohibition does not relate to information contained in the book apart from the Confidential Schedules or contained in the public judgment of the court. Nor does it apply to any material which had been placed in the public domain before 1 September 2014 and either appeared on the internet in the father's name in a form and on a site accessible at 1 September 2014 or was attributed to the father and contained in a national television programme transmitted in England within the previous 12 months.



 



	The trial of the action was listed for April 2015. The father and the publishers contend that on the agreed facts the child has no cause of action against them.



 



Wilkinson v Downton



	Mr Downton secured a place for himself in legal history by a misconceived practical joke. He thought that it would be a cause of harmless amusement among the clientele of the Albion public house in Limehouse to tell the landlord's wife, Mrs Wilkinson, a false tale that her husband had fractured his legs in an accident while on his way back from a race meeting and that he had sent a message to ask for her help to get him home. It cost her 1 shilling and 10 ½ pence to send her son and another helper on this fools' errand, but a matter of far greater concern was the effect on her health. She suffered severe shock to her nervous system, which manifested itself in vomiting and weeks of physical suffering. Mrs Wilkinson had not shown any previous sign of predisposition to nervous shock. She and her husband sued Mr Downton, and the matter came to trial before Wright J and a jury.



 



	Recovery of the transport costs incurred in response to Mr Wilkinson's supposed request for help presented no legal difficulty. Such costs were recoverable as damages for deceit. The jury assessed damages for the illness caused to Mrs Wilkinson by her nervous shock (together with her husband's claim for the resulting loss of her services) at £100, but the legal basis for making such an award was problematic.



 



	Wright J rejected the argument that damages for deceit could include an award for Mrs Wilkinson's suffering, because the essence of liability for deceit was that a maker of a false representation, intended to be acted upon, was liable to make good any loss naturally resulting from the representee acting on it, but the illness suffered by Mrs Wilkinson was not a consequence of her acting on what she was told. It was simply a consequence of the shock brought about by the news reported to her.



 



	Wright J held, at pp 58-59, that a cause of action could be stated in law where a defendant has



 



""wilfully done an act calculated to cause physical harm to the plaintiff – that is to say, to infringe her legal right to personal safety, and has in fact thereby caused physical harm to her.""



He continued



""That proposition without more appears to me to state a good cause of action, there being no justification alleged for the act. This wilful injuria is in law malicious, although no malicious purpose to cause the harm which was caused nor any motive of spite is imputed to the defendant.""



	This compact statement of law contained a number of key features. First, he identified the plaintiff's protected interest as her ""legal right to personal safety"". Secondly, he identified the defendant's act as wilful. Thirdly, he described the act as ""calculated"" to cause physical harm to the plaintiff. Fourthly, he noted the absence of any alleged justification. Fifthly, he characterised the ""wilful injuria"" as ""in law malicious"" despite the absence of any purpose (ie desire) to cause the harm which was caused. Having stated the law in that way, Wright J then considered whether it covered Mrs Wilkinson's claim. He held that it did. He said:



 



""One question is whether the defendant's act was so plainly calculated to produce some effect of the kind which was produced that an intention to produce it ought to be imputed to the defendant, regard being had to the fact that the effect was produced on a person proved to be in an ordinary state of health and mind. I think that it was. It is difficult to imagine that such a statement, made suddenly and with apparent seriousness, could fail to produce grave effects under the circumstances upon any but an exceptionally indifferent person, and therefore an intention to produce such an effect must be imputed …""



	This passage removes any doubt that Wright J was using the word ""calculated"" in the sense of likely to have an effect of the kind which was produced, and that the result was taken in law to be intended by a process of imputation.



 



	The work of modern scholars is helpful to understanding Wright J's judgment by placing it in its historical context. The latter part of the 19
th
 century was a formative period in the law of tort, as in other areas of the common law. There was a movement towards general principles of liability for intentional or ""malicious"" torts, as there was also for negligence. (See Professor Oliphant's chapter, 
The Structure of the Intentional Torts
, in 
Emerging Issues in Tort Law
, 2007, edited by Professor Neyers and others.) The first edition of 
Pollock on Torts 
was published in 1887. In it he began his discussion of principles by stating it as ""a general proposition of English law that it is a wrong to do wilful harm to one's neighbour without lawful justification"" (p 21). He acknowledged that this was a modern principle for which there was no express authority, but he reasoned that as the modern law of negligence enforced the duty of fellow-citizens to observe in varying circumstances an appropriate measure of prudence to avoid causing harm to one another, ""much more must there exist, whether it be so expressed in the books or not, the negative duty of not doing wilful harm; subject, as all general duties must be subject, to the necessary exceptions"" (p 22). In later editions he cited an obiter dictum of Bowen LJ in 
Skinner & Co v Shew & Co
 [1893] 1 Ch 413, 422 that at common law there was a cause of action ""whenever one person did damage to another wilfully and intentionally, and without just cause or excuse"". Wright J was familiar with 
Pollock on Torts
 and he referred to the 4
th
 edition in 
Wilkinson v Downton
 at p 60.



 



	The word ""maliciously"" was much used both in the law of tort and in criminal law. In the famous case of 
Mogul Steamship Co Ltd v McGregor, Gow & Co
 (in which the plaintiffs complained about being kept out of the conference of shipowners trading between China and London) Bowen LJ said that the word had an ""accurate meaning, well known to the law"" as well as a ""popular and less precise signification"". As a legal term it meant ""an intention to do an act which is wrongful, to the detriment of another"": (1889) 23 QBD 598, 612. He continued, at p 613:



 



""Now, intentionally to do that which is calculated in the ordinary course of events to damage, and which does, in fact, damage another in that other person's property or trade, is actionable if done without just cause or excuse. Such intentional action when done without just cause or excuse is what the law calls a malicious wrong (see 
Bromage v Prosser
 
(1825) 4 B & C 247
; 
Capital and Counties Bank v Henty
 (1882) 7 App Cas 741, 772, per Lord Blackburn).""



In 
Bromage v Prosser
 Bayley J distinguished ""malice in law"", inferred from the defendant's intentional interference with the plaintiff's rights, from ""malice in fact"" (p 255). In the 
Mogul Steamship
 case Bowen LJ held that the defendants had just cause to act as they did, because they were free to carry on their trade freely to their best advantage, and the House of Lords agreed [1892] AC 25.



	Just as absence of actual ill-will was not a defence if the defendant's act wilfully interfered with an interest of the plaintiff which carried a right to legal protection, conversely the existence of ill-will was held not to be enough to create a cause of action in the absence of such a right. This was the ratio decidendi in the celebrated case of 
Mayor of Bradford v Pickles
 
[1895] AC 587
, from which it followed that insofar as Bowen LJ suggested that any act of interference with another's trade was 
prima facie
 unlawful his dictum was too wide. The chief source of water supplied for the citizens of Bradford was a collection of springs on land owned by the corporation at the foot of a hillside on the outskirts of the city. Above that land was a tract owned by Mr Pickles, and the springs were fed by water flowing underground from Mr Pickles's land. Mr Pickles embarked on the work of sinking a shaft on his land which had the effect of altering the flow of water and reducing the volume which fed the springs. The corporation brought proceedings for an injunction to restrain him from doing the work. The pleader alleged that he was acting ""maliciously"". It was argued that he was not acting for the improvement of his own land, but that he simply intended to deprive the corporation of water which it would otherwise have received, with the motive of forcing it to buy him out at a price satisfactory to himself. The corporation was granted an interim injunction at first instance, but the injunction was set aside by the Court of Appeal (Lord Herschell, LC, and Lindley and AL Smith LJJ, [1895] 1 Ch 145) and the Court of Appeal's judgment was upheld by the House of Lords. It was held that Mr Pickles had acted throughout in accordance with his legal rights. The corporation had no legal right to the flow of water from his land and, that being so, his motives were irrelevant. Lord Halsbury LC said at p 594:



 



""This is not a case in which the state of mind of the person doing the act can affect the right to do it. If it was a lawful act, however ill the motive might be, he had a right to do it. If it was an unlawful act, however good his motive might be, he would have no right to do it. Motives and intentions in such a question as is now before your Lordships seem to me to be absolutely irrelevant.""



	All this would have been familiar to Wright J. Shortly before he gave judgment in 
Wilkinson v Downton
 he had been summoned with other judges to give his opinion to the House of Lords in the famous case of 
Allen v Flood
 [1898] AC 1. He delivered his judgment in 
Wilkinson v Downton
 on 8 May 1897 and his opinion in 
Allen v Flood 
on 3 June 1897. In his opinion in 
Allen v Flood
, at [1898] AC 63, he said that in circumstances where:



 



""there was not otherwise any wrong or injuria, it follows that there could not be malice in the ordinary legal sense of that term, as compendiously stating the wilful infringement of a legal right or breach of a legal duty without matter of legal justification or excuse: upon which may be cited 
Bromage v Prosser 
[and other authorities].



These and other authorities show that in general wherever the term 'malice' or 'maliciously' forms part of a statement of a cause of action or of a crime, it imports not an inference of motive to be found by the jury, but a conclusion of law which follows on a finding that the defendant has violated a right and has done so knowingly, unless he shows some overriding justification.""



	Lord Herschell said in his judgment in 
Allen v Flood
 at p 124:



 



""More than one of the learned judges who were summoned refers with approval to the definition of malice by Bayley J in the case of 
Bromage v Prosser
: 'Malice in common acceptation of the term means ill-will against a person, but in its legal sense it means a wrongful act done intentionally without just cause or excuse.' It will be observed that this definition eliminates motive altogether.""



	It is interesting to compare and contrast Wright J's opinion in 
Allen v Flood 
with his judgment in 
Wilkinson v Downton
. In his opinion in 
Allen v Flood
 Wright J made the point (as the House of Lords had held in 
Mayor of Bradford v Pickles
) that if the defendant's conduct did not interfere with any right of the plaintiff, malice in its popular meaning would not be enough to create a wrong or injuria. But in 
Wilkinson v Downton
 he treated the defendant's wilfulness in telling a deliberate falsehood as an element of the injuria. The two approaches were not incompatible, for it is perfectly possible for the law to recognise an interest deserving some form of legal protection, but to require an appropriate degree of fault for an interference with it to constitute a legal injuria; the appropriate fault element may vary, typically between negligence and intention (although they are not the only possibilities); and the measure of protection provided by the law may vary as between different types of interest (be it a person's property, trade or personal safety). In 
Wilkinson v Downton
 Wright J identified the plaintiff's protected interest as her right to personal safety. There may be good reasons of social policy for the law to treat a person who deliberately does something which causes another to suffer physical or psychological injury or illness by telling them a false story (
Wilkinson v Downton
) more harshly than one who carelessly passes on false information.



 



	In the passage cited above from his opinion in 
Allen v Flood
, Wright J referred to cases where ""malice … forms part of a statement of a cause of action or of a crime"". In relation to the criminal law, Professor Mark Lunney has drawn attention in an illuminating article, 
Practical joking and its penalty: Wilkinson v Downton in context
 (2002) 10 Tort Law Review 168, 178, to the decision of the Court of Crown Cases Reserved in 
R v Martin
 (1881) 8 QBD 54. The defendant caused panic in a theatre by barricading an exit door and extinguishing the gas lighting. In the resulting confusion several people were seriously injured. His conduct was intended as a prank, but any sane person would have realised that it was dangerous. The court upheld his conviction for unlawfully and maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, contrary to section 20 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. Lord Coleridge CJ said (at p 58):



 



""The prisoner must be taken to have intended the natural consequences of that which he did. He acted 'unlawfully and maliciously', not that he had any personal malice against the particular individuals injured, but in the sense of doing an unlawful act calculated to injure …""



Stephen J said (also at p 58) that:



""if the prisoner did that which he did as a mere piece of foolish mischief unlawfully and without excuse, he did it 'wilfully', that is, 'maliciously', within the meaning of the statute.""



	There is a striking parallel between the language and reasoning in 
R v Martin
 and in 
Wilkinson v Downton
. Wright J's proposition that the ""injuria"" was ""in law malicious"", despite the absence of any ""malicious purpose"" or ""motive of spite"" contained a clear echo of the criminal law.



 



	Historically the doctrine of imputed intention, that is to say that a person is to be taken as a matter of law to intend the natural and probable consequences of his acts, survived in the criminal law as late as the decision of the House of Lords in 
DPP v Smith
 [1961] AC 290. The decision surprised most criminal lawyers and was described by Professor Glanville Williams in his 
Textbook of the Criminal Law
, (1
st
 ed) (1978), p 61, as ""the most criticised judgment ever to be delivered by an English court"". The doctrine was abolished by section 8 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967. This states:



 



""A court or jury, in determining whether a person has committed an offence, -



(a)	shall not be bound in law to infer that he intended or foresaw a result of his actions by reason only of its being a natural and probable consequence of those actions; but



(b)	shall decide whether he did intend or foresee that result by reference to all the evidence, drawing such inferences from the evidence as appear proper in the circumstances.""



	The final matter which Wright J addressed in his judgment in 
Wilkinson v Downton
 was whether the effect on Mrs Wilkinson of the report about her husband ""was, to use the ordinary phrase, too remote to be regarded in law as a consequence for which the defendant is answerable"". Having expressed the view that it was difficult to imagine that such a report could fail to produce grave effects, unsurprisingly he said that apart from authority he would hold that it was not too remote. He then considered two authorities advanced for the proposition that ""illness through mental shock is a too remote or unnatural consequence of an injuria to entitle the plaintiff to recover in a case where damage is a necessary part of the cause of action"": 
Victorian Railways Commissioners v Coultas
 (1888) 13 App Cas 222 and 
Allsop v Allsop
 
(1860) 5 H & N 534
, approved by the House of Lords in 
Lynch v Knight
 (1861) 
9 HL Cas 577
.



 



	In 
Victorian Railways Commissioners v Coultas
 the plaintiff narrowly escaped serious injury at a level crossing. She was a passenger in a buggy driven by her brother. The gate keeper negligently opened the gates for them to cross when a train was approaching. There was no collision, but the plaintiff was found by a jury to have suffered illness as a result of the shock of seeing the train approaching and thinking that they were going to be killed. The Privy Council held that mere sudden terror unaccompanied by actual physical injury could not in such circumstances be considered a consequence which in the ordinary course would flow from the negligence of the gate keeper.



 



	Wright J declined to follow that authority. He observed that it had been doubted by the Court of Appeal (
Pugh v London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Co
 [1896] 2 QB 248, 250, per Lord Esher MR) and had been rejected in Ireland (
Bell v Great Northern Railway Co of Ireland 
(1890) 26 LR Ir 428, per Palles CB) and by the Supreme Court of New York (
Mitchell v Rochester Railway Co
 (1896) 151 NY Rep 107, cited by Pollock). He did not go further and express the view that it was wrong, but it was unnecessary for him to do so, for he also described the case as not in point since ""there was not in that case any element of wilful wrong"".



 



	
Allsop v Allsop
 was a case of illness allegedly caused by a slanderous imputation of unchastity to a married woman. The woman heard the slander at third hand. It was held that the woman could not claim special damages for her illness in an action for slander against the originator of the slander. Wright J took a narrow view of the case as an authority on the type of damages recoverable in an action for slander. He said that to adopt it as a rule of general application that illness resulting from a false statement could never give rise to a claim for damages would be difficult or impossible to defend.



 



	Wright J's essential reasoning is clear, once the terms that he used are properly understood. He did not attempt to define physical harm of a psychiatric nature, but on the facts it was unnecessary for him to say more than he did. We have analysed his reasoning at some length because of the uncertainty to which it has given rise.



 



Subsequent case law



	
Wilkinson v Downton
 has been a source of much discussion and debate in legal textbooks and academic articles but seldom invoked in practice. This may be due to the development of the law of negligence in the area of recognised illness resulting from nervous shock. But a distinctive feature of the present case is that the courts below have held that there is no arguable case against the father in negligence (applying 
Barrett v Enfield London Borough Council
 
[2001] 2 AC 550
), and the claimant has therefore been constrained to rely on 
Wilkinson v Downton
.



 



	
Wilkinson v Downton
 was considered by the Divisional Court (Kennedy and Phillimore JJ) in 
Dulieu v White
 
& Sons
 
[1901] 2 KB 669
. The plaintiff was working behind the bar at the Bonner Arms in Bethnal Green when an employee of the defendant negligently drove a horse drawn van into the room where she was. She was pregnant at the time and claimed damages for illness allegedly resulting from her severe shock. The defendant pleaded that the damages claimed were too remote. The issue came before the Divisional Court on a demurrer. The court rejected the defence and declined to follow 
Victorian Railways Commissioners v Coultas
. The judges observed that the decision of the Privy Council was entitled to great respect but was no more binding on the court than it was on the Exchequer Division in Ireland. Kennedy J put to one side cases of wilful wrong-doing, such as 
Wilkinson v Downton
, as perhaps involving special considerations. In cases of negligence, he said that he was inclined to limit liability to injury from shock arising from a reasonable fear of immediate personal injury to oneself. Phillimore J, at p 683, said that he agreed with the decision of Wright J in 
Wilkinson v Downton
 ""that everyone has a right to his personal safety, and that it is a tort to destroy this safety by wilfully false statements and thereby to cause a physical injury to the sufferer"". From that and other authorities he drew the principle that ""terror wrongfully induced and inducing physical mischief gives a cause of action"".



 



	
Wilkinson v Downton
 was approved by the Court of Appeal in 
Janvier v Sweeney
 [1919] 2 KB 316. The plaintiff was a French woman engaged to a German who was interned in the Isle of Man during World War 1. She lived as the paid companion of another woman who had a house in Mayfair. The defendants were an ex-police officer who ran a private detective agency and his assistant. The first defendant wanted to inspect surreptitiously some letters written to the plaintiff's employer. In July 1917 he sent his assistant to see the plaintiff and trick her into cooperating by pretending that he was a police officer and that she was suspected of corresponding with a German spy. She claimed that this caused her to suffer severe shock resulting in a period of nervous illness. She sued for damages and won.



 



	On the appeal it was conceded that the threatening conduct found by the jury would amount to an actionable wrong if damage which the law recognised could be shown to have flowed directly from it. But it was argued that the plaintiff's illness was too remote in law and that 
Wilkinson v Downton
 was wrongly decided. The court approved the reasoning of Wright J and the statement of Phillimore J in 
Dulieu v White
 that ""terror wrongfully induced and inducing physical mischief gives a cause of action"". Duke LJ described 
Janvier v Sweeney
 as a stronger case than 
Wilkinson v Downton
 because there was an intention to terrify the plaintiff for the purpose of attaining an unlawful object.



 



	There appear to have been no reported cases in this country on 
Wilkinson v Downton
 for the next 70 years or so. In the last 25 years it has had a modest resurgence in the context of harassment: 
Khorasandjian v Bush
 
[1993] QB 727
; 
Wong v Parkside Health NHS Trust
 
[2001] EWCA Civ 1721
, 
[2003] 3 All ER 932
; 
Wainwright v Home Office
 
[2001] EWCA Civ 2081
, 
[2002] QB 1334
 (CA), 
[2003] UKHL 53
, 
[2004] 2 AC 406
 (HL).



 



	In 
Khorasandjian v Bush
 the plaintiff obtained an injunction, in reliance on 
Wilkinson v Downton
 and 
Janvier v Sweeney
, to prevent a former partner from making threatening phone calls. Dillon LJ (with whom Rose LJ agreed) described those authorities as establishing that ""false words or verbal threats calculated to cause, uttered with the knowledge that they are likely to cause, and actually causing physical injury to the person to whom they are uttered are actionable"" (p 735). (This was a direct quotation from the headnote in 
Janvier v Sweeney
.) Dillon LJ interpreted injury in the sense of ""recognisable psychiatric illness with or without psychosomatic symptoms"", as distinct from ""mere emotional distress"" (p 736).



 



	In 
Wong v Parkside Health NHS Trust
 the claimant sued her former employer for post-traumatic stress resulting from alleged harassment at her place of work. Hale LJ, giving the judgment of the court, said that it followed from Wright J's formulation in 
Wilkinson v Downton
 that although the tort is commonly labelled ""intentional infliction of harm"", it was not necessary to prove actual (subjective) intention to injure; it was sufficient to prove that the conduct was ""calculated"" to do so in the sense of being deliberate conduct which was likely in the nature of things to cause injury (para 10). As explained above, Hale LJ was correct that this was indeed the effect of Wright J's formulation, which the Court of Appeal endorsed in 
Janvier v Sweeney
. Whether it should be endorsed by this court is a different question. Hale LJ also confirmed the view expressed in 
Khorasandjian v Bush
 that for liability to arise under 
Wilkinson v Downton
 there must be ""physical harm or recognised psychiatric illness"". The interesting question is whether it should be sufficient to establish conduct intended to cause severe alarm or distress falling short of a recognised psychiatric illness but in fact causing the latter. This question was touched on in 
Wainwright v Home Office
.



 



	In 
Wainwright v Home Office
 a young adult who suffered from cerebral palsy and severe arrested social and intellectual development was wrongly subjected by prison officers to a strip search, which was carried out in a particularly humiliating fashion. He was greatly distressed by the episode and was subsequently diagnosed as suffering post-traumatic stress disorder. He claimed damages under 
Wilkinson v Downton
. It was argued on his behalf that the ambit of harm covered by the tort should extend beyond cases of recognised physical or psychiatric injury and should include distress of the kind which was the natural consequence of the prison officers' treatment of him.



 



	In the Court of Appeal Lord Woolf CJ said that he had no difficulty with the statement in 
Salmond & Heuston on Torts
, (21
st
 ed) (1996), p 215, that ""one who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional distress to another is liable for such emotional distress, provided that bodily harm results from it"": 
[2002] QB 1334
, para 49. (This statement was taken from the 
American Law Institute, Restatement of the Law, Torts,
 (2
nd 
ed) (1965), section 46.) But the trial judge had not made any finding that there was such intention or recklessness, and for that reason Lord Woolf held that the claim failed.



 



	Buxton LJ agreed that the claim failed on the facts, but he disagreed with the formulation in 
Salmond & Heuston
. He considered that the headnote in 
Janvier v Sweeney
, adopted by Dillon LJ in 
Khorasandjian v Bush
, came ""as close as it is possible to do to a general statement of the rule in 
Wilkinson v Downton
"" (para 79). But if that was not correct, he held that the rule must be limited to Wright J's statement that the defendant's act was so clearly likely to produce an effect of the kind that occurred that an intention to produce it should be imputed to him (objective recklessness). The reformulation in 
Khorasandjian v Bush
 required subjective recklessness as to the causation of physical injury in the sense of recognisable psychiatric distress. Intention or recklessness merely as to severe emotional distress, from which bodily harm happened to result, was not enough. Buxton LJ regarded the court in 
Wong's 
case as treating the two formulations as equivalent in their effect.



 



	In the House of Lords the principal judgment was given by Lord Hoffmann. His analysis of 
Wilkinson v Downton
 was that Wright J was prevented by the decision of the Privy Council in 
Victorian Railway Commissioners v Coultas
 from finding in negligence, and Wright J devised a concept of imputed intention which sailed as close to negligence as he felt that he could; that it was not entirely clear what he meant by finding that the defendant intended to cause injury; but that by the time of 
Janvier v Sweeney
 the law was able comfortably to accommodate the facts of 
Wilkinson v Downton
, since the court in 
Dulieu v White
 had declined to follow 
Victorian Railway Commissioners v Coultas
. (See paras 44, 37 and 39 to 40.)



 



	This interesting reconstruction shows the pitfalls of interpreting a decision more than a century earlier without a full understanding of jurisprudence and common legal terminology of the earlier period. The concept of imputed intention was certainly not a novel concept devised by Wright J to get around a perceived stumbling block in the law of negligence. The concept was in the mainstream of legal thinking at that time. Moreover there is no reason for supposing that Wright J would have felt obliged to follow the decision of the Privy Council unless he could find a means of distinguishing it. He pointed out that it had been doubted by the Court of Appeal, was inconsistent with a decision of the Court of Appeal in Ireland and had been criticised in the USA and by Pollock. Just as Kennedy and Phillimore JJ said in 
Dulieu v White
 that they were not bound by the decision of the Privy Council, Wright J would have known that he was not bound to follow it as a matter of precedent (and respect for it would have been reduced by the comments of the eminent judges, Lord Esher and Palles, CB, who had either doubted it or judged it to be wrong). There is no reason to suppose that Wright J was being artful when he described the Privy Council's decision as not in point because it did not involve wilful wrongdoing. His reasoning may seem unclear to modern readers, but it would not have been unclear to those familiar at the time with his use of the terms ""malicious"", ""calculated"" and ""imputed"".



 



	It is also incorrect to suggest that after 
Dulieu v White
 the law would have comfortably accommodated the facts of 
Wilkinson v Downton
 within the law of nervous shock caused by negligence. Kennedy J's judgment in 
Dulieu v White
 would have limited a cause of action in negligence for damages for nervous shock to cases in which the nervous shock resulted from fear for the plaintiff's own personal safety, which would not have included Mrs Wilkinson's case, since her fear was for her husband. This limitation was disapproved by a majority of the Court of Appeal in 
Hambrook v Stokes Brothers 
[1925] 1 KB 141 (Sargant LJ dissenting) and was finally put to rest in 
McLoughlin v O'Brian
 
[1983] 1 AC 410
. In any event negligence and intent are very different fault elements and there are principled reasons for differentiating between the bases (and possible extent) of liability for causing personal injury in either case.



 



	Lord Hoffmann rejected the argument on behalf of Mr Wainwright that there should be liability under 
Wilkinson v Downton
 for distress, not amounting to recognised psychiatric injury, on the basis of imputed intent. He said at para 45:



 



""If … one is going to draw a principled distinction which justifies abandoning the rule that damages for mere distress are not recoverable, imputed intention will not do. The defendant must actually have acted in a way which he knew to be unjustifiable and either intended to cause harm or at least acted without caring whether he caused harm or not.""



	Lord Hoffmann said that he read Lord Woolf's judgment as suggesting a willingness to accept such a principle, but that the facts did not support it. As we read Lord Woolf's judgment, the proposition from 
Salmond & Heuston 
which he was willing to accept was slightly different. It was that damages should be recoverable only in cases where the claimant suffered recognised bodily or psychiatric injury (and not mere emotional distress), but that in order to be entitled to damages for such injury it should be sufficient to show that the injury resulted from severe emotional distress which was intentionally or recklessly caused by the defendant's outrageous conduct.



 



	Lord Hoffmann was open to the idea that compensation should be available in cases where there was a genuine intention to cause distress, but he added a strong note of caution. He observed that in institutions and workplaces all over the country, people constantly say and do things with the intention of causing distress and humiliation to others. ""This"", he said at para 46, ""shows lack of consideration and appalling manners but I am not sure that the right way to deal with it is always by litigation"". He referred also to the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, which provides a remedy in damages for a course of conduct amounting to harassment. He observed that the requirement of a course of conduct showed that Parliament was conscious that it might not be in the public interest to allow the law to be set in motion for one ""boorish"" incident, and that it might be that any development of the common law should show similar caution (para 46).



 



	Lord Hoffmann concluded that 
Wilkinson v Downton
 as an authority did not provide a remedy for distress falling short of recognised psychiatric injury, and that in so far as there might be a remedy for distress (without psychiatric injury) intentionally caused, the necessary intention was not established (para 47).



 



Other common law jurisdictions



	Most common law jurisdictions have adopted 
Wilkinson v Downton
. In Australia it was cited with approval by the High Court in 
Bunyan v Jordan
 
(1937) 57 CLR 1
. Despite some later cases in which the courts have tended to treat it as subsumed within the law of negligence, Spigelman CJ in the New South Wales Court of Appeal treated it as an intentional tort in 
Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Naidu
 
[2007] NSWCA 377
, paras 71-72. It has also been followed in New Zealand (
Stevenson v Basham
 [1922] NZLR 225; 
Bradley v Wingnut Films Ltd
 [1993] 1 NZLR 415), Ireland (
Sullivan v Boylan
 
[2013] IEHC 104
) and Hong Kong (
Wong Kwai Fun v Li Fung
 [1994] 1 HKC 549). In the USA and Canada there has been significant further development.



 



	The American Law Institute's 
Restatement of the Law: Torts
 (2
nd 
ed) (1965), section 46(1) stated:



 



""One who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional distress to another is subject to liability for such emotional distress, and if bodily harm to the other results from it, for such bodily harm.""



45 states accepted this definition and others adopted a modified version of it. (See R Fraker, ""
Reformulating Outrage: a critical analysis of the problematic tort of IEED
"" (2008) 61 Vand L Rev 983.) In the 
Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical and Emotional Harm
 (2012) the wording of section 46 is marginally different but the meaning is unchanged:



""An actor who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional harm to another is subject to liability for that emotional harm and, if the emotional harm causes bodily harm, also for the bodily harm.""



The commentary to the current version states:



""The outrage tort originated as a catchall to permit recovery in the narrow instance when an actor's conduct exceeded all permissible bounds of a civilized society but an existing tort claim was unavailable. This tort potentially encompasses a broad swath of behaviour and can easily, but often inappropriately, be added as a supplement to a suit in which the gravamen is another tort or a statutory violation. The intent requirement is satisfied when an actor knows that conduct is substantially certain to cause harm. Because emotional harm is often a predictable outcome of otherwise legitimate conduct, such as terminating an employee, liability for this tort could be expansive. Courts have played an especially critical role in cabining this tort by requiring 'extreme and outrageous' conduct and ""severe"" emotional harm. A great deal of conduct may cause emotional harm, but the requisite conduct for this claim – extreme and outrageous – describes a very small slice of human behaviour.  The requirement that the resulting harm be severe further limits claims. These limits are essential in preventing this tort from being so broad as to intrude on important countervailing policies, while permitting its judicious use for the occasions when it is appropriate.""



	In Canada it is settled law that ""The tort of intentional infliction of mental distress or shock has three elements: (1) an act or statement … that is extreme, flagrant or outrageous; (2) the act or statement is calculated to produce harm; and (3) the act or statement causes harm"" (
High
 
Parklane Consulting Inc v Lewis
 
2007 CanLII 410
, para 31, per Perell J). This three-limbed test is derived from a line of earlier authorities including particularly the decision of McLachlin J, sitting as she then was in the British Columbia Supreme Court, in 
Rahemtulla v Vanfed Credit Union
 [1984] 3 WWR 296. In that case the plaintiff was harassed at work, falsely accused of theft in threatening circumstances and summarily dismissed without proper cause in a humiliating fashion. The defendant submitted that to be liable for wilful infliction of nervous shock its conduct must be outrageous. McLachlin J said, at para 52:



 



""This submission appears to be founded on the distinction drawn in American cases between mere insult, which is not actionable, and 'extreme and outrageous conduct' which is: 
Linden: Canadian Tort Law
 (3
rd
 ed) (1982), p 48. While this distinction appears not to have been expressly adopted in the Canadian and Commonwealth cases, the conduct considered in the leading authorities such as 
Wilkinson v Downton
, and 
Janvier v Sweeney
, was in fact flagrant and extreme. Moreover, it is difficult to accept that the courts should protect persons from every practical joke or unkind comment.""



	McLachlin J said that ""assuming"" that only flagrant and extreme conduct inflicting mental suffering was actionable, the defendant's conduct could be so described. She identified the two further ingredients of the tort as being: that the conduct was ""plainly calculated to produce some effect of the kind which was produced"" (quoting from Wright J's judgment in 
Wilkinson v Downton
), and that the conduct produced provable illness. She found that the conduct was ""plainly calculated"" to cause profound distress because it was clearly foreseeable. Since that decision the courts have followed the approach of imputing the necessary intention where severe emotional distress was foreseeable (see Professor Denise Réaume's chapter, 
The Role of Intention in the Tort in Wilkinson v Downton
, in 
Emerging Issues in Tort Law
).



 



Analysis



	The order made by the Court of Appeal was novel in two respects. The material which the appellant was banned from publishing was not deceptive or intimidatory but autobiographical; and the ban was principally directed, not to the substance of the autobiographical material, but to the vivid form of language used to communicate it. The appeal therefore raises important questions about freedom of speech and about the nature and limits of liability under 
Wilkinson v Downton
.



 



	In 
Wilkinson v Downton
 Wright J recognised that wilful infringement of the right to personal safety was a tort. It has three elements: a conduct element, a mental element and a consequence element. The issues in this case relate to the first and second elements. It is common ground that the consequence required for liability is physical harm or recognised psychiatric illness. In 
Wainwright v Home Office
 Lord Hoffmann discussed and left open (with expressions of caution) the question whether intentional causation of severe distress might be actionable, but no one in this case has suggested that it is.



 



	The conduct element requires words or conduct directed towards the claimant for which there is no justification or reasonable excuse, and the burden of proof is on the claimant. We are concerned in this case with the curtailment of freedom of speech, which gives rise to its own particular considerations. We agree with the approach of the Court of Appeal in regarding the tort as confined to those towards whom the relevant words or conduct were directed, but they may be a group. A person who shouts ""fire"" in a cinema, when there is no fire, is addressing himself to the audience. In the present case the Court of Appeal treated the publication of the book as conduct directed towards the claimant and considered that the question of justification had therefore to be judged vis-à-vis him. In this respect we consider that they erred.



 



	The book is for a wide audience and the question of justification has to be considered accordingly, not in relation to the claimant in isolation. In point of fact, the father's case is that although the book is dedicated to the claimant, he would not expect him to see it until he is much older. Arden LJ said that the father could not be heard to say that he did not intend the book to reach the child, since it was dedicated to him and some parts of it are addressed to him. We have only found one passage addressed to him, which is in the acknowledgments, but more fundamentally we do not understand why the appellant may not be heard to say that the book is not intended for his eyes at this stage of his life. Arden LJ also held that there could be no justification for the publication if it was likely to cause psychiatric harm to him. That approach excluded consideration of the wider question of justification based on the legitimate interest of the defendant in telling his story to the world at large in the way in which he wishes to tell it, and the corresponding interest of the public in hearing his story.



 



	When those factors are taken into account, as they must be, the only proper conclusion is that there is every justification for the publication. A person who has suffered in the way that the appellant has suffered, and has struggled to cope with the consequences of his suffering in the way that he has struggled, has the right to tell the world about it. And there is a corresponding public interest in others being able to listen to his life story in all its searing detail. Of course vulnerable children need to be protected as far as reasonably practicable from exposure to material which would harm them, but the right way of doing so is not to expand 
Wilkinson v Downton
 to ban the publication of a work of general interest. But in pointing out the general interest attaching to this publication, we do not mean to suggest that there needs to be some identifiable general interest in the subject matter of a publication for it to be justified within the meaning of 
Wilkinson v Downton
.



 



	Freedom to report the truth is a basic right to which the law gives a very high level of protection. (See, for example, 
Napier v Pressdram Ltd
 
[2009] EWCA Civ 443
, 
[2010] 1 WLR 934
, para 42.) It is difficult to envisage any circumstances in which speech which is not deceptive, threatening or possibly abusive, could give rise to liability in tort for wilful infringement of another's right to personal safety. The right to report the truth is justification in itself. That is not to say that the right of disclosure is absolute, for a person may owe a duty to treat information as private or confidential. But there is no general law prohibiting the publication of facts which will cause distress to another, even if that is the person's intention. The question whether (and, if so, in what circumstances) liability under 
Wilkinson v Downton
 might arise from words which are not deceptive or threatening, but are abusive, has not so far arisen and does not arise for consideration in this case.



 



	The Court of Appeal recognised that the appellant had a right to tell his story, but they held for the purposes of an interlocutory injunction that it was arguably unjustifiable for him to do so in graphic language. The injunction permits publication of the book only in a bowdlerised version. This presents problems both as a matter of principle and in the form of the injunction. As to the former, the book's revelation of what it meant to the appellant to undergo his experience of abuse as a child, and how it has continued to affect him throughout his life, is communicated through the brutal language which he uses. His writing contains dark descriptions of emotional hell, self-hatred and rage, as can be seen in the extracts which we have set out. The reader gains an insight into his pain but also his resilience and achievements. To lighten the darkness would reduce its effect. The court has taken editorial control over the manner in which the appellant's story is expressed. A right to convey information to the public carries with it a right to choose the language in which it is expressed in order to convey the information most effectively. (See 
Campbell v MGN Ltd 
[2004] UKHL 22
, 
[2004] 2 AC 457
, para 59, and 
In re Guardian News and Media Ltd
 
[2010] UKSC 1
, 
[2010] 2 AC 697
, para 63)



 



	The problem with the form of the injunction is that Schedule 2 defines the information which it is forbidden to publish not only by reference to its substantive content, but also by the descriptive quality of being ""graphic"". What is sufficiently ""graphic"" to fall within the ban is a matter of impression. The amplification of ""graphic"" in the court's supplementary judgment as meaning ""seriously liable to being understood by a child as vividly descriptive so as to be disturbing"" similarly lacks the clarity and certainty which an injunction properly requires. Any injunction must be framed in terms sufficiently specific to leave no uncertainty about what the affected person is or is not allowed to do. The principle has been stated in many cases and nowhere more clearly than by Lord Nicholls in 
Attorney General v Punch Ltd 
[2002] UKHL 50
, 
[2003] 1 AC 1046
 at para 35:



 



""An interlocutory injunction, like any other injunction, must be expressed in terms which are clear and certain. The injunction must define precisely what acts are prohibited. The court must ensure that the language of its order makes plain what is permitted and what is prohibited. This is a well established, soundly-based principle. A person should not be put at risk of being in contempt of court by an ambiguous prohibition, or a prohibition the scope of which is obviously open to dispute.""



	Our conclusion that the publication of the appellant's book is not within the scope of the conduct element of the tort is enough to decide this case. However, the issue of the mental element required for the tort has been argued before us and it is right that we should address it. The Court of Appeal found that the necessary intention could be imputed to the appellant. The court cannot be criticised for doing so, since it was bound by previous decisions of the court which upheld that approach (in particular, 
Janvier v Sweeney
 and 
Wong v Parkside Health NHS Trust
).



 



	There is a critical difference, not always recognised in the authorities, between imputing the existence of an intention as a matter of law and inferring the existence of an intention as a matter of fact. Imputation of an intention by operation of a rule of law is a vestige of a previous age and has no proper role in the modern law of tort. It is unsound in principle. It was abolished in the criminal law nearly 50 years ago and its continued survival in the tort of wilful infringement of the right to personal safety is unjustifiable. It required the intervention of Parliament to expunge it from the criminal law, but that was only because of the retrograde decision in 
DPP v Smith
. The doctrine was created by the courts and it is high time now for this court to declare its demise.



 



	The abolition of imputed intent clears the way to proper consideration of two important questions about the mental element of this particular tort.



 



	First, where a recognised psychiatric illness is the product of severe mental or emotional distress, a) is it necessary that the defendant should have intended to cause illness or b) is it sufficient that he intended to cause severe distress which in fact results in recognisable illness? Option b) is close to the version stated by 
Salmond & Heuston
 which attracted Lord Woolf in 
Wainwright v Home Office
.



 



	Secondly, is recklessness sufficient and, if so, how is recklessness to be defined for this purpose? Recklessness is a word capable of different shades of meaning. In everyday usage it may include thoughtlessness about the likely consequences in circumstances where there is an obvious high risk, or in other words gross negligence. In 
R v G
 
[2003] UKHL 50
, 
[2004] 1 AC 1034
, the House of Lords construed ""recklessly"" in the Criminal Damage Act 1971 as meaning that ""A person acts recklessly … with respect to … a result when he is aware of a risk that it will occur; and it is, in the circumstances known to him, unreasonable to take the risk"". The House of Lords based its interpretation on the definition proposed by the Law Commission in clause 18(c) of the Criminal Code Bill annexed to its Report on Criminal Law: A Criminal Code for England and Wales and Draft Criminal Code Bill, Vol 1 (Law Com No 177, 1989). A similar definition of recklessness was included in a draft Bill for reforming the law of offences against the person, which the Government published in 1998 but did not take forward. The Law Commission has repeated its proposal in a scoping consultation paper on Reform of Offences against the Person (LCCP 217, 2015). The exact wording of its proposed definition is:



 



""A person acts recklessly with respect to a result if he is aware of a risk that it will occur and it is unreasonable to take that risk having regard to the circumstances as he knows or believes them to be.""



	In thinking about these questions it is pertinent to consider the practical implications. Suppose that a hostage taker demands money from the family of the hostage (H) for his safe release, or that a blackmailer threatens harm to a person unless the family of the victim (V) meets his demands. The wife or parent of H or V suffers severe distress causing them to develop a recognised psychiatric illness. We doubt that anyone would dispute that in those circumstances the hostage taker or blackmailer ought to be held liable for the consequences of his evil conduct. There would be no difficulty in inferring as a matter of fact that he intended to cause severe distress to the claimant; it was the means of trying to achieve his demand. But the wrongdoer may not have had the intention to cause psychiatric illness, and he may well have given no thought to its likelihood.



 



	Compare that scenario with an example at the other end of the spectrum. The defendant has a dispute with his neighbour. Tempers become flared and he makes a deliberately insulting remark. He intends it to be upsetting, but he does not anticipate or intend that the neighbour will suffer severe emotional distress. Unfortunately the episode and in particular the insult have that effect, and the distress leads to a recognised form of psychiatric illness. It would be disproportionate to hold the defendant liable when he never intended to cause the neighbour to be seriously upset.



 



	Our answer to the first question is that of option (b) (para 83 above). Our answer to the second question is not to include recklessness in the definition of the mental element. To hold that the necessary mental element is intention to cause physical harm or severe mental or emotional distress strikes a just balance. It would lead to liability in the examples in para 85 but not in the example in para 86. It means that a person who actually intends to cause another to suffer severe mental or emotional distress (which should not be understated) bears the risk of legal liability if the deliberately inflicted severe distress causes the other to suffer a recognised psychiatric illness. A loose analogy may be drawn with the ""egg shell skull"" doctrine, which has an established place in the law of tort. This formulation of the mental element is preferable to including recklessness as an alternative to intention. Recklessness was not a term used in 
Wilkinson v Downton
 or 
Janvier v Sweeney
 and it presents problems of definition. The Law Commission's definition would be clear, but it would not cover the example of the hostage taker or the blackmailer, because it would require proof of actual foresight of the risk of the claimant suffering psychiatric illness.



 



	It would be possible to limit liability for the tort to cases in which the defendant's conduct was ""extreme, flagrant or outrageous"", as in Canada. But this argument has not so far been advanced in this country, and, although Arden LJ adverted to it as a possibility, the appellant has not sought to pursue it. We are inclined to the view, which is necessarily obiter, that the tort is sufficiently contained by the combination of a) the conduct element requiring words or conduct directed at the claimant for which there is no justification or excuse, b) the mental element requiring an intention to cause at least severe mental or emotional distress, and c) the consequence element requiring physical harm or recognised psychiatric illness.



 



	In the present case there is no basis for supposing that the appellant has an actual intention to cause psychiatric harm or severe mental or emotional distress to the claimant.



 



	We conclude that there is no arguable case that the publication of the book would constitute the requisite conduct element of the tort or that the appellant has the requisite mental element. On both grounds the appeal must be allowed and the order of Bean J restored.



 



LORD NEUBERGER: (with whom Lord Wilson agrees)



	I agree that this appeal should be allowed for the reasons given by Lady Hale and Lord Toulson. Because the issue involved is of importance and could raise some points of difficulty in other cases, I add some remarks of my own.



 



	There are various familiar circumstances in which a defendant can be liable to a claimant as a result of a statement made by the defendant. Examples include a statement which is unlawful statutorily, a breach of contract, defamatory, a breach of duty because of a pre-existing relationship, and a statement which amounts to misuse of information or a breach of the claimant's confidence, copyright, or right to privacy. This appeal concerns the circumstances in which a claimant has a cause of action for distress or psychiatric illness which he suffers as a result of a statement made by the defendant, where the statement would not otherwise give rise to a claim. It is a fundamental issue, and, particularly given the importance attached to both freedom of expression and human dignity, it can raise questions which are difficult to resolve. Having said that, the answer to the question whether there is a valid claim in the present case appears to me to be quite plain.



 



	The facts of this case are fully set out by Lady Hale and Lord Toulson in paras 1-30 above. I agree that the interlocutory injunction granted by the Court of Appeal was flawed for two reasons. First, there should have been no injunction at all, because the claimant's claim to restrain publication of the defendant's book had no prospects of success. Secondly, the terms of the injunction were flawed both conceptually and procedurally.



 



	The claimant's claim had no prospects of success because publication of the defendant's book would plainly not have given rise to a cause of action in his favour. It is true that the claimant is the defendant's son and is psychologically vulnerable, and it was argued in the Court of Appeal that this relationship gave rise to a duty of care on the part of the defendant which publication of the book would breach. However, as the Court of Appeal rightly held, that argument cannot assist the claimant in this case – see the reasoning of Arden LJ at 
[2014] EWCA Civ 1277
, paras 48-57, upholding the conclusion of Bean J at first instance on this aspect. There is, rightly, no appeal on that ground.



 



	Once that ground is disposed of, it appears to me that the book's contents simply have nothing to do with the claimant, at least from a legal perspective. The book describes the defendant's searing experiences of sexual abuse as a boy and its consequential effects. It is true, that the book is dedicated to the claimant and it expresses fears about the claimant being at risk of abuse as a child, but the furthest that that point could go would be to negative the idea that the defendant could have been unaware of the fact that the contents of the book would come to the claimant's attention at some point (which was unsurprisingly not in issue anyway).



 



	While I agree that many people would regard the book as being in some respects in the public interest, it is not necessary to decide this appeal on that ground. Unless it is necessary to do so, I am unenthusiastic about deciding whether a book, or any other work, should be published by reference to a judge's assessment of the importance of the publication to the public or even to the writer. In the present case, I do not consider that it would make any difference if the experiences which the defendant describes could be shown to have been invented, or if the book had been written as a novel by someone who had not been sexually abused. It is true that the book contained material which some people might find offensive, in terms of what was described and how it was expressed, but ""free speech includes not only the inoffensive but the irritating, the contentious, the eccentric, the heretical, the unwelcome and the provocative provided it does not tend to provoke violence"" – see 
Redmond-Bate v Director of Public Prosecutions 
 
7 BHRC 375
, para 20, per Sedley LJ. As he memorably added, ""[f]reedom only to speak inoffensively is not worth having"".



 



	Quite apart from this, it would, I think, be an inappropriate restriction on freedom of expression, an unacceptable form of judicial censorship, if a court could restrain publication of a book written by a defendant, whose contents could otherwise be freely promulgated, only refer in general and unobjectionable terms to the claimant, and are neither intended nor expected by the defendant to harm the claimant, simply because the claimant might suffer psychological harm if he got to read it (or extracts from it). Whatever the nature and ingredients of the tort whose origin can be traced to 
Wilkinson v Downton 
[1897] 2 QB 57
, it therefore cannot possibly apply in this case. And that, at least in a narrow sense, is in my view the beginning and the end of this case.



 



	As to the terms of the injunction, the Court of Appeal accepted that the defendant should be entitled to describe the ordeals which he had undergone. However, they decided that he could not publish certain specified passages in his book or any other accounts of his ordeals in so far as those accounts were ""graphic"", a description which was explained by Arden LJ as meaning ""seriously liable to being understood by a child as vividly descriptive so as to be disturbing"".



 



	There are two problems with such a form of injunction. First, it treats the terms in which events are described in the book as detachable from the inclusion of the events themselves. Freedom of expression extends not merely to what is said but also to how it is said. Whether a communication is made orally or in writing, the manner or style in which it is expressed can have a very substantial effect on what is actually conveyed to the listener or reader. One cannot realistically detach style from content in law any more than one can do so in literature or linguistic philosophy. I agree with what is said in para 78 above in this connection.



 



	The second problem with the form of injunction granted by the Court of Appeal is that it is insufficiently specific, and in that connection there is nothing which I wish to add to what is said in para 79 above.



 



	It would not, however, be right to leave matters there, in the light of the decision in 
Wilkinson 
(on which the Court of Appeal relied) and the subsequent cases in this and other common law jurisdictions, discussed by Lady Hale and Lord Toulson in paras 51-71 above. In 
Wilkinson
, the defendant was held liable to a plaintiff for severe mental distress caused to her by an untrue statement, which was misconceivedly intended as a cruel joke, namely that her husband had suffered serious injuries in an accident. The way in which the trial judge, Wright J, expressed himself in his judgment must, like all statements, be seen in its context, and that context is illuminatingly explained in paras 34-50 above. Given that there was a valid claim in that case and there is none in this case, it raises the question as to the characterisation of the tort in question, which could perhaps be characterised as the tort of making distressing statements.



 



The tort has been identified as ""terror wrongfully induced and inducing physical mischief"" (see 
Dulieu v White & Sons 
[1901] 2 KB 669
, 683 and 
Janvier v Sweeney 
[1919] 2 KB 316, 322). However, I am not happy with that characterisation, as it lumps together physical actions and statements, it begs the question by the use of the word ""wrongful"", and it is limited to ""terror"", and, as explained below, I would leave open whether ""physical mischief"" is a necessary ingredient.


 



While I would certainly accept that an action not otherwise tortious which causes a claimant distress could give rise to a cause of action, I would be reluctant to decide definitively that liability for distressing actions and distressing words should be subject to the same rules, at this stage at any rate. There is of course a substantial overlap between words and actions: after all, words can threaten or promise actions, and freedom of expression can in some respects extend to actions as well as words. And, in the light of what I say below, it might be the case that the tort of making distressing statements is to be limited to statements which are the verbal equivalent of physical assaults. However, there are relevant differences between words and actions. The reasons for a difference in legal treatment between liability for actions and liability for words were identified by Lord Reid, Lord Devlin and Lord Pearce in 
Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd 
[1964] AC 465
, 482-483, 516-519 and 534 respectively.


 



	In order to decide when a statement, which is not otherwise tortious, and which causes a claimant distress, should be capable of founding a cause of action, it is necessary to bear in mind five points, some of which are in tension. First, that there must be circumstances in which such a cause of action should exist: the facts of 
Wilkinson 
and 
Janvier 
make that point good. Secondly, given the importance of freedom of expression, which includes the need to avoid constraining ordinary (even much offensive) discourse, it is vital that the boundaries of the cause of action are relatively narrow. Thirdly, because of the importance of legal certainty, particularly in the area of what people can say, the tort should be defined as clearly as possible. Fourthly, in the light of the almost literally infinite permutations of possible human interactions, it is realistic to proceed on the basis that it may well be that no set of parameters can be devised which would cater for absolutely every possibility. Fifthly, given all these factors, there will almost inevitably be aspects of the parameters on which it would be wrong to express a concluded view, and to let the law develop in a characteristic common law way, namely on a case by case basis.



 



	In other words, the tort exists, and should be defined narrowly and as clearly as possible, but it would be dangerous to say categorically that each ingredient of the tort must always be present. Nonetheless, it seems to me that it is worth identifying what are, at least normally, and hopefully almost always, the essential ingredients of the tort.



 



	
Wilkinson 
and 
Janvier 
were cases where the statement made by the defendant was untrue, gratuitous, intended to distress the plaintiff, directed at the plaintiff, and caused the plaintiff serious distress amounting to psychiatric illness. Clearly, where all these ingredients are present, the tort would be established, but the question is whether they are all strictly required.



 



	First, if it is possible at all, it will be a very rare case where a statement which is not untrue could give rise to a claim, save, perhaps where the statement was a threat or (possibly) an insult.



 



	Sometimes, a threat will be unlawful anyway: for instance a threat of immediate assault or a blackmail. In some cases there is statutory liability for an offensive statement. Thus, a statement may be covered by the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 (as amended) which provides for both civil remedies (section 3) and criminal liability (sections 2, 2A, 4, 4A). Similarly Part IV of the Family Law Act 1996 (as amended) allows a court to make an order to protect an individual from molestation, and provides that the breach of such an order is a criminal offence. Harassment requires a course of action, so I do not think that a one-off statement could be caught by the 1997 Act. Section 4A of the Public Order Act 1986 (added by the Public Order Act 1994) provides that it is an offence to use ""threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour"" which causes ""harassment, alarm or distress"" and which is intended to have that effect. However, section 4A only creates a criminal offence, and it does not apply where the words are used ""by a person inside a dwelling and the person who is harassed, alarmed or distressed is also inside that or another dwelling"". Further, section 1 of the Malicious Communications Act 1988 criminalises communications which are ""grossly offensive"", ""a threat"" or ""known … to be false"" if at least one of the purposes is to ""cause distress or anxiety"", unless the sender had ""reasonable grounds"", but it does not appear to give rise to civil liability. And section 127 of the Communications Act 2003 criminalises electronic sending of ""grossly offensive"" or ""menacing"" messages, or ""false"" messages ""for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety to another"", but it is limited to electronic communications and appears to give rise to no civil liability.



 



	I do not consider that this is a case where it can be said that Parliament has intervened in such terms that the common law should, as it were, keep out. After all, Parliament has not legislated so as to cover, or to suggest disapproval of, claims in tort based on ""one-off"" distressing statements as in 
Wilkinson 
and 
Janvier
. On the contrary, the last 20 years have seen legislation which actually suggests that the legislature considers it appropriate for the courts to be involved, albeit in relatively limited and extreme cases, where words are used offensively.



 



	This does not, of course, mean that every untruthful statement, threat or insult could give rise to a claim. Because of the importance of freedom of expression and of the law not impeding ordinary discourse, there must be a second and demanding requirement which has to be satisfied before liability can attach to an untruth, an insult or a threat which was intended to, and did, cause distress, but would not otherwise be civilly actionable. Lady Hale and Lord Toulson have suggested a test of ""justification or reasonable excuse"" in paras 74-76 above, and I have used the adjective ""gratuitous"" in para 106 above. Neither description is ideal as it can be said to be question-begging (virtually every threat, untruth or insult can be said to be unjustified, inexcusable and gratuitous), and it involves a subjective assessment. There may be something to be said for the adjectives ""outrageous"", ""flagrant"" or ""extreme"", which seem to have been applied by the US and Canadian courts (discussed in paras 69-71 above). Of course, even with a test of outrageousness a subjective judgment will be involved to some extent, but that cannot be avoided.



 



	As mentioned, it seems to me to be vital that the tort does not interfere with the give and take of ordinary human discourse (including unpleasant, heated arguments, whether in domestic, social, business or other contexts, sometimes involving the trading of insults or threats), or with normal, including trenchant, journalism and other writing. Inevitably, whether a particular statement is gratuitous must depend on the context. An unprompted statement made simply because the defendant wanted to say it or because he was inspired by malice, as in 
Janvier
, or something very close to malice, as in 
Wilkinson
, may be different from the same statement made in the course of a heated argument, especially if provoked by a series of wounding statements by the defendant. Similarly, it would be wrong for this tort to be invoked to justify relief against a polemic op-ed newspaper article or a strongly worded and antipathetic biography, save in the most unusual circumstances. The tort should not somehow be used to extend or supplement the law of defamation.



 



	Thirdly, I consider that there must be an intention on the part of the defendant to cause the claimant distress. This requirement might seem at first sight to be too narrow, not least because it might appear that it would not have caught the defendant in 
Wilkinson
: he merely intended his cruel statement as a joke. However, the fact that a statement is intended to be a joke is not inconsistent with the notion that it was intended to upset. How, it might be asked rhetorically, could Mr Downton not have intended to cause the apparently happily married Mrs Wilkinson significant distress by falsely telling her that her husband had been very seriously injured? That was the very purpose of the so-called joke. There are statements (and indeed actions) whose consequences or potential consequences are so obvious that the perpetrator cannot realistically say that those consequences were unintended.



 



	Intentionality may seem to be a fairly strict requirement, as it excludes not merely negligently harmful statements, but also recklessly harmful statements. However, in agreement with Lady Hale and Lord Toulson, I consider that recklessness is not enough. In truth, I doubt it would add much. Further, in practice, recklessness is a somewhat tricky concept. Quite apart from this, bearing in mind the importance of freedom of expression and of the law not sticking its nose into human discourse except where necessary, it appears to me that the line should be drawn at intentionality.



 



	I am inclined to think that distressing the claimant has to be the primary purpose, but I do not consider that it need be the sole purpose. The degree of distress which is actually intended must be significant, and not trivial, and it can amount to feelings such as despair, misery, terror, fear or even serious worry. But it plainly does not have to amount to a recognised psychiatric disease (even if such disease is an essential ingredient, as to which see below). It is, I think, hard to be more specific than that.



 



	Fourthly, the statement must, I think, be directed at the claimant in order to be tortious. In most cases this will add nothing to the requirements already mentioned. However, I would have thought that a statement which is aimed at upsetting a large group of addressees, without any particular individual (or relatively small group of individuals) in mind, should not be caught.



 



	Then there is the question as to whether a claimant can only bring an action if he suffers distress to a sufficient degree to amount to a recognised illness or condition (whether psychological or physiological - assuming that the distinction is a valid one). Like Lord Hoffmann in 
Wainwright v Home Office 
[2003] UKHL 53
, 
[2004] 2 AC 406
, I consider that there is much to be said for the view that the class of potential claimants should not be limited to those who can establish that they suffered from a recognised psychiatric illness as a result of the actionable statement of the defendant.



 



	Such a limitation seems to have been imposed by Kennedy J at pp 672-673 in 
Dulieu
, when he referred to ""terror"" which ""operates through parts of the physical organism to produce bodily illness"". However, that was a case involving a negligent act, and, as already explained, I am unconvinced that it involved the same tort as 
Wilkinson
, although it was relied on by Kennedy J. It would seem that the reasoning in 
Dulieu
 was consistent with the principle that damages for distress in negligence are only recoverable for a ""recognisable psychiatric illness"" and not merely for ""grief and sorrow"", as Lord Denning MR put it in 
Hinz v Berry 
[1970] 2 QB 40, 42-43, an approach which was followed by Lord Bridge of Harwich in 
McLoughlin v O'Brian
 
[1983] 1 AC 410
, 437.



 



	This limitation appears to have been imposed in cases of negligence as a matter of policy, and it has been justified in a number of cases on the ground that grief and distress are part of normal life, whereas psychiatric illness is not – see eg 
McLoughlin
 at p 431 per Lord Bridge and 
White v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police
 
[1999] 2 AC 455
, 465 per Lord Griffiths. The Australian High Court has justified the rule by reference to the undesirability of encouraging litigation – see 
Tame v New South Wales
 
(2002) 211 CLR 317
, para 194 per Gummow and Kirby JJ. However, in some negligence cases, it appears that damages for distress falling short of psychiatric illness may be recoverable – see the observations of Brooke LJ in 
Robinson v St Helens Metropolitan Borough Council
 
[2002] EWCA Civ 1099
, paras 36-37. And, as is pointed out in 
McGregor on Damages 
(19th ed) (2014), paras 5-012 and 5-013, injury to feelings is taken into account when assessing general damages in claims, by way of example, for assault, invasion of privacy, malicious prosecution and defamation.



 



	As I see it, therefore, there is plainly a powerful case for saying that, in relation to the instant tort, liability for distressing statements, where intent to cause distress is an essential ingredient, it should be enough for the claimant to establish that he suffered significant distress as a result of the defendant's statement. It is not entirely easy to see why, if an intention to cause the claimant significant distress is an ingredient of the tort and is enough to establish the tort in principle, the claimant should have to establish that he suffered something more serious than significant distress before he can recover any compensation. Further, the narrow restrictions on the tort should ensure that it is rarely invoked anyway.



 



	In the light of article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, it is appropriate to consider the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court. This is a case which involves a purely common law issue, but the common law should be generally consistent with the Convention and it would be arrogant to assume that there may be no assistance to be gained from the Strasbourg jurisprudence – see Lord Reed's illuminating analysis in R (
Osborn) v Parole Board
 
[2013] UKSC 61
, 
[2014] AC 1115
, paras 56-63. In that connection, there have been a number of cases where the Strasbourg court has been called on to rule on the compatibility of a ruling of a national court or tribunal that an offensive statement was unlawful. A number of those decisions were summarised in 
R (Gaunt) v Office of Communications
 
[2011] EWCA Civ 692
, 
[2011] 1 WLR 2355
, paras 25-30. They all involved statements made in public, but some of them involved statements which had been held unlawful because they were personally insulting. I do not think that these cases take matters much further for present purposes, other than to confirm the vital nature of freedom of expression, the consequent requirement to ""establish"" that there is a cause of action ""convincingly"", the importance of taking into account the context, and the need for proportionality both in deciding whether there is a cause of action and in determining the sanction.



 



	The final point I should make is that this case has been argued in this court on the basis that the issue between the parties has to be resolved according to English law, rather than the law of the US, where the claimant resides. It may well be that that is right (as the Court of Appeal held), or that, even if United States law is in fact applicable, it is the same as our law.



 



	In all these circumstances, it seems to me clear, even at this interlocutory stage, that the claimant's case plainly fails all but one of the requirements of the tort on which it is said to be based. While there is some (disputed) evidence that they could cause the claimant serious distress, the contents of the defendant's book are not untrue, threatening or insulting, they are not gratuitous or unjustified, let alone outrageous, they are not directed at the claimant, and they are not intended to distress the claimant. Accordingly, I have no hesitation in agreeing that the appeal should be allowed, and the order of Bean J striking out the claim restored.",2015-05-20 00:00:00,UK Supreme Court
