2701868,Proud v R (No 2) [2016] NSWCCA 44,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: I agree with R A Hulme J in respect of each of the grounds of appeal. It follows that the appellant's conviction must be set aside: as a retrial is appropriate, there is no reason not to direct it.
	
	
	There are two issues which arise from these conclusions which may be thought to warrant brief comment. First, there is at least a superficial inconsistency between the rejection of the proviso with respect to ground 1 and the rejection of ground 3. The inconsistency is superficial, because the onus was on the prosecutor to establish that, despite the error constituted by ground 1, no substantial miscarriage of justice had actually occurred. On the other hand, the onus was on the appellant, in support of ground 3, to establish that the verdict was unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence. However, there was a more basic reason why the proviso did not apply in the present case. The misdirection, which, most unfortunately, may have left a cloud over the appellant's evidence, constituted an irregularity which can be described as ""such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings"": Wilde v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 365 at 373 (Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ); see also Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; 80 ALJR 614 at [6]-[8] (Gleeson CJ); [35]-[36] (Gummow and Hayne JJ); [105]-[109] (Kirby J) and [158] (Callinan and Heydon JJ). The effect of the proviso would depend upon this Court's assessment of the explanations given by the appellant for her apparently damning admissions, in circumstances where she had been deprived of her right to have the jury assess her evidence without warnings as to its possible unreliability. Although the scope of the principle articulated in Wilde is not capable of precise description, this is a case where it cannot be said that no substantial miscarriage occurred; the miscarriage arose from the significant departure from the principles governing a criminal trial with a jury.
	
	
	The second matter concerns the directions given in relation to the involvement of the appellant in what may colloquially be described as a joint criminal enterprise. I specifically agree with the statements of R A Hulme J concerning the manner in which questions of accessorial liability are left to the jury. The submissions in the present case provided a lucid example of the risks of using language which departs from the basic principles of the criminal law. Because the appellant was said to have engaged in a ""joint criminal enterprise"" it was suggested that the jury had to be satisfied that there was some form of ""agreement"" between the co-offenders, the scope of which was to be identified, together with ""acts of participation"" which were to be particularised for the jury.
	
	
	The principles of accessorial liability are set out in Pt 9 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). While it is true that some of the language such as the reference in s 345 to a ""principal in the second degree"" and in s 346 to an ""accessory before the fact"" may be opaque to a lay juror, the factual requirements as to state of mind and level of involvement are well-established by the cases and can be explained with reasonable clarity in ordinary language. It is at least in part the departure in recent times from those established concepts which led the UK Supreme Court to revisit the directions required in R v Jogee [2016] UKSC 8.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of R A Hulme J and the additional comments of Basten JA. I agree with the reasons and orders proposed by R A Hulme J. In addition, I agree with the conclusion of Basten JA at [2] with respect to the proviso.
	
	
	R A HULME J: Michelle Sharon Proud was tried before Harrison J and a jury for the murder of Ms Katherine Foreman at Corrimal on 27 October 2011. She was jointly indicted with Bradley Max Rawlinson and Bernard Justin Spicer. A co-offender, Wendy Evans, had earlier pleaded guilty.
	
	
	On the 28th day of the trial Bernard Spicer made an application to be discharged so as to be tried separately from his co-accused on account of certain evidence that had been given by Ms Proud. The learned trial judge acceded to that application. Mr Spicer was subsequently tried and convicted.
	
	
	On 11 April 2014 the jury returned verdicts of guilty in respect of Ms Proud and Mr Rawlinson. On 3 July 2014 Ms Proud was sentenced to imprisonment for 20 years with a non-parole period of 14 years.
	
	
	Ms Proud appeals against her conviction but not her sentence. The grounds of appeal are:
	


1   A miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of his Honour's warning to the jury to regard with ""considerable caution"" the evidence of the appellant as a result of her being a person who ""might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceedings"".

2   His Honour erred in not properly directing the jury as to the element of participation in the joint criminal enterprise.

3   The verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence.


	
	Ms Proud was granted leave at the hearing on 11 March 2016 to add a further ground (see Proud v R [2016] NSWCCA 41 at [17]):
	


4   His Honour erred in directing the jury on extended joint criminal enterprise and the requisite mental state.

The prosecution case


	
	Katherine Foreman died at her home in the early hours of 27 October 2011 when the upstairs bedroom in which she was sleeping was set alight. Petrol had been poured inside the bedroom and ignited. Ms Foreman's body was found lying on the landing at the top of the stairs. The Crown case was that this was the culmination of a joint criminal enterprise between Evans, Rawlinson, Spicer and the appellant to either kill or at least cause serious harm to Ms Foreman.
	
	
	The relationships between the participants in the joint criminal enterprise were complicated: see the description provided by Harrison J in sentencing Evans, Rawlinson and Spicer (R v Evans; R v Rawlinson; R v Proud [2014] NSWSC 979 (""the sentence judgment"")) at [6]-[11]. It will suffice for present purposes to note that Mr Rawlinson and Ms Evans were in a relationship as were Mr Spicer and the appellant. Ms Evans, a former court officer, was a friend of the deceased, a solicitor, they having met through their work. The appellant was a friend of Ms Evans; on the Crown case a close and loyal friend. Mr Spicer was a friend as well but to a lesser extent.
	
	
	There was evidence of various events which occurred from July 2011 which indicated that Ms Evans and Mr Rawlinson bore the deceased a considerable degree of animosity which developed to the point when the plan was formulated which led to the murder. The prosecution contended that the appellant was motivated by her loyalty to Ms Evans to assist with the plan; from what she had heard from Ms Evans she adopted a similar degree of animosity towards the deceased.
	
	
	It was the prosecution case that in the early hours of the morning of 27 October 2011 Wendy Evans and Bernard Spicer entered Ms Foreman's home using keys that had been provided by Bradley Rawlinson. Spicer spread petrol around the bedroom and Evans lit the fire.
	
	
	Harrison J found that Spicer, Evans and Rawlinson had an intention to kill (sentence judgment at [120], [168]; R v Spicer [2015] NSWSC 519 at [38]). Rawlinson was not present when the fire was set but was involved in planning for it to occur. He was described by the judge as ""the principal and driving force behind the conception and consummation of the offence"" (sentence judgment at [157]).
	
	
	The Crown case against the appellant was that she acted as an intermediary between Evans and Spicer. She was also involved in arranging payment by Evans to Spicer and herself for their involvement. Harrison J found the appellant to have been ""a willing and enthusiastic contributor in the plan to cause very substantial harm to the deceased"" but, as a party to ""an agreement to cause grievous bodily harm"", her culpability was distinguished from the others (sentence judgment at [173]-[174]).
	
	
	The principal evidence against the appellant included a covertly recorded conversation she had with another person seven weeks after the murder in which, on the Crown case, she spoke of the instructions she had given her partner, Bernard Spicer, as to what he was to do. There was also evidence of her involvement in the transfer of money by Wendy Evans prior to the murder and later following up on the payment of an outstanding amount.
	


Admission to Danielle Gallagher


	
	The appellant had a conversation with a friend, Ms Danielle Gallagher, at the appellant's home on 15 December 2011. Unbeknown to her it was being recorded. (Exhibit AAAE at p267)
	
	
	The appellant asked Ms Gallagher if she could ""keep a really, really, really big secret"". She said she was being investigated by the Homicide Squad and proceeded to tell Ms Gallagher how Ms Foreman had been killed. She made various disparaging comments about the deceased but claimed that what occurred was intended to be ""a warning thing for her to back off""; ""they weren't supposed to kill her"". She told Ms Gallagher of a plan to provide police with a story that would exclude Spicer from involvement. In the course of this conversation the appellant said:
	


""And it wasn't supposed to kill her, it was only supposed to warn her to back off. See, all BJ [Spicer] was supposed to do, like I said to BJ all you do is, is you go in there, you mess her up a bit, I said damage her face, because she thought she's this crash hot …

Just bash her a bit and that, put her in hospital to the point her face can't be fixed and no one will want her after that …

… [S]o Wendy went asked if we knew anyone that could do the job and like she'd pay them.

And BJ said, 'Well, we need the cash' cause we wanted to get another car.

And she rang us before I lost me licence and we were going to get another car with it and then um, yeah, so BJ said, 'I'll do it for you, Wendy' but it wasn't supposed to kill her, it was just supposed to scare her …” (Emphasis added)

The appellant's evidence


	
	The appellant said in her evidence in chief that Wendy Evans rang her on the night of 25 October 2011 and ""asked me if I knew anyone that could do something to Katie"". She replied, ""No"". She told Mr Spicer of the request and ""that I didn't want him getting involved in it"".
	
	
	The appellant said that she later heard Mr Spicer on the telephone saying ""I will do it"". He later ""told us we were going on a holiday"" to Wollongong and that Wendy Evans would drive them there. On 26 October 2011 Ms Evans collected her and her three children from their home at Whalan and drove them to the Oasis Motel at Windang. On the way she asked Ms Evans what Mr Spicer had meant when he said ""he will do it"". Ms Evans explained that ""she was getting BJ to scare Katie""; ""she wanted someone to go in there … mess her up to the point she didn't look pretty anymore, bash her to the point she was put in hospital because she thought she was crash hot"". The appellant said that she told Ms Evans, ""If BJ said he'll scare, he'll just scare her"". She also said that she (the appellant) did not want to get involved in it.
	
	
	The appellant said that after arriving at the motel, Ms Evans left and went back to pick up Mr Spicer and her step-daughter. Late that night Ms Evans returned to the motel and Mr Spicer went away with her. The appellant claimed that ""she was taking him to Kmart"" although she did not know why. Mr Spicer returned sometime in the early hours the following morning. He told her what had occurred:
	


""He said that he went and bought petrol from the servo and Jiffy Firelighters. He then went around to Katie's house with Wendy. He went upstairs, poured the petrol around the bed. Katie woke up screaming, and he doesn't understand why she didn't get up and run, and then he left after that – and Wendy lit the cloth but couldn't go through with it and threw it away. He re-picked it up and threw it towards the bed.""


	
	The appellant claimed that she did not become aware that Ms Foreman had been killed until the following afternoon (27 October). She told Mr Spicer who said ""It wasn't supposed to happen like that"".
	
	
	The appellant's counsel asked her about the conversation she had on 15 December 2011 with Danielle Gallagher. She said she had been trying to concoct an untruthful story to conceal Mr Spicer's involvement. She denied that she had any prior knowledge of what was to occur aside from the conversation she had in the car with Ms Evans on the way to Windang.
	
	
	She was taken specifically by her counsel to the part of the conversation with Ms Gallagher that included her saying ""like I said to BJ, 'All you do is … go in there, you mess her up a bit'"". She explained:
	


""When I tell a story or relay a story I tend to use those words. That's just a saying I use.""


	
	She maintained that she did not give instructions to Mr Spicer. She was simply conveying what Wendy Evans had told her.
	
	
	The appellant maintained the essence of this account in the course of cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor. She explained that when she told Ms Gallagher that ""we wanted to get another car"" she meant ""he [Mr Spicer] wanted to get another car"".
	
	
	She maintained that when she said to Ms Gallagher ""I said to BJ"" she was not conveying something that she herself had said to Mr Spicer. What she meant to be conveying was that, ""Wendy said to BJ"". And where she was recorded as having said ""I said 'damage her face'"" she meant that ""Wendy said, 'damage her face'"".
	
	
	The appellant said in her evidence in chief that sometime after returning home to Whalan she had a conversation by telephone with Wendy Evans in which she asked Ms Evans ""what the hell had happened"". She said Ms Evans replied:
	


""[I]t wasn’t' supposed to be like that, all BJ was supposed to do was go in there, mess her face up a bit to the point she didn't look pretty anymore, bash her to the point she was in hospital because she thought she was crash hot.""


	
	In cross-examination, she said (with obvious reference to the conversation with Ms Gallagher):
	


""[A]fter I got off the phone from Wendy after it happened, I went out to BJ and said, 'BJ, what you were supposed to do was go in there, mess her up a bit'. That's why I said here, 'Like I said to BJ, 'Go in there, mess her up' because I said to BJ, 'You were supposed to do this, not kill her'. That's why I said it.""

Payment of money


	
	Ms Peggy Case is the sister of Bernard Spicer. Ms Case was employed by the TAB and she had a TAB account which she allowed her brother to use. On 26 October 2011, an amount of $1000 was deposited into her account after the appellant telephoned her and said that her friend Wendy was going to put money into the account. Ms Case asked her why and the appellant explained that she was going to Wollongong for a few days because she was stressed out. Ms Case said that she withdrew the money from the account and gave it to her brother. There was evidence that the deposit occurred at 11.57am and Ms Case made the withdrawal at 12.33pm on 26 October 2011.
	
	
	Ms Case also gave evidence of another sum of $1000 deposited to her account which she understood was money from Wendy. Her brother asked her to withdraw it and he came and collected it. This occurred on 8 November 2011.
	
	
	A sum of $350 was deposited to Ms Case's account on 25 November 2011 which she withdrew and gave to her brother.
	
	
	There was evidence that the appellant and Mr Spicer were angered because Ms Evans had not paid the full amount promised. Ms Aimie Hull, who had known the appellant since school, gave evidence that after the appellant had returned from her trip to Wollongong she complained that ""Wendy dogged on us"". A few days later the appellant told her that she was waiting on Wendy to put ""a couple of thousand"" dollars in her account. A couple of days after that the appellant told her that Wendy had not paid the money and said ""if she didn't pay the money they were going to bash her"".
	
	
	The pursuit by the appellant and Mr Spicer of the money owed by Ms Evans was vividly illustrated by a voice message the appellant left for Ms Evans on 18 November in which she said:
	


""I want my fucking money bitch and this is Michelle. Where is my fucking money? I'll come down and I'll hunt you down. I know where Brad lives so don't fucking stuff me around. I'm nearly kicked out of my fucking house."" (Exhibit AAAE p 111) (Emphasis added)


	
	The appellant denied in her evidence that she had any knowledge or involvement in the transfer of money from Ms Evans (and Mr Rawlinson) to Mr Spicer prior to the death of Ms Foreman. She only found out later when Mr Spicer told her. She explained that contact between Ms Case's phone and her home landline phone between the deposit to and withdrawal from Ms Case's TAB account on 26 October 2011 did not involve her as she was out shopping at the time.
	


Ground 1 – error in warning the jury that the appellant's evidence may be unreliable


	
	The appellant gave her evidence in chief on the 25th day of the trial (24 March 2014). The day's evidence concluded after counsel for Bradley Rawlinson had cross-examined her. After the jury were released for the day, counsel for Bernard Spicer made an application for a separate trial on the basis that he had been taken by surprise by evidence of Ms Proud that was damaging to his client's case. The judge ruled on the application the following morning; it was refused: R v Rawlinson; R v Proud; R v Spicer [2014] NSWSC 329. The continuation of the evidence was deferred by a day to allow Mr Spicer's counsel to obtain instructions as he was next to cross-examine.
	
	
	It is of some significance for present purposes to note that in the course of submissions on Mr Spicer's application the Crown Prosecutor referred to the admission he had made, according to the appellant's evidence, as ""very important evidence in the case against Mr Spicer"". He also referred to it as ""important admissible evidence coming out during one of the defence cases"".
	
	
	Counsel for Bernard Spicer cross-examined the appellant on the 27th day of the trial (26 March 2014). Suffice to say that her credibility was seriously questioned. It was in the course of that cross-examination that the appellant said various things which were unfairly prejudicial to Mr Spicer (e.g. a reference to his past criminality; he was not working because he was on parole) which prompted a further application to separate his trial which was granted.
	
	
	After the jury departed at the conclusion of the evidence that day there was a short preliminary discussion about the directions the judge would be required to give the jury in his summing up. The Crown Prosecutor listed a number of matters including:
	


""There will be s 165 warnings about the various categories of evidence that that applies to.""


	
	The learned judge's summing up to the jury commenced on Tuesday 8 April 2014. A juror was absent the following day and the summing up concluded the next afternoon. In the absence of the jury on 9 April the opportunity was taken for there to be some further discussion about directions which included the following:
	


""HIS HONOUR: Are there any matters that we can deal with?

TERRACINI [Counsel for Rawlinson]: We have your Honour's directions on joint criminal enterprise. We still ask your Honour to add that sentence that I made application about last week. That was opposed by the Crown and the fact that it's not in your Honour's directions –

HIS HONOUR: Before you say anything, Mr Terracini, I can indicate the fact that it's not in the written directions has not yet foreclosed my concern or decision about whether or not to include it in oral directions.

TERRACINI: I just re-agitate that; I don't put it any higher.

HIS HONOUR: I understand. I'm aware of that.

TERRACINI: Upon reflection, I think I should ask for a 165 direction on [Name of witness], the escort.

HIS HONOUR: I was proposing to give one in relation to Ms Proud.

TERRACINI: The only basis that we could mount an application for a 165, I think, would be the history of drug use, reliability and memory.

HIS HONOUR: Having recently reviewed once again your submissions concerning [Name of witness], Mr Terracini, there was little about her credit, or lack of it, that could be said that you failed to say.

TERRACINI: No, it was all encompassing.

HIS HONOUR: It was all encompassing, and then some, I suspect."" (9.4.14 at T82) (Emphasis added)


	
	It would seem that no-one heard or noticed what the judge said in the italicised portion of that exchange.
	
	
	During the course of the continued summing up the following day his Honour gave the following direction that is the subject of this ground of appeal (as extracted from the revised transcript):
	


""Section 165(1)(d) and (2) – evidence given by a witness being a person who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding

[357] Now, in the events that have occurred in this case, although obviously not called by the Crown in its case as a witness, the Crown relies upon the evidence of Ms Proud in some respects, who is asserted by it to be a person who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the present proceedings. Indeed, that is obvious because she is an accused person in this trial.

[358] The law requires me to give you certain warnings and directions concerning this evidence. They are given in every case in which the Crown relies upon the evidence of a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceedings before the Court. They are not given in this case because of any view that I have formed concerning Ms Proud's evidence.

[359] The need to give such directions arises because the courts have, over the years, accumulated a great deal of experience concerning the reliability of evidence given by a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events that give rise to the proceedings before the Court, and that experience would not readily be known to general members of the public. Experience has shown that the evidence given by such a witness is often unreliable. In saying that, I do not intend to suggest, however, that such evidence is always unreliable.

[360] My purpose in giving you these directions is only to warn you that the evidence of such a witness may be unreliable and for that reason alone you should approach that evidence with considerable caution in the way that I will shortly outline.

[361] There are, no doubt, many reasons why the evidence of such a person may be unreliable. I will give you some possible reasons.

[362] It is only natural, you may think, that a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceedings may want to shift the blame from himself or herself on to others and to justify his or her own conduct. In the process, the witness may construct untruthful stories, which tend to play down his or her part in the crime and play up the part of others in the crime, even going so far as to blame quite innocent people.

[363] Persons reasonably supposed to be involved in the commission of an offence may make false claims as to the involvement of others out of motives of revenge or feelings of dislike or hostility.

[364] There may be reasons why such a witness has given false evidence. However, it is not for the accused to establish the reason or reasons why such a witness may have been lying.

[365] Experience has shown that once such a witness has given a version to the police, for example, inculpating an accused, he or she may feel locked into that version, even it contained inaccuracies or even if it was substantially untrue.

[366] In this case when assessing the evidence of Ms Proud, you must remember those warnings and directions that I have just given to you.""


	
	The jury were sent out for lunch a short time later and the following exchange occurred:
	


""PULLINGER [Counsel for the appellant]: Your Honour gave an unreliability warning under the terms of 165 in relation to the evidence of Ms Proud.

HIS HONOUR: But you wanted me to give it in relation to—

PULLINGER: My recollection, your Honour, is that no one has made a request of your Honour to give any such warning. Your Honour gave it on the basis as suggesting that the Crown relied upon her evidence and then gave the warning in that regard. That puts the accused Ms Proud in this invidious position that it may have the effect of undermining her evidence on the basis that the Crown wants to rely upon it and it would be unfair in my submission to have her tainted with an unreliability warning on that basis, particularly bearing in mind nobody has requested it.

HIS HONOUR: My mistake. Mr Crown?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, your Honour, 165 does become operationally, it would appear, pursuant to a request by a party, that's 165(2), ""if there is a jury and a party so requests"" and my learned friend didn't request that warning. It is open for a trial judge to give a 165 warning in relation to an accused who gives evidence and becomes a witness. ""Witness"" is defined to include a defendant but, in the absence of a request, it would seem that 165 doesn't become operational.

I had understood your Honour was going to give the 165 warning in relation to the ERISP of Wendy Evans insofar as it was hearsay, so I don't oppose the application by my learned friend.

HIS HONOUR: What's the application? Do you want me to tell them to disregard what I have said?

PULLINGER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: I can do that in fulsome terms. I'm not sure about the ERISP.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: The Crown would submit your Honour gave that direction but I don't know what your Honour means by ""fulsome"".

HIS HONOUR: Well, that's a word that's often misused or misinterpreted.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Perhaps your Honour might want to consider it over lunch as to how you deal with it.

HIS HONOUR: I suppose I was merely indicating that anything I say to the jury ought to be adequate to satisfy Mr Pullinger's concern that any harm caused by it has been salved. That's all I mean.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I have no objection to that.

TERRACINI: Your Honour could say that was the Crown's case and you're not trying to suggest to the jury that's your view; you're not giving them a direction but that's what the Crown case is.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, I have no problem with that.

TERRACINI: As long as your Honour takes away your Honour's imprimatur, that is the Crown's case but it's not your Honour's view.

HIS HONOUR: I certainly said that, I think you will find, in the course of the direction. I think Mr Pullinger's concern is slightly different though.

PULLINGER: I think my concern, if I have expressed it correctly, your Honour, is that in giving the warning, your Honour adverted to the Crown's reliance on Ms Proud's evidence and then went on to deliver a warning.

HIS HONOUR: You're absolutely correct about that. Mr Pullinger, I will turn my mind to that. Do you want to give me your version of what you say would be a satisfactory recitation from me to deal with the matter?

PULLINGER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: If you can get that to me in chambers as soon as you can, that would be appreciated.

PULLINGER: It will probably be handwritten, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Are there any other matters that anyone wanted to raise apart from that?

TERRACINI: No, your Honour.

PULLINGER: No, your Honour.

LUNCHEON ADJOURNMENT

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, I have the draft proposed additional direction that your Honour suggested in relation to the 165 warning. The Crown submission is that where your Honour has ""The Crown has submitted that Ms Proud is a witness whose evidence may be unreliable"", the Crown submits your Honour should say instead, ""The Crown has submitted that Ms Proud is a witness whose evidence is unreliable.""

HIS HONOUR: And the rest is all right?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: What about the third sentence, that is proposed by Mr Pullinger - that's all right, that is a general comment. Are you happy with that, Mr Pullinger?

PULLINGER: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I had your written direction but I thought I should go a bit further.

PULLINGER: I am happy with the way your Honour has done it.

HIS HONOUR: We will have the jury back, I will give that direction and then we will have the ballot.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour is just giving the formal last directions as to return of verdict?

HIS HONOUR: I am going to do that after we have the ballot. I thought it was slightly impertinent to those who are released.

You didn't want to have any input, Mr Terracini, into the direction I am about to give?

TERRACINI: No, your Honour, I was present when Mr Pullinger sent me a draft so I read it."" (10.4.14 at T142-4)


	
	It is apparent from this exchange that the appellant's counsel sent the judge a written suggested direction during the luncheon adjournment. A copy was not marked for identification and the parties have been unable to locate it on the court file or elsewhere.
	
	
	It is also clear that the judge's first reaction was to suggest that he should tell the jury to disregard what he had said about the potential unreliability of the appellant's evidence. However, senior counsel for the co-accused Rawlinson (who it would seem had no direct interest in the subject) suggested that he could tell the jury that he had not been expressing a personal view or giving a direction but simply conveying that it was the Crown case that the appellant's evidence was unreliable. As it turned out, that is the substance of what the judge ultimately said.
	
	
	The jury returned to court and the judge gave the following further direction (again, extracted from the revised transcript):
	


“Reliability of Ms Proud’s evidence

[394] I just need to clarify something that I said during the course of my summing-up to you before lunch concerning Ms Proud. In the course of my summing-up, I indicated that the Crown relied upon the evidence of Ms Proud. The law on occasion has found that the evidence of a witness involved in a criminal offence may be unreliable. The Crown has submitted that Ms Proud is a witness whose evidence is unreliable. I want to make it clear, however, that I have no view or opinion about that, and you should not proceed upon the basis that I do. Ms Proud is entitled to be considered and assessed by you in the same way as any other witness.

[395] The fact that the Crown has submitted that you should not believe Ms Proud is no more and no less than a part of the way the Crown has presented its case against her. It is a matter for you whether you accept or reject what the Crown says about Ms Proud's reliability. I direct you as the trial judge that I am not offering an opinion that in this case you should regard Ms Proud's evidence as being in a class that may be unreliable.”

Appellant's submissions


	
	Ms Loukas SC on behalf of the appellant acknowledged that r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies so that leave is required for her to raise this ground.
	
	
	It was submitted that the clarification of the warning later given by the trial judge was not effective in withdrawing it. The substance of the clarification was that the potential unreliability of the appellant's evidence was something for which the Crown contended and it was something about which the judge was not offering his opinion. In written submissions the following matters were listed as having not been withdrawn by the redirection:
	


“That courts have ‘experience’ that may not be obvious to members of the public in relation to such witnesses.

That in this experience, such witnesses may be ‘unreliable’, ‘want to shift the blame from himself or herself on to others’, construct untruthful stories, which tend to play down his or her part in the crime’, ‘give false evidence’, and may ‘feel locked into’ a false version given to police.

That the jury should approach the evidence with considerable caution’.

That in assessing the evidence of Ms Proud, the jury must ‘remember those warnings and directions’.”

Crown submissions


	
	The Crown in this Court accepted that the warning about the potential unreliability of the appellant's evidence was erroneous. However, the fact that no complaint was made about the clarification later given by the trial judge was indicative of it being considered adequate in the atmosphere of the trial.
	
	
	The Crown also emphasised that the judge had given the jury directions about the onus and standard of proof. These directions included that the appellant was presumed to be innocent unless and until the Crown persuaded the jury of guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The fact that the appellant had given evidence did not alter the burden of proof. It was for the Crown to persuade the jury that the evidence of the appellant (as well as what she had told police) together with the evidence of the witnesses she called should not be accepted as a version that could possibly be true.
	
	
	So, the Crown submitted, the position left to the jury was that it was the Crown alone who was saying that the appellant's evidence was unreliable. Even if the jury disbelieved her evidence entirely, it remained for the Crown to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	In written submissions, the Crown submitted that even if error be found, the proviso in s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) should apply as ""no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred"". However, when pressed at the hearing of the appeal, senior counsel conceded that there was ""arguably"" a fundamental defect in the trial that would render application of the proviso inapt.
	


Rule 4


	
	In relation to the operation of r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, Hunt J (as his Honour then was), with the agreement of Gleeson CJ and Mahoney JA, said in R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536 that the rule is ""no mere technicality which may simply be brushed aside"". One of its purposes is ""to ensure that the trial judge receives the assistance from counsel to which he or she is entitled in the task of giving appropriate directions to the jury"". That did not occur in the present case.
	
	
	However, there is no suggestion that the acquiescence of trial counsel to the ""clarification"" direction was explicable by counsel hoping to gain some forensic advantage. More significantly, the ground is concerned with the judge having given the initial warning about the appellant's evidence (to which, taking a broad view, objection was taken), not with the later attempt to clarify it. In any event, if the appellant establishes that she has lost a real chance (or a chance fairly open) of being acquitted the rule should not stand in her way: see, generally, ARS v R [2011] NSWCCA 266 at [59] (Bathurst CJ) and particularly Picken v R [2007] NSWCCA 319 at [20]-[21] (Mason P).
	


Section 165


	
	Section 165 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) provides (relevantly):
	


""165 Unreliable evidence

(1) This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence:

…

(d) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding,

…

(2) If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to:

(a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and

(b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and

(c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it.

(3) The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so.

(4) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving the warning or information.

(5) This section does not affect any other power of the judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury.""


	
	As noted by both trial counsel and the Crown Prosecutor, the section was not engaged because there had been no request by a party for the judge to give the direction. That is not determinative, however, given the judge was empowered by sub-s (5) to give a warning, if appropriate, regardless of any request. The question is whether a warning was appropriate and, if not, whether it was productive of a miscarriage of justice.
	


Caselaw


	
	Robinson v The Queen [1991] HCA 38; 180 CLR 531 concerned a trial of a rape charge in which the issue was consent. The trial judge directed that when assessing the evidence of witnesses the jury should consider whether a witness had an interest in the outcome of the case, adding:
	


""You might think – it is a matter solely for you – that the accused had the greatest interest of all the witnesses you saw and heard and that, therefore, you should scrutinize his evidence closely.""


	
	It was noted that the judge had directed the jury in unexceptional terms about the Crown bearing the onus of proof, including in the event that the jury disbelieved the accused and his witnesses. Notwithstanding such directions, the Court held (at 535-6) that there had been a serious misdirection affecting the fairness of the trial. It had the effect that ""the evidence of the appellant had to be scrutinized more carefully than the evidence of any other witness, including the complainant, for no reason other than that he was the accused"". The direction was described as having the effect that ""the appellant was to be treated as a 'suspect witness'"". The presumption of innocence had been undermined.
	
	
	The direction in the present case did not make any reference to the appellant’s interest in the outcome of the trial. It did, however, require the jury to approach her evidence with “considerable caution” because she was one of the persons accused of the murder with which the trial was concerned.
	
	
	In Hargraves v The Queen; Stoten v The Queen [2011] HCA 44; 245 CLR 257 the plurality (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) took the opportunity to consider what had been decided in Robinson v The Queen. It was noted that it had been held that the trial judge's directions ""had the effect that the evidence of the appellant had to be scrutinised more carefully than the evidence of any other witness, including the complainant, for no reason other than that he was the accused"" and that ""virtually had the effect that the appellant was to be treated as a 'suspect witness'"". However it was noted that the Crown had conceded that there had been a misdirection and the appeal was allowed without argument. In those circumstances, it was considered (at [34]) that there were difficulties in treating the case as having established some new rule or principle.
	
	
	It was noted that in both Robinson v The Queen and the present case ""the immediate question was … whether on any ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice"" (i.e. one of the grounds of appeal in s 668E(1) of the Criminal Code (Qld) as it is in s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW)). The decision in the former was described (at [38]) as stemming from the fundamental features of a criminal trial which were described in the following way in RPS v The Queen [2000] HCA 3; 199 CLR 620 at [22]:
	


""[A] criminal trial is an accusatorial process in which the prosecution bears the onus of proving the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.""


	
	The same point was made in Robinson v The Queen (at [535-6):
	


""If [the presumption of innocence] is to have any real effect in a criminal trial, the jury must act on the basis that the accused is presumed innocent of the acts which are the subject of the indictment until they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he or she is guilty of those acts.""


	
	The plurality continued:
	


""[41] … These being the fundamental features of a criminal trial, it follows that the judge's instructions to the jury must accord with them and departure from them would be a miscarriage of justice.""


	
	After some general remarks about features of a summing up, they continued:
	


""[42] … But informing and underpinning all of these requirements is that the judge's instructions to the jury, whether by way of legal direction or judicial commentary on the facts, must not deflect the jury's attention from the need to be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt of the accused's guilt before returning a verdict of guilty.""


	
	Three examples were given (at [43]-[45]) to demonstrate that a jury's attention can be deflected from its fundamental task in various ways. RPS v The Queen involved inappropriate comment by a trial judge on the failure of the accused to give evidence. Palmer v The Queen [1998] HCA 2; 193 CLR 1 involved a person accused of sexual offences being asked whether the person could offer any reason or motive for the complainant to lie. And Robinson v The Queen itself involved an invitation to the jury to test an accused's evidence according to his interest in the outcome of the trial and a suggestion that his evidence should be scrutinised more carefully than that of other witnesses, thus deflecting the jury from applying the requisite onus and standard of proof.
	
	
	The plurality judgment concluded on the subject (relevantly):
	


""[45] … The instructions which a trial judge gives to a jury must not, whether by way of legal direction or judicial comment on the facts, deflect the jury from its fundamental task of deciding whether the prosecution has proved the elements of the charged offence beyond reasonable doubt.

[46] The principle that is identified is expressed at a high level of abstraction: did the judge's instructions deflect the jury from its fundamental task of deciding whether the prosecution proved the elements of the charged offence beyond reasonable doubt? … Whether there has been on any other ground whatsoever a miscarriage of justice must always require consideration of the whole of the judge's charge to the jury. In every case, the ultimate question must be whether, taken as a whole, the judge's instructions to the jury deflected the jury from its proper task.""

Analysis


	
	Before turning to the terms of the warning and the effect of the ""clarification"" it is appropriate to consider whether there was any need for a warning at all.
	
	
	Prior to the discharge from the trial of Bernard Spicer there was clearly evidence that was damaging to his case that had been given by the appellant in respect of which the Crown Prosecutor had indicated the Crown might or would rely. If he had remained in the trial it could well have been necessary for the judge to say something in fairness to Mr Spicer about the reliability of the appellant's evidence. As to the care with which this issue would have to have been approached, see R v Henning (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), Gleeson CJ, Campbell and Mathews JJ, 11 May 1990, unrep) and Webb v The Queen; Hay v The Queen [1994] HCA 30; 181 CLR 41.
	
	
	Bernard Spicer had departed the trial before the evidence had concluded. The Crown did not rely upon any of the evidence of the appellant in the case concerning the remaining co-accused, Bradley Rawlinson. Counsel for Mr Rawlinson cross-examined the appellant but only to obtain her agreement that she had never met him before the death of Ms Foreman, let alone spoken to him or seen him in the company of Mr Spicer or his sister or Ms Evans. In these circumstances, the appellant's evidence should have been the subject of assessment by the jury in the ordinary way.
	
	
	Given the warning about the possible unreliability of the appellant's evidence was not called for, the question is whether it had the capacity to deflect the jury from its task of deciding whether the Crown had proved the essential elements of the charge against her beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the attempted clarification by the judge did not remove the damaging aspects of the earlier warning from the jury's consideration.
	
	
	The appellant's evidence represented the essence of her defence to the incriminating aspects of the Crown case. Her credibility was seriously questioned in cross-examination by the prosecutor. The effect of the warning was that the jury were given a variety of reasons why her evidence might be unreliable over and above what the jury might have considered when assessing her evidence on its merits. These further reasons were extraneous and irrelevant because this was not a ""case in which the Crown relies upon the evidence of a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceedings before the Court"". Rather than relying upon it, the Crown vigorously disputed the appellant’s evidence.
	
	
	The proviso in s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act should not be applied for the reasons given by Basten JA at [2]. Accordingly, ground 1 should be upheld.
	


Ground 2 – error in not directing as to the element of ""participation"" in a joint criminal enterprise


	
	The success of the appellant under the previous ground would result in an order for retrial and the same would be the result if she succeeded under this ground. I am not persuaded that this ground has merit and, in the circumstances, will deal with it only briefly.
	
	
	In what follows I propose to confine my reference to a joint criminal enterprise but it should be taken that I am also referring to an extended joint criminal enterprise which was the alternative way the Crown case was left.
	
	
	The judge directed the jury on the concepts of joint criminal enterprise in textbook terms in conformity with the authorities and modelled on the suggested directions in the Criminal Trials Bench Book published by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales. The directions were settled with the input of counsel. The appellant's counsel raised no objection nor sought any redirection.
	
	
	In this Court, Ms Loukas sought to draw a distinction between a joint criminal enterprise where the accused was present at the scene of the crime and one where the accused, as in this case, was not. She referred to Huynh v The Queen; Duong v The Queen; Sem v The Queen [2013] HCA 6; 87 ALJR 434 where it was held that the participation by a party to a joint criminal enterprise may be established by no more than their presence at the scene of the crime. The submission was that where a party to such an enterprise was not present, then the Crown was required to prove not only that the person was a party but also that the person performed some act in furtherance of the enterprise.
	
	
	The merits of the point are dubious but it is unnecessary to dwell upon them. The simple answer is that in this case what was capable of proving that the appellant was a party to the enterprise also proved that she participated in it – for example, her instruction to Mr Spicer: ""all you do is, you go in there, you mess her up a bit … just bash her a bit … put her in hospital to the point her face can't be fixed"".
	
	
	Before departing, I observe that the appellant's role would more accurately be described as being an accessory before the fact than a participant in a joint criminal enterprise. However, for practical purposes these are different legal descriptions of criminal complicity that would not make any difference to the necessary matters the Crown was required to prove in order to establish the appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	I also take the opportunity to observe that the avoidance of technical legal arguments on appeal that have little or no regard to the factual issues a jury was called upon to decide would be fostered if directions in a summing up were posed, wherever possible, in terms of factual questions for the jury to decide. It is an understatement to say that there would also be the benefit of jurors being more readily able to understand the directions.
	
	
	The language that is often used in directing a jury on complex legal issues such as whether an accused was criminally complicit in an offence that was the product of a joint criminal enterprise, adapted from technical concepts discussed in appellate cases, might be well understood by experienced criminal lawyers and judges but it does not necessarily lend itself to ease of comprehension by lay jurors. The challenge for judges is to provide the jury with only so much of the law as is necessary in order to guide the jury to a decision on the real issue(s) in the case: Alford v Magee [1952] HCA 3; 85 CLR 437 at 466. In the present case, the real issues for determination in relation to the appellant were:
	


whether she had prior knowledge of a plan to cause the deceased really serious harm (alternatively to cause some harm with foresight of the possible infliction of really serious harm) and,

if so, whether she assisted, encouraged or facilitated the execution of that plan.


	
	In very recent times, New South Wales judges have had the benefit of seminars presented by New Zealand judges on a more enlightened approach taken in that jurisdiction to the distillation of the real issues falling for jury determination. It is a matter that requires serious reconsideration of the approach taken here.
	
	
	Leave pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules should be refused in respect of this ground.
	


Ground 3 – the verdict is unreasonable or not supported by the evidence


	
	Ms Proud requires leave to raise this ground as it does not involve a question of law alone (s 5(1) Criminal Appeal Act). For convenience, however, I will continue to refer to her as ""the appellant"".
	
	
	The principles concerning the determination of a ground of appeal that a verdict of guilty is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, are well known and there is no need to recite them again in this judgment. In short, the question is whether, upon independently assessing the evidence, this Court is of the view that it was open to the jury (in the sense explained by the High Court) to conclude beyond reasonable that the appellant was guilty: M v R ]1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493; Jones v R [1997] HCA 56; 191 CLR 439; MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606; Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 and SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400.
	
	
	There is no need to survey the evidence in the trial in any further detail than I have already. Whatever might be made of the other incriminating evidence the prosecution relied upon, the most telling evidence was the covertly recorded conversation between the appellant and Ms Gallagher on 15 December 2011: see above at [19]. If the jury accepted that the appellant did in fact instruct Mr Spicer as to what he should do – that is, intentionally inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased, then, given that is what in fact occurred (at least), the jury were required to return a verdict of guilty of murder. Was it open to the jury to accept that this is what the appellant was conveying to Ms Gallagher?
	
	
	I have earlier set out the appellant's attempt to explain what she said to Ms Gallagher as ""a manner of speech"". It is an explanation that is distinctly lacking in credibility. Moreover, the appellant's credibility was seriously damaged by the overwhelming body of uncontested evidence that she had devoted considerable effort to the concoction of false accounts to give to police during the course of their investigation. In addition, there was the appellant's police interview of 21 December 2011 in which she maintained a false version, only to be forced to concede the falsity of some of its elements after she was confronted with some of her recorded conversations.
	
	
	In my view, there was nothing unreasonable about the appellant's conviction. It was well open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of her encouragement and facilitation of the plan to have the deceased hospitalised and seriously disfigured.
	
	
	This ground must be rejected.
	


Ground 4 – error in directions on extended joint criminal enterprise and the requisite mental state


	
	Senior counsel for the appellant acknowledged that this ground was put forward to protect her client’s position should the High Court reconsider established authority that is binding on this Court such as McAuliffe v The Queen [1995] HCA 37; 183 CLR 108 in the light of the recent joint decision of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the Privy Council in R v Jogee; Ruddock v The Queen [2016] UKSC 8; [2016] UKPC 7.
	
	
	As accepted by the appellant, this ground must be rejected. (Proud v R [2016] NSWCCA 41).
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1   Appeal against conviction upheld.

2   The appellant’s conviction and sentence for the murder of Katherine Foreman are quashed.

3   Pursuant to s 8 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 there be a new trial.

		10 October 2017",2016-03-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2701882,R v Finley [2016] NSWSC 327,"Judgment


	
	Earlier today I discharged the entire jury that had been empanelled in this trial. These are my reasons for doing so.
	
	
	Before the arraignment of the accused on the charge of murder (and in the alternative manslaughter and dangerous driving causing death), I was informed that the jury panel available today consisted of only 22 citizens. I was further informed that four of them were seeking to be excused. I raised those facts with counsel, along with the fact that, due to a number of logistical problems that do not need to be detailed, there were no other panels available later in the sittings. Having taken time to reflect and obtain instructions, each counsel was content to at least try to empanel a jury.
	
	
	In the event, sixteen members of the jury panel were available to be empanelled after a number of them were excused by me. The parties saw no need to exercise their full number of challenges, and a jury of twelve was empanelled before morning tea.
	
	
	Before that process occurred, the Crown prosecutor had, in accordance with my usual invitation, read out in the presence of the panel a précis of the Crown case, along with a list of Crown witnesses and of persons who would be mentioned in the evidence. A number of panel members applied to be excused on the basis of their connections with the persons involved in the trial, and at least one of those applications was granted by me.
	
	
	During morning tea, I received a note from a juror to the effect that she knew, or knew of, four persons involved in the trial. They included the deceased and his mother. Upon resumption, and in the absence of the jury, I provided the parties with copies of that note and read aloud the majority of its contents in open court (some details were omitted in order to protect the privacy of the juror). That note was marked Jury Note 1 and remains on the court file.
	
	
	Thereafter, with the concurrence of counsel, I examined the juror on oath. She gave evidence that she had formed an assessment (whether positive or negative) of at least the deceased and his mother. Although I did not explicitly ask her to detail whether those assessments were in fact either positive or negative, she gave evidence that her assessment of the deceased (who was two years below her at high school) was a positive one.
	
	
	Furthermore, she gave evidence that, in the short period that passed between the commencement of morning tea and its end, she had provided her assessments of persons involved in the trial to other members of the jury.
	
	
	By way of background to the trial itself, the Crown case statement is before me as Voir Dire Exhibit A. It shows that the Crown case is that there was an ill-tempered interaction between the accused and the deceased that culminated in a collision between a motor vehicle driven by the accused and the person of the deceased. Some days later, the deceased died as a result of the injuries inflicted by that collision. The Crown case is that the accused drove the car deliberately at the deceased with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him. The defence case as foreshadowed to me is that the accused did not have that intention; in any event, whatever he did on the evening in question was done in self-defence.
	
	
	The accused engaged in at least one recorded interview with police. The deceased also gave a version of what occurred before he died, and I understand that there is no dispute that it is admissible pursuant to s 65 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	
	
	In other words, there will need to be an assessment by the jury of what actually occurred in the moments before the collision. More generally, there will need to be an ascribing of responsibility for what happened, in the sense of who was the aggressor against whom. Furthermore, there will need to be some assessment of the credibility of the versions of events given by the accused and the deceased.
	
	
	In those circumstances, the parties jointly submitted that the individual juror should be discharged. In accordance with what was said in Wu v R [1999] HCA 52; (1999) 199 CLR 99, the parties accepted that the question of whether the remaining eleven jurors should be discharged is an entirely separate one. I understood their joint position to be that, if it had not been the case that the juror had passed on her positive assessment of (at least) the character of the deceased, they would have been content for the trial to continue with eleven jurors. But in light of the sworn evidence that she had indeed done so, combined with the gravity of the primary count against the accused, and the particular circumstances of this case, there was no alternative to discharging the remainder of the jury and commencing the trial again as soon as reasonably practicable. They eschewed the possibility that a direction to the remaining jurors that they should focus only upon the evidence presented in court would be a sufficient remedy.
	
	
	I accepted the joint position of the parties.
	
	
	As for the initial question of whether the individual juror should be discharged, I agree that, in the circumstances, despite her confidence that she could serve as a fair and impartial juror, nevertheless she should be excused from further service. I came to that view based upon the gravity of the charge; the fact that she had had some contact not only with the deceased but also with his mother; the fact that she had made a positive assessment of at least one of them; and the fact that the trial will involve a process of assessing the credibility of two men and, to some degree, ascribing responsibility for what occurred between the two of them. In those circumstances, I felt it appropriate to exercise my discretion pursuant to s 53B of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) to discharge the individual juror.
	
	
	As for the second, separate question as to whether the entirety of the jury should be discharged, I took the view that, if it had not been the case that the juror had passed on her assessments to the other members of the jury, there would be no need for that to occur. But in light of the clear evidence that that had occurred (even, regrettably, in the time that it takes to have morning tea), combined with all of the other facets of the trial to which I have referred, I came to the view that the entirety of the jury should be discharged as well, pursuant to s 53C of the Jury Act, because to continue would give rise to a risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. And I took that view even though, at least at that stage, I believed that logistical difficulties stood in the way of recommencing the trial in a timely manner.
	
	
	It is for those reasons that earlier today I ordered:
	



	
	An individual juror is discharged.
	
	
	The remainder of the jury is discharged.

		15 April 2016",2016-03-21 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701886,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 34) [2016] NSWSC 259,"Judgment EX TEMPORE – REVISED

BACKGROUND


	
	On 15 March 2016, which was day 32 of the current trial, the Crown called Steven John Farley to give evidence.
	
	
	Mr Farley is, on his own account, a close acquaintance of the accused Rogerson, having known him for a period of 21 years. He described himself as being ""a good friend"" of Rogerson.
	
	
	From the perspective of the Crown case, the importance of Mr Farley's evidence is that on 25 May 2014 he was in the company of Rogerson in Queensland, at which time they had attended a promotional boxing event in Redcliffe. Shortly afterwards, there was a news broadcast in Queensland making reference to the fact that Rogerson was wanted in New South Wales in relation to a kidnapping.
	
	
	According to Mr Farley, Rogerson said to him at that time:
	


""I don't know anything about it"".


	
	That evidence was the subject of an objection by counsel for Rogerson, but I allowed the evidence for reasons set out in a previous judgment: R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No. 33) [2016] NSWSC 247.
	
	
	After the evidence-in-chief of Mr Farley was completed, he was cross-examined by Ms Shead who appears for McNamara, following which he was cross-examined by counsel for Rogerson, Mr Thomas. At T2102, Mr Thomas' cross-examination turned to the circumstances in which Mr Farley had come to know McNamara. Commencing at T2102 L24 Mr Thomas asked:
	


“Q. You knew Glen McNamara?

A. Yes.

Q. Correct?

A. Yes.

Q. How did you know Glen?

A. He was at the Cross the same time I was there.”


	
	Mr Thomas then asked (at T2102 L33):
	


“Q. Was he working as a detective or police officer at Kings Cross when you were there?""


	
	Mr Farley responded (at T2102 L35):
	


“He was a detective and drug dealer at Kings Cross.”


	
	Mr Thomas then asked:
	


“Q. He was in the what--”


	
	In light of the previous answer which had been given by Mr Farley I intervened at that point, stopped the question from being asked and directed the members of the jury to leave the court. I intervened because it seemed to me at the time that the introductory words of the question being put by Mr Thomas may have resulted in Mr Farley seeking to expand upon what he had said in the previous answer. In making that observation, and in taking the course that I did, I do not intend any criticism at all of Mr Thomas.
	
	
	I pause to observe at this stage that on any view, the reference made by Mr Farley to McNamara being a “drug dealer” was a gratuitous and non-responsive comment made by a person who, on his own admission, is a close friend of the co-accused Rogerson. The answer gave the appearance of being somewhat calculated, although that is not an issue which I am required to determine for present purposes.
	
	
	After the jury left the court, I gave counsel for each of the accused, and the Crown, the opportunity to consider their respective positions.
	
	
	Ms Shead subsequently informed me that she had instructions to make an application that the jury be discharged. In doing so, and in view of the time of day, she asked that she be given until today to prepare submissions in support of that application.
	
	
	Mr Thomas submitted that the answer given by Mr Farley at least raised a suspicion that it was in some way calculated to benefit Rogerson, and had therefore been instigated by him. That indicated to me that Mr Thomas was joining in an application that the jury be discharged. That position was confirmed before me this morning.
	
	
	The Crown's initial position (set out at T2105 L9) was that Ms Shead's application to discharge the jury was ""justified, in that the answer given (was) relevant to the direct issue before the court"". The Crown's position fell short of amounting to a concession that Ms Shead’s application should succeed and I made it clear at the time that even if such a concession was made by the Crown, I would not be bound by it. In any event, when the proceedings resumed this morning the Crown made it clear, for reasons to which I will come, that any application to discharge the jury was opposed.
	
	
	In opposing such application, the Crown indicated that he wished to call evidence from Detective Phillips and Mr Farley in the absence of the jury. The Crown explained that he would seek to lead evidence from Detective Phillips that during the 1980s inquiries and investigations had been undertaken in relation to an allegation that McNamara was a dealer in drugs, and that no evidence was forthcoming to support such an allegation. The Crown submitted that if I were ultimately minded to refuse the present application, the evidence of Detective Phillips would be available to “reinforce” any direction I might give to the jury to ignore what Mr Farley had said. The Crown then explained that the purpose in seeking to call Mr Farley in the absence of the jury was to ascertain the basis on which he asserted that McNamara was a “drug dealer”. The Crown submitted that if it transpired that Mr Farley’s assertion was based upon hearsay, that evidence would also be available to reinforce any direction given to the jury.
	
	
	When the Crown raised these issues, I expressed some reservation as to the relevance of the evidence he sought to lead. Ms Shead objected to the evidence but accepted that there would be no prejudice to McNamara’s position if it were initially given in the absence of the jury so as to allow me to evaluate it. Mr Thomas did not object to the course foreshadowed by the Crown. Accordingly, Detective Phillips and Mr Farley were called.
	
	
	The evidence given by Detective Phillips was to the effect of that outlined in [16] above. The evidence of Mr Farley was that he had no personal knowledge, and had made no relevant observation, which supported his assertion before the jury that McNamara was a drug dealer. It is evident from what Mr Farley said that his assertion was based on second, third or perhaps even fourth-hand hearsay statements made to him by other people, some of whom he asserted were members (or then members) of the NSW Police Force.
	
	
	However in my view, the evidence of Detective Phillips and Mr Farley given before me this morning is irrelevant to the determination I am required to make. As I pointed out to the Crown at the time, what is before me is an application by counsel for each accused that the jury be discharged. Each application is made based upon a single event, namely the utterance of Mr Farley when giving evidence yesterday in the terms to which I have referred. Apart from a lack of relevance, the course proposed by the Crown of using such evidence to reinforce any direction I might determine is appropriate would have the potential to unnecessarily overcomplicate what is, in my view, a relatively straightforward issue. For those reasons, I have not taken into account the evidence given on the voir dire by Detective Phillips or Mr Farley in determining the matter.
	


SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES


	
	I turn to the submissions of the parties.
	
	
	The Crown, as I have already indicated, initially took the position that Ms Shead’s application to the discharge the jury was “justified”. However when the proceedings resumed this morning the Crown opposed both Ms Shead’s application as well as that of Mr Thomas.
	
	
	In terms of the application made by Mr Thomas, the Crown submitted that there was no basis whatsoever upon which such application should succeed. It was submitted, in particular, that there was no prejudice to Rogerson arising from anything that Mr Farley had said. I pointed out that I anticipated that Mr Thomas would submit that there was a possibility that the jury could infer that Mr Farley’s statement was made at the behest of Rogerson. The Crown submitted that for that to be so, there would necessarily need to be some evidence supporting such an inference. The Crown submitted that there was simply no such evidence.
	
	
	As to the position of Ms Shead (advance notice of which the Crown had by virtue of written submissions helpfully provided by Ms Shead before today's proceedings commenced) the Crown submitted that it was possible to formulate a careful direction to the jury to ignore what had been said. The Crown submitted that the essential components of any such direction would include a direction that what Mr Farley had said was to play no part in the jury’s consideration of the issues in this case, and was to be disregarded. It was submitted that a direction in such terms would be sufficient to address any prejudice which might have arisen.
	
	
	The Crown highlighted the fact that it has been evident from day one of this trial that each accused is engaging in what is commonly referred to as a ""cut throat"" defence. The Crown submitted that in these circumstances, the utterance of Mr Farley did not (to use the Crown’s words) ""amount to a thunderclap out of the heavens"". That, as I understood it, was another way of submitting that in trials such as this, utterances of the kind made by Mr Farley, although obviously not welcome, are not unheard of.
	
	
	The Crown also took issue with Ms Shead's submission that because of the circumstances in which the matter had arisen, Mr Farley's evidence would be ""vividly etched"" on the minds of each of the members of the jury. The Crown submitted that as the trial judge, I was in a good position to assess the likely impact of what Mr Farley had said. The Crown pointed out that what had been said occurred at the end of the day, had been non-responsive to the question which had been put, and was properly categorised as a ""throwaway line made by a friend of Roger Rogerson"". The Crown submitted that in the atmosphere of the trial, and although the jury would obviously have heard what was said, I should not accept the proposition that it was “vividly etched” on their minds. The Crown submitted that the matter had not escalated to such a level that the jury would not be able to properly consider the evidence in the trial. It was submitted that the jury could and would accept a direction that the utterance of Mr Farley was to be disregarded.
	
	
	Finally, the Crown pointed out that the trial is now in its seventh week. He submitted that if the jury were to be discharged on the basis of what had occurred in the course of Mr Farley’s evidence, the administration of justice would “amount to a complete waste of time”. He submitted that the jury system was intended to be robust, and that this was an example of a situation where, with an appropriate direction, such system should be allowed to operate as was intended. It was submitted that, in all of the circumstances, the jury necessarily retained the capability of accepting and acting upon a direction from me, as the trial judge, that the statement of Mr Farley was to be ignored.
	
	
	As I have indicated, Ms Shead provided written submissions in advance of the proceedings this morning, which I have had the opportunity of reading. In those submissions, Ms Shead articulated the relevant principles and sought to apply them to the circumstances of this case. As I have already indicated, her submissions highlighted the proposition that in all of the circumstances, the evidence of Mr Farley would be vividly etched on the minds of the members of the jury.
	
	
	In supplementing her written submissions, Ms Shead argued that the statement made by Mr Farley ""had to be met"". That proposition formed the basis of a fundamental submission by Ms Shead that there was no direction which I was able to give which would be capable of ameliorating the prejudice which had flowed to McNamara as a consequence of what had been said. Ms Shead submitted that any direction which might be given would do nothing more than highlight the evidence, and serve to reinforce the prejudice which she submitted had already arisen.
	
	
	As I observed at the time, the proposition that the utterance of Mr Farley had to be ""met"" necessarily overlooks the terms of any direction which it might be thought appropriate to give to the jury. If I were to come to the view that a direction was appropriate, the essence of that direction would necessarily be that the jury would be told to ignore the evidence. If that direction were given, and accepting that the direction would be acted upon, there would be nothing to ""meet"" in the sense that Ms Shead argued.
	
	
	Ms Shead also placed significance upon the context in which the evidence had been given. She pointed out that only the day before, evidence was given by one of the investigating police in relation to bags of drugs found in a car connected to McNamara and which, at one point at least, was parked in his residence.
	
	
	Ms Shead also made reference to the fact that one of the charges against McNamara is a charge of supplying a prohibited drug. It was submitted that this was of some significance in light of what Mr Farley had said.
	
	
	Ms Shead further submitted that in all of the circumstances the assertion made by Mr Farley deprived McNamara's case of good character of its probative force. She submitted that it would be impossible for any member of the jury to disregard what had been said, given a number of factors. These factors included what she described as the ""concrete terms"" in which the assertion had been made, the nature of the allegations against McNamara, the coincidence of the supply charge against him, the relationship between that supply charge and the charge of murder, and the nature of his defence. In this context, Ms Shead reminded me of the terms in which the Crown will put its case to the jury and, in particular, the terms in which the Crown will seek to draw a connection between the two charges.
	
	
	Finally, Ms Shead submitted that there were necessarily cases where the prejudice to an accused arising from something said by a witness was so great as to be incapable of being ameliorated by a direction. The essence of her submission was that the present was one such case, and that the jury should be discharged.
	
	
	Mr Thomas explained that the basis on which he sought that the jury be discharged necessarily differed from that put by Ms Shead. Mr Thomas emphasised that there was evidence that Mr Farley and Rogerson had been close friends for a number of years and that there was, in these circumstances, a strong inference available to the jury that Rogerson had exerted some degree of pressure or force upon Mr Farley to say what had been said. In this regard Mr Thomas drew my attention, in particular, to McNamara's reliance upon a defence of duress in this trial. He pointed out that there would necessarily be evidence given by McNamara of threats and “influence” allegedly exerted upon him by Rogerson.
	
	
	Mr Thomas submitted that in all of these circumstances, the jury may well be left with the impression that Rogerson had the capacity to influence Mr Farley, and more particularly influence any evidence that he might give.
	
	
	Mr Thomas submitted that such circumstances combined to create the important context in which his application was to be considered. He submitted that the jury may think that Mr Farley's statement amounted to another example of the ""power"" of Rogerson, about which McNamara will give evidence in his case.
	
	
	Like Ms Shead, Mr Thomas submitted that what had been said by Mr Farley had been said with ""great determination"". He too submitted that no direction could ameliorate the prejudice which had arisen.
	


CONSIDERATION


	
	Incidents of the present kind are not uncommon in criminal trials. They are, to say the least, regrettable. It would obviously have been be preferable if Mr Farley had not said what he said. However, it does not automatically follow from the fact of an utterance such as this that the jury must be discharged. Whether the jury should be discharged is a discretionary decision for me as the trial judge. That discretion falls to be exercised according to the application a number of well-established principles.
	
	
	In Crofts v The Queen [1996] HCA 22; (1996) 186 CLR 427, Dawson J expressed the relevant principle is this way (at 427):
	


“Whether or not a jury should be discharged by reason of some incident which occurs during the course of a trial is a matter within the trial judge's discretion. But it is a discretion which is to be exercised in favour of a discharge only when that course is necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice. It is in that sense that it has been said that the underlying principle is that of necessity and that a ‘high degree of need for such discharge’ must appear before a discharge will be ordered.”


	
	In making these observations his Honour made reference to an earlier decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in R v Boland (1974) VR 849. In that case Adam J, with whom Little and McInerney JJ agreed, observed (at 166) that in order to discharge a jury there must be evident a high degree of need. In doing so his Honour made reference to similar observations of Erle CJ in Winsor v R (1866) LR 1 QB 390 at 394.
	
	
	In Crofts the plurality (Toohey, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ) also made the following relevant observations (at 440):
	


“No rigid rule can be adopted to govern decisions on an application to discharge a jury for an inadvertent and potentially prejudicial event that occurs during a trial. The possibilities of slips occurring are inescapable. Much depends upon the seriousness of the occurrence in the context of the contested issues, the stage at which the mishap occurs, the deliberateness of the conduct and the likely effectiveness of a judicial direction designed to overcome its apprehended impact. As the Court below acknowledged, much leeway must be allowed to the trial judge to evaluate these and other considerations relevant to the fairness of the trial, bearing in mind that the judge will usually have a better appreciation of the significance of the event complained of, seen in context, than can be discerned from reading the transcript.”


	
	These general principles have been applied by the Court of Criminal Appeal in this State on numerous occasions. In R v Ahola (No 6) [2013] NSWSC 703, Button J undertook a review of some of those authorities. They included R v Bartle [2003] NSWCCA 329 and An v R [2007] NSWCCA 43. More recently, the Court of Criminal Appeal applied such principles in Mikael v R [2015] NSWCCA 294.
	
	
	In Ahola, Button J observed at [17]:
	


“My review of some of the leading authorities shows that the High Court of Australia and the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales do not require or encourage trial judges to take an overly sensitive approach to the accidental receipt of prejudicial material. That review also shows that in many circumstances a direction is an appropriate remedy, not the discharge of the whole jury, although of course every case will turn upon its own facts.”


	
	His Honour went on to note (as I have already observed) that the decision to discharge the jury is necessarily a discretionary one.
	
	
	There is a further important principle which bears upon my determination of the current applications. Such principle, shortly stated, is that criminal trials necessarily proceed on the basis that a jury will follow, and apply, an instruction or direction given by the trial judge. In R v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592, Brennan J (as his Honour then was) expressed the principle in this way (at 614-15):
	


“Of necessity, the law must place much reliance on the integrity and sense of duty of the jurors. The experience of the courts is that the reliance is not misplaced.”


	
	In doing so his Honour made reference to the judgment of Street CJ in Munday v R (1984) 14 A Crim R 456 (at 457–8) where the Chief Justice observed:
	


“It is relevant to note the system of jury trials is geared to enable juries to be assisted in every possible way to put out of mind statements made outside the court, whether in the media or elsewhere. There is every reason to have confidence in the capacity of juries to do this. Judges do not have the monopoly on the ability to adjudicate fairly and impartially.”


	
	Although the observations of Street CJ were in a different context, they necessarily apply with equal force to the circumstances of this case, and to the determination of the present applications.
	
	
	In Glennon, Mason CJ and Toohey J also made the following pertinent observation (at 603):
	


“The possibility that a juror might acquire irrelevant and prejudicial information is inherent in a criminal trial. The law acknowledges the existence of that possibility but proceeds on the footing that the jury, acting in conformity with the instructions given to them by the trial judge, will render a true verdict in accordance with the evidence.”


	
	In a later case of Gilbert v R [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414, McHugh J explained the rationale behind the principle in this way (at [31]):
	


“The criminal trial on indictment proceeds on the assumption that jurors are true to their oath, that, in the quaint words of the ancient oath, they harken to the evidence and that they obey the trial judge's directions. On that assumption, which I regard as fundamental to the criminal jury trial, the common law countries have staked a great deal. If it was rejected or disregarded, no one - accused, trial judge or a member of the public - could have any confidence in any verdict of a criminal jury or in the criminal justice system whenever it involves a jury trial. If it was rejected or disregarded, the pursuit of justice through the jury system would be as much a charade as the show trial of any totalitarian state.

Put bluntly, unless we act on the assumption that criminal juries act on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge, there is no point in having criminal jury trials.”


	
	By reference to all of these principles, and for the reasons set out, I have come to the view that each application to discharge the jury should be refused.
	
	
	Firstly, the offending statement made by Mr Farley was effectively constituted by two words. It was isolated. The question put was not improper. More importantly, the question obviously made no reference to, and did not seek to elicit, the fact that McNamara was a “drug dealer”. As I have already pointed out, the words said by Mr Farley were gratuitous and non-responsive.
	
	
	Secondly, and stemming at least in part from the first consideration, it is relevant that this trial is now in its thirty-third day. I am informed that the Crown case is approaching closure. Over those thirty three days, almost fifty witnesses have been called to give evidence. The trial transcript extends to more than two thousand pages. The evidence which the jury will be asked to consider includes observations made during an extensive view of a number of areas relevant to the trial.
	
	
	I accept, of course, that these matters are not conclusive. As Button J pointed out in Ahola at [19]:
	


“Questions of convenience are not determinative and obviously, no matter what the time, trouble or expenses involved, a trial that has been prejudiced to the point of becoming unfair cannot continue whatever the inconvenience might be.”


	
	However that said, the factors to which I have referred in [51] and [52] tend generally against the applications being granted. Those matters serve to highlight the fact that Mr Farley’s isolated words were said in the context of a vast amount of evidence having been given, and in circumstances where I specifically intervened to prevent anything further from being said.
	
	
	Thirdly, although I am mindful of the fact that McNamara will raise good character in his case, I am not satisfied that Mr Farley's utterance places McNamara in a position where his case of good character will have no probative force at all. In that regard, I am particularly mindful of the principles to which I have referred which make it clear that a trial judge, and indeed all parties in a trial, should proceed in the confidence that a jury will accept, and act upon, such directions as are given to them. This is particularly the case in circumstances where the offending statement really amounted to the two words ""drug dealer"". That is not to say that those words do not assume any significance at all. But there is, in my view, no difficulty or complexity in giving a jury a direction that such evidence is to be ignored. There is some substance in the Crown’s submission to the effect that if a decision was made to discharge a jury in circumstances such as this, the jury system could never operate effectively, and in the manner in which it was intended to operate.
	
	
	In all of those circumstances, the applications will be refused. It is my intention, subject to hearing from counsel, to direct the jury in the broad terms to which I have referred in the course of giving these reasons. However, I will hear counsel on the terms of the direction which ought be given when we resume at 2:00pm.

2701899,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 33) [2016] NSWSC 247,"Judgment EX TEMPORE - REVISED


	
	The Crown proposes to call Steven John Farley to give evidence. Mr Farley is a hotelier who has been a close acquaintance of the accused Rogerson for some time.
	
	
	On 25 May 2014 Mr Farley was contacted by Rogerson. They made arrangements to travel to Redcliffe in Queensland to watch a boxing match. They did so, and socialised together afterwards.
	
	
	On the following morning a news broadcast reported that the NSW Police wished to speak with Rogerson in relation to the disappearance and death of the deceased Jamie Gao. In that regard, a statement made by Mr Farley records the following (at paragraph 7):
	


“The following morning I became aware that Roger spoke with New South Wales Police the previous night, and that the police wished to speak with him over his knowledge surrounding the disappearance of a young man the previous week. The matter was all over the news by this stage. Roger denied knowing anything about the missing man or having any involvement in his disappearance or kidnapping.”


	
	The Crown sought to press the final sentence of that paragraph as evidence of a lie told by the accused Rogerson. Ms Shead, who appears on behalf of the co-accused McNamara, supported the admission of the evidence. Mr Thomas, who appears on behalf of Rogerson, objected to it.
	
	
	Because of the oblique (and inadmissible) form in which the final sentence in paragraph 7 of Mr Farley's statement was phrased, the parties agreed that it was appropriate to hear evidence from Mr Farley on the voir dire in relation to that aspect of his evidence.
	
	
	On the voir dire Mr Farley was asked whether or not he had any conversation with Rogerson about the NSW Police having been in contact with him. Mr Farley said that Rogerson had said that the police had contacted him, following which he said (commencing at T2088 L3):
	


Q. Did he tell you what they wanted to speak to him about?

A. Well, it was on the news, we are listening to it on the news

Q. What was on the news?

A. Roger Rogerson was wanted in connection with a kidnapping.

Q. Did he say anything about that to you?

A. He said he didn't know anything about it.

Q. What were his words?

A. 'I don't know anything about it.'


	
	The last statement attributed to Rogerson by Mr Farley in that passage of the evidence, namely the words ""I don't know anything about it"", constitutes the denial to which Mr Farley referred in paragraph 7 of his statement which the Crown seeks to lead. The Crown submitted that the evidence was admissible on the basis that it constituted a lie. The Crown's primary position appeared to be that the statement was a lie which constituted evidence of a consciousness of guilt on the part of Rogerson. However, I understood the Crown to make an alternative submission that the statement was evidence of a lie going to Rogerson’s credit. The Crown submitted that on either basis the evidence was admissible and there was no danger of unfair prejudice justifying its exclusion pursuant to s. 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”).
	
	
	Ms Shead submitted that the evidence was admissible, either as an admission made by Rogerson or alternatively as a statement about which he could be cross-examined as to his credit. Ms Shead submitted that on either basis the evidence was properly admissible, and she supported the Crown’s submission that there was no unfair prejudice which would justify its exclusion.
	
	
	Mr Thomas accepted that the evidence was relevant but pressed for the exclusion of the evidence under s. 137 of the Act. He submitted that the context in which the statement was made was vague, and that its admission would invite the jury to speculate about the terms of what was said.
	
	
	Section 137 of the Act mandates a refusal to admit evidence adduced by the Crown if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. Whilst I have some doubt about whether Rogerson’s statement is a lie capable of amounting to evidence of a consciousness of guilt, that is not an issue that I am required to determine at the present time. In my view, at the very least, the evidence is capable of going to the issue of Rogerson's credit.
	
	
	In seeking exclusion of evidence under s. 137 of the Act, an accused bears the onus of satisfying the court that danger of unfair prejudice from the evidence outweighs its probative value. The section is directed, not to evidence which is simply prejudicial, but to evidence which is unfairly so.
	
	
	In my view, the probative value of the evidence is substantial and its admission would not give rise to the danger of any unfair prejudice to Rogerson. I do not accept the submission advanced by Mr Thomas that the context in which the statement was made is in any way vague. Mr Farley's evidence on the voir dire tends positively against that submission. The statement attributed by Rogerson was, on Mr Farley’s evidence, clear and unequivocal in its terms. It is capable of supporting a conclusion that as at 26 May 2014, Rogerson was denying any involvement in the disappearance of the deceased. That is significant in the light of the evidence adduced by the Crown in its case thus far, particularly exhibit Q. It would be open to the jury to conclude on the basis of such evidence that Rogerson’s denial of involvement in the deceased’s disappearance was false.
	
	
	I am also not persuaded that if the evidence is admitted it will be open to any misuse by the jury, or will give rise to the possibility of the jury engaging in any speculation. The evidence, as I have said, is in clear and unequivocal terms. For all of those reasons I am not persuaded that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to Rogerson. Accordingly, I propose to admit it.
	
	
	I should also add that if the conclusion is ultimately reached that the statement constitutes a lie going to Rogerson’s credit, the jury will be directed in accordance with the decision in Zoneff v The Queen [2002] HCA 28; (2002) 200 CLR 234. Such a direction will make clear how the evidence is to be treated and will serve to eliminate the possibility of its misuse by the jury.

		15 June 2016",2016-03-14 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701902,Lazarus v Director of Public Prosecutions NSW [2016] NSWCA 47,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: The applicant, Michelle Lazarus, seeks leave to appeal from a judgment of Garling J in the Common Law Division dismissing with costs Ms Lazarus’ amended summons dated 23 March 2015.
	
	
	The amended summons was brought in the Court’s supervisory jurisdiction under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), seeking judicial review of a judgment of Magistrate Barnes finding her guilty of 7 counts of giving false or misleading evidence, contrary to s 87 of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988 (NSW) (“the ICAC Act”). The offences related to evidence given at a compulsory examination before the ICAC on 12 July 2010 and at a public hearing on 21 February 2011.
	
	
	Ms Lazarus was represented by counsel during the Local Court hearing. She appeared without legal representation before Garling J and when she instituted the present application. She has been represented today by counsel and a solicitor.
	


Local Court decision


	
	In the Local Court Ms Lazarus objected that the commencement of the prosecutions was invalid because the court attendance notices (CANs) by which the proceedings were commenced had been issued by an officer of the ICAC. The magistrate (Barnes LCM) rejected the objection.
	
	
	Ms Lazarus was convicted and sentenced to 4 months’ imprisonment on count 1 and five months imprisonment on counts 2 to 7 to be served concurrently, but consecutively following the term for count 1. Both terms of imprisonment were suspended (under s 12 of Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)) on condition that Ms Lazarus enter into a good behaviour bond.
	
	
	She filed an appeal in the District Court pursuant to s 11 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW). The appeal has not yet been heard. The hearing of that appeal was initially listed for 23 February 2015, but was then adjourned until 16 November 2015. That hearing date was subsequently vacated and the matter stood over for mention before Zahra DCJ on 18 January 2016. The matter is still pending in the District Court.
	


Authority of informant to commence prosecution


	
	There were numerous grounds of review set out in Ms Lazarus' amended summons and the submissions in support; these were dealt with by the primary judge in four categories, of which it is only necessary to mention one – which addressed grounds 1 and 2 of the review grounds. These were directed to the legality of the prosecution for an offence against s 87(1) of the ICAC Act.
	
	
	Garling J also referred, after dismissing the grounds of challenge, to discretionary considerations. He said that even had he been persuaded that there was a ground, or grounds, sufficient to enliven the discretion of the court to grant relief by way of an order in the nature of certiorari, he would not have granted relief. This was on the basis that there was a full right of appeal from a decision of the Local Court to the District Court; that right of appeal had been engaged by an appeal lodged by the applicant; and that appeal provided an equally effective and convenient remedy for the matters she sought to raise before him.
	


Proposed appeal grounds


	
	In dealing with the grounds which are presently relevant, the judge noted that the applicant had two arguments, set out at [48]-[92]. The first was that s 87 of the ICAC Act did not create an offence at law. That ground was abandoned in submissions which were received by the Court this morning. Her second point was that the CANs had not been validly issued by the officer of the ICAC who had in fact issued them. This is one of two points which are now pursued on the appeal.
	
	
	In respect of the procedural point, and dealing with authority of an informant to issue a CAN, the primary judge set out the background to the proceedings at [64]-[75]. He accepted that the Director of Public Prosecutions had taken over the prosecution, as he was entitled to do, and held it was therefore a valid prosecution: at [76]-[78]. However, the applicant had contended that if the prosecution were not validly commenced, the action of the Director would not validate it. It is not necessary to determine whether that is so, if in fact the prosecution was validly commenced. The primary judge went on to explain why the prosecution had been validly commenced by an officer employed by the ICAC: at [80]-[85].
	
	
	Although there was no plausible error in his reasoning identified in the documents filed by the applicant when acting for herself, counsel appearing for her at the hearing of the application has filed further written submissions which were expanded upon in the course of oral argument. With respect to the point raised before Garling J, counsel submitted that the source of the power of an informant to issue a CAN could not derive from the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) and the regulation under it, but, pursuant to s 14 of that Act, was required to be found in the ICAC Act. He challenged the finding of the primary judge that “the ICAC Act is entirely silent on that question.” Section 14 is in the following terms:
	


14   Common informer

A prosecution or proceeding in respect of any offence under an Act may be instituted by any person unless the right to institute the prosecution or proceeding is expressly conferred by that Act on a specified person or class of persons.


	
	The ICAC Act was indeed silent on the question identified in s 14 of the Criminal Procedure Act; it did not restrict the right to commence a prosecution by expressly conferring the power on a specified person or class of persons. At least it did not do so at the date when these proceedings were commenced. The applicant placed reliance on the functions conferred on the ICAC by s 53 of the ICAC Act. However that reliance was misconceived. That section deals with the matter being investigated, not an incidental prosecution, as in the present case, for an offence against Pt 9 of the ICAC Act. Similarly, reliance on provisions in the ICAC Act limiting the power of the Commission to refer a matter to another body and make recommendations that a person should be prosecuted for a criminal offence (ss 13(4) and 70(4B) were referred to) were also directed to the investigatory function of the Commission and did not deal with offences under Pt 9.
	
	
	For the same reason, the applicant’s reliance on Balog v Independent Commission Against Corruption (1990) 169 CLR 625 was beside the point. It may be noted that the legislative regime which operated when Balog was decided has long ago been significantly amended.
	


Challenge to validity of investigation


	
	Because no error has been identified in the reasoning of the primary judge, it is not necessary to consider whether, as a matter of discretion, leave to appeal should be granted. It is however necessary to deal with a fresh matter raised by counsel today for the first time. That matter involved a challenge to the validity of the investigation by the Commission which gave rise to the charges of which the applicant was convicted, not for offences revealed by the investigation but as a result of her conduct in the course of the investigation.
	
	
	The invitation to address this matter for the first time on appeal should be declined. There are a number of questions which would arise if that matter were to be addressed. First, there would be a question as to whether what has been determined to be a limitation on the powers of the Commission in Independent Commission Against Corruption v Cunneen [2015] HCA 14; 89 ALJR 475 would affect the validity of the charges laid for giving false or misleading evidence to the Commission.
	
	
	Secondly, there would be a need to investigate the effect of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Amendment (Validation) Act 2015 (NSW). There would, as counsel for the applicant expressly noted, be a question as to the proper construction of Sch 4, Pt 14 of the current Act, where the transitional provisions are now to be found. There might also be an issue as to the application of the principles identified in Lodhi v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 121; 199 FLR 303 as to the retrospectivity of such legislation in respect of criminal offences.
	
	
	For these reasons it would be entirely inappropriate for this Court to grant leave to the applicant to raise such matters for the first time at this stage of the proceedings.
	


Discretion to refuse relief


	
	Although the application must be refused, it is appropriate to note that there was a lively discretionary issue before the primary judge, had he been of the view that error had been committed. The applicant not only had a right of appeal to the District Court, but had exercised that right.
	
	
	There is a potential abuse of process in pursuing both an appeal to the District Court and a challenge to the decision of the Local Court in the Supreme Court simultaneously. According to conventional reasoning, as identified in Wishart v Fraser (1941) 64 CLR 470, a decision of the District Court on appeal would supersede the orders of the Local Court. The factual issues should have been determined before the legal challenges were raised in the supervisory jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, which is not to say that the legal challenges could not have been raised in the District Court. Although there is no appeal from the District Court, the applicant has a right of review in this Court of any judgment of that Court on appeal from the Local Court.
	
	
	It is well-established, as the primary judge noted, that the failure to seek or pursue an appeal to the District Court may result in relief being refused by the Supreme Court in the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction. It was at least open to the primary judge to consider the question of discretion as an initial matter and, if thought appropriate, to refuse to allow the matter to proceed to a hearing unless the applicant withdrew her appeal to the District Court. Indeed, the necessary extension of time to pursue these proceedings could properly have been refused on that basis. The result of the present proceedings is that, almost two years after her convictions in the Local Court, there are issues as to the correctness of those convictions which remain unresolved. Nor are these matters merely of history. The fact that the present application sought to raise a swathe of fresh issues, the answers to which will not be obvious without further and careful investigation, suggests the inappropriateness of the course which has been taken so far and the need to avoid continuing along the same course.
	
	
	However, it is not necessary to deal with the matter on that basis. The proper course is for this Court to refuse leave to appeal from the judgment of Garling J. The applicant should pay the respondent’s costs in this Court.
	
	
	WARD JA: I agree with Basten JA that the application for leave to appeal should be refused with costs for the reasons that his Honour has given.

2701922,New South Wales Crime Commission v Nye [2016] NSWSC 300,"Judgment


	
	By summons of 16 March 2016, which I grant leave to file, the New South Wales Crime Commission applied ex parte, seeking restraining orders under s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (‘the Act’) in relation to the interest of the defendant, Dylan Michael Nye, in a property located at Bella Vista identified in a schedule to the summons. Orders under ss 12(1) and 27 of the Act were also sought.
	
	
	For the reasons which follow, I am satisfied that the orders sought should be made.
	
	
	The application is supported by an affidavit sworn on 11 March 2016 by Jonathan Lee Spark, the Commission’s Director, Financial Investigations and an authorised officer under the Act, as well as by a statement of facts and circumstances provided in accordance with Rule 1.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW).
	
	
	Mr Spark deposed that he suspected that Mr Nye had engaged in serious crime related activities within the definition of “serious criminal offences” in s 6 of the Act, namely:
	


""supply prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) of an amount greater than the large commercial quantity of that drug contrary to section 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.""


	
	Mr Spark gave a detailed explanation of the basis upon which he came to hold this suspicion. His suspicions rested on a consideration of a Police Facts Sheet provided by Sergeant Clavel of the New South Wales Police Force; answers provided to questions he asked of the Sergeant as to the Facts Sheet; and information later provided as the result of searches conducted of the COPs database and the LPI database, which disclosed that the property is registered in the name of Mr Nye as joint with another identified person.
	
	
	The material disclosed that Mr Nye has been charged with possession and supply offences. He was arrested after a police search of his vehicle revealed more than a kilo of a crystalline substance hidden under the carpet. More of the substance was found on further search of the vehicle. It is alleged that the substance is methylamphetamine, with a total weight of over 2 kilograms and a street value of $2 million.
	
	
	Mr Spark deposed to his experience, that in the absence of a restraining order, it is possible for people to quickly enter into unregistered mortgages in respect of real estate, in order to attempt to defeat the operation of the Act. He also deposed as to his view that, given the serious nature of the criminal activity in which Mr Nye is apparently involved, notice of this application should not be given to him, a course available under the Act. Section 10A(4) permits a different course to be taken, if the Court thinks fit.
	
	
	Section 10A(5) requires the making of the orders sought under the Act, if the Court considers that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Mr Spark has deposed. The basis for such a suspicion was considered in International Finance Trust Co Ltd v New South Wales Crime Commission [2008] NSWCA 291; (2008) 189 A Crim R 559 at [23] per Allsop P. As explained by Davies J in NSW Crime Commission v Sarikaya [2010] NSWSC 692, while the High Court’s judgment in International Finance Trust Co Ltd v New South Wales Crime Commission [2009] HCA 49; (2009) 240 CLR 319 led to the amendment of the Act by the Criminal Assets Recovery Amendment Act 2009 (NSW), it did not affect the binding force of what the Court of Appeal had earlier said in relation to what is required to establish the suspicion with which s 10A deals.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the material relied on well establishes that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Mr Spark deposed in his affidavit and that the requirements of s 10A(5) of the Act have been addressed. In that situation the Act requires that the orders sought in relation to the property in question be made. In the circumstances, it is also appropriate to make the ancillary orders sought.
	
	
	I am also satisfied that the Commissioner ought not to be required to give notice of this application and that it should be dealt with ex parte. In coming to that view, I have had regard to the provisions of s 10C of the Act, which permit an affected person to apply to have a restraining order set aside.
	


Orders


	
	I accordingly make the orders in the terms sought and also direct that a copy of this judgment be served with the orders.

		21 March 2016",2016-03-15 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701927,State of New South Wales v Davis (Final) [2016] NSWSC 175,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: By its amended summons filed on 1 March 2016 the State of New South Wales seeks an extended supervision order under s 9(1)(a) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 for a period of five years and an order directing Mr Davis to comply with certain conditions contained in a Schedule to the summons pursuant to s 11 of the Act.
	
	
	Mr Davis does not dispute that he is a high risk sex offender under s 5B of the Act or that he poses an unacceptable risk of committing a sex offence if not kept under supervision. There is therefore no issue between the parties concerning whether or not I can make an extended supervision order. The only contested issues called up for consideration are whether the order should be made for a period of five years or some lesser period and whether some at least of the conditions contained in the Schedule should be made either at all or without modification. In the events that have occurred, this latter issue has also been resolved.
	


Background


	
	Mr Davis was sentenced for the offences of aggravated robbery, detain for advantage and aggravated sexual assault on 5 September 2003. The total effective sentence was 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years. The sentence for aggravated sexual assault was itself 8 years with a non-parole period of 4 years.
	
	
	Mr Davis was released from custody on 12 October 2011 by order of the State Parole Authority. However, he was returned to custody on 29 September 2013 for failing to comply with the supervision conditions of his parole. His parole revocation was later rescinded on 5 December 2013. Following his re-release, Mr Davis’ parole was once again revoked on 28 March 2014 for failing to obey a reasonable command, failing to report as directed and failing to reside at an approved address. A warrant for his arrest was issued on 28 March 2014. He was not arrested until 13 May 2014 when he was apprehended and arrested for indecently assaulting an 18 year old victim in Wollongong.
	
	
	On 2 July 2014, the Crown Solicitors Office filed a summons seeking an interim detention order against Mr Davis. On 10 July 2014, he was charged with offences arising from the alleged incident on 13 May 2014. Bail was refused in respect of those matters. On 15 July 2014, the State Parole Authority confirmed the revocation of Mr Davis’ parole. Pursuant to the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999, the date of expiration of his sentence was extended to 4 September 2014.
	
	
	On 17 July 2014, Hoeben CJ at CL made certain orders by consent, including the appointment of two qualified psychiatrists to examine Mr Davis under s 15(4) of the Act.
	
	
	On 19 August 2014, Mr Davis was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 2 years for the offence of indecent assault commencing on 12 August 2014 and expiring on 11 August 2016. The non-parole period expired on 11 February 2016.
	
	
	On 11 December 2015, I ordered that Mr Davis be subject to an interim supervision order pursuant to s 10A of the Act upon his anticipated release from custody on 11 February 2016. Mr Davis was released from custody on that day, and has been subject to the conditions imposed by the interim supervision order. He has complied with those conditions.
	
	
	It is not in contest that Mr Davis was a detained sex offender who was in custody when this application was made, serving a sentence for a serious sex offence and that he was in the last six months of the total sentence when the application was filed. Further, Mr Davis does not dispute that the application is supported by the necessary documentation required under s 14 of the Act and that the material has been served on him. As I have already observed, there is also no dispute that Mr Davis is a high risk sex offender under s 5B of the Act or that he poses an unacceptable risk of committing a sex offence if he is not kept under supervision.
	


Term of the extended supervision order


	
	The State seeks an extended supervision order for a period of five years. Mr Davis contends that three years would be adequate and sufficient. The latter approach would take into account the fact that Mr Davis successfully completed the CUBIT programme while in custody and that he has so far exhibited positive responses to supervision since his release.
	
	
	In his report dated 13 August 2014 at page 22, Dr Samson Roberts offered the following opinion:
	


“Having regard for Mr Davis’ history of difficulties with respect to complying with community based supervision in the past, his limited participation in substance abuse programs and the requirement that he be supported in his reintegration into his community over a protracted period of time, an extended supervision order of five years would be appropriate from a psychiatric perspective.”


	
	Dr Jeremy O’Dea said this in his 5 September 2014 report at [102]:
	


“[102] Mr Davis’ risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours in the community and of committing a further serious sex offence in the community, is likely to be long term, and of at least 5 years duration. Therefore, from a psychiatric risk management perspective, any appropriate risk management program implemented should be long term and at least of 5 years duration, and should be regularly monitored and reviewed every 6 to 12 months dependent on his progress.”


	
	Dr O’Dea and Dr Roberts each identified a return to alcohol use as Mr Davis’ most significant risk factor. The evidence indicates that Mr Davis has support in the community to assist in maintaining his abstinence. However, Dr Roberts has noted that an earlier relationship that was supportive of ongoing abstinence from alcohol was not enough to prevent Mr Davis’ relapse, “reflecting the fact that Mr Davis has a propensity to resume alcohol consumption irrespective of the social milieu”: 13 August 2014 report at page 15.
	
	
	The State contended in light of these opinions that Mr Davis’ risk factors present an ongoing and unacceptable risk to the community over the long term and that an extended supervision order for the period of five years was called for in the circumstances.
	
	
	It was not contended on behalf of Mr Davis that these medical opinions were flawed or should for some particular reason be discarded or disregarded. Instead, counsel for Mr Davis referred to well-known authority that drew attention to the onerous nature of any supervision order and the availability of a means to extend the period if circumstances warranted such a course: see, for example, State of New South Wales v Conway [2011] NSWSC 925; State of New South Wales v Scerri [2012] NSWSC 271; Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v Steadman [2013] NSWSC 170.
	


Consideration


	
	Mr Davis was born in February 1959 and has a long and unfortunate criminal history of offending, including sexual offending. This would appear to have commenced in June 1976 when he was only 17 years of age. He is now 57 years old.
	
	
	On 4 June 1976, Mr Davis assaulted a female on a train. He was intoxicated at the time. He was fined $150 and sentenced to 30 days detention.
	
	
	On 18 October 1978, Mr Davis committed an act of indecent assault upon his 7 year old female cousin. The offence was committed while on a recognisance. He had been drinking prior to the assault. He was sentenced on 17 September 1979 to a further 5 year recognisance.
	
	
	On 8 February 1980, Mr Davis was arrested in Victoria and extradited to New South Wales where he was charged with assault and robbery whilst armed. The victim of the offence was a 26 year old mother of two who was camping with her husband and children at a caravan park near Eden. The victim’s husband had gone fishing and she was asleep in a tent with only her children. Mr Davis entered the tent, placed a towel over her face and held a screwdriver to her neck. Mr Davis told her that he would cut her throat if she screamed or moved. He pulled her night gown over her face and ultimately penetrated her. He made repeated demands for money and threatened to cut the victim’s throat and those of her children. Mr Davis had been drinking prior to the commission of these offences. He was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment on 16 December 1980 for the sexual assault and 9 years imprisonment for the armed assault and robbery. The sentencing judge recommended that Mr Davis receive treatment for his sexual problems.
	
	
	On 28 July 1998, Mr Davis assaulted his then wife. He had consumed alcohol before slapping and punching her to the face and head. She received cuts, abrasions and bruising. Mr Davis was sentenced on 29 August 1999 to a recognisance for 2 years.
	
	
	On 24 March 2002, Mr Davis once again assaulted his wife. They had been consuming alcohol. He pushed her to the floor, placed his foot on her head and kicked her several times in the back. This continued into the following morning. Mr Davis was convicted on 26 February 2004 in relation to the assault occasioning actual bodily harm and sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months.
	
	
	On 5 September 2003, Mr Davis was sentenced by Berman DCJ to a total of 12 years in custody, expiring on 18 July 2014, with a non-parole period expiring on 18 July 2010 for a series of offences, including an offence committed on 9 July 2002 involving the violent sexual assault of a woman in her home. He had been intoxicated at the time.
	
	
	Following his release on parole, Mr Davis committed an aggravated sexual assault upon an 18 year old woman on a train that they joined at Central Station. Mr Davis was intoxicated at the time. He pleaded guilty to indecent assault and was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months.
	
	
	The evidence suggests that Mr Davis has generally, although not exclusively, responded poorly to supervision. This is despite participating in several programmes designed to deal with drug and alcohol and sexual offending problems, including PREP, CUBIT and Getting SMART, as well as psychological and psychiatric assessment and counselling. He currently resides at the Nunyara Community Offender Support Program.
	
	
	I am sympathetic to the notion that continual supervision can in some circumstances operate to extend and prolong the difficulties with which Mr Davis is required to deal if it forestalls opportunities for him to achieve some form of insight and associated independence. The difficulty that I see with any period of supervision less than five years, however, is that Mr Davis’ history of violent offending in general and sexual offending in particular is of such longstanding that short to medium term supervision will be inadequate to address his problems. The aspect of community safety looms large in this assessment as well.
	
	
	Drs O’Dea and Roberts are of one view. I have not been directed to any countervailing or alternative opinions. Each expert foresees long term supervision as the only likely source of effective assistance for Mr Davis as a way to address future offending by him in the circumstances. I am unable to disagree with their prognoses. Mr Johnston SC who appears for Mr Davis accepts that the medical and psychological prognostications about the risks associated with Mr Davis reoffending and the need for long term supervision to accommodate that risk all point in the same direction.
	
	
	It is well established and uncontroversial that the appropriate duration of an extended supervision order is referrable to the risk of the offender committing further offences: see Johnson J in State of New South Wales v Tillman [2008] NSWSC 1293 at [62]. The safety and protection of the community and the need to encourage serious sex offenders to undertake rehabilitation are paramount.
	
	
	In the case of Mr Davis, the psychiatric and psychological experts agree that his abstinence from alcohol and other drugs is crucial to the management of his risk in the community over the long term. It follows that an assessment of the appropriate duration of an extended supervision order must take account of the associated risk of relapse into alcohol use. Unfortunately, Mr Davis’ use of alcohol and other drugs has been persistent and of longstanding.
	
	
	The risk assessment report dated 20 June 2014 prepared by Kate Solomon reveals at [29] that Mr Davis appears to have been able to manage himself responsibly for periods of approximately 12 months following his release from incarceration but has been unable to maintain that position over the longer term:
	


“OVERALL RESPONSE TO SUPERVISION

29.    Mr Davis’ response to supervision has been consistently poor and resulted in the State Parole Authority revoking his parole on at least four occasions. Initially when released Mr Davis appears to be able to manage himself responsibly; after both his lengthy incarcerations he has attracted minimal negative attention from the supervising bodies for at least one year. However Mr Davis has been unable to maintain this satisfactory response and consequently destabilised; he has disengaged from the authorities, not sought help from his support network, left his accommodation and relapsed into alcohol use. Mr Davis’ drinking has escalated rapidly and he has attracted the attention of Police due to drinking in a public park (COPS, Event number 25/03/2014). When asked during interview (26/05/2014) why he did not seek assistance from Community Corrections, Mr Davis stated that he was afraid of being breached. However he also admits that due to his high levels of alcohol consumption he was unable to make good decisions.”


	
	That assessment is redolent of what is otherwise emphatically reflected in other assessment reports as well.
	
	
	I am satisfied that in the light of the whole of the evidence relied upon by the State that Mr Davis’ risk factors present an ongoing and unacceptable risk to the community. His historical and apparently intransigent and persistent problems with alcohol, and the need for continued support to maintain abstinence, are a reoccurring theme throughout the early and current expert opinions. I am equally satisfied that the ongoing and unacceptable risk to the community posed by Mr Davis is likely to exist and to persist over the long term. I am accordingly of the opinion that an extended supervision order for the period of five years is called for in the circumstances.
	
	
	I note that in forming my opinion and in arriving at my conclusions I have had specific regard, among other material, to the several expert reports tendered without objection and marked as exhibits “B” to “F” inclusive. I have also had similar regard to the affidavits upon which the State has relied, which were read without objection and which for convenience have been assembled in a folder that became exhibit “A” in the proceedings.
	


Conditions


	
	Not all of the proposed conditions were in dispute. In accordance with s 11 of the Act, I am required to be satisfied “having regard to the scope, purpose and objects of the Act that it is appropriate to impose a particular condition so as to address the risk of future offending of the type which was the basis of the order”: Wilde v State of New South Wales [2015] NSWCA 28 at [53].
	
	
	In State of New South Wales v Kamm [2016] NSWSC 1, I considered the need in the particular circumstances of that case to ensure that the conditions imposed were not more onerous or restrictive than the nature of the case required. For example, a sexual offender whose conduct has been exclusively directed to female children is not to be unnecessarily restricted from having contact with adult females against whom he has no history of, or any demonstrated propensity for, sexual offending. Similarly, restrictions on the use or consumption of alcohol or drugs have no automatic place in a supervisory regime with respect to an offender with no antecedent or anticipated problems with drugs or alcohol.
	
	
	Mr Davis originally contended in these proceedings that proposed conditions 14, 15, 26, 28 and 35 could and should be amended so as not unnecessarily to impose too onerous or inappropriate restrictions on him. Those conditions were originally proposed in the following terms:
	


“14.    The defendant must not permit any person to enter and remain, or to stay overnight, at his approved address, without the prior approval of his DSO.

15.    The defendant must not leave New South Wales without the approval of CSNSW.

26.    The defendant must not approach or have contact without [sic, with] anyone he knows is under 18 unless his DSO tells him he can, and he is with someone who has been approved in writing by his DSO.

28.    The defendant must not associate with any people who are consuming or under the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol.

35.    The defendant must not carry on his person, at any time he has left his residence, any knife, syringe or other cutting instrument or any rope, cord, cable ties, or other instrument of restraint.”


	
	Mr Davis submitted that these conditions were unduly restrictive. However, the State has now conceded that the conditions should be revised to take account of these concerns. Accordingly, the conditions now listed in the Schedule to these reasons reflect what has now been agreed between the parties are suitable in the present circumstances. More importantly, they also represent what in the circumstances of this case I consider to be appropriate and necessary conditions.
	
	
	In forming that view I have taken account of the fact that Mr Davis will be subject to this regime for a period of five years in accordance with my decision in that respect. The intrusive and onerous nature of the conditions has therefore to be assessed having regard not only to the conditions themselves but to the period in Mr Davis’ life over which they will apply. In my experience, however, with the confidently anticipated competent and professional assistance of those with whom Mr Davis will be required to interact during the period of his supervision, the likelihood is that a settled and workable system or arrangement will develop so that the administration and enforcement of the conditions becomes a matter of mutual understanding rather than a source of conflict. In that respect I encourage the parties to cooperate whenever and wherever possible.
	


Conclusions and orders


	
	In the circumstances I make the following orders:
	



	
	Order pursuant to s 5C of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 that Paul Edward Davis be subject to a high risk sex offender extended supervision order for a period of five years from today.
	
	
	Direct pursuant to s 11 of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 for the period of the high risk sex offender extended supervision order that Paul Edward Davis comply with the conditions set out in the SCHEDULE to these orders.

		09 March 2016",2016-03-08 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701938,Hudson v R [2016] NSWCCA 30,"Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	HALL J: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: Damien Lee Hudson seeks leave to appeal against a sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months imposed upon him in the District Court at Sydney on 9 October 2014 for an offence of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon committed at the Stockton Bowling Club on 26 August 2012.
	
	
	The offence is contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 25 years.
	
	
	Mr Hudson (""the applicant"") raises two grounds of appeal, one asserting that the learned sentencing judge erred in assessing the seriousness of the offence and another asserting that the sentence is manifestly excessive.
	


Facts


	
	The applicant pleaded not guilty but was convicted after a relatively short trial. The facts for the purpose of sentencing were not disputed. The following summary was helpfully provided in the Crown’s written submissions:
	


“The applicant along with two co-offenders, Peter Laupama and Scott Lynch, planned and carried out an armed robbery on the Stockton Bowling Club where Lynch worked as a barman. They planned for it to take place on the night of an annual charity function when Lynch was on duty. At about 10pm trading ceased, the patrons left and the club was secured. Lynch and another employee, Ms Susan Stirrat, remained behind to empty the poker machines, to count the tills and put the money in the safe. At about 10.23pm Lynch called the applicant to signal the start of the robbery. Immediately following this the applicant and Laupama smashed through the back doors wearing disguises and armed with shotguns. They ran through the club and pretended to hold up Lynch. Lynch directed them to the office area where Ms Stirrat was counting the money. The two men confronted her and stole $34,520. They then fled the scene in a stolen car which they burnt-out a short distance away before making their escape. Lynch provided Police with a false statement and then met the co-offenders at the applicant’s house for his cut of the proceeds. Two months later Police arrested Lynch and interviewed him. Lynch admitted his involvement in the robbery and implicated the applicant and Laupama. The applicant was arrested on 28 November 2012.”


	
	The planning for the robbery involved the following steps, again usefully summarised in the Crown’s written submissions:
	


“i.   Six months before the offence the applicant approached and then recruited an inside man (Lynch);

ii.   Several months before the offence they discussed and identified the most advantageous time to rob the club (the “Jelly Blubber Ball” – “the busiest day in the calendar”);

iii.   Two weeks before the robbery they undertook a reconnaissance of the club, where they identified the best time to enter the club (at the end of the night once Lynch had emptied the poker machines), the point of access (the back door which was not covered by a security camera) and the path to take once inside;

iv.   On the day of the robbery they gave money and instructions to Lynch to acquire a disposable pre-paid phone in a false name and to call and then hang up as the go signal for the robbery;

v.   They acquired two shot guns, disguises and a car they could dispose of after the robbery;

vi.   Once that signal was given they broke in through the back door and robbed the club. During the robbery they took the disposal phone from Lynch to ensure it wouldn’t be found;

vii.   Immediately after the robbery they burnt out the getaway car and disposed of one of the shot guns; and

viii.   Several days later (in accordance with prior arrangements) Lynch and the others reunited at the applicant’s house to divide the money.”


	
	A relatively lengthy victim impact statement by Ms Susan Stirrat was tendered and quoted in full in the judge’s sentencing remarks. It described a significant level of psychological harm she experienced and continues to endure as a result of the offence. One aspect she emphasised was the sense of betrayal she felt that one of the offenders was a co-worker with whom she thought she had a good working and social relationship.
	


Subjective features


	
	The applicant was born in 1978. He was aged 34 at the time of the offence.
	
	
	He has a criminal record that commenced in the Children’s Court when he was aged 16. It is only necessary to refer to the following offences which have some significance on this application.

	A psychiatrist’s report was tendered in the sentence proceedings. It set out a history reported by the applicant to the author of some significant matters that occurred during his childhood and early adult years. They are summarised in the written submissions of the applicant’s counsel, Ms Avenell:
	


“Sexual abuse when he was 6; physical abuse by his step-father; lack of parental support; suffering ADHD; witnessing another boy’s suicide on train tracks and a homicide at 14-15; no or limited education from about 14; homelessness as a teenager; his father’s suicide on Mr Hudson’s nineteenth birthday; and attempt suicide himself. Mr Hudson started drinking at about 16, and as an adult abused alcohol, drugs and gambled. His mother had psychiatric admissions and his brother suffered schizophrenia.”


	
	A Pre Sentence Report by a Community Corrections Officer referred to the applicant’s response to supervision by Juvenile Justice and subsequently as an adult pursuant to good behaviour bonds, community service orders and parole. She noted that the majority had been breached by way of re-offence or non-compliance. She added:
	


“Case management has focused on alcohol and other drug treatment and anger management but to date the offender has been non-compliant, hindering attempts at interventions and treatment to address his criminogenic issues.”


	
	The officer made the observation that the applicant had in the past “refused to engage in case management strategies to address his anger management issues and collateral checks revealed the offender appears to self-medicate with illicit substances”.
	


Ground 1 - McLoughlin DCJ erred in assessing the seriousness of the offence


	
	Counsel for the applicant drew attention to the following passage in the remarks on sentence:
	


“The crime is unfortunately prevalent and very serious. The commission of this offence, involved extensive planning, threats of violence and no consideration for the effect it may have on the victims and a considerable amount of money was stolen. …

Having regard to the Henry guideline judgment, however, I regard this offence as far more serious because of the age of the offenders, the planning, the threats of violence, the use of firearms and the amount of money taken.

The offender knew at the time what to take and how to take it and I regard the offence as well above the middle of any scale constructed for such offences, and it must result in a lengthy prison sentence.” (Emphasis added)


	
	It was submitted that referring to the planning for the offence as “extensive” was an overstatement. I am not persuaded that is correct having regard to the features set out above (at [7]).
	
	
	Issue was also taken with the judge’s reference to “violence” being “extensive”. The emphasised passage in the above extract from the sentencing remarks could be read as indicating his Honour thought the violence was extensive; but I believe it should be read as indicating that “extensive” was confined to the planning and his Honour was then immediately referring to the fact that the offence also involved threats of violence. Such a finding is unimpeachable given that Ms Stirrat gave evidence of how she was confronted in a small office by an offender (the applicant) who was wearing dark clothes and a balaclava and who was armed with a shotgun. She was told not to go anywhere. The offender took money from the safe, telling Ms Stirrat “Don’t you look at me”. He then grabbed her, pushed her to the corner and told her “get down on your knees, face the corner”. He demanded to know whether there was any more money before telling her to “stay there”.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant also submitted that the reference by the judge to “no consideration for the effect it [the violence] may have on the victims” was simply an observation that could be made about any armed robbery offence. I readily accept that this is usually the case but it does not mean that an offender’s selfish disregard for the impact of such an offence upon victims is irrelevant.
	
	
	Counsel accepted the correctness of the judge’s finding that the offence was more serious than the typical offence described in the guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 but argued that it did not warrant the characterisation of being “well above” the middle of the range of seriousness. Reference was made to the finding of the judge who sentenced the co-offender Laupama that the offence was at the “higher end of the lower range”.
	
	
	As counsel for the Crown correctly pointed out, the assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is a discretionary evaluation classically within the role of sentencing judges which is not ordinarily susceptible to interference on appeal: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37] (Spigelman CJ) and [46] (Simpson J, as her Honour then was).
	
	
	The discretionary nature of the exercise explains how one judge might come to a certain view which differs, within reason, to the view of another judge. Where the difference in assessment is significant, as in the present case, the question must be whether the assessment in respect of the sentence under consideration was open to be made. It is not the case that error must be inferred because of the extent of the departure.
	
	
	In my view, the degree of planning for the offence; that it was committed by three offenders; that two potentially lethal weapons were used; that a substantial sum of money was taken; that the victim was vulnerable (a woman who in reality was alone in the club at night with, effectively, three armed robbers); that significant psychological distress was caused; and that it caused significant financial stress for the club itself were all features that rendered the offence particularly serious. Moreover, counsel appearing for the applicant in the District Court accepted that the offence involved “the highest degree of criminality”. He conceded that it was “disgraceful”; it was “organised”; it was committed “in company”; and “guns were used”.
	
	
	None of the complaints raised under this ground have been made good.
	


Ground 2 – The sentence is manifestly excessive


	
	In addition to the matters raised under the previous ground, counsel for the applicant relied upon some further matters in support of her contention that the sentence is manifestly excessive.
	
	
	It was submitted that the judge gave “undue regard” to the victim impact statement because he quoted it in full in his sentencing remarks. It was contended that there was nothing especially out of the ordinary in the impact this offence had upon Ms Stirrat and that she seemed to be more affected by the role played by her co-worker. It was acknowledged that she was required to give evidence in the applicant’s trial but it was noted that such evidence was quite brief (six pages of transcript with cross-examination occupying a single page).
	
	
	I do not agree that by reading the entire victim impact statement the judge gave it “undue regard”. Such a complaint is not established simply because the document was relatively lengthy and thereby occupied a significant portion of the transcript of the judgment. The statement had not been read out when it was tendered and so I see nothing untoward in the judge reading it out in full. Public ventilation of the effect upon a victim of a serious crime of violence should not be the subject of criticism. Significantly, all that the judge said about it after having read it was: “I give it statutory regard”. The impact of the offence upon Ms Stirrat was not a factor that his Honour mentioned when explaining his finding as to the relative seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	The fact that Ms Stirrat’s evidence at the trial might have been brief does not provide a measure of the impact having to do so might have had upon her. There is nothing to indicate she was aware at any time before the trial that there would be little or no challenge to her evidence.
	
	
	Criticism was made of his Honour’s reference to the applicant as “no stranger to violence, weapons or robbery” and later, “it is his third robbery offence” and “this is his third robbery offence with the use of weapons”. It was submitted that the repetition of reference to the applicant’s history of robbery offences suggests that it bore strongly on his determination of the appropriate sentence. And the last reference to this being a third robbery with the use of weapons was submitted to be wrong.
	
	
	The applicant’s criminal history has been set out earlier. It is patently obvious that he has been a recidivist violent offender. The present matter constituted his third robbery offence but there have been many other offences of a violent nature. He has been imprisoned repeatedly with no deterrent effect and he has not responded to supervision within the community. It was entirely appropriate for his Honour to emphasise such features as bearing upon the need for a strongly deterrent sentencing response. The reference to a “third robbery offence with the use of weapons” was not literally correct but the two components of the statement are both reflected in the applicant’s history. If the judge had referred to a “third robbery offence and a third offence involving a weapon” there could be no complaint. In my view, at worst, this was an inadvertent misstatement of no material consequence.
	
	
	Reference was made to the various unfortunate experiences in the applicant’s early life (see above at [11]) and R v Millwood [2012] NSWCCA 2 was cited as an example of how such a background was relevant to the assessment of sentence. The circumstances of Mr Millwood's upbringing were not dissimilar to the present applicant. The Crown in that case had submitted that ""there is little in the circumstances of the respondent that assist him by way of mitigation"". Simpson J (as her Honour then was) rejected the submission and her response included the following:
	


""[69] … Common sense and common humanity dictate that such a person will have fewer emotional resources to guide his (or her) behavioural decisions. I should not be taken as implying that such a person bears no moral responsibility; but I consider that the DPP's submission significantly underestimates the impact of a dysfunctional childhood. …""


	
	Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 is well-known for its discussion of the significance on sentence of an offender having emanated from a background of tragedy and deprivation. In the plurality judgment at [44] there is reference to the various purposes of punishment and the fact that a feature of a particular case might reduce an offender’s moral culpability whilst at the same time increasing the emphasis to be given to protection of the community. In the present case the various unfortunate experiences and disadvantages in the applicant’s past might serve to explain his entrenched abuse of alcohol and drugs. However, whilst in that way it might explain his frequent interaction with the criminal justice system, there was also a heightened need for personal deterrence and community protection. Further, it is important to bear in mind that whilst the applicant’s experiences in early life might justifiably evoke sympathy, it was necessary for the sentence to be proportionate to the gravity of the crime: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566 at 572 [15] (Spigelman CJ).
	
	
	The sentencing judge referred to the personal history set out in the psychiatric report in some detail. While he did not accept various aspects of the applicant’s account of the offence, he appears to have accepted without question the account of his earlier life. For example, his Honour considered that a lengthy sentence was called for “despite his upbringing and the difficulties he has had in his youth”. This was a conclusion well open to his Honour in the exercise of his sentencing discretion.
	
	
	It is clearly the case that the index offence is substantially more serious than any offence for which the applicant has been sentenced in the past and the present sentence is by far the longest that has been imposed upon him. Nevertheless it was a serious example of an offence for which the statutory guidepost is a high maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. In my view, it cannot be concluded that there was any miscarriage in the manner in which the sentencing discretion was exercised.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1. Leave to appeal against sentence granted.

2. Appeal dismissed.

		07 March 2016",2016-03-06 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2701941,Price v R [2016] NSWCCA 29,"Judgment


	
	SIMPSON JA: I agree with Johnson J.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Christian Price, seeks leave to appeal with respect to a sentence imposed at the Newcastle District Court on 28 August 2013.
	


Offence and Sentence


	
	The Applicant pleaded guilty to a charge that, on 4 June 2012 at Charlestown, he did supply a prohibited drug, methylamphetamine, contrary to s.25(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 15 years.
	
	
	The Applicant requested the sentencing Judge take into account, on a Form 1, offences of possession of a prohibited drug (cannabis) and dealing with property suspected of being the proceeds of crime ($2,450.00 in cash).
	
	
	The Applicant was sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years and eight months commencing on 28 August 2013 and expiring on 27 April 2016, with a balance of term of 11 months commencing on 28 April 2016 and expiring on 27 March 2017.
	


The Applicant’s Grounds


	
	The Applicant, who appeared unrepresented in this Court, identified two grounds of appeal expressed as follows:
	



	
	Ground 1 - “Severity of sentence for the amount”.
	
	
	Ground 2 - “Traversed plea to guilty to be eligible for Drug Court”.
	



	
	Although the second ground is framed in terms which suggest an intention to challenge conviction, the form of the application brought by the Applicant remained one directed to sentence only.
	


Factual Background


	
	On 4 June 2012, a search warrant was executed on the Applicant’s home at Charlestown. Inside the premises, police located quantities of methylamphetamine and cannabis. The sum of $2,450.00 in cash, digital scales and numerous resealable bags were also found. The Applicant told police he was a long-term drug user and that the drugs were for his personal use.
	
	
	The Applicant was charged with one count of (deemed) supply of a prohibited drug (15.53 grams of methylamphetamine), possession of a prohibited drug (30.3 grams of cannabis) and dealing with property suspected to be the proceeds of crime ($2,450.00 in cash).
	
	
	The Applicant was granted bail. He pleaded not guilty in the Newcastle Local Court and was committed for trial. On 14 March 2013, the Applicant was arraigned at the Newcastle District Court on an indictment containing one count of supplying a prohibited drug. He pleaded not guilty and a trial date was fixed for 12 August 2013.
	
	
	Following a conference with his counsel and solicitor on 12 August 2013, the Applicant provided instructions to enter a plea of guilty and he did so later that day.
	
	
	The proceedings were adjourned with the sentencing hearing taking place on 26 August 2013. The Applicant was called to give evidence. He said with respect to the offence:
	



	
	he pleaded guilty to possessing methylamphetamine;
	
	
	he used the proceeds from a poker machine win and the sale of a motor bike to buy the methylamphetamine and cannabis;
	
	
	he used the scales and bags so he knew exactly how much he was taking for his “own personal use”;
	
	
	the scales and bags were not for the purpose of supplying the drugs; and
	
	
	he did not supplement his habit by selling the drug, although he did very rarely “sell amphetamine to support his habit”.
	



	
	The presiding Judge raised concerns about the Applicant’s evidence which appeared to traverse his plea. The matter was stood down in the list so that the Applicant could provide instructions to his legal representatives. The sentencing Judge provided the Applicant’s counsel with a copy of the decision of this Court in R v Masri [2005] NSWCCA 330, a case in which the Court found there to be a miscarriage of justice where an appellant had been sentenced for deemed supply in circumstances where he had adopted a position that he was not guilty of supply.
	
	
	Following a conference with his legal representatives, the Applicant confirmed instructions that he wished to maintain his plea of guilty.
	
	
	The Applicant appeared before the sentencing Judge on 27 August 2013 and his counsel informed the Court that the Applicant wished to proceed with his plea of guilty. The matter was adjourned to 28 August 2013, when the sentencing hearing continued. The Applicant was called to give evidence and he stated that he adhered to his plea, had read the Statement of Agreed Facts and wished to be sentenced on those facts.
	
	
	The presiding Judge proceeded to sentence the Applicant on that day, applying a discount of 10% for his late guilty plea.
	


Ground 2 - Entering a Plea of Guilty to be Eligible for the Drug Court


	
	It is appropriate to address the second ground of appeal first, which will be treated as if it was a challenge to conviction.
	
	
	In an unsworn document entitled “Affidavit” filed on 10 September 2015, the Applicant asserted, in effect, that he had entered a plea of guilty to the drug supply charge so as to be eligible for the Drug Court. He stated that he had discussed this issue with his counsel in the District Court before confirming his plea of guilty.
	
	
	The Crown filed in this Court an affidavit of the Applicant’s counsel in the District Court. In that affidavit, the Applicant’s account was contradicted and, in particular, the barrister stated that he had advised the Applicant that he was not eligible for the Drug Court.
	
	
	At the hearing before this Court, the Applicant did not dispute the accuracy of this proposition. It is the case that the Applicant was not an “eligible person” for the purpose of the Drug Court Act 1998. The Applicant pleaded guilty to supplying 15.53 grams of methylamphetamine. The indictable quantity with respect to methylamphetamine is five grams. This charge was not capable of being dealt with summarily: cl.29, Sch.1, Criminal Procedure Act 1986; ss.25 and 31 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. Accordingly, the Applicant was not eligible for the Drug Court: s.5(2)(a) Drug Court Act 1998.
	
	
	To the extent that an appeal against conviction may be entertained in the face of a plea of guilty entered at first instance, this Court has stated that it is necessary to demonstrate that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred. The ultimate question relates to the integrity of the plea itself. There will be no miscarriage of justice where the Court acts upon a plea of guilty entered in the exercise of a free choice in what the Accused person believed to be his interests at the time, and where there was a genuine consciousness of guilt. The authorities and principles are gathered in the decision of this Court in Loury v R [2010] NSWCCA 158 at [97]-[100].
	
	
	The Applicant has not demonstrated that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred in this case. His plea of guilty was entered and confirmed by the Applicant after an opportunity had been provided to him to take advice from his counsel and solicitor before the District Court. The Applicant was not eligible for the Drug Court in any event. The material before this Court does not support a finding that the Applicant misunderstood the position in this respect.
	
	
	The second ground of appeal should be rejected.
	


Ground 1 - Complaint Concerning the Severity of the Sentence Given the Amount of Prohibited Drug Involved


	
	In support of this ground, the Applicant pointed to the quantity of drug involved on the supply offence and steps which he told the Court he had taken to progress his rehabilitation whilst in custody.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the sentence imposed was open to the sentencing court in light of the Applicant’s offence (and Form 1 matters) and the Applicant’s criminal history, which included a prior offence of supplying a prohibited drug.
	
	
	The first ground of appeal should be taken as being a claim that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. To succeed in this respect, the Applicant must show that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 371 [25]. It is not simply a matter for this Court to substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing Judge because it might have exercised its discretion in a different manner: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at 339 [57].
	
	
	The Applicant was 44 years old at the time of sentence. His criminal history included entries for cultivation of a prohibited drug (in 1991), possession and use of prohibited drugs (in 1990, 1991, 1992, 1998 and 2009) and offences of supplying a prohibited drug, for which suspended sentences were ordered in 2011. One of the Applicant’s suspended sentences for drug supply expired in January 2012, some five months before the commission of the offence to which this appeal relates.
	
	
	Having regard to the objective gravity of the drug supply offence (including the Form 1 offences), the Applicant’s subjective case, the need for general and specific deterrence and keeping in mind the maximum penalty of 15 years’ imprisonment, it cannot be concluded that the sentence imposed upon the Applicant, although substantial, was unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	
	
	The Applicant points to steps he has taken to remain drug free whilst in custody. Whilst these matters are commendable, unless error is demonstrated, they cannot be taken into account before this Court.
	
	
	It has not been demonstrated that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. The first ground of appeal should be rejected.
	


Conclusion


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	leave to appeal against sentence granted;
	
	
	appeal against sentence dismissed.
	



	
	McCALLUM J: I agree with Johnson J.

2701943,Coles v R [2016] NSWCCA 32,"JUDGMENT


	
	HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with Fullerton J.
	
	
	ADAMS J: I agree with Fullerton J.
	
	
	FULLERTON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against an aggregate sentence of 8 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months imposed in the District Court on 2 May 2014 following pleas of guilty to fifteen counts laid variously under ss 117, 125,178A and 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) as to which maximum periods of imprisonment of between 5 years and 7 years are provided.
	
	
	In January 2012, after a three year police investigation, the applicant was arrested and charged with a significantly greater number of offences than those for which he was sentenced. On 8 November 2012 he was committed for trial in respect of 30 offences with a further 74 offences the subject of a s 166 certificate.
	
	
	On 22 August 2013, within a short time of the trial date, the applicant entered pleas of guilty to 15 counts on indictment and asked the sentencing judge to take into account a further 18 offences on two separate Forms 1.
	
	
	In nominating an indicative sentence for each of the 15 counts, the sentencing judge allowed a discount of 15 per cent for the late pleas of guilty. A finding of special circumstances based on the applicant’s age (he was 66 at the time of sentence) and what was found to be reasonable prospects that he would not reoffend, resulted in a significant alteration to the statutory ratio specified in s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	


The sole ground of appeal


	
	The applicant contends that the sentencing judge’s failure to take into account the passage of three years from the execution of search warrants at his home and business in January 2009 in the initial phase of the police investigation, to the laying of charges by the service of CAN notices in January 2012, was an error of principle and that on re-sentence this Court would impose a more lenient aggregate sentence.
	
	
	No submission was advanced that this Court should indicate a lesser sentence or sentences for any individual count or counts. The applicant also invited the Court on re-sentence to preserve the ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of term by endorsing a finding of special circumstances.
	


The facts for sentencing purposes


	
	It was the agreed position for sentencing purposes that the counts in the indictment, and the offences on the Forms 1, were representative of the totality of the applicant’s dishonest conduct between 2001 and 2008, including his utilisation of a business owned and operated by him and various companies he controlled for fraudulent purposes. This was reflected in a comprehensive agreed statement of facts and other materials tendered by the Crown on sentence.
	
	
	For present purposes, it suffices to describe the applicant’s business activities as involving him offering financial advice and related services to those of his clients who owned artistic works for investment purposes (most usually valuable oil paintings by acclaimed Australian artists) either personally or, more usually, through self-managed superannuation funds. In order that the client comply with the rules applying to investment in artworks, principally that the artwork held as an asset by such a fund not be displayed as an artwork but stored or held for sale, the applicant encouraged his clients to either allow him to hold works on consignment for sale (with the corresponding obligation to account to the client where a work was sold) or to store the works in his premises for a fee.
	
	
	In respect of each of the artworks the subject of the 15 counts on the indictment, the applicant either dealt with the work contrary to the terms of the bailment, including by offering the work as security for a loan from which he benefited, and failing to account to the owner of the work after it was sold by retaining the funds for his own use. That conduct was also the subject of 11 of the 18 offences on the Forms 1 with the remaining seven offences involving the applicant fraudulently taking artworks for his own use.
	
	
	The total value of the 35 artworks the subject of the indictment, including those on the Forms 1, particularised in the agreed facts by the title of the painting, was $5,956,500. None of those works have been recovered. Four hundred and thirteen artworks were seized by police, some of which have been restored to the owners of the artworks.
	
	
	Although there was no obligation on the sentencing judge to appoint the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offending referable to any range (none of the offences attracted a standard non-parole period), the objective seriousness was found to be well above the mid range having been the result of what the sentencing judge found was a deliberate, well planned and systematic fraud committed over many years. His Honour also regarded the applicant’s dishonest dealings with clients who had reposed trust in him as a brazen breach of that trust and that his sole motivation was greed and the desire for financial gain to maintain an affluent lifestyle.
	
	
	Save for the finding of special circumstances (a generous finding given that the sentencing judge also found the applicant an unimpressive witness with poor insight into his offending), the applicant’s subjective circumstances, including his good character, did not attract any leniency.
	
	
	At the sentencing hearing, the applicant’s legal representative submitted that the delay between the initiation of the police investigation in 2009 and the commencement of proceedings in 2012 should be taken into account on sentence because the applicant “was left in limbo for three years” having given evidence on sentence that he had made contact with the police “on a number of occasions” and that the response of the police was “we’ll get back to you”. The sentencing judge was referred to Blanco v R [1999] NSWCCA 121; 106 A Crim R 303 as authority for the proposition that in those circumstances delay operated as a factor in mitigation of sentence.
	
	
	In Blanco, the delay in sentencing was solely as a consequence of what the Court found was the inordinate and unexpected delay in the offender’s arrest and charge. In light of that finding, Wood  CJ at CL said:
	


[16] The reason why delay is to be taken into account when sentencing an offender relates first to the fact of the uncertain suspense in which a person may be left; secondly to any demonstrated progress of the offender towards rehabilitation during the intervening period; and thirdly, to the fact that a sentence for a stale crime does call for a measure of understanding and flexibility of approach: See, in addition to Todd and Mill, the decisions in Harrison (1990) 48 A Crim R 197 at 198-199 and King (Court of Criminal Appeal NSW, 24 February 1998).

[17] The present was not a case where the applicant had been arrested and had spent a long time awaiting sentence, or in a state of suspense as to whether he might be charged; nor is it a case where he had shown any commitment towards rehabilitation after having realised the error of his ways. However, it remains the fact that it is highly desirable that the prosecuting authorities act promptly where they have evidence of serious criminality. If they fail to do so, then they must expect that circumstance to be taken into account on sentencing. It is in the public interest that those who are suspected of serious criminality be brought to justice and be brought to justice quickly, particularly where there is a strong case available against them. I will return to this fact later, because it does seem to me that insufficient weight was given to it in the sentencing process.


	
	The Crown advanced no submission in reply as to the significance of the passage of three years between the initiation of the investigation and charge after it was raised by the defence in submissions, including whether it carried any weight as a factor in mitigation in the particular circumstances of the case, and the sentencing judge made no reference in his sentencing reasons to having considered the applicant’s submission that delay should attract leniency.
	
	
	In support of what was said to be the applicant’s entitlement to have had delay taken into account in his favour on sentence, at the hearing of the appeal significant reliance was placed on Sabra v R [2015] NSWCCA 38, where this Court had occasion to review the principles as to the potential for delay to be a mitigating factor in the sentencing exercise. In addition to setting out the relevant principles drawn from a number of authorities (including Blanco), the Court in Sabra rejected the approach of the South Australian courts exemplified in Pickard v R [2011] SASCFC 134 which requires an offender to demonstrate consequences greater than anxiety and a state of uncertain suspense before a sentencing court can take delay into account in mitigation (see Sabra) at [38]-[46]). At [45] Bellew J said:
	


Delay which is not attributable to an offender may be relevant on sentence at a number of different levels. Ordinarily, such delay will be a mitigating factor if (as in the present case) it has resulted in significant stress to the offender, or has left him or her, to a significant degree, in a state of uncertain suspense. Where there is evidence that delay has led to consequences being visited upon an offender which are adverse to his or her circumstances and which are over and above stress and anxiety, be those consequences in the nature of interrupted rehabilitation or otherwise, then the weight to be given to such delay in the sentencing process will obviously be greater. But that is not to say that an offender must be able to establish consequences of that kind before delay can become relevant at all. To so conclude would be contrary to the weight of previous authority in this Court.


	
	An analysis of the authorities to which Bellew J referred in Sabra, authorities which this Court has considered on numerous occasions, make it clear that preliminary to the question whether the applicant in fact suffered a significant detriment, or adverse consequences of any relevant kind, by the passage of three years from January 2009 to January 2012 which might have attracted mitigatory weight in the sentencing exercise (an evidential burden he was obliged to discharge on the balance of probabilities), is whether the passage of three years was a delay of the kind which might attract the considerations of fairness referred to in Todd v R [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 (at 519). That case was referred to in Mill v R [1988] HCA 70; 166 CLR 59, where the plurality of the High Court said (at [14]):
	


… The long deferment of the trial or punishment of an offender, with the consequent uncertainty as to what will happen to him, raise considerations of fairness to an offender which must be taken into consideration when the second court is determining an appropriate head sentence. …


	
	While it is clear that delay in the sentencing of an offender is a relevant consideration, a relevant principle for which both Todd and Mill are authority, as Simpson J observed in McKittrick v R [2014] NSWCCA 128 at [17], it is not every case where delay has occurred in the prosecution of an offender that a reduced sentence results, since each case depends upon its own particular circumstances. It seems to me that before any consideration can meaningfully be given to whether an amelioration in sentence is warranted because of the delay in the prosecution or sentencing an offender, the reasons for the delay need to be considered and, where necessary, some evidence directed to that question.
	
	
	On the hearing of the appeal, the applicant’s reliance on delay as a factor in mitigation proceeded on the assumption that three years from the execution of search warrants over the applicant’s home and business by police in January 2009 to the laying of charges in January 2012 was of such a length that the Crown was obligated to explain the delay by calling direct evidence that the delay was both explicable and reasonable and, having failed to call that evidence, or to address any submission to the issue, the sentencing judge was obligated to afford it weight in mitigation of sentence.
	
	
	The authorities to which I have referred recognise that an unexplained, unreasonable, or inordinate delay in commencing a prosecution, in particular where evidence is available to support the laying of charges and no charges are laid, or where there is evidence of wrongdoing but the police are dilatory in investigating whether it supports the laying of charges (as was the case in Blanco and, more recently, in McKittrick), might operate in mitigation of sentence even where the delay did not cause any change in the offender’s circumstances. There was, however, nothing in the evidence before the sentencing judge in this case to suggest that the delay was of that order.
	
	
	The overwhelming inference from the evidence before the sentencing judge was that the three year police investigation before CAN notices issued was due to the complexity of the investigation into the applicant’s fraudulent activities, including the sheer number of paintings ultimately seized by police and the need to have them authenticated and valued by art specialists. The fact that very few of the paintings were labelled also meant that ownership in many works was difficult to trace. In addition, the duplicity of receipts issued by the applicant to various people for the same artworks in perpetration of the fraud, and the paucity of financial records provided by him to the liquidators of his companies and his trustee in bankruptcy, together with the paucity of documents seized by police under warrant, would inevitably have extended the investigation period.
	
	
	There was no submission advanced in the court below or on the appeal that the offences were stale, that is, charged long after the offences were committed such as might attract leniency on that account alone.
	
	
	While the Crown did not lead any detailed evidence from the officer in charge as to the precise course the investigation took, his evidence in chief having been limited to a discrete issue, neither was he cross-examined to suggest that the investigators were dilatory or the investigation unfocused, or that the passage of three years was not fairly accounted for by the nature of the applicant’s offending, including either his deliberate or negligent failure to maintain proper business records.
	
	
	In fact, in the following exchange, the applicant’s legal representative effectively conceded that delay was not in issue:
	


Q. You see Coles was trying to contact police to find out what was going on, wasn’t he?

A. Well Senior Constable Last never told me that.

Q. Well he didn’t say anything to the contrary, did he?

A. No but –

Q. That they were searching for Mr Coles?

A. Well he wasn’t searching for Mr Coles because he handed over the matter to the Fraud Squad.

Q. Okay and it took several years. I’m not suggesting there was any delay in relation to the investigation but it took several years for Mr Coles to be charged, correct?

A. That’s correct.

Q. Three years went by, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And when you made the decision to charge him you were able to locate him?

A. Yes.

Q. And you found him to be a taxi driver in the Ettalong/Central Coast area, yes?

A. He told me that.

[Emphasis added.]


	
	There being no complaint by the applicant’s legal representative at the sentence hearing about the time taken by police to fully investigate the matter and to assemble the evidence, the fact that the applicant contacted police in the early part of the investigation (assuming that the conflict between his evidence and that of the officer in charge concerning the nature and extent of contact in the first six months was resolved in his favour) was, in my view, of no weight as a factor in mitigation. To suggest, as counsel did on the appeal, that the applicant was in a state of uncertainty as to whether he would be charged might be accurate, but to suggest, as the applicant did in his evidence, that he “had no idea what the police really wanted of him” was disingenuous (and entitled to be treated as such by the sentencing judge) in light of what the applicant must be taken to have known was the inevitability of his being prosecuted for a systematic and patent course of fraudulent dealings over many years.
	
	
	Finally, no evidence was called from the applicant or led on his behalf that he suffered any detriment as a result of the delay inherent in the investigation or, for that matter, adverse consequences of any kind. His change in material circumstances (he was driving taxis and living in rented accommodation at the time of his arrest) was unrelated, in any relevant sense, to the delay in the laying of charges. Neither did it indicate anything positive about his rehabilitation. The fact that he did not reoffend in the three years after his fraudulent business dealings were disclosed and investigated was doubtless because of his bankruptcy and the loss of his clientele and, in those circumstances, of no weight as a mitigating factor.
	
	
	It is always preferable for a sentencing judge to refer to matters relied upon in mitigation, whether in acknowledgement of their weight or in finding they have no weight, and the reason for so finding. Although in this case it would have been preferable for the sentencing judge to have expressly distinguished Blanco, there being no evidential basis for the principles in that case or any related authority to have any application, I am not persuaded that the sentencing judge’s failure to refer to the effluxion of three years and what was said to be the applicant’s reaction to it, constitutes error, there being no principled basis for the delay in this case to have attracted any measure of leniency.
	
	
	I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

2701944,R v Gordon (No 5) [2016] NSWSC 315,"EX TeMPORE Judgment (REVISED)


	
	An issue in this case is how trace DNA of the accused and to some extent of the deceased came to be on a large 21 kilogram rock and indeed particular aspects of that rock that the Crown says the jury should accept was the murder weapon.
	
	
	Senior Constable Vercoe, a Crime Scene Officer since 2010, who carried out, in conjunction with others, the crime scene process of preserving the evidence on 7 November 2013, is giving evidence. In the course of that evidence she has described the procedures she usually adopts, indeed she says she invariably adopts, by way of donning and changing personal protective equipment during the process of collecting the evidence for its preservation.
	
	
	Part of the evidence involves the frequent changing of gloves and between what I will describe as major events, the changing of the whole protective outfit from top to toe.
	
	
	She is asked by the learned Crown Prosecutor whether she knows why those procedures, which are detailed in internal police protocols or practices, are adopted and applied. Mr Watts of counsel has objected to that question. He has objected to it essentially on two bases. First he challenges the expertise of the witness to answer the question and secondly argues that any expertise in regard to the secondary transfer of trace DNA is at such a low level that its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused and that under s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), I am required by law to refuse to admit the evidence, that is to say it is not a matter of discretion.
	
	
	Senior Constable Vercoe has given evidence on the voir dire, she has told me, and for present purposes I accept this evidence (there was no challenge to it) that when she first commenced as a Crime Scene Officer she underwent a two week course of basic training in the procedures that were to be adopted in the performance of the type of work that she has described in this case. That course was carried out at a police facility and also at a Fire and Rescue facility. She says that although the precise details are, understandably, hazy she received training in the importance of following the procedures because of the risk of contamination of exhibits.
	
	
	She also said that she, from time to time, received continuing training by attending other courses and that whenever there was an update to the Crime Scene Procedures on the police intranet, she would assiduously read those changes.
	
	
	The learned Crown Prosecutor has tendered exhibit VD1 which is a field hazard aide memoire of two pages. It states in part that a following table is designed to assist officers in identifying and managing hazards that may be present at particular scenes. It goes on to expand on that basic statement of purpose and sets out in tabular form a list of potential hazards and the protective action available.
	
	
	Although I have not been taken through it in detail and I have only for the purpose of giving this ex tempore decision been able to look at it quickly, it seems to me that the table and the minimum standards chart which forms the second page do not in terms address the theory behind the procedures to be adopted and indeed the general thrust seems to be personal protection of the officer.
	
	
	However, in relation to the hazard presented at crime scenes by blood, body fluids, etcetera, it recommends the taking of certain action, which as I read it, seems to be the donning of disposable protective equipment or clothing. There is a reference to stepping plates, decontamination and personal hygiene. With respect, it is difficult for me to understand that as a reference to the risk of cross-contamination of exhibits, other than the need for the officer to take steps to ensure that she is not contaminated.
	
	
	There are different levels of expertise. In effect, although not framed this way, the question asked the witness to express an opinion based upon her course of study, training and experience for the purpose of s 79 of The Evidence Act. 
	
	
	She is undertaking a degree which she is yet to complete but one does not need to have a university qualification to be an expert entitled to express opinions for the purpose of s79 of The Evidence Act. The words of the statute talk about specialised knowledge based on the person’s training, study or experience. The use of the word “or” in its conjunctive sense suggests that anyone of those matters or all of them together can give rise to specialised knowledge. There is no doubt that Senior Constable Vercoe at a certain level has specialised knowledge and accordingly could express opinions relevant to the existence of facts in issue substantially based upon it.
	
	
	The three conditions of the admissibility of expert opinion are relevance; the possession of specialised knowledge; and demonstration that the opinion expressed is substantially based upon that specialised knowledge.
	
	
	I have already set out the relevance of the evidence sought to be adduced. I am of the view that the witness has a degree of specialised knowledge and accordingly opinions substantially based upon that specialised knowledge are admissible. The issue though I think really is the nature of the specialised knowledge. When asked in cross-examination by Mr Watts whether she had received any training, and I understood the question to be put in general terms, meaning as at any time, in the secondary transfer of trace DNA, the witness said “I don’t recall”. It seems to me that if training of that technical nature had been given she would remember because she has impressed me, so far anyway, as a careful police officer.
	
	
	It seems to me that she could not give any evidence about that particular scientific matter, because it is beyond her specialised knowledge and accordingly opinions expressed could not be said to be substantially based upon it. I certainly think that her specialised knowledge would allow her to say that from her training and ongoing experience she is aware of the risk of cross-contamination of exhibits, and is aware that that is the reason for the adoption of the procedures she has described and her observance of them. That evidence, I think subject to s 137, would be admissible. But she should not be permitted to give evidence directly related to the question in issue here, which is specifically about the secondary transfer of trace DNA.
	
	
	I turn then to the question of the application of s 137 of the Evidence Act. In criminal cases, especially serious criminal cases to be decided by a jury of 12 lay people, the danger of unfair prejudice to an accused really consists of the risk that the jury might from something about the nature of an item of evidence misuse that evidence if admitted through misunderstanding, or overstatement, of its importance, relevance or authority, matters going to its reliability.
	
	
	Now, it may be relevant for the witness to say she is aware that these procedures are followed to avoid the risk of cross-contamination, or contamination, of exhibits simpliciter. However there is a real possibility that the jury could over-estimate the importance of that evidence in circumstances where the real question is whether the Crown have excluded as a reasonable possibility the secondary transfer of trace DNA in particular from one area of enquiry to another.
	
	
	Given what I regard as Senior Constable Vercoe’s relatively, with no disrespect intended, low level of expertise on these matters, I am satisfied that the probative value of what she can say about this matter is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant because she is not qualified to address the particular scientific enquiry at issue in this case. I reject the question.

	Kreidies Management Group Pty Ltd operated a heavy vehicle, comprising a prime mover and a trailer, which, on 1 November 2012, was driven on a road in breach of a “dimension requirement” contrary to s 56 of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 (since repealed, now Road Transport (Vehicle and Driver Management) Act 2005 (NSW)). The requirement which was breached was that the vehicle, including its load of scrap metal, exceeded the applicable height limit. The truck struck the overheight bar inside the entrance of the M5 East Tunnel at Mascot and caused considerable damage, including the closure of the tunnel westbound for about 14 hours, obviously substantially disrupting traffic.
	
	
	The proceedings in this Court were commenced by summons under the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 ­(NSW) seeking a finding that the defendant contravened the relevant provisions and be dealt with according to law for the commission of this offence and orders for costs and compensation. When the matter came on for hearing the defendant, following submissions about some aspects of the evidence, changed its original position, which was to plead not guilty, to a plea of guilty. Accordingly, I entered a conviction in accordance with the summons and the proceedings were adjourned to enable facts to be agreed and certain other matters relevant to sentence to be clarified.
	


The facts


	
	As mentioned these were the subject of an agreement which was tendered. The following details are drawn essentially from this document. On 31 October 2012 the defendant, which had a contract with Sims Group Australia Holdings Limited for the transport of scrap steel, was engaged to collect a consignment of scrap steel from Delta Pty Ltd at Bourke Road, Alexandria for transport by road to Sims’ yard at St Marys (a distance of about 60 kms) on 1 November 2012. The job was allocated by the defendant’s manager to Mr Omar Kreidie, a driver employed by it. On 1 November 2012, as instructed, he drove the heavy vehicle combination comprising a prime mover and two trailers to Sims’ premises in Alexandria to collect the consignment. The trailers were loaded with scrap steel by Mr Aldhayvi, an employee of a company, Mad Transport Pty Ltd, which was subcontracted to Delta. At about 9.30am the loaded vehicle, on the way to St Marys via the M5 East Expressway, struck and dislodged the overheight steel beam about 10 metres inside the Tunnel. The beam was set at a height of between 4.68 metres and 4.7 metres above the roadway. Inspectors from the Roads and Maritime Services NSW attended the scene and, amongst other things, measured the combination with its load at 4.97 metres high. The height of the load was reduced by cutting the scrap steel and the combination could then be removed from the tunnel.
	
	
	The height limit applicable to the combination was 4.3 metres (as a permit exempting it from the dimension requirement had not been issued).
	
	
	The driver was interviewed by RMS inspectors and, amongst other things, stated that he had checked the height of the combination by driving under a 4.3 metre beam at the Delta yard but did not use any other method to check it. He said the size and tailgates of the trailer are used to secure the load, usually weighed down by placing cars or heavy steel on top of the scrap but he thought the Delta yard had run out of these items so that the load sprung up during the trip which it is always liable to do, sometimes breaking the chains which hold it down. He had not noticed any flashing warning lights on his approach to the tunnel which diverted overheight vehicles away from the entrance but, as I understand it, he believed that his vehicle was not over height. The defendant’s manager, Mr Salahddine Kreidie, informed the inspectors that he had allocated the job but had not given any instructions to check the height of the load because the driver knew what the legal height was and “has been doing it every day”. For the same reason he did not need to give him any instructions on restraining the load. The driver was not provided with any equipment to measure the load, which is simply estimated from the known height of the prime mover and trailers. As it happened, on the day after the incident, inspectors attended Delta’s premises in Alexandria and were told that there was no 4.3 metre beam for heavy vehicles to pass under before departing the site.
	


The defendant’s response


	
	The manager gave evidence, apologising on behalf of the company for all of the damage and inconvenience caused by the incident. The company policy and safety manual in operation at the time of the offence specifically prohibited driving any of the company trucks in tunnels. After the incident he asked the driver why he had used the tunnel and was told that he was running late and heard of an accident on an alternative route so he detoured to go through the tunnel on that day. Mr Kreidie’s father (the defendant’s sole director and shareholder) was very upset by the accident, which affected his health adversely. The driver was disciplined by being stood down for a time. He has been warned that if the company rules are broken again he will be permanently dismissed.
	
	
	The defendant runs about 15 trucks, but Sims has been reducing its use of the company, in part because of the tunnel claim. It has instituted supervision methods to ensure that this kind of incident does not happen again, including navigation devices operating in real time and now requires input of height and weight dimensions. Mr Kreidie pointed out that this particular load was placed on the truck at a customer’s yard not that of Sims and the customer did not have facilities for checking heights or for cages and harnesses to use a forklift to ensure the load is secure before the truck went onto the road. There were commercial pressures to increase the tonnage and so load the scrap metal directly to the combing rail of the trailer, which then allowed the scrap metal to exceed the appropriate height where there was nothing to impede its movement. This has now been changed so that the load is under the combing rail. This reduces the tonnage able to be carried by about 10 per cent and, since the company is paid by tonnage, also reduces its price for transport.
	
	
	This is the first offence which involves an incident in a road tunnel in over 15 years that the company has been in business. There had previously been severe breaches of dimensions offences having to do with width when the bins would sometimes belly out but bigger trailers of different design have corrected this problem.
	
	
	I am satisfied that management of the defendant genuinely regretted the incident itself, has acknowledged the seriousness of the offence and has taken appropriate steps, at some significant commercial cost, to ensure that nothing of this kind occurs again.
	


Sentence


	
	Under s 37(3) of the Act, the lower limit applicable to a “severe risk breach” of a height limit is 300mm over the maximum permissible dimension limit of 4.3m. In this case, it follows that the present breach is a severe risk breach (by definition) because the relevant combination was 4.97m high when it was measured in the tunnel, thus exceeding the relevant height limit by 670mm. Mr Cahill of counsel for the plaintiff submitted that exceeding the lower limit applicable to a severe risk breach increases the gravity of the offence. The defendant has some prior relevant convictions which I have already mentioned but not in respect of height. The applicable maximum penalty is 500 penalty units or $55,000: s 59 of the Act – column 5.
	
	
	The Act provides for particular matters to be taken into account –
	


Section 60(2)(c)

…

(2) In determining the sanctions (including the level of fine) that are to be imposed in respect of breaches of mass, dimension or load restraint requirements, a court is to take into consideration the classification of the breach under this Part and, having regard to that classification, the following matters:

…

(c) severe risk breaches involve one or more of the following:

(i) an appreciable risk of harm to public safety or the environment,

(ii) a serious risk of accelerated road wear,

(iii) a serious risk of harm to road infrastructure,

(iv) a serious risk of increased traffic congestion,

(v) a serious risk of diminished public amenity,

(vi) a serious risk of unfair commercial advantage.

 


	
	The direct consequences of the overheight vehicle being driven into the tunnel included the damage to the tunnel infrastructure, the need to disconnect services to the tunnel and make extensive repairs entailing the closure of the tunnel for about 14 hours. Although it was the accident here which gave rise to the damage caused by the overheight loading, it is important not to treat this, as it were, as happenstance caused by the need for the driver to change his route. Even if no accident had occurred, the potential for damage was present and the specified serious risks, to a greater or lesser extent, would have remained. Those risks are objective features of the offending which must be reflected in the sentence. It is nevertheless fair to observe that avoiding the tunnel (obligatory under the defendant’s manual) would have lessened risks 2(c)(ii),(iii),(iv) and (v), though they were not obviated.
	
	
	Although the lack of an appropriate measuring device at the point of load was a significant departure from what, as a minimum, safe procedures required, this was not the only problem. It may well be that the load did not exceed the stipulated height when the combination left the yard but that the characteristic and known likely springing of the scrap metal occurred as the truck was moving. Indeed, I think this is the likely course of events since I would be prepared to accept that the driver could, within reasonable limits, have accurately assessed the height of the combination after it had been loaded and did so, although of course not with the accuracy which an appropriate measuring device would have afforded. The fact that he knew of the spring effect meant there was an element of risk taking both on his part and that of management in the sense that it took no steps to effectively deal with that issue.
	
	
	It is agreed that s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) applies to sentencing the defendant for the present offence. In particular, s 21A(2)(g) of the Act provides that the damage flowing from the defendant’s breach is to be taken into account as a matter of aggravation. Although the offence is described as a “severe risk breach” (by way of definition) the actual seriousness of the breach is a distinct matter and needs to be separately assessed, reflecting what actually occurred. In this respect, Mr Cahill points to the fact that the load was to be transported at a distance of approximately 65km by way of travel on major arterial roads which happened to include, on the day in question, the M5 East Motorway. It is clear that, despite the likelihood that a load of scrap metal will move upwards during travel, especially if there were no countervailing weights placed on it (such as motor vehicles or heavy steel beams), there were no procedures in place that permitted the driver to actually measure the height of the load or authorise him to reduce the load so that, even with an upward shift, it would not exceed the relevant height limits. It is also fair to say that the defendant failed to provide the driver with appropriate loading instructions. The prohibition concerning travel in tunnels is an obvious precaution but the dangers of driving an overheight combination on the busy arterial roads of Sydney is obviously dangerous. It was, in substance, conceded by the general manager in his evidence that the corrective steps presently utilised could, and indeed should, have been in operation considerably before the incident here occurred. Furthermore, but for the accident, it seems likely that the defendant would have continued to avoid its responsibilities so far as height restrictions are concerned and the driver would have continued to carry excessive loads until some other incident occurred to bring this conduct to an end.
	
	
	Mr Cahill rightly submits that in this context, general deterrence is an important factor: see Kemp v Air Liquide Australia Ltd [2014] NSWSC 1200 per Garling J at [10], [81] – [82]. Other companies must be deterred from continuing with inappropriate and dangerous practices in the hope that accidents can be avoided by specifying routes drivers are to take. Mr Cahill also contends that, although the defendant continues to transport scrap metal by road within the State, there is no evidence that it has taken steps to obtain relevant engineering advice regarding the loading, compaction and restraint of the loads, which raises a risk of reoffending. As to this, I am satisfied from the evidence of the general manager that appropriate steps have been taken to ensure that the prescribed height dimensions are complied with. He was not cross-examined to suggest that further engineering advice might be useful and this is not a matter upon which I am disposed to speculate.
	
	
	The plea of guilty is to be taken into account, not only as evidence of contrition but also for its utilitarian benefit. Here, as I have outlined, the plea of guilty was made on the first day of the hearing, after the clarification of certain factual and legal issues. Nevertheless, some benefit arose from this change of approach. In the circumstances I consider that a 10 per cent discount is appropriate. I am satisfied that the defendant is unlikely to reoffend and has taken rehabilitative action, which are mitigating factors both generally and by reference to s 21A(3)(g) and (h) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I am also satisfied that the defendant has accepted responsibility, through its management, for its actions and has acknowledged the injury, loss or damage caused by the breach (see s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act).
	
	
	Sims was fined $3000 (following a discount of 25 per cent for its early plea) whilst Delta was fined $6000 with the same discount.
	
	
	In my view, the appropriate fine is $8,000 which, when reduced by the discount for pleading guilty, comes down to $7,200.
	
	
	Section 210 of the Road Transport (General) Act provides for the making of a “roads compensation order” in respect of damage to road infrastructure by a breach. The overall cost of repairs as certified pursuant to s 202 of the Act is just under $222,000. Both Sims (as consignor) and Delta (as loader) pleaded guilty to contraventions respectively of s 53 and s 55 of the Act and consented to the making of roads compensation orders against them upon entry of conviction, against the former for $55,494.85 and the latter $66,593.85. The balance of $99,890.75 is sought by way of a roads compensation order against the defendant, which has consented to it. The driver of the vehicle pleaded guilty to contravening s 57 of the Act, was convicted and fined $2,250 plus professional costs of $1,200. A roads compensation order was not sought against him.
	


Costs


	
	It is agreed that the costs payable pursuant to s 214 of the Act in relation to the roads compensation order should be $60,000 and, in relation to the prosecution, the sum of $15,000.
	
	
	Accordingly I make the following orders –
	



	
	The defendant is convicted.
	
	
	The defendant is fined the sum of $7,200.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 257B of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) in relation to the offence contrary to s 56 of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 (NSW) the defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff’s costs in the sum of $15,000.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 210 of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 (NSW) order that the defendant pay to Roads and Maritime Services compensation in the sum of $99,890.75 for the damage to road infrastructure, namely the road and M5 Tunnel infrastructure, incurred by Roads and Maritime Services as a consequence of the commission of the offence.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 214 of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 (NSW) the defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff’s costs in the sum of $60,000.

2701970,Daniels v R [2016] NSWCCA 35,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Fullerton J.
	
	
	FULLERTON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by Lerve DCJ on 20 November 2014 following his plea of guilty in the Local Court to one count of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm contrary to s 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	That offence attracts a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of 4 years is specified under Division 1, Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	After taking into account the applicant’s plea of guilty, and upon making a finding of special circumstances, the sentencing judge imposed a non-parole period of 3 years with a balance of term of 18 months to be served partially concurrently with the balance of parole for a sentence imposed by Syme DCJ on 15 February 2012 for an aggravated break and enter with intent to commit the indictable offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Her Honour’s sentencing remarks were before the sentencing judge.
	
	
	Following his arrest for the index offence in the early hours of the morning of 22 December 2013, the applicant’s parole was revoked. He was serving the balance of parole at the time of sentence.
	


The facts for sentencing purposes


	
	The applicant had been drinking at a hotel in Dubbo with friends for some hours on 21 December 2013 before he was ejected by security staff some time after midnight for throwing a drink. On leaving the hotel he approached a young man and, apparently in the mistaken belief that he had assaulted a friend of his inside the hotel earlier in the evening, the applicant delivered a single punch to the young man’s jaw without warning and under significant force. In fact, the victim had not been inside the hotel at any time that evening. After dining at a local restaurant with friends, the victim had gone to the hotel to meet his girlfriend but had been refused entry due to a “lock out” imposed by hotel security. He was waiting for a taxi when the applicant struck him. The victim fell immediately to the ground, bleeding heavily, while the applicant maintained a fighting posture. A number of security guards intervened and physically restrained the applicant. He was arrested by police a short distance from the scene.
	
	
	The incident was recorded on closed circuit television. The recording was tendered on sentence.
	
	
	The victim was taken by ambulance to Dubbo Base Hospital where he was treated for a fractured mandible and malocclusion of the upper and lower teeth. On referral to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgical Registrar at Westmead Hospital the following day, he underwent surgery involving the open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture with the application of bone plates and screws to maintain the alignment of his jaw. The plates and screws will be left in situ permanently.
	
	
	In February 2014, the Registrar reviewed the victim’s injuries and reported that although there was no permanent functional impairment to his jaw or any disfigurement from the injuries, he complained of residual paresthesia to the lower lip.
	
	
	In a victim impact statement tendered by the Crown on sentence and dated 12 June 2014, the victim reported that following the assault he also required specialist dental treatment with the potential need for future treatment. He also reported that he was hypervigilant in his work as a farm labourer because of his injuries and that he had voluntarily withdrawn from the sporting activities he had previously enjoyed.
	


The applicant’s subjective case


	
	The applicant gave evidence at the sentencing hearing and was cross-examined with the Crown questioning the extent of his insight into his offending and its impact on the victim. He was asked a number of questions by the sentencing judge querying his assertion that the assault was “out of character”.
	
	
	The applicant also relied upon reports from Dr Olav Nielssen, a forensic psychiatrist, and a number of certificates showing his successful completion of a number of programs in custody. (I note that the applicant also told Dr Nielssen that it would be out of character for him to hit someone for no reason.)
	
	
	Dr Nielssen reported as follows:
	


The diagnosis of substance use disorder is made on the basis of [the applicant's] account of regular hazardous drinking from the age of fourteen and during adult life, and the    complications of alcohol use, including the role of alcohol intoxication in this offence and in previous offences.


	
	His Honour found that the applicant enjoyed substantial family support, having heard evidence form the applicant’s mother and partner on the unsuccessful application brought under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which preceded the sentencing hearing. It would appear that his Honour was invited to have regard to their evidence for sentencing purposes.
	
	
	Although his Honour found the applicant had a number of “mental health issues” (Dr Nielssen also reported the applicant suffered from ADHD), he was not satisfied that this was causally related to his offending. There is no challenge to that finding.
	
	
	Despite the applicant’s stated determination to do something about his alcohol abuse upon his eventual release, his Honour was unable to find that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation or that he was unlikely to reoffend. His Honour did accept that the applicant was remorseful.
	


The objective seriousness of the offence, including aggravating factors in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act


	
	After taking into account the force of the punch, the fact that it was entirely unprovoked and the nature of the victim’s injuries, the sentencing judge assessed the objective seriousness of the offending as within the mid range. There is no challenge to that finding.
	
	
	In considering s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, his Honour had regard to the applicant’s criminal record, which included entries for violent offending in 2011 in addition to the offence committed in February 2012 for which he was serving the balance of parole. His Honour also noted the similarities in the commission of that offence and the index offence, in particular that both victims were intentionally targeted by the applicant as deserving of retaliatory violence when they were in fact innocent of any wrongdoing, and that on both occasions the applicant was heavily intoxicated. The applicant was on bail for another offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm at the time of the offending the subject of the sentence imposed by Syme DCJ. That offence was also committed under the influence of alcohol.
	
	
	The sentencing judge resisted finding that the principles in Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 were enlivened, but was satisfied, to the criminal standard, that the statutory aggravating factors in s 21A(2)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (a previous conviction including a conviction for a serious personal violence offence) and s 21A(2)(d) (an offence committed on conditional liberty) were made out.
	


The grounds of appeal


	
	The applicant relied upon three grounds of appeal.
	
	
	The second ground related to an order made by the sentencing judge in purported exercise of the power in s 50(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, that upon the applicant’s release to parole he enter into a residential rehabilitation program and obey all reasonable directions of the Department of Community Corrections as to his ongoing treatment and counseling for alcohol abuse. The sentencing judge treated the residence condition as a form of quasi-custody which, together with what he saw as the need for the applicant to submit to intensive supervision for his abuse of alcohol, attracted a finding of special circumstances. The statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of term specified in s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act was adjusted to 66 per cent. On the appeal it was accepted that was a generous finding.
	
	
	In the course of his sentencing remarks, his Honour noted that Syme DCJ had also found special circumstances when sentencing the applicant in February 2012, principally because of his relative youth (he was then aged 19) and what her Honour found was a need for supervision on his release. In sentencing the applicant to a non-parole period of 18 months, Syme DCJ recommended that the applicant enter a full-time residential program to address his abuse of alcohol on his release to parole. It would appear he did not do so. There was evidence before the sentencing judge that the applicant’s participation in various custody-based programs prior to his release to parole was marred by what were referred to as “attitude problems”.
	
	
	Although the imposition of the residence condition was directed to ensuring that the applicant address his continued abuse of alcohol under the close supervision inherent in a residential rehabilitation program, in imposing the residence condition as part of the sentencing order his Honour acted beyond power. Under ss 50 and 51 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the power to impose parole conditions is confined to sentences of 3 years imprisonment or less. In the case of sentences exceeding 3 years, the imposition of parole conditions are matters solely for the Parole Authority (see Webster v R [2006] NSWCCA 346 at [14]; Wilson v R [2008] NSWCCA 245 at [29]; Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [4]).
	
	
	The error is conceded by the Crown.
	
	
	In the applicant’s written submissions, the Court was invited to set aside the parole condition as being beyond power - the approach taken by the Court in Moss v R [2011] NSWCCA 86. On the hearing of the appeal, the question arose as to whether the error should nonetheless to be characterised as a sentencing error, invoking the operation of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	
	
	It is accepted that upon a finding of sentencing error this Court is obligated to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh before determining whether no other sentence is warranted in law (the positive opinion provided for in s 6(3) – see Kentwell v R [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601).
	
	
	However, as the High Court recognised at [42], not all errors in the sentencing of offenders will vitiate the exercise of the sentencer’s discretion:
	


… A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ""warranted in law"" unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is not to say that all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer's discretion. By way of example, s 44(1) of the Sentencing Act requires the court when sentencing an offender to imprisonment to first set the non-parole period and then set the balance of the term. Prior to 1 February 2003, a court was required to first set the term of the sentence and then specify the non-parole period. A court which sentences an offender to imprisonment after 1 February 2003 by first setting the term of the sentence commits legal error. Without more, the error does not affect the exercise of the sentencer's discretion.


	
	In my view, the error in the sentencing exercise the subject of the second ground of appeal is an example of an error of the kind to which the High Court in Kentwell was referring. After setting aside the parole condition (it being of no legal effect being made beyond power), the sentencing judge’s appointment of a non-parole period of 3 years as the minimum period the applicant is to spend in custody is unaffected. Although his Honour clearly intended that the applicant’s release at the expiration of three years should be subject to the further condition that he be willing to comply with the restrictions on his liberty that would result from his participation in a residential rehabilitation program, it was also treated as a special circumstance for the purposes s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act giving the applicant the benefit of a shorter period in full-time custody.
	
	
	I do not regard the error in imposing a parole condition as part of the sentencing order as vitiating the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion in this case. I would order that the parole condition be set aside but I would not move to re-sentence the applicant.
	
	
	The two remaining grounds of appeal concern what is said to be the sentencing judge’s failure to have regard to the applicant’s background (the first ground of appeal), including his exposure to alcohol from a young age, and the imposition of a sentence which was otherwise manifestly excessive (the third ground of appeal).
	


The first ground of appeal


	
	The applicant contends that the sentencing judge failed to have regard to two features of his subjective case, each of which should have attracted weight in the sentencing exercise in mitigation of sentence.
	
	
	The first concerned an incident when the applicant was a young child, aged three or four. The applicant’s mother gave evidence of an occasion when she woke to find a stranger holding her son in his arms after which she noticed changes in the manner and the content of his speech. There was no further reference to the incident in the evidence called on the applicant’s behalf on sentence, nor was it a matter raised with Dr Nielssen (cf the report of Kathryn Wakely, forensic psychologist, also tendered in the proceedings before Syme DCJ, where she opined that the applicant did not appear concerned about the incident).
	
	
	Given the paucity of the evidence bearing on the incident and any evidence of sequalae of any relevant kind, I am not persuaded that the sentencing judge was in error by failing to refer to the incident. Furthermore, I am unable to see how it merited any weight in his Honour’s assessment of the applicant's subjective case for sentencing purposes.
	
	
	The second matter related to evidence of the applicant's exposure to alcohol as a teenager. The applicant gave evidence, and reported to Dr Nielssen, that he started drinking at the age 14 in his uncle's company, becoming drunk several times a week. He said this encouraged him to regard drinking alcohol to a point of intoxication as acceptable. His mother confirmed that the applicant started drinking when he was an adolescent and that his drinking had become problematic from that time.
	
	
	On the appeal it was submitted that the applicant’s teenage drinking had the effect of impacting adversely on him in his formative years, attracting application of the principles espoused by the plurality of the High Court in Bugmy v R [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 [40] and [42]-[44].
	
	
	This case is readily distinguishable from the extent of social and family disadvantage that prevailed in Bugmy and other decisions of this Court where the principles in Bugmy have since been applied (see Ingrey v R [2016] NSWCCA 31).
	
	
	Aside from the evidence of teenage drinking with an extended family member perhaps being suggestive of a permissive approach to underage drinking by the applicant’s parents, the applicant’s family life was stable and supportive. There was no family violence and no drug use or alcohol abuse by immediate family members; neither were there family or social influences creating a milieu in which criminal conduct or other antisocial conduct was either encouraged or not appropriately disciplined. The evidence also established that the applicant was educated to Year 11 where, on his own assessment, he was an above average student and had secured full-time employment in various capacities after leaving school.
	
	
	In short, aside from his progressive and apparently largely unchecked abuse of alcohol throughout his young adolescence through to his late teens and early 20s, including whilst he was living in the family home, there was no evidence of any deprivation in his home or social circumstances (still less any of the profound deprivation with which the High Court was invited to deal in Bugmy or that this Court was invited to consider in Ingrey) which would reduce the applicant’s moral culpability for his offending or the need for general deterrence to be reflected in the sentence to be imposed.
	
	
	Counsel also submitted that the applicant’s abuse of alcohol from a young age was such that it should be regarded as a factor mitigating the seriousness of his offending. In support of that submission, the Court was referred to a passage in R v Todorovic [2008] NSWCCA 49 at [58] where RS Hulme J observed that although this Court, in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346, rejected the proposition that addiction to drugs should be regarded as a mitigating factor on sentence, there might be exceptional cases were an offender’s youth, or other circumstances over which the offender had no control and which predisposed an offender to drug abuse, might ameliorate a sentence as an exception to the general rule that drug addiction is not a mitigating factor.
	
	
	I am not persuaded, by parity of reasoning with his Honour’s observations in Todorovic or otherwise, that the applicant’s teenage drinking is exceptional in duration or degree, or that there is any principled basis upon which the applicant could have invited the sentencing judge to afford him any particular leniency because of his alcohol use, even if, as seems implicit in the submission, his underage drinking might have predisposed him to commit offences of violence.
	
	
	The fact that the two discrete matters the subject of this ground of appeal were referred to by counsel who appeared on sentence, and even accepting that they might have provided some historical context in which the applicant’s offending occurred or which might have shed some light on the applicant’s subjective circumstances, including Dr Nielssen’s diagnosis of a substance abuse disorder, that did not obligate the sentencing judge to refer to each of those matters in terms; neither does his failure to do so reflect error.
	
	
	The consideration given by the sentencing judge to the applicant’s subjective circumstances as a whole, and the various matters urged on the applicant’s behalf, is evident in his Honour’s sentencing reasons, as is the weight he gave to the applicant’s entrenched alcohol use in the sentence imposed and what his Honour was satisfied was his desire for treatment, including the generous finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	I would reject the first ground of appeal.
	


The third ground of appeal


	
	The principles that are to be applied when a sentence is said to be manifestly excessive are well settled. This Court will only intervene where the Court is satisfied, having regard to the sentence imposed, that there must have been some misapplication of principle or discretionary error in the sentencing exercise, even if the error may not be apparent from the sentencing reasons. That the sentencing judge might have taken a different course, or that an appellate judge would have done so, will not be sufficient (see Lowndes v R [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665). 
	
	
	Even where the sentence under challenge is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases, unless the degree of difference is such that the appellate Court is driven to the conclusion that there must have been some misapplication of principle, intervention is not justified (see R v Pham [2015] HCA 39 per French CJ, Keane and Nettle JJ at [28]). Manifest excess is made out when, after consideration is given to all of the matters that are relevant to fixing the sentence, the Court concludes that the sentence imposed is ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"" (see Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [59]-[60] applying Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321).
	


Consideration 


	
	The applicant relied upon a number of features of his offending which he submitted would satisfy this Court that the sentence imposed was excessive, particularly when reviewed against what are said to be five comparable cases - two at first instance in the District Court and three in this Court (see the attached schedule extracted from the Crown’s written submissions). Those features included what counsel described as the delivery of a single punch in an unplanned and impulsive assault which did not result in the infliction of serious or permanent injury.
	
	
	For the applicant’s counsel to seek to distinguish the offending in this case from a worst case of offending against s 35(2) of the Crimes Act, referable only to the injury the applicant inflicted being not as serious as in other cases to which the Court was referred, is wrong in principle. While the seriousness of the injury is an important consideration in an assessment of objective seriousness, and while the authorities recognise that the more serious the harm the more serious the offence (see the discussion in Kiernan v R [2016] NSWCCA 12 at [33] where malicious wounding causing grievous bodily harm and wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm were described as “result offences”), the circumstances in which the injury is inflicted, including the reason for it and the manner of its infliction, are also relevant considerations (see McCullough v R [2009] NSWCCA 94; 194 A Crim R 439).
	
	
	In this case, the applicant’s unprovoked attack on an entirely innocent bystander who had the legitimate expectation of being able to socialise with friends on a Saturday night without any fear for his safety from random alcohol-fuelled violence was properly taken into account by the sentencing judge. It was this feature that prompted his Honour to endorse the observations of Bellew J in Mansour v R; Hughes v R [2013] NSWCCA 35 at [47]:
	


The victim had a legitimate expectation that he would be able to socialise with his friends at a nightclub without being subjected to acts of violence of the kind her Honour described. As her Honour pointed out, the attack was perpetrated upon the victim in total disregard of his entitlement to a sense of security and personal safety, and was one which left him with a number of physical and psychological injuries. Despite her Honour's assessment that those injuries fell at the lower end of the relevant scale, they were nevertheless significant, as was the offending overall.


	
	Counsel also placed reliance on the applicant having pleaded guilty, having expressed remorse, and that his prospects of rehabilitation were “not hopeless” as a point of relevant distinction between the other cases to which the Court was referred. In each case to which the applicant referred, sentence was imposed following a plea of guilty, some of which were accompanied by findings of remorse. In other cases the Court noted a criminal history including offences of violence.
	
	
	While each of those factors were not unimportant in the sentencing exercise, they were either implicitly or expressly accounted for in the exercise of his Honour’s sentencing discretion. In the consideration given to the first ground of appeal, I noted that there was nothing in the applicant’s subjective case generally that was deserving of any particular leniency. Given the applicant’s evidence at the sentencing hearing, and his criminal antecedents over a concentrated period of years, in my view, his Honour’s reservations about the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were well founded.
	
	
	Significantly, as the Crown emphasised, in none of the cases relied on by the applicant was the offence committed whilst the offender was on parole, let alone on parole for a similar offence of violence.
	
	
	The applicant’s survey of cases fails to demonstrate manifest error in the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion.
	
	
	Although not relied upon as a separate ground of appeal, the applicant also submitted that the manifestly excessive sentence may also be the result of his Honour having given undue weight to the policy considerations underpinning mandatory sentencing in relation to ""one punch"" homicides or that, at the very least, he overemphasised the need to denounce alcohol-fuelled violence in this case. I see nothing in his Honour’s sentencing remarks or in the sentence imposed to support either proposition.
	
	
	His Honour was entitled to regard the delivery of a punch to the victim’s jaw under force, causing him to fall immediately to the ground, of considerable weight in the sentencing exercise despite the fact that, fortunately for the victim, a more serious injury did not result. The denunciation of alcohol-fuelled violence can form part of the sentencing exercise particularly, although not exclusively, in the context of single blow manslaughter cases (see Hopley v R [2008] NSWCCA 105 at [46]; R v Carroll [2010] NSWCCA 55; 77 NSWLR 45 at [60]-[61]; Pattalis v R [2013] NSWCCA 171 at [23]; R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120; 243 A Crim R 31 at [100]-110]).
	
	
	Finally, the interplay of the two statutory aggravating factors in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, and the standard non-parole period of 4 years operating as a guidepost in the sentencing exercise, together with the need for specific deterrence to have featured in the appointment of sentence, cannot be overlooked.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, I am not persuaded that a non-parole period of 3 years with a balance of term of 18 months is manifestly excessive.
	
	
	I would dismiss the third ground of appeal.
	


Orders


	
	The orders I would propose are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal is granted.
	
	
	The order of Lerve DCJ made on 20 November 2014 that the applicant’s parole at the expiration of the non-parole period be supervised and that it be subject to the condition that he enter into and remain within a full-time residential rehabilitation facility until his treatment and counselling for alcohol abuse is completed is set aside.
	
	
	The appeal against the sentence imposed is otherwise dismissed.
	



	
	RS HULME AJ: I agree with Fullerton J.
	
	
	I would add this. Compared with either the maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment or the standard non-parole period of 4 years imprisonment the starting point, before discount for plea, of 6 years adopted by his Honour was heavy, particularly for an offence that was unpremeditated and that resulted in grievous bodily harm substantially less serious than much falling within the section of the Crimes Act 1900 against which the Applicant offended. However, he was on parole at the time and his record demonstrated that more weight than usual should be given to specific deterrence and protection of the community.
	
	
	Furthermore, while fully conscious of the decision of the High Court in Kentwell v R to which Fullerton J has referred, I am satisfied that in no way was any other aspect of the sentence affected adversely to the Applicant by his Honour’s unauthorised imposition of a parole condition.

2701977,R v Maybir (No 8) [2016] NSWSC 166,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Kodi Maybir is to be sentenced for the murder of a 7 year old boy at Oatley in May 2013. He was found guilty by a jury of this dreadful crime and has either pleaded guilty or been found guilty of a variety of other offences.
	


Identification of the deceased child


	
	The provisions in Pt 2 Div 3A of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW) have the effect of prohibiting the publication of the name of the deceased child so as to prevent his identification. I raised with the parties the question whether this would prevent the publication of the child's first name. I did so because I am concerned that it would be disrespectful to his memory to completely anonymise him. Given that he does not share the surname of the offender, or his mother, and his siblings (who now live in another country) will be referred to by pseudonym to protect their identity, I am satisfied that it would be permissible to refer to the child by his first name, Levai. Both parties have concurred with my taking this approach.

Facts


	
	Before setting out the facts relating to the offences I should indicate that I am aware that any finding that is adverse to an offender must be made to the standard of beyond reasonable doubt: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at [27].
	


Overview


	
	At 6.12 am on 21 May 2013 a triple 0 call was made by Ms Kayla James requesting an ambulance to attend to her 7 year old son, Levai, at premises in Mulga Road, Oatley. The ambulance officers arrived a short time later and examined Levai. He was deceased and appeared to have been so for some time.
	
	
	An autopsy examination revealed that Levai had died as a result of blunt force trauma to the back of the head with resulting subdural bleeding and swelling of the brain.
	
	
	Ms James had three children, Levai, AB (aged 5) and CB (aged 4). She had been in a relationship with Mr Maybir for the past 4 months. For a lot of that time they lived at Mr Maybir's music studio in a small commercial suburban complex of shops and offices. It comprised a foyer, two large rooms, and a small storeroom and kitchenette. There were no windows and no bathroom or toilet facilities in the studio.
	
	
	It was the Crown case that Mr Maybir inflicted the blunt force trauma that resulted in Levai's death. How he did so remains a complete mystery. Only Mr Maybir knows but on each occasion he has been asked he has provided outrageous and transparent lies in cowardly attempts to avoid responsibility.
	


Life before Kodi Maybir


	
	Ms James was 24 years old when she met Mr Maybir in January 2013. Her three children were born to a former partner from whom she had separated in 2009. Thereafter, Ms James and the children lived for various periods of time in the households of family members.
	
	
	In the latter half of 2012 Ms James and the children were living with her brother and sister-in-law at The Ponds. Levai was attending primary school; Ms James was studying at TAFE to become a beauty technician; and AB and CB were attending daycare. There was no suggestion of any physical or emotional mistreatment of any of the children. They were regularly taken to see doctors for various childhood ailments. Levai's attendance record at school was unremarkable. There were no issues with toilet training. Ms James' sister-in-law said that Ms James and the children appeared to be happy and well.
	
	
	Levai was described as a healthy baby who progressed well in his infant years. However, his school teachers detected that he might have an intellectual disability. When he was 6 years old a teacher described him having the speaking ability of a 2 or 3 year old and an inability to write a word, not even his own name. Discussions took place between the teachers and Ms James about this. The last teacher to have contact with Levai was the principal of Riverstone Public School who described him as having a ""moderate intellectual disability"". She said that Ms James appeared to be doing her best to support Levai; she followed all requests the teachers made concerning his progress and anything that was suggested she should be doing with him at home.
	


Background to Kodi Maybir


	
	Kodi Maybir was born in 1984 and so he was aged 29 at the relevant time. He leased the commercial unit at Oatley which he used as a music studio. It operated under the name ""Seminal Studios"" and Mr Maybir had a record label called ""Seventy Seven Records"". He performed under the name ""General Kopri"" and also produced music for others. The style of music was described by his brother as ""Christian hip-hop rap"". It would seem that the studio was used by Mr Maybir and other musicians at all hours. He gave evidence of his habitual use of cannabis.
	
	
	Mr Maybir had some past involvement in helping to run camps conducted by Prison Fellowship Australia. The camps were for children aged 7 to 14 who had at least one parent in prison. They were designed to provide the children with a break and to give them some Christian spiritual support. Mr Maybir introduced the concept of ""boot camp"" sessions involving intensive physical exercise and team building activities.
	
	
	Mr Maybir married Ms Naomi Brealey in 2007 and they had two children who were born in March 2008 and May 2010. They separated in July 2012.
	
	
	Ms Brealey gave evidence, which I accept, that he was very physical in disciplining their children. She said that he would scream at them when they acted out and if they did not stop he had a practice of grabbing them by the face. She said he had very large hands (something I observed myself during the trial) and would squeeze the children's faces by holding them with one hand with his fingers and thumb spanning from ear to ear. If the children did not cease screaming he would squeeze even harder and scream back at the children with his face a few centimetres from theirs.
	
	
	Ms Brealey also described his practice of using implements such as a spatula or wooden spoon or just his hand to smack the children. He kept a wooden spatula in the car for this purpose. If they were out in public Mr Maybir used to control the children by pinching them on the fleshy part of their inner upper arm. Mr Maybir said in his evidence that he regarded smacking a child with a wooden spoon or spatula as normal parental discipline.
	
	
	Ms Brealey's evidence was heavily contested as to these matters. Particular reliance was placed upon written statements she made to police in the aftermath of the separation in relation to various incidents she complained of. There was no mention in the statements of Mr Maybir's disciplinary practices with the children. However, Ms Brealey was steadfast in relation to this evidence which was generally consistent with the evidence independently given by Ms James. Further, her description of the manner in which Mr Maybir gripped the faces of her children coincides with bruising seen on either side of the face of the deceased during the post-mortem examination. I am of the view that Ms Brealey's evidence was truthful.
	


Life with Mr Maybir


	
	Life for Ms James and her children changed dramatically after she met Mr Maybir in January 2013. They met at her brother's house where she and the children were living and she said they immediately became intimate as lovers. This appeared to cause some ruction within the family as a result of some unexplained concern about the children being exposed to the relationship. As a result she decided to move out and she accepted Mr Maybir's offer for her and the children to stay at his music studio at Oatley where he had been living. They moved there on about 24 January.
	
	
	Ms James gave evidence that prior to meeting Mr Maybir she considered herself to be a loving, kind but firm parent. Soon after meeting Mr Maybir she came to embrace his extreme religious views and parenting philosophies. He spoke of his experience working with troubled teenage children and explained that the cause of the problems of those children was deficient parenting. He persuaded her that her parenting skills were inadequate and that she was allowing the children, especially Levai, to manipulate her emotionally. He counselled her to be strict, to insist on obedience of her commands and to impose physical punishment in response to disobedience.
	
	
	The punishments he encouraged, and meted out himself, included smacking with the heel of a shoe or with a spatula; squatting; leaning against the wall; holding objects in their hands with their arms outstretched; and running. Another technique involved having the children punch each other.
	
	
	Ms James described in some detail how Mr Maybir would punish the children in these types of ways. She initially expressed some concern but was told that if she did not agree with his disciplinary techniques she should pack up and move out. She said she did not do that because she had no family support and would have nowhere to live. She also said she was reliant upon Mr Maybir and loved him.
	
	
	Ms James very soon succumbed to Mr Maybir’s counselling about the need for harsh disciplinary methods. There was an occasion on 20 February 2013 when she and the children were on a train when she chastised and physically punished Levai for not being able to recite the alphabet. She said that Mr Maybir had told her that he was old enough and intelligent enough to know his alphabet; it was just a behavioural issue; and that he should be punished if he failed to recite it correctly. Ms James ceased taking Levai to school at around about this time.
	
	
	I pause to observe that much was sought to be made by senior counsel for Mr Maybir of evidence given by Ms James that his regime of ""discipline"" did not commence until about 6 weeks into their relationship. For that reason it was contended that her conduct on the train on 20 February was not a product of his influence. On the basis that I do not believe Ms James was at all accurate in that estimate of time I do not accept the submission. I accept her explanation for why she did what she did.
	
	
	The following passage in Ms James' evidence summarises how she had been enthralled and subjugated by Mr Maybir:
	


""Q. How would you describe the dynamics of your relationship in terms of power?

A. I loved Mr Maybir a lot. I became to rely on him mentally, emotionally. He would talk to me about his ex-wife and his two children and how much he missed them, and how he wanted to meet a woman who loved him more than he loved her and how obedient she must be spiritually as well.

Q. Did you try to become that woman?

A. Yes.""


	
	Ms James also said that Mr Maybir ""influenced me so much to the point where I wanted to be what he wanted me to be"". This included wanting her to be more religious and spiritual.
	
	
	On 23 March 2013 Ms James recorded a video in the lounge area of the studio in which she spoke of her feelings towards Mr Maybir. Her infatuation with him is clear:
	


""He's such a good man … He's the most awesome guy to be around with. He's so funny. In the depths of my darkness, he always brings me out … he's that light that shines through. I love him. I love him.""

The “purple snake”


	
	Shortly after moving into the studio, Mr Maybir asked Ms James if she suspected anything sexual had happened with any of the children and she replied that she did not. However, he told her that based upon his experience of working with troubled children he believed something had happened. He claimed that when he had spoken to Levai, AB and CB there had been mention of a ""purple snake"". Ms James had never heard the children speak of such a thing. This topic of the children having supposedly been sexually abused became a recurring issue.
	
	
	In a series of videos recorded by Mr Maybir on 8 March 2013 he purported to interview Levai about the ""purple snake"", encouraging him to say something that would support an allegation that Levai had been sexually abused by Ms James' father. In the course of this he incited Levai to demonstrate the sexual abuse by inserting his finger into his little brother's anus. Levai's responses to Mr Maybir's questioning make it obvious that Levai did not have the faintest idea what he was being asked about. The jury returned a verdict of guilty in respect of Count 1 which alleged an offence of inciting a person under the age of 16, namely 7 years, to an act of indecency towards CB, knowing the act was being filmed for the purpose of the production of child abuse material.
	
	
	It was the Crown case that the ""purple snake"" issue was a creation of Mr Maybir's, designed to have the effect of isolating Ms James and her children from her family. Whether or not that was his intention, it did have that effect, and I am satisfied that it was his fictional creation.
	


Mr Maybir as an army general


	
	Mr Maybir was said to be heavily inspired by the movie “300”. He referred to himself, and had the children refer to him, as “the General” and to themselves as “Spartans”. He would require the children to line up and he would call out, “Spartans, what is your profession?” and the children would respond in unison with some nonsensical word.
	
	
	He also referred to himself as being ""the General of the Army of the Helpers"". He said this ""army"" carried out ""the will of God"". His friend, Mr Tureif Hourani, described its focus as being to help disadvantaged youth and Mr Maybir described it as having also adopted a focus on helping single mothers with children. In a video he recorded on 30 March 2013 which he gave the title ""What it Takes"", part of a documentary he was making of his life, he said:
	


""As you know we found out not so long ago, a few weeks ago, that these children were being ah, touched by their grandfather. The Army of the Helpers stepped in. … [T]hey hid away after we, the mother of the children went public to the family. The family threatened to bash me and kill me or whatever …

It was only just … to get this family to a safe place into safety so Kopri's in full hiding right now as I talk. No one knows where I am … And to all my family and that I hope you realise that the Army of the Helpers is real and that this documentary is real …

And I just pray that God protects me and keeps me doing what I'm doing – and the Army of the Helpers goes from five people to … hundreds, hundreds. … So as General of Army of the Helpers, their leader and leading by example obviously it's not about the … music. … I couldn't have done it without my main man in the last six months Tureif Hourani, current CEO of Seventy Seven Records and he has been the backbone other than me of Army of the Helpers aside from the record label. …

But we know we're doing the will of God, and God, if he was here on this earth, would want to help every person too, whether they were Muslim, Christian, Hindu, Jew, Atheist, Agnostic, ah whatever, Buddhist, much respect to all the followers of God and good ways and good morals and we love youse. We're out here thinking of youse what we can do next.

…

And that's the Army of the Helpers' General leading the way. I had a mission to finish and I wasn't going to let the system stop me from helping three kids that they're probably going to arrest in 10 years 18 years. Army of the Helpers hits it where it happens and that's in the families. And all you single mums out there just know that the Army of the Helpers is coming, ah that's our prime focus at the moment.""


	
	Mr Maybir said in his evidence that the documentary, ""What it Takes"" was going to be released after he had won either an ARIA or a Grammy award so as to give people ""a real insight into [his] life"".
	


Moving out of the studio


	
	Having three young children living in a commercial building with only communal bathroom facilities (accessible via stairs and corridors through common property) proved to be a problem. To avoid needing to take the children to the toilet during business hours Mr Maybir had each of them wearing nappies and urinating in a bucket. Despite this, there were inevitable toileting accidents in the studio which angered Mr Maybir because of the smell. He required the children to own up as to who was responsible and would be physically abusive until one had spoken up. It would seem that Levai became the primary victim in that he was the least likely to ask to be taken to the toilet.
	
	
	At some stage in early March the family moved to live in the garage at Mr Maybir's mother's home at Woodpark. It was there on 16 March 2013 that a video was recorded of Mr Maybir inciting Levai to be assaulted by his two younger siblings. They punched and slapped him multiple times on Mr Maybir's command. Mr Maybir is heard to be laughing as this occurred. The video shows Levai with a pitiful and pained expression. He doubled over in pain whenever punched in the abdomen but otherwise simply stood to attention and took the punishment without saying a word. This video is sickening to watch but it amply demonstrates Mr Maybir's disdain for Levai and his physical and psychological cruelty towards him. Mr Maybir pleaded guilty to three counts of assault and one of producing child abuse material (Counts 2 – 5) in respect of this incident.
	


Other indications of Mr Maybir's disdain for Levai


	
	Ms James said that Levai would not cry when he was troubled. Rather, he would go within himself; he would cower whenever someone yelled at him or was aggressive towards him. She said this angered Mr Maybir even more because Levai was not responding in the way he would expect him to. She tried to explain that this was just Levai's personality but he said, ""Well, that’s not normal”. She also described him giving vent to his frustration at Levai not getting upset or crying by grabbing his face and squeezing, a description which mirrored that given by Ms Brealey.
	
	
	On 22 February 2013 a video was recorded as Mr Maybir, Ms James and the children were on a train arriving at Circular Quay railway station. When Levai was unable to see something that Mr Maybir asked him to look at, he pointed to Levai and mocked him by laughing and saying, ""Look at him ... is this kid alright?""
	
	
	Mr Maybir resorted to other callous and cruel punishments. He forced Levai to stand clothed in a cold shower. There was evidence of him putting Levai's underpants on his head. There was an occasion when to stop Levai crying he put ice down his pants and later joked to a friend about Levai having ""blue balls"". He admitted to police that there was an occasion when he punished Levai by making him eat his own faeces. He was asked why and said, ""there was no purpose, I was just angry"". (I note that Ms James said he did the same thing to AB as well.)
	
	
	At the conclusion of his cross-examination the Crown Prosecutor put to Mr Maybir that he had no respect for Levai. He replied, ""I had lots of respect for that little boy"". In my view, nothing could be further from the truth.
	


Back to the studio


	
	The family returned to live at the studio for a short period. There was a video recorded on 17 March 2013 of Mr Maybir wrestling with Levai. The accused pleaded not guilty to two counts of assault (Counts 6 and 7); the Crown case being that the conduct was too rough to be regarded as ""play"". The jury obviously had a reasonable doubt about this and returned verdicts of not guilty.
	


Camping


	
	Just before the Easter weekend at the end of March 2013 the family moved to live at the Sydney Tourist Park at Miranda for a short time. On Good Friday (29 March) they moved to the Bulli Beach Tourist Park where a number of incidents occurred.
	
	
	Mr Maybir pleaded guilty to assaulting Levai on an occasion when they were in their tent by striking him a number of times with a spatula (Count 8). A witness said that he struck Levai at least ten times but it was put to her that it was less than five times. I do not think the difference matters terribly much.
	
	
	Mr Maybir was found guilty of assaulting Levai on an occasion when all the family were on the beach (Count 9). The facts relating to this incident were disputed but I am satisfied that it involved Levai being forced to run on the beach to the point of exhaustion. He fell to the sand but was picked up by Mr Maybir, struck with a stick or similar object to the lower back/buttocks region and told to keep going.
	
	
	Ms James gave evidence of that and other events, as did other campers. She was asked in relation to this one how it made her feel and she said she ""felt hopeless"". She was asked whether she had ever protested to Mr Maybir about his conduct and she said she had not because, ""At that time I had given responsibility [for disciplining the children] to Mr Maybir"".
	
	
	Later the same day Levai was required by Mr Maybir to run back and forward from one point to another on the grass near their campsite. Again Levai became exhausted and fell to the ground but Mr Maybir picked him up and punched him hard to the face. A witness heard Mr Maybir say something to the effect of ""keep running or you'll get more of what you just got"". Count 10 alleged an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and, alternatively, Count 11 alleged an assault. The jury returned a verdict of guilty to Count 10. Witness descriptions of seeing a lump on Levai's forehead with photographic confirmation support the verdict for the more serious offence.
	
	
	These three assaults were not the only instances of misconduct by Mr Maybir (or Ms James) that occurred at Bulli. Despite some inconsistencies, I am satisfied by the overall evidence of the eyewitnesses that the following occurred. Levai was forced to sit outside the tent for an extended period of time, with very little clothing and sobbing at times, on the morning of both Saturday 30 March and Sunday 31 March as punishment for toileting mishaps. Ms James struck Levai with a spatula a number of times on another occasion.
	
	
	In the late afternoon of 30 March a fellow camper was in the amenities block when Levai came in wanting a drink. The camper lifted him up to the tap and said that he was surprised at how much water he gulped. The camper noticed that Levai was very skinny and said his ribs were visible. In the late afternoon of 31 March (after the Count 10 and 11 incident), Levai was invited into a neighbour's tent where he was given juice and Easter eggs which he quickly consumed. It was in this context that one or more lumps were seen on Levai's forehead.
	
	
	Fellow campers were so distressed by the mistreatment of Levai they witnessed that police were notified. Two officers attended during the evening of 31 March but gave evidence that they saw no injuries. I accept the evidence of the campers, supported as it is by a photograph of Levai with at least one and possibly two lumps on the forehead.
	
	
	As a result of the police visit the manager of the park, after having spoken to the officers, offered Ms James and the children accommodation in a cabin. They stayed there until early May 2013 during which time Mr Maybir spent more time at the studio at Oatley.
	
	
	There was an occasion early in the time when the family was at Bulli when they had a meal comprising chicken and bread rolls but Levai was given only a bread roll and water. This was another punishment for a toilet mishap.
	
	
	There was an incident in the cabin in mid-April when Ms James became upset with Levai. She said she was yelling at him and started smacking him with a spatula. Levai struggled and fell against a bed. Mr Maybir told him to keep still and that he deserved it. He grabbed Levai by the arm and dragged him onto the bed and held him down. He told Ms James to continue smacking him. She took up a piece of skirting board and struck him a number of times to the buttocks while Mr Maybir held him down. Ms James said that welts later appeared on Levai's buttocks and they became infected. Mr Maybir counselled her against taking him to a doctor because of the questions that would be asked so she obtained treatments and dressings from a pharmacy. Mr Maybir pleaded guilty to an offence of reckless wounding in company (Count 12) in respect of this incident.
	
	
	At some stage when living in the cabin there was an incident when Mr Maybir forced Levai to stand under a cold shower while he questioned him. Ms James said she heard a thud and a moan and she went to the bathroom doorway to investigate. She heard Mr Maybir ask Levai, ""why are you lying"" as he punched him in the middle of the chest.
	
	
	In a video recorded on 12 April 2013 Levai is shown to have a large bruise on the right side of his forehead and a small laceration and associated bruise under his right eye.
	
	
	In another video, recorded in the cabin on 20 April 2013, Levai is shown being forced to put a jacket on, take it off, let it fall to the ground, pick it up, hang it over a chair and then put it on again. He was forced by Ms James to repeat these actions numerous times, something she said was derived from a movie, ""The Karate Kid"". It is apparent that Levai was lethargic and in a state of discomfort, struggling to perform the routine. There appears to be bruising to the left side of his face and left arm. The other children are heard to be watching a movie nearby. Mr Maybir was not present. In a separate video, Ms James is recorded as describing this as ""the new discipline plan"" that she has implemented because smacking was not working. She also described how Levai was on ""an eating plan"" whereby he was getting the ""bare minimum"" and was ""excluded from any special treats"".
	
	
	The following day Ms James recorded a video of the children running on the beach at Bulli. It shows them continually running between two posts 20 metres apart. The children appear tired, particularly Levai. Ms James referred to this as ""training"".
	
	
	Mr Maybir, Ms James and the children travelled to Brisbane by train in early May but they returned to live at the studio a few days later.
	
	
	According to Ms James, there was an occasion when they were back at the studio when Mr Maybir was squatting in front of Levai as he questioned him when he struck out with his foot and hit Levai in the chest.
	


19 May 2013


	
	A video was recorded on the evening of 19 May 2013. It shows Levai being made to run on the spot while he is questioned about the ""purple snake"" allegation concerning Ms James' father. It is apparent that by this time Mr Maybir had given up on his claim to believe that Mr James had abused the children and, rather ironically, had persuaded Ms James to believe that the children, Levai in particular, had lied about it. By this stage, Levai had been rendered so compliant that when Mr Maybir asked him, ""why did you make all this up"" he meekly replied, ""because I keep lying all the time"".
	
	
	Ms James said that after the running on the spot, she slapped Levai to the side of the face. She said it was ""a firm slap"" but it did not leave a mark. She denied that it forced Levai's head to come into contact with a door. I am satisfied that this was a false suggestion created by Mr Maybir in an attempt to provide an alternative explanation for the child being found on post-mortem examination to have sustained a fracture to his parietal bone.
	
	
	Mr Maybir then wanted Levai to do another punishment. He was required to squat with his back against the wall with his arms outstretched to the side. Levai kept falling down and Mr Maybir would tell him to get back up and do it again. While Levai was doing this Mr Maybir was reading random passages from the Bible.
	


20 May 2013


	
	Life in the studio began uneventfully on the morning of 20 May 2013. There was some talk about an outing to the Blue Mountains and Mr Maybir made a number of internet searches about that. While he was doing this he received a text message advising that his sister-in-law had just given birth.
	
	
	Ms James said she woke the children and left them when they were sitting up in bed. She went to the kitchenette to prepare breakfast. She said that as she was making toast she heard ""a scratch and a thud"" which sounded like something scraping against the floor. She went and looked through a nearby window into the lounge area. She could not see all of the room but noticed AB and CB on the far side of the room in their sleeping area. She returned to the kitchen. She waited for the toast to pop and then started buttering it. Mr Maybir then came in carrying Levai in his arms. Levai was unconscious. Mr Maybir explained, ""Levai fell over, it was an accident"".
	
	
	Ms James took Levai in her arms and tried to rouse him but he did not respond. She said ""his arms were rolled back and he had a bit of froth on the corner of his mouth"". She splashed water on his face and then took him to the lounge. She said his breathing was slow and shallow and his eyes were slightly open but he was otherwise not responding. She tried to give him liquid Panadol but was spilling it; Levai was biting the spoon. Mr Maybir put his hands beside Levai's jaw to try and open his mouth.
	
	
	Levai's condition deteriorated. He was laying on the lounge but was later transferred to a sleeping bag which was put on a mattress on the floor. Ms James said it first occurred to her around midday that he may have been extremely seriously injured. She asked Mr Maybir, because he was the one who made the decisions, whether he thought Levai needed medical attention. He said he did not know and asked her what she thought. She replied that she did not know either. The Crown Prosecutor asked her, ""Did you know?"" She replied, ""I was afraid to know … I was afraid of finally putting Mr Maybir in a position with the police."" She said she still loved him at that point.
	
	
	In the evening Mr Maybir went to visit his brother and sister-in-law and their new baby. When he returned, he, Ms James, AB and CB had pizza. Ms James checked on Levai's condition during the evening but said she was still afraid to call an ambulance. She last checked him before going to bed at 11.30pm.
	


21 May 2013


	
	Ms James woke early and went to check on Levai. She found him to be stiff and cold. After obtaining approval from Mr Maybir she called the ambulance service. He told her to say that Levai had fallen off a pogo stick. While they were waiting for the ambulance to arrive he got rid of some cannabis and a bong. He also took out to a garbage bin on the kerb a bag containing items of children's clothing, many pairs of children's underwear and a doona on which there was a blood stain with a DNA profile consistent with being Levai's.
	
	
	The ambulance officers who attended the scene immediately recognised that Levai was dead. Signs of lividity and rigor mortis indicated that he had been dead for some time. Ms James was allowed to hold him until the police arrived. Mr Maybir knelt beside her and said, ""He's in a better place, he's with the angels now"". Mr Maybir told ambulance and police officers that Levai had fallen off a pogo stick. A police officer overheard him say to Ms James that ""he is in a better place, he is with Jesus now … you didn't know Jesus until you met me. That was the only way I could help you"".
	
	
	The forensic examination of the scene and the subsequent analysis of various items revealed a number of blood stains found in various areas of the studio with a DNA profile the same as Levai's. The Crown did not place any emphasis on this in the case that was put to the jury or on sentence.
	


Post-mortem examination


	
	Dr Issabella Brouwer carried out a post-mortem examination. She found there was a mass of swelling to the back of the child's head extending down to the neck. There was a fracture in the base of the skull at the back of the head directly associated with an area of bruising. It was her opinion that ""quite substantial force"" would be required to cause such blunt force injury. It could have been caused by one or more impacts. Directly associated with this was an acute subdural haemorrhage causing pressure on the brain leading to death.
	
	
	There was an issue in the trial about whether shaking may have been the cause of the fatal injury. The overwhelming force of the evidence was to the effect that it was not. Dr Brouwer was resolutely of the view that it was ""an extremely forceful impact to the back of the head"" that was the cause.
	
	
	Dr Brouwer also found a hairline fracture in the left parietal area indicative of a blunt force injury. Bruising on both sides of the head was consistent with having been caused by a thumb on the right side and fingers on the left side. Her opinion was that there could have been a gripping of the head with substantial force causing bleeding into the muscles on both sides.
	
	
	A large number of other injuries were noted all over the child's body. There were numerous bruises to the front of the torso. A group of bruises on the right side of the chest were indicative of having been caused by a punch with substantial force. Another group of bruises on the left side of the chest was in the same area as underlying healing fractures to four ribs. The degree of healing to the ribs indicated the fractures had occurred three to four weeks earlier, possibly longer, but the bruises were more recent and were indicative of having been caused by a fist. The repetition of trauma to the area might have interfered with the healing of the rib fractures. Between the ribs and the hip on the left side there were two scars consistent with having been caused by a linear object.
	
	
	Bruises and abrasions were found in various places on the child's back, some ""recent"" (meaning at the time of death or hours to days old) and others ""remote"" (weeks or months old). Scars on the left side in the rib cage area were consistent with having been caused by a linear object. Scars and open wounds which appeared to have become infected were seen on the buttocks.
	
	
	Various bruises were seen on the left arm, some recent and others remote. A large bruise on the inner left elbow was consistent with the arm having been gripped with some force. A number of scars were seen which Dr Brouwer said were consistent with having been caused by a linear object, for example the handle of a large spoon. There were many similar injuries seen on the right arm.
	
	
	Multiple bruises on the front of the right leg included a group that were seen on x-ray that were reminiscent of a shoe print injury. There was an abrasion on the fourth toe. A lesion on the big toe appeared to have been caused by the skin being perforated by an oval-shaped object. Further bruising was found on the back of this leg.
	
	
	On the left leg there were multiple bruises, some recent and some remote. There were also abrasions consistent with having been caused by a linear object. There was a healing wound on the top of the foot consistent with the skin having been penetrated with substantial force by a rounded object. A fractured metatarsal leading to the little toe was consistent with the application of blunt force trauma.
	
	
	Generally, Dr Brouwer opined that fractures in different stages of healing, together with the presence of fractures in uncommon locations, for example the fingers and the metatarsal, were strong indicators of non-accidental injuries associated with child abuse.
	
	
	Other observations made by Dr Brouwer included that Levai was 117cm in height and weighed 20.5 kg. Both measurements fell under the 25th percentile for boys of the age of 7. I note that Levai was a month short of his 8th birthday.
	
	
	Mr Maybir sought to explain the thumb and fingerprint bruising on the sides of Levai's head by saying that he exerted some force when the child was biting the spoon as Ms James was trying to administer Panadol. Dr Brouwer thought that to be unlikely. In my view, the location of fingertip bruises adjacent to and above and below the left eye renders it highly improbable.
	
	
	I do not accept that Mr Maybir was responsible for all of the extensive injuries seen on the body of Levai in Dr Brouwer's post-mortem examination. Ms James was at least responsible for causing the injuries seen on the buttocks and I have no hesitation in concluding that she was responsible for the infliction of some of the other injuries. However I am satisfied that Mr Maybir was responsible for the majority of them.
	


Explanations for the fatal injury


	
	Mr Maybir has provided four explanations for how Levai sustained the blunt force trauma to the back of his head that resulted in his death. First he said that the child had fallen from a pogo stick. Then he told police that he had fallen to the floor when being punished by being made to stand on a large coffee tin. When confronted with some medical evidence he then said the child had got back up onto the coffee tin but had fallen a second time. Mr Maybir abandoned all of that nonsense at trial and claimed that Levai accidentally fell to the floor when he had tried to perform a ""play"" wrestling manoeuvre of throwing him towards a lounge. The manner in which he described it made no more sense than any of his previous explanations.
	


Sentencing of Kayla James


	
	Ms James pleaded guilty and was sentenced by Harrison J for four offences of assault; one of reckless wounding in company; one of consenting to Levai being used in the production of child abuse material; three of producing child abuse material; one of failing to provide Levai with the necessities of life; and one of manslaughter. In sentencing for the offence of failing to provide Levai with the necessities of life his Honour was asked to take into account two offences of neglect of a child (AB and CB) by failing to provide adequate lodgings. See R v KJ [2015] NSWSC 767.
	
	
	Three of the assaults concerned the incident on the train on 20 February 2013 when Levai was having difficulty reciting the alphabet and the fourth concerned her striking Levai multiple times with a spatula on the Easter weekend at Bulli. The reckless wounding offence concerned the striking of Levai with a wooden plank in the cabin at Bulli. The offence of consenting to Levai being used in the production of child abuse material related to the filming of the sustained assault of him by his siblings that was incited by Mr Maybir on 16 March. The offences of producing child abuse material relate to the filming of Mr Maybir and Levai ""play"" wrestling on 17 March, the filming of Levai doing the repetitive routine with the jacket on 20 April, and the filming of Levai running on the spot on 19 May. The offence of failing to provide Levai with the necessities of life concerned her social isolation of him and restricting his food and water intake in the months leading up to his death. The manslaughter offence was based upon Ms James' gross negligence in failing to obtain medical attention for Levai.
	
	
	Unsurprisingly, Harrison J regarded most of the offences as serious. The reckless wounding and the manslaughter offences were regarded as most serious examples of their type.
	
	
	A number of favourable subjective matters were taken into account in the assessment of sentence for Ms James. They included matters such as her early pleas of guilty, her assistance to authorities, her genuine remorse, good prospects of rehabilitation and unlikelihood of reoffending.
	
	
	Ms James was convicted but no penalty was imposed in respect of the assaults on the train, filming the ""play"" wrestling, and filming Levai performing the jacket routine. For the other offences she received an aggregate term of imprisonment for 14 years with a non-parole period of 10 years and 6 months. The individual sentences that would have been imposed if not for the imposition of an aggregate sentence ranged from 9 months to 12 years. They had been reduced by 40 per cent on account of Ms James' pleas of guilty and assistance to authorities. Harrison J indicated by way of example that the sentence for the manslaughter would otherwise have been 20 years.
	


Related summary offences


	
	The Crown determined to proceed no further against Mr Maybir in respect of a number of summary offences that had been referred by the Local Court to this Court pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). However, it was indicated by the Crown Prosecutor that it wished to proceed in respect of three offences. Mr Maybir entered a plea of guilty to an offence of possessing 13.18 grams of cannabis on 21 May 2013 and pleas of not guilty to two charges of neglecting to provide a child in his care with adequate and proper lodging. Those charges related to AB and CB and covered the period 24 January to 21 May 2013.
	
	
	No submissions were made by counsel for either party as to these offences. I was told simply that the evidence concerning them could be found in the evidence that was adduced during the trial. The drug offence relates to the cannabis Mr Maybir tried to dispose of while the ambulance was on its way on the morning of 21 May 2013. The other two charges I take to relate to the children living in the wholly unsatisfactory environment of the music studio at various times between January and May 2013. As unsatisfactory as it was, whether it did not meet the description of ""adequate and proper lodging"" was not a subject upon which I received any assistance.
	
	
	There is no suggestion that AB and CB were not provided with the daily necessities for a child of their age such as food, clothing, warmth, exercise, entertainment and the like. The toileting arrangements were far from ideal but otherwise I have a reasonable doubt that the children's lodging was inadequate or improper to an extent that should warrant conviction for a criminal offence.
	
	
	The cannabis charge warrants conviction but, having regard to what will be imposed in respect of the offences on indictment, no penalty is warranted.
	


Personal circumstances of the offender


	
	The evidence on sentence added very little to what I did not already know about Mr Maybir.
	
	
	I now know that he has a criminal history comprising offences of contravening an apprehended domestic violence order for which he was placed on good behaviour bonds. These offences were committed on 14 September 2012 and between 1 December and 26 February 2013. He was the subject of one good behaviour bond from 11 October 2012 for a period of 6 months, it being operative at the time of his commission of the offences constituting Counts 1 to 5 and 8 to 10.
	
	
	Mr Maybir has been in custody continuously since 20 September 2013 and so his sentence must be backdated to then.
	
	
	Eighteen testimonials were tendered. The authors are family and extended family members as well as friends. They provide descriptions of Mr Maybir having experienced difficulties in his childhood years as a consequence of his parents' separation when he was about 10 years of age and further difficulties following the breakdown of his own marriage in mid-2012. The latter was said to be particularly difficult because Ms Brealey tried to prevent him having any access to his children; something he found particularly distressing. I note, however, that Mr Maybir gave evidence in the trial that he was still seeing his children at the time he met Ms James and that his access only ceased after she moved into the studio with him.
	
	
	Mr Maybir is described as being a sincere, kind, respectful, generous, industrious, hardworking, forgiving, loving, peaceful, compassionate, gentle, loyal, protective and family oriented person who is concerned for the welfare of others and would help anyone in need. One person described him as being a ""very loving and adventurous father"" and another said he was ""a decent human being with a strong desire to make a positive contribution to this world"". A person with the title ""senior pastor"" praised him for his mentoring of marginalised and disadvantaged youth. Others speak of the positive impact he has had with children he has worked with. One of his sisters said ""he has always been one to recognise and admit when he knows he was in the wrong"". At least two people refer to Mr Maybir as being an honest person.
	
	
	I accept that Mr Maybir is entitled to have his otherwise good character taken into account. The sustained and serious nature of his offending, however, means that the weight to be afforded to it is extremely modest.
	
	
	The pleas of guilty in respect of Counts 2 to 5 and 12 were entered at the commencement of the trial. They had some utilitarian value but not a lot. I have taken that into account but in the context in which I am sentencing for a larger number of offences including one of murder I do not intend to quantify any reduction of sentence for those matters.
	
	
	Mr Maybir did not give evidence on sentence. One of the reasons for adjourning the sentence proceedings for so long after the conclusion of the trial was to allow time for his lawyers to acquire some psychiatric material. In the end, however, none was tendered. That leaves me in the position of having no expert opinion that might explain why Mr Maybir behaved as he did towards Ms James and her children. There was a suggestion by his counsel that depression arising from his marriage breakdown, grief over not being able to see his children, and consumption of cannabis might provide an explanation. I am not prepared to accept that in the absence of expert evidence. Opinions expressed by authors of testimonials are no substitute.
	
	
	It was submitted that I should take into account that Mr Maybir has been assaulted and otherwise mistreated whilst in custody, including by correctional officers. Mr Brady SC contended that ""his time in custody to date has been harder than usual and is likely to continue in that manner"". The problem with this is that the only evidence of it comes from Mr Maybir. He said, in effect, that he was mistreated in custody after having given the ""fall from a pogo stick"" version and thought the mistreatment would cease, or at least be less likely, if he gave the ""fall from a coffee tin"" versions. How this credibly explained the replacement of one innocent, but false, story with another innocent, but still false, story is impossible for me to fathom. There was evidence of a complaint having been made by telephone to the Ombudsman on 1 November 2013 who replied by letter a fortnight later saying that the matter would not be investigated because he was satisfied with action taken by gaol authorities to investigate it. There is no other evidence on the subject that does not depend upon the credibility of the offender.
	
	
	Mr Maybir bears the onus on this subject and I am not persuaded on the balance of probabilities that he has, or will, experience hardship in custody over and above that of the average inmate.
	
	
	There was no suggestion that I should extend leniency to Mr Maybir for having good prospects of rehabilitation or for being unlikely to reoffend. It was suggested that his pleas of guilty to certain offences could be regarded as a sign of remorse in relation to those matters but I think it was largely a sign of him accepting the inevitable. Aside from his prior good character and his pleas of guilty there is nothing else in terms of subjective matters that operates in mitigation of penalty.
	


Seriousness of the offences


	
	The offence in Count 1 of encouraging Levai to insert his finger or fingers into his little brother's anus while being filmed is an unusual one on its facts. It came towards the end of a sustained period of Mr Maybir trying to persuade Levai to say something incriminating about his grandfather having sexually abused him. There seems to have been very little prospect of the child acting out a demonstration of something that was a figment of Mr Maybir's creation. For an offence of this type it falls towards the lower end of the scale of seriousness.
	
	
	The assaults in Counts 2 to 4 are very serious examples of their type. The physical pain caused to Levai is obvious from the recording. The psychological impact upon each of the three children is incalculable. The recording of these offences which constituted Count 5, compared to the range of child abuse material the courts encounter, is modestly serious.
	
	
	The assault of Levai with a spatula in the tent at Bulli (Count 8) is modestly serious. The assault with the stick on the beach (Count 9) is slightly more serious, given the circumstances attending it, including that it occurred when Levai had fallen exhausted to the sand. The assault occasioning actual bodily harm involving the punch to the boy's forehead when he again became exhausted whilst performing interval running in the camping area (Count 10) is more serious again.
	
	
	The reckless wounding in company involving Mr Maybir assisting and encouraging Ms James to beat Levai on the buttocks with a piece of wood (Count 12) was despicable. He might not have delivered the blows, but his position of power and influence over Ms James and the fact that he held Levai down and encouraged her to keep beating him means, in my view, that he is at least as culpable as her. Then there is the fact that he discouraged her from seeking medical attention when the wounds became infected. This offence is easily within the mid-range of seriousness for an offence of its type.
	
	
	The filming of Levai running on the spot on 19 May 2013 (Count 13) is towards the lower end of the scale of seriousness of offences involving the production of child abuse material.
	
	
	The murder of Levai (Count 14) is an offence of great heinousness. The Crown contends that this is a case that warrants the imposition of the maximum penalty of imprisonment for life. The practical effect of such a sentence is that the offender would remain in prison for the balance of his natural life with no prospect of release on parole at any time.
	
	
	A life sentence may be imposed if the circumstances are such that the case is within the worst case category. That does not mean that it is necessary to impose a lesser sentence if it is possible to envisage a worse case. A case will be within the worst case category if it is possible to point to features which are of very great heinousness and there is an absence of facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime. See R v Twala (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 4 November 1994, unrep).
	
	
	Section 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) provides that a court is to impose a sentence of life imprisonment if it is satisfied that the level of culpability of the offender is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of such a sentence. It is the combined effect of those four indicia that must be considered: R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19; 59 NSWLR 557 at [35].
	
	
	I am satisfied that in the months leading up to his death, Levai was subjected to cruel, degrading and inhumane treatment at the hands of Mr Maybir and to some extent - as a product of his insidious influence upon her - Ms James. Levai was not alone in being on the receiving end of this treatment but he was singled out among his siblings to receive the worst of Mr Maybir's extreme physical and mental cruelty. The reason that was so was because of the personality and behavioural manifestations of Levai's intellectual disability. The Crown's characterisation of Mr Maybir's attitude towards Levai as one of ""disdain"" is accurate; maybe even an understatement.
	
	
	The months of abuse to which he had been subjected rendered Levai utterly submissive and defenceless to the physical and psychological power wielded by Mr Maybir. What happened to Levai on the morning of Monday 20 May 2013 remains largely a mystery locked away in the memory of only Mr Maybir. It may be that one element of his various false versions could be true – that Levai was expressing defiance to being punished. It may be that Mr Maybir was so enraged by this that he assaulted the boy. However, given the falsity of all of the versions he has given I am not prepared to give any credence to anything that he has said that is not independently verified.
	
	
	All that can be said is that Mr Maybir grabbed the face of Levai and exerted such force with his single-handed grip that he caused the bruising and the parietal bone fracture seen by Dr Brouwer post-mortem. Mr Maybir also somehow inflicted one or more extremely forceful impacts to the back of the boy's head so as to fracture his skull and generate the subdural haemorrhage that caused his death. One possibility is that he gripped Levai's head forcefully with his right hand and slammed it one or more times into a hard surface. But whether that is how it happened I cannot be sure.
	
	
	Upon Levai immediately becoming unconscious, Mr Maybir's reaction was to pick him up and carry him to his mother. Thereafter the two of them did nothing to summon medical assistance which might possibly have saved the boy's life. Their inaction was reprehensible in the extreme but the Crown did not contend that this was intended by Mr Maybir to ensure that death would result.
	
	
	These circumstances describe a very bad case of murder. However, I am not satisfied that it is at the extremity that would justify the imposition of a life sentence. I have arrived at that conclusion primarily because of two matters. First, there is an absence of any evidence of planning or premeditation. That it occurred in the spur of the moment in a fit of sudden rage cannot be excluded as a reasonable possibility. Secondly, there is an absence of sufficient evidence of an intention to kill. It is a reasonable possibility that Mr Maybir's intention was limited to the causing of really serious bodily harm rather than to actually end the boy's life. The absence of those two features is not something that mandates a conclusion that the crime is not within the worst case category or that the offender's culpability is not at the extreme level referred to in s 61. They are, however, the principal reasons why I have concluded that a life sentence should not be imposed.
	


Family victim impact statement


	
	Mr Michael James, Levai's maternal grandfather read a family victim impact statement to the court at the sentencing hearing. It is evident that the loss of Levai has been a heavy burden for the family. Regrettably, his siblings have been relocated to New Zealand where they live with their natural father which has meant that the James family have not seen them for a considerable time. All of these events have brought unimaginable grief and suffering for Levai's family and extended family. My sympathies go to them.
	


Other matters relevant to the assessment of sentence


	
	The purposes of sentencing in criminal cases are multifarious and include the need to see that an offender is made accountable for his or her actions, to denounce the conduct, to recognise the harm caused and to ensure that there is adequate punishment. There is also the need to deter the offender and others from committing similar offences and to protect the community. Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act also speaks of promoting the rehabilitation of the offender but in the circumstances of this case it is overtaken by the other considerations.
	
	
	Significant weight must be given to personal deterrence and community protection in this case having regard to the fact that Mr Maybir remains completely unrepentant in respect of Levai’s death and there is no indication of him acknowledging the enormity of his brutality and inhumanity.
	
	
	There must be acknowledged a need to bear in mind as guideposts the maximum penalty and, where applicable, the standard non-parole periods prescribed for the offences. A standard non-parole period is defined as representing the non-parole period for an offence that, taking into account only the objective factors affecting the relative seriousness of that offence, is in the middle of the range of seriousness: s 54A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. It is, of course, necessary to take into account the full-range of factors in determining an appropriate sentence but I note that the standard non-parole period for the reckless wounding in company offence is 4 years and for the murder of a person under the age of 18 is set at a very high level of 25 years.
	
	
	There is a need to assess sentences for the individual offences but also to ensure that the overall result is one that bears an appropriate relationship with the totality of Mr Maybir's criminality. This requires that there be some degree of accumulation which was conceded on his behalf.
	
	
	It was contended that parity in relation to the sentencing of Ms James should be taken into account when sentence is imposed for the offences in common to both. I have borne that in mind in the assessment of the sentences of Counts 5, 8, 12 and 13 but on no account should Mr Maybir necessarily receive the same as what Ms James received. In relation to Counts 8 and 13 my assessment is that the sentences should be less than those indicated by Harrison J (absent the discounts) but that is simply the product of my own assessment being less than his.
	
	
	Overall, however, Ms James had a lot more favourable subjective matters taken into account in her case. There was also the expert opinion evidence that she ""very quickly fell under the influence of Mr Maybir to the point that she effectively subjugated herself, and delegated her parental responsibilities for her children, particularly the deceased, to him"". I note also that a respected psychologist had likened Ms James' position to that of ""members of a cult who become susceptible to loss of independence, unassertive, gullible, possessing a desire for spiritual meaning, all in ignorance of the mechanisms of ongoing manipulation"". (See R v KJ at [49]-[50]). I believe that aptly describes what occurred.
	


Aggregate and indicative sentences


	
	For the offences on indictment I am imposing an aggregate sentence pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. It is necessary that I indicate the individual sentences that I would otherwise have imposed and, where a standard non-parole period is prescribed, the non-parole period (""NPP"") as well.

		04 March 2016",2016-03-03 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701988,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 27) [2016] NSWSC 152,"Judgment EX-TEMPORE (REVISED)


	
	Today marks the commencement of week five of this trial. Following commencement of proceedings this morning, and in accordance with my customary practice, I made periodic observations of the members of the jury as evidence was being given. In the course of doing so, I observed that one of the members of the jury, a male who was then seated adjacent to the foreperson, appeared to be closing his eyes and falling asleep on a regular basis.
	
	
	I proceeded to pay particular attention to that member of the jury as the evidence led up to the morning tea adjournment. It was evident to me from those observations that he was struggling to stay awake, and was clearly asleep for broken periods over that time.
	
	
	During the course of the morning tea adjournment, I spoke with the Crown and counsel for each of the accused in chambers, at which time I appraised them of my observations. I invited each of them to undertake their own observations when proceedings resumed after morning tea and indicated that I would do the same.
	
	
	When I did so, the pattern of the juror’s behaviour was much the same as it had been earlier that morning. There were numerous periods in which the juror was clearly asleep. When an adjournment was taken shortly before lunch the Crown indicated that he (understandably) had not had the opportunity to make any sustained observations but did say that he had briefly noticed the juror apparently closing his eyes.
	
	
	Ms Shead, who appears for the accused McNamara indicated to me that following the morning tea adjournment she had made her own observations of the juror in question. Those observations, to use her words, were that the juror had his “eyes closed and head down”. Ms Shead also said this was not the first occasion in which she, and those who instruct her, had noted this to be the case. She cited an instance a couple of weeks ago where a similar situation had arisen, albeit though one that was brief compared to what had occurred this morning.
	
	
	Mr Thomas of counsel who appears for the accused Rogerson indicated he had noted last week that the juror ""appeared to have his eyes closed for a short period"". He raised the question of whether or not it would be appropriate for me, in the absence of counsel, to make a specific inquiry of the juror to ascertain, amongst other things, whether or not he might be suffering from some medical condition that served to explain what had occurred. As to that suggested course I observed at the time, and I observe again, that even if the juror in question is suffering from some medical condition, it does not alter the fact that he has been asleep for periods during this trial, not only today but before today, and as such could not possibly have been paying attention to the evidence.
	
	
	I then gave all parties an opportunity to consider their respective positions and, in the case of counsel for each of the accused, an opportunity to obtain instructions. Upon resumption this afternoon Ms Shead has made an application that the juror be discharged. Mr Thomas made no formal application and did not seek to add to the submissions that he had made to me earlier today. The Crown did not make a formal application but at the same time made it clear that, accepting the accuracy of the observations that I have summarised, it seemed not only appropriate but mandatory that the juror be discharged.
	
	
	The Jury Act 1977 (NSW) (the “Act”) contains two particular provisions which govern the power of the Court to make an order discharging an individual juror. Section 53A makes provision for the mandatory discharge of an individual juror and is in the following terms:
	


53A Mandatory discharge of individual juror

(1) The court or coroner must discharge a juror if, in the course of any trial or coronial inquest:

(a) it is found that the juror was mistakenly or irregularly empanelled, whether because the juror was excluded from jury service or was otherwise not returned and selected in accordance with this Act, or

(b) the juror has become excluded from jury service, or

(c) the juror has engaged in misconduct in relation to the trial or coronial inquest.

(2) In this section:

""misconduct"" , in relation to a trial or coronial inquest, means:

(a) conduct that constitutes an offence against this Act, or

Note : For example, under section 68C it is an offence for a juror to make certain inquiries except in the proper exercise of his or her functions as a juror.

(b) any other conduct that, in the opinion of the court or coroner, gives rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice in the trial or inquest.


	
	Section 53B of the Act confers an additional, and wide, discretion on the Court to discharge an individual juror in particular defined circumstances, as follows:
	


53B Discretionary discharge of individual juror

The court or coroner may, in the course of any trial or coronial inquest, discharge a juror if:

(a) the juror (though able to discharge the duties of a juror) has, in the judge’s or coroner’s opinion, become so ill, infirm or incapacitated as to be likely to become unable to serve as a juror before the jury delivers their verdict or has become so ill as to be a health risk to other jurors or persons present at the trial or coronial inquest, or

(b) it appears to the court or coroner (from the juror’s own statements or from evidence before the court or coroner) that the juror may not be able to give impartial consideration to the case because of the juror’s familiarity with the witnesses, parties or legal representatives in the trial or coronial inquest, any reasonable apprehension of bias or conflict of interest on the part of the juror or any similar reason, or

(c) a juror refuses to take part in the jury’s deliberations, or

(d) it appears to the court or coroner that, for any other reason affecting the juror’s ability to perform the functions of a juror, the juror should not continue to act as a juror.

Note : Section 22 provides for the continuation of a trial or inquest on the death or discharge of a juror.


	
	The definition of the word ""misconduct"" as it appears in s. 53A of the Act is a wide one. In particular, s. 53A(2)(b) makes it clear that misconduct includes any conduct falling short of conduct constituting an offence which, in the opinion of the Court, gives rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	The inability of a member of a jury to stay awake and listen to the evidence as it is being given, and the propensity of that inability to give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice, needs no further comment.
	
	
	Fundamental to the right of an accused person, and indeed the Crown, to a fair trial, is the proposition that all members of the jury should be alert, attentive, and in a position to follow and comprehend the evidence as it is being given. It is impossible for a juror to discharge that function if he or she is asleep. Any further observation in relation to that would be superfluous.
	
	
	I should also emphasise that my observations of the juror are specifically consistent with those of Ms Shead, and generally consistent with those of Mr Thomas and the Crown Prosecutor.
	
	
	In those circumstances, it is not necessary for me to consider the provisions of s. 53B of the Act although I should say that had I been required to do so I would have come to the view that the member of the jury was not able to perform his functions and should not continue to act as a juror.
	
	
	For those reasons, I propose to make an order discharging the juror in question. I will have the juror come into court by himself, at which time I will explain to him, in brief terms, why I have taken the course that I have. I will then ask the officer to ensure that he is taken from the court, following which we will resume with the remaining 13 jurors. It is appropriate that the remaining 13 jurors be informed, again in general terms, of why this course has been taken. In explaining that, I propose to take the opportunity to remind the members of the jury of the necessity to listen carefully at all times to the evidence as it is given.
	
	
	For those reasons, I make the following orders:
	



	
	Pursuant to s. 53A of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW), juror number 01453654 from call number 650-8 is discharged.
	
	
	Pursuant to s. 53C(1)(b) of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) the trial is to continue with a reduced number of jurors, namely 13 jurors.

		15 June 2016",2016-02-28 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701993,Director of Public Prosecutions v Lazzam [2016] NSWSC 145,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	The Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) appeals pursuant to s 56(1)(a) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) against the order made by Stafford LCM on 28 April 2015 at Glen Innes Local Court dismissing summary criminal proceedings against the first and second defendants.
	
	
	The plaintiff, in a summons filed on 14 August 2015, relied on the following grounds of appeal, each of which was accepted to involve a question of law:
	


(i)   Holding that a failure by the prosecution to comply with an order or direction of the Local Court for the service of prosecution evidence was capable of itself of amounting to a failure to comply with either Division 2 of Part 2 of Chapter 4 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (‘the Division’) or a rule made under the Division within the meaning of section 188(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

(ii)   Impliedly holding that an order for the service of prosecution evidence was either part of, or a ‘rule’ made under Division 2 of Part 2 of Chapter 4 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 within the meaning of section 188 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

(iii)   Refusing to admit, pursuant to section 188(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, prosecution evidence served on the defendant in the absence of any non-compliance by the prosecution with the provisions of the Division, or with any rule made under the Division.

(iv)   In the alternative, refusing to admit evidence pursuant to section 188(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 without considering section 188(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

(v)   Dismissing the proceedings.


	
	There was no appearance for the second defendant at the hearing of the appeal, although he was called outside the Court three times. Service on him was proved. Mr Shaudin, who appeared for the first defendant, indicated that his client consented to the appeal being allowed and to the other orders sought, including that the Magistrate’s order be set aside and that the matter be remitted to the Local Court at Glen Innes to be dealt with according to law.
	
	
	I was satisfied by the conclusion of the oral hearing that grounds (i), (ii), (iii) and (v) had been made out and that it was appropriate to make orders in accordance with the short minutes that had been agreed between the plaintiff and the first defendant, which are set out at the conclusion of these reasons.
	


The relevant legislation

The service of a police brief


	
	The Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) (the Act) makes provision for service of a police brief. For present purposes, the relevant sections are ss 183, 187 and 188 which provide as follows:
	


“183 Brief of evidence to be served on accused person where not guilty plea

(1) If an accused person pleads not guilty to an offence, the prosecutor must, subject to section 187, serve or cause to be served on the accused person a copy of the brief of evidence relating to the offence.

(2) The brief of evidence is, unless the regulations otherwise provide, to consist of documents regarding the evidence that the prosecutor intends to adduce in order to prove the commission of the offence and is to include:

(a) written statements taken from the persons the prosecutor intends to call to give evidence in proceedings for the offence, and

(b) copies of any document or any other thing, identified in such a written statement as a proposed exhibit.

(3) The copy of the brief of evidence is to be served at least 14 days before the hearing of the evidence for the prosecution.

(4) The Magistrate may set a later date for service with the consent of the accused person or if of the opinion that the circumstances of the case require it.

. . .

187 When brief of evidence need not be served

(1) The court may order that all or part of the copy of the brief of evidence need not be served if it is satisfied:

(a) that there are compelling reasons for not requiring service, or

(b) that it could not reasonably be served on the accused person.

(2) The court may make an order under this section on its own initiative or on the application of any party.

(3) An order may be made subject to any conditions that the court thinks fit.

(4) Without limiting any other power to adjourn proceedings, the court may grant one or more adjournments, if it appears to it to be just and reasonable to do so, if the copy of the brief of evidence is not served in accordance with this Division. For that purpose, the court may extend the time for service of the brief of evidence.

(5) A prosecutor is not required to serve a brief of evidence in proceedings for an offence of a kind, or proceedings of a kind, prescribed by the regulations.

188 Evidence not to be admitted

(1) The court must refuse to admit evidence sought to be adduced by the prosecutor in respect of an offence if, in relation to that evidence, this Division or any rules made under this Division have not been complied with by the prosecutor.

(2) The court may, and on the application of or with the consent of the accused person must, dispense with the requirements of subsection (1) on such terms and conditions as appear just and reasonable.”

The making of rules under the Act


	
	The reference to “rules made under this Division” in s 188 (1) requires consideration of the rule-making power. Section 4(2) of the Act provides that a Rule Committee for a court may make rules including with respect to matters of practice and procedure. The term “Rule Committee” is defined in s 3 of the Act as a person or body having power to make rules for the court. Section 25(1) of the Local Court Act 2007 (NSW) provides for a Rule Committee of the Local Court. Section 25(2) provides for its membership. Schedule 3 of the Local Court Act makes provision for the Rule Committee.
	


Local Court Practice Notes

The power to make Local Court Practice Notes


	
	Section 27(1) of the Local Court Act confers power on the Chief Magistrate to issue practice notes in relation to any matter with respect to which rules may be made.
	


Local Court Practice Note Crim 1


	
	Local Court Practice Note Crim 1 (the Practice Note) was issued by the Chief Magistrate on 24 April 2012. The objects of the Practice Note are identified in cl 2, which provides:
	


“Objects

The objects of this Practice note are to ensure that matters in the Local Court’s criminal jurisdiction are finalised in a timely and proper fashion in accordance with the Local Court’s published time standards, and to set out practices in relation to other procedural or ancillary aspects of such proceedings.”


	
	The relevant time standard published by the Local Court (referred to in the objects of the Practice Note) is that 100% of the court’s summary criminal trials are to be completed within 12 months.
	
	
	Clause 5.4 of the Practice Note relevantly provides:
	


“First mention

(a) On the first mention, if the accused enters a plea of not guilty, a Magistrate or the Registrar is to:

(i) Make orders for service of the prosecution brief of evidence upon the accused in 4 weeks, and

(ii) Adjourn the proceedings for mention for reply in 6 weeks.”


	
	Clause 5.6 of the Practice Note relevantly provides:
	


“Adjournments

. . .

(b) Failure to finalise a brief in accordance with the above timetable will not, of itself, provide the basis for an adjournment for further time for service of the brief. Unless a plea of guilty is entered or the interests of justice require otherwise, the court will:

(i) List the matter for hearing, and

(ii) Order that the balance of the brief be served not less than 14 days prior to the allocated hearing date.”

The making of directions in Local Court proceedings


	
	Section 28(1) of the Local Court Act provides that, in relation to particular proceedings, the Court may give directions with respect to any aspect of practice or procedure not provided for by any Act.
	


The background facts

The incident the subject of the charges


	
	At 11pm on 16 November 2014 police were called to a private address in Glen Innes to deal with a complaint that a metal bar had been thrown by the second defendant’s girlfriend at a neighbour’s window. An altercation ensued, following which the defendants were charged.
	


The charges


	
	On 16 November 2014 the first defendant was charged with: two counts of intimidate police officer in the execution of duty (s 60(1), Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)); one count of behave in an offensive manner in public (s 4(1), Summary Offences Act 1988 NSW)); one count of assault police officer in the execution of duty (s 58, Crimes Act); and one count of hinder police officer while in the execution of duty (s 546C, Crimes Act). The charges against the second defendant were one count of assault police officer in the execution of duty (s 58, Crimes Act) and resist police officer while in the execution of duty (s 546C, Crimes Act).
	


The first mention date: 12 December 2014


	
	The matter was first mentioned before Stafford LCM on 12 December 2014. The defendants entered pleas of not guilty to all charges. In accordance with cl 5.4(a) of the Practice Note, the Magistrate directed that the brief be served by 16 January 2015 and that the matter be listed for reply on 30 January 2015. The direction regarding service of the brief was not complied with. As at the due date, only two statements, of civilian witnesses, Mr Mellor and Mr Cole, had been served.
	


The second mention date: 30 January 2015


	
	When the matter came before Stafford LCM on 30 January 2015, police informed her Honour that the statements of Constables S Howe, Gava, M Howe and Marriott were outstanding. The police also called on a subpoena issued to the first defendant’s solicitor for a recording of the incident. The police prosecutor explained that there had been difficulties in serving the brief over the Christmas period. At the conclusion of the mention, Stafford LCM directed that the outstanding brief be served by 27 February 2015; that a notice of listing be filed by the defence on 13 March 2015; and appointed a hearing date of 28 April 2015.
	
	
	The due date for service of the police brief, 27 February 2015, was not complied with. On 11 March 2015 the first defendant’s solicitor sent a facsimile to the Local Court advising that the notice of listing could not be filed because the balance of the brief was still outstanding. An order was made by Stafford LCM in chambers extending time for the filing of the notice of listing to 14 days after service of the balance of the brief.
	
	
	On 17 March 2015 the police canvassed the public for potential witnesses by door knocking in the area of the alleged incident, as a result of which three further witnesses were identified. Statements were taken from Ms Young and Mr Earl on 21 March 2015 and from Ms Palmer on 23 March 2015.
	


The service of the balance of the police brief


	
	On 25 March 2015 the balance of the police brief was served. It comprised: the statements of Constables S Howe, M Howe, Marriott and Gava; the official notebook transcription; and the statements of lay witnesses, Ms Young, Mr Earl and Ms Palmer.
	


The hearing in the Local Court


	
	The hearing of the proceedings took place before Stafford LCM on 28 April 2015. An objection was taken by the first defendant’s solicitor to the statements in the police brief which had been served outside the time permitted by the directions. She did not seek an adjournment, or identify any prejudice occasioned by service outside the timetable and confirmed that she wanted the matter to proceed that day.
	
	
	The police prosecutor submitted that there was no basis to exclude the evidence; that there had been no failure to comply with any provision of the Criminal Procedure Act; and that s 188 required only that the brief be served at least 14 days before the hearing. The prosecutor also referred to the Practice Note and noted that cl 5.6(c) appeared to contemplate that the Court would relist the matter if the brief was not served in accordance with the timetable and the Court, on that relisting, would order that the brief be served not less than 14 days before the hearing. The prosecutor provided various reasons why the full brief was not served in accordance with her Honour’s direction, including: that the canvas of the area had not occurred until 17 March 2015; the absence of an officer on leave; and the work commitments of the relevant police officers.
	
	
	The Magistrate upheld the objection and gave ex tempore reasons for the ruling. In the reasons her Honour:
	



	
	referred to the “requirement” that 100% of Local Court matters be completed within 12 months of the filing of the Court Attendance Notice;
	
	
	noted the default in compliance with the directions; and
	
	
	said that the only explanation given was that the police had many commitments.
	



	
	Her Honour concluded:
	


“Returning to s 188 and bearing in mind the non-compliance with the directions of the Court, I am satisfied on balance that the division of the Criminal Procedure Act has not been complied with. In other words that the evidence as sought to be adduced by the prosecutor, being statement evidence from Constable Mitchell Howe, Constable Matthew Graver, Constable Marriott, Constable S Howe, R Young, C Earl and M Palmer have not being served in compliance with the division of the Criminal Procedure Act, bearing in mind the Court’s direction made and, therefore, the s 188 as mandatory says, I must refuse to admit that evidence and ACCORDINGLY I REFUSE TO ADMIT THE EVIDENCE OF CONSTABLE M HOWE, CONSTABLE MATTHEW GRAVER, CONSTABLE FEE MARRIOTT, CONSTABLE S HOWE, I YOUNG, C EARL AND M PALMER.”


	
	As only the statements of Mellor and Cole had been served by 27 February 2015, these statements were sought to be tendered by the police prosecutor. Before they were actually tendered, Mr Schaefer, who appeared for the second defendant, informed the Magistrate that he was instructed to enter a plea to the charge of offensive language. The plea was noted, after which the statements of Mellor and Cole were admitted without objection. The witnesses were not required for cross-examination. The prosecutor informed the Magistrate that identification could not be proved because of the rejection of the remaining statements. On this basis her Honour delivered an ex tempore judgment in which she found both defendants not guilty of the charges and dismissed them.
	


The appeal


	
	Although the complete police brief was not served in accordance with the Magistrate’s directions, it was served well within the time required by s 183 of the Criminal Procedure Act since it was served almost five weeks before the hearing and s 183 required only that it be served at least 14 days before the hearing. That a police brief is not served in accordance with the court’s directions does not independently affect its admissibility and provides no basis to reject the evidence.
	
	
	Neither the first defendant’s solicitor, nor the Magistrate, identified any proper basis for excluding the evidence. Section 188(1) did not apply since no non-compliance with “this Division [Division 2 of Part 2 of Chapter 4)] or any rules made under this Division” had been identified. The Magistrate’s primary error was to elevate her Honour’s direction (that the police brief be served by 27 February 2015) and, possibly, the Practice Note, into a statutory requirement of Division 2 of the Act when neither had any such status. Further, Stafford LCM treated herself as being “bound” to reject the evidence, when s 188(2) required her to consider whether to grant dispensation from any such non-compliance on terms.
	
	
	The Magistrate, in considering herself bound to reject evidence by a section which did not, in terms, apply, erred in law. Her orders ought be set aside and the matter remitted for determination.
	
	
	This is sufficient to dispose of the appeal. However, one of the purposes of appeals such as the present is for this Court to provide guidance. For this reason, I propose to set out how s 188 operates in accordance with its terms and to address, by way of illustration, how the discretion in s 188(2) (where applicable) ought be exercised.
	


The operation of s 188 of the Act


	
	Section 188(1) requires the court to refuse to admit evidence if, in relation to the evidence, “this Division or any rules made under this Division have not been complied with by the prosecutor”.
	
	
	Section 188 is only concerned with non-compliance by a prosecutor in relation to particular evidence with a provision of Division 2 of the Act or a rule. Accordingly it requires the particular evidence to be considered and the question to be answered whether there was any non-compliance by the prosecutor in respect of that evidence with a section of Division 2 or a rule. The recitation of relevant statutory provisions set out above demonstrates that there is a significant difference between a statutory provision, a rule, a Practice Note and a direction. Section 188 is concerned solely with a provision within Division 2 or a rule (as defined). No other non-compliance engages the section.
	
	
	If any relevant non-compliance with such a provision or rule can be identified, the Magistrate is obliged, for the purposes of s 188(2), to ask whether the accused person consents to dispensation with the requirements of s 188(1); and, if so, the Magistrate is obliged to dispense with the requirements of s 188(1) “on such terms and conditions as appear just and reasonable”. If the accused person does not consent, the Magistrate is obliged to consider whether the requirements ought be dispensed with and, if so, grant such dispensation “on such terms and conditions as appear just and reasonable”.
	
	
	The discretion conferred on the Magistrate by s 188(2) to dispense with the requirements (of the relevant provision of Division 2 or rule) on such terms and conditions as appear just and reasonable is a broad one and must be exercised judicially. The Act does not list the matters that are to, or may, be taken into account in exercising the discretion. Nonetheless, the purpose of the discretion can be divined from its statutory context and authorities in which this, and analogous discretions, have been considered and exercised.
	
	
	The requirement to serve the police brief is a fundamental aspect of the administration of criminal justice. A defendant is entitled to have adequate notice of all the evidence to be relied upon by the prosecution before the charges are dealt with by the court. The time required to prepare the police brief is necessarily variable. An estimate which seems reasonable at the outset may prove to be optimistic. It is important that a prosecution not be required to be conducted on incomplete evidence since this (as in the present case) is apt to result in an acquittal, which may not have been warranted, if all of the evidence had been available to prove each of the elements of each charge to the requisite standard.
	
	
	A balance is commonly struck by a court’s extending the time within which a police brief is to be served and, if necessary, adjourning the hearing so as not to compromise the defendant’s opportunity to consider the evidence that comprises the police brief in order to make forensic decisions, such as whether to plead guilty or not guilty.
	
	
	In Director of Public Prosecutions v West [2000] NSWCA 103; 48 NSWLR 647 the Court of Appeal considered the statutory predecessor to s 188 (s 66F of the now repealed Justices Act 1902 (NSW)). Of present relevance, Mason P (Sheller and Giles JJA agreeing) said of the discretion in s 66F(3) (now s 188(2)) at [24]:
	


“(h) However (and subject to s 66F(3)), the magistrate may, and on theapplication of or with the consent of the defendant must, dispense with therequirements of subs (1) on such terms and conditions as appear just andreasonable (s 66F(2)). The judicial discretion is a broad one, but it is to beexercised having regard to the public interest in enabling a prosecution to beheard and determined so long as unfairness or injustice does not occur: seefurther par (m), below.

. . .

(m) It is possible to conceive of situations where it would not be just orreasonable to grant to a non-complying prosecuting authority an adjournmentand extension of time pursuant to s 66G. However, the general thrust of s 66G is to ensure that the case is able to proceed, after a suitable adjournment to overcome the prejudice flowing from non-compliance. Section 66G thus fits in with the law as explained by the High Court in Queensland v J L Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 189 CLR 146. There is a legitimate public interest in the conviction of those guilty of crime so long as the fairness of the trial is not compromised: Ridgeway v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 19 at 32 and 75.”


	
	The circumstances of the instant case can be used by way of illustration. Had there been any relevant non-compliance (such as to engage s 188(1)), the following factors would have been relevant to the exercise of the discretion in s 188(2):
	



	
	Whether there was any prejudice to the defendants; and, if so, whether it could be cured or ameliorated: for example, on conditions that included an adjournment (in the present case, no prejudice was identified; and no adjournment sought);
	
	
	The reason for any non-compliance (in the present case, lack of police resources; absence of relevant police officers; the Christmas break; need to canvass the public);
	
	
	The probative value of the evidence and its importance of the evidence to the proof of the offences charged (in the present case, crucial to the proof of the charges, as illustrated by the fact that its rejection deprived the prosecutor of proof of identification and resulted in an acquittal on that basis alone) ;
	
	
	The public interest in determination of criminal proceedings by reference to probative, (otherwise) admissible evidence (which, in the present case, was subverted by the rejection of the evidence); and
	
	
	The public interest in finality and avoiding delays in proceedings (in the present case, relatively slight delay).
	



	
	It appears that Stafford LCM took umbrage that her direction had not been complied with. This matter cannot be said to have influenced her Honour since her Honour’s misreading of s 188 was not only that it applied (when it did not) but that it also deprived her of any discretion (which it did not). However, it is important to note that non-compliance with earlier directions is not a particularly relevant matter to the exercise of the discretion under s 188(2) except where delay has caused prejudice to the defendant which cannot be remedied or ameliorated. Her Honour also appears to have been frustrated by the lack of resources allocated to the local police. While the frustration is understandable (particularly where it leads to court delays) it would not have been a basis for refusing dispensation, unless the delay was such as to create irremediable prejudice to the defendant. It is not part of the purpose of the discretion in s 188(2) to punish the police for lack, or misallocation, of resources.
	
	
	Where the relevant matter was the timing of service of the police brief, the real question, in my view (had there been relevant non-compliance), was whether the proceedings ought to have been adjourned. Since the defendants did not want the proceedings adjourned and no prejudice was identified, the discretionary factors would have greatly favoured dispensation.
	


Orders


	
	I made the following orders at the conclusion of the hearing on 25 February 2016:
	


1.    An order allowing the appeals.

2.   An order pursuant to s 59(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) that the order of Stafford LCM made on 28 April 2015 at Glen Innes Local Court dismissing proceedings against:

		01 March 2016",2016-02-28 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2702007,Zhuang v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2016] NSWCCA 27,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Johnson J.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Shelley Zhuang, seeks leave to appeal against a drug proceeds order under the Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act 1989 (“the Confiscation Act”) made by Acting Judge Williams at the Sydney District Court on 4 April 2014. Following the Applicant’s pleas of guilty and sentencing for drug supply offences, a drug proceeds order was made against her in the sum of $113,390.00.
	
	
	The appeal is brought under s.92(1) of the Confiscation Act, which allows a convicted person to appeal against a drug proceeds order as if it were part of the sentence imposed for the offence in relation to which the order was made: s.92(2). On appeal to this Court, a drug proceeds orders may be confirmed, discharged or varied: s.92(3).
	
	
	As an appeal by a convicted person against a drug proceeds order is to proceed as if it were an appeal against sentence, the Applicant requires leave to appeal under s.5(1)(c) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	


Offences and Sentences


	
	On 22 October 2013, the Applicant was committed for sentence from the Central Local Court on serious drug supply charges. The sentencing hearing took place before Acting Judge Williams on 7 February 2014 and his Honour sentenced the Applicant on 4 April 2014.
	
	
	The Applicant was sentenced for the following offences:
	



	
	Count 1 - an offence of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (a total of 625 grams) between 25 July 2012 and 1 November 2012 at Sydney - an offence under s.25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, for which the maximum penalty was 20 years’ imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
	
	
	Count 2 - an offence of supplying heroin (10.5 grams) between 26 July 2012 and 31 July 2012 at Sydney - an offence under s.25(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 for which the maximum penalty was 15 years’ imprisonment.
	



	
	In passing sentence on Count 1, the Applicant asked that six matters be taken into account on a Form 1, being knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime ($4,790.00 in cash in the Applicant’s possession at the time of arrest), possession of a prescribed restricted substance and four counts of goods in custody.
	
	
	After applying a 25% discount for the Applicant’s pleas of guilty, the Applicant was sentenced on 4 April 2014 as follows:
	



	
	on Count 1, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of three years and six months commencing on 31 October 2012 and expiring on 30 April 2016, with a balance of term of one year and six months expiring on 30 October 2017;
	
	
	on Count 2 - imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years commencing on 1 May 2014 and expiring on 30 April 2016, with a balance of term of one year expiring on 30 April 2017.
	



	
	On the same day, the sentencing Judge made the following additional orders:
	



	
	the drug proceeds order in the sum of $113,390.00, pursuant to s.29(1)(c) of the Confiscation Act;
	
	
	a forfeiture order in the sum of $4,790.00, pursuant to s.18(1) of the Confiscation Act.
	


Facts of Offences


	
	The facts may be stated briefly. An Agreed Statement of Facts was before the sentencing Judge, with that document having been signed by the solicitor for the Applicant.
	
	
	Over a period of three months between July and October 2012, police intercepted approximately 1,400 telephone calls and messages which showed the Applicant was involved in the supply of prohibited drugs. Based on the intercepted calls and messages in which the Applicant discussed the quantity of drugs to be supplied, she supplied 625 grams of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	The intercepted calls revealed, as well, that the Applicant was involved in further methylamphetamine supply transactions where no quantity was mentioned. Accordingly, the quantity of 625 grams was the minimum quantity of methylamphetamine supplied by the Applicant.
	
	
	The Applicant also supplied 10.5 grams of heroin in late July 2012.
	
	
	In the majority of the transactions, the Applicant received a call from a customer and arranged to meet with him or her to supply the nominated drug.
	
	
	The Agreed Statement of Facts revealed that the Applicant received money from the customer when she supplied the drugs. Between 26 July and 31 October 2012, based on the telephone intercepts, it was agreed that the Applicant “received at least $118,180.00 from the supply of prohibited drugs”.
	
	
	On 31 October 2012, the Applicant was arrested by police whilst she was negotiating with a customer to supply him with drugs. She was driving a vehicle with Queensland registration plates and was the sole occupant of the vehicle. She had parked in the vicinity of where she had agreed to meet him at a street corner.
	
	
	Police apprehended her and searched the vehicle. They found a small set of scales, seven mobile telephones (one being the mobile telephone service that had been lawfully intercepted by police) and a purse containing items with her identification and the sum of $4,790.00 in cash, this sum being the subject of the unchallenged forfeiture order. The Agreed Statement of Facts stated that the $4,790.00 was possessed by her “knowing that it was the proceeds of crime, namely the supply of prohibited drugs”.
	
	
	There was nothing in the Agreed Statement of Facts that suggested the Applicant was supplying on behalf of any other person, or anything which could identify the source or sources of the drugs which she supplied to customers over that discrete three-month period.
	


The Applicant’s Subjective Case in the District Court


	
	The Applicant gave evidence before the sentencing Judge. In evidence-in-chief, she said that she had become “quite a heavy user” of drugs when she was supplying drugs, with her habit being “between $700.00 to $800.00 a day” shortly before her apprehension. The Applicant said that that monetary amount equalled about one-and-a-half grams of Ice per day (T5, 7 February 2014; AB82).
	
	
	Under cross-examination, she was asked (T8, 7 February 2014; AB85):
	


“Q. Was it the case you were obtaining those drugs from the persons that you were purchasing the drugs to supply your customers, the drugs that you were using yourself?

A. Yes.”


	
	There was no re-examination by the Applicant’s counsel.
	
	
	In a presentence report, the Applicant informed the author that “She had obtained the drug through boyfriends and associates, for whom she would also sell the drug” and that “She felt stupid because she was of the opinion that she was being used by the associates she was selling drugs for”. (AB69).
	


Application for Drug Proceeds Order and Forfeiture Order


	
	A Summons was filed by the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (“the Director”) in the District Court on 31 January 2014, seeking orders against the Applicant under the Confiscation Act in the terms which were ultimately made on 4 April 2014.
	
	
	In addition, the prosecution trial advocate furnished written submissions dated 6 February 2014 outlining the basis upon which the orders were sought, with submissions of fact and law being made in support of the application.
	
	
	At the sentencing hearing on 7 February 2014, counsel for the Applicant submitted (T9, 7 February 2014):
	


“Effectively even when your Honour looks to the confiscation application and looks to the totality of the telephone intercept material that’s referred to in the agreed statement of facts during the entire offending period the amount that is effectively the subject of the application is $120,000 odd, 116 less the amount that was found on the offender. Dividing that by the 90 days being the three month period which is captured by the offending conduct leaves us with a figure of effectively $1,288 per day as a potential profit margin.”


	
	Towards the end of the sentencing hearing, counsel for the Applicant made short submissions concerning the orders sought under the Confiscation Act. The forfeiture order in the sum of $4,790.00 was not opposed. With respect to the drug proceeds order, counsel for the Applicant did not challenge the law as advanced in the Director’s written submissions. A short submission was made concerning hardship which it was said would flow from the making of the drug proceeds order.
	
	
	In the course of the remarks on sentence, his Honour said (ROS2, AB11):
	


“There can be little doubt that Ms Zhuang’s offending would be categorised as dealing in drugs to a substantial degree. Whilst she was supporting her own significant habit of up to $800 per day she was also making about $500 per day profit as revealed by the facts.” 


	
	A little later, his Honour said (ROS4; AB13):
	


“As to the objective seriousness of the offence I note sequence 47 involved 388 separate transactions from which she received $116,580, although how much of that she retained is not known. I note her several boyfriends used her to run street deals to obtain drugs for herself and money for them. She supplied altogether 625 grams of methylamphetamine which is midway between a commercial quantity 250 grams and a large commercial quantity of 1,000 grams. She supplied 10.5 grams of heroin, the indictable quantity being 5 grams and the commercial quantity 250 grams.” 


	
	In the remarks on sentence, the sentencing Judge addressed the orders sought under the Confiscation Act in the following way (ROS6-7; AB15-16):
	


“I have also been asked to make some other orders. They are that pursuant to s 29(1) the respondent, Ms Zhuang, pay a pecuniary penalty of $113,390 and that pursuant to s [18(1)] the cash found on her of $4,790 be forfeited to the State.

At the hearing of this matter there was submissions made in respect of both those issues. I think it is fair to say that Ms Paul for Ms Zhuang does not resist the order for the $4,790 but asks that consideration be given to assessing the amount of the pecuniary penalty. The Crown has made some helpful written submissions and has referred me to the case of R v Hall 2013 NSWCCA 47 in which an earlier case of Fagher was referred to. 

One of the things that this kind of legislation tends to do away with is considerations as regard to hardship and the like. 

As far as the application under s 29(1) is concerned what that section requires the Court to do is (a) determine whether the defendant has derived any benefit in connection with drug trafficking at any time.

and (b) if the Court believes that the offender has so benefited assess the value of any such benefit.

and (c) order the defendant to pay to the State a pecuniary penalty equal to the amount so assessed. 

The expression in the legislation of deriving any benefit in connection with the drug is fairly encompassing it seems to me. Whilst at first blush one could perhaps argue that the benefit that Ms Zhuang received from the sale of the drugs was the personal profit to her, the fact of the matter is that whilst there was a personal profit to her a benefit was also derived by the sale of the drugs, even if part of the proceeds of that sale were used to purchase drugs for herself. The provisions are fairly draconian, obviously meant to deal with situations of commercial drug activity which it would be hard not to classify this as and furthermore the legislation seems to be extremely incapable of a great deal of interpretation.

Despite the arguments that have been made on her behalf I don’t think that I have any alternative but to make the orders sought. So that I make an order under s 29(1) that she pay a pecuniary penalty in the amount indicated and that under s 18(1) the amount indicated to be forfeited to the State.”

The Applicant’s Ground of Appeal


	
	The sole ground of appeal asserts that his Honour erred in failing to take into account relevant considerations when determining that he had no alternative but to make the orders sought by the Director pursuant to s.29(1) of the Confiscation Act, and that his Honour erred in his assessment of the amount that the Applicant ought be ordered to pay.
	


Submissions of the Parties

The Applicant’s Submissions


	
	Mr Averre, counsel for the Applicant (who did not appear below), submitted that the sentencing Judge had failed to properly undertake the process of assessment required under ss.29 and 30 of the Confiscation Act where an assessment of a drug proceeds order is required. He submitted that his Honour did not address issues raised at the sentencing hearing which may bear upon that assessment, including the reference to other persons who were involved in the Applicant’s drug supply activities.
	
	
	Mr Averre referred to the decisions of this Court in R v Hall [2013] NSWCCA 47; 227 A Crim R 544 and Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Colakoglu [2015] NSWCCA 301 in his submissions.
	
	
	Mr Averre acknowledged that the argument he was advancing in this Court had not been made at first instance by counsel for the Applicant. He submitted, however, that the Court should approach the matter upon the basis that error had been demonstrated, and that the matter should be remitted to the District Court under s.12(2) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 so that the application for a drug proceeds order against the Applicant could be reheard.
	


Submissions for the Director


	
	The Director submitted that no error had been demonstrated in this case.
	
	
	It was submitted that it was not open to the Applicant to seek to contest the application for a drug proceeds order in this Court upon a basis that was not run at first instance: Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; 223 A Crim R 460 at 477-478 [79]-[82].
	
	
	The Director noted, in any event, that the quantum of the drug proceeds order in this case constituted a minimum figure based upon the quantified amounts of drugs referred to in intercepted conversations. It was noted that a complete assessment, which may be undertaken by reference to the further 40% of the Applicant’s offences which were not included in the calculation, may see a gross claim against the Applicant in the order of $200,000.00 if the matter was to be reopened.
	


Decision


	
	It is necessary for the Applicant to demonstrate error on the part of the primary Judge.
	
	
	In considering whether error is demonstrated, it is appropriate to have regard to the manner in which the proceeding below was conducted on behalf of the Applicant, and to consider what issues were raised at first instance.
	
	
	There is a practical expectation that an offender’s legal representative will make submissions to the sentencing Judge at first instance by reference to the particular factors which are sought to be taken into account on sentence: Zreika v R at 478 [80]. Similar considerations arise with respect to an application for a drug proceeds order under the Confiscation Act.
	
	
	In this case, the Director had filed a Summons notifying his intention to seek such an order and had made written submissions in support of the application.
	
	
	The Agreed Statement of Facts provided a substantial foundation for the making of the order. The Agreed Statement of Facts in this case disclosed material which was pertinent for the purposes of ss.29, 30 and 31 of the Confiscation Act.
	
	
	Although there was some reference in passing to the Applicant’s male acquaintances who were, in some way, said to be involved in the drug supply activities, there was no identification of these persons nor any specification of their alleged roles. The observations of the sentencing Judge in the remarks on sentence (referred to at [28] above) appear to have been drawn from the presentence report.
	
	
	The oral evidence of the Applicant did not provide a foundation for this aspect to be further explored on the application. Nor was any submission made on behalf of the Applicant that the issue should be explored on the Confiscation Act application.
	
	
	It is not necessary to elaborate, on this application, upon the principles applicable under the Confiscation Act, as considered in cases such as R v Hall and Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Colakoglu.
	
	
	In my view, this case is far removed from that considered by this Court in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Colakoglu. In that case, there were several convicted co-offenders who had been involved in drug supply activity, and in relation to whom drug proceeds orders were sought. It was there observed (at [96]) that the Director had sought “drug proceeds orders against multiple co-offenders using a process of double counting”. The process of assessment of the value of benefits in that case involved different considerations (and different evidence) to the present application.
	
	
	In this case, a drug proceeds order was sought against a single offender. The Agreed Statement of Facts disclosed that the sum of at least $118,180.00 had been received by the Applicant in the course of her drug supply activities. Deducted from this figure was the sum of $4,790.00 in cash which was found in her possession.
	
	
	In circumstances where there were, at best, vague references to the activities of the Applicant’s unidentified male acquaintances in the drug supply activity, it could not be said that there was any real foundation to make an assessment under ss.29-31 of the Confiscation Act in a figure different to that ordered by the primary Judge.
	
	
	The Applicant has not established that the primary Judge failed to have regard to relevant considerations in the circumstances of this case.
	
	
	It should be observed that, even before this Court, there was no evidence from the Applicant, in the form of an affidavit or otherwise, which purported to set out what it was that she would have wished to say in the event that the Court acceded to the application to remit the matter to the District Court.
	
	
	The primary Judge in this case undertook the assessment process in accordance with ss.29-30 of the Confiscation Act by reference to the evidence before the District Court. No error has been demonstrated on the part of the primary Judge in this respect.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	grant leave to appeal;
	
	
	dismiss the appeal against the drug proceeds order made against the Applicant on 4 April 2014;
	
	
	confirm the drug proceeds order made against the Applicant on 4 April 2014 in the District Court.
	



	
	DAVIES J: I agree with Johnson J.

	BUTTON J: 
	


Introduction


	
	On 22 February 2016, an application was made to this Court on behalf of Mr Neil Chidiac, pursuant to s 39A of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 (Cth) (the Act). The relevant portions of that section are as follows:
	


39A Requests by Attorney‑General on behalf of a defendant

(1) If a defendant in a proceeding relating to a criminal matter thinks that it is necessary for the purposes of the proceeding that:

(a) evidence should be taken in a foreign country; or

…

the defendant may apply to the relevant court (see subsection (1A)) for a certificate that it would be in the interests of justice for the Attorney‑General to make any appropriate request to the foreign country under Part II, III or IV so that:

(e) the evidence may be taken; or

…

(1A) For the purposes of subsection (1), the relevant court is:

(a) if the proceeding is being heard in the Federal Court of Australia - - that Court; or

(b) otherwise - - the Supreme Court of the State or Territory in which the proceeding is being heard.

(2) Before making a decision on the application, the court must give an opportunity to:

(a) all parties to the proceeding; and

(b) the Attorney‑General;

to appear before the court and be heard on the merits of the application.

(3) In deciding whether to issue a certificate, the court must have regard to the following matters:

(a) whether the foreign country is likely to grant such a request made by the Attorney‑General on behalf of the defendant;

(b) the extent to which the material (whether it is evidence, a document, an article or a thing) that the defendant seeks to obtain from the foreign country would not otherwise be available;

(c) whether the court hearing the proceeding would be likely to admit the material into evidence in the proceeding;

(d) the likely probative value of the material, if it were admitted into evidence in the proceeding, with respect to any issue likely to be determined in the proceeding;

(e) whether the defendant would be unfairly prejudiced if the material were not available to the court.

(4) Subsection (3) does not prevent the court from having regard to any other matter that it considers relevant.

(5) If the court issues a certificate:

(a) the court must send a copy of the certificate to the Attorney‑General; and

(b) the Attorney‑General must, in accordance with the certificate, make a request on behalf of the defendant to the foreign country for international assistance unless he or she is of the opinion, having regard to the special circumstances of the case, that the request should not be made.


	
	The submission made before us was that it would be in the interests of justice for the Commonwealth Attorney-General to make a request to the Solomon Islands that evidence be taken from a Mr Alfred Oti. The subject matter of the certificate that was sought is itself derived from s 12 of the Act:
	


12 Requests by Australia

(1) Australia may request the appropriate authority of a foreign country:

(a) to arrange for:

(i) evidence to be taken in the foreign country; or

(ii) a document or other article in the foreign country to be produced;

for the purposes of a proceeding or investigation relating to a criminal matter in Australia; and

(aa) if subparagraph (a)(i) applies - - to arrange for a tape recording to be made of the evidence to be taken; and

(b) to arrange for the evidence (and if paragraph (aa) applies, the tape recording or a copy of it), document or other article to be sent to Australia.

(2) To remove any doubt, it is stated that:

(a) any evidence may be taken; or

(b) any document or other article may be obtained;

in the foreign country even though, under Australian law:

(c) the evidence could not have been taken; or

(d) the document or other article could not have been obtained;

by using in the circumstances processes similar to those used in the foreign country.

(3) When making a request under subsection (1), Australia may also request that an opportunity be given for the person giving evidence, or producing the document or other article, to be examined or cross‑examined in person, or through a video link from Australia, by:

(a) any party to the proceeding or that party’s legal representative; or

(b) any person being investigated or that person’s legal representative.


	
	The parties were in agreement that the conviction appeal of the applicant, which is part heard in this Court, falls within the definition of “a proceeding relating to a criminal matter” as that concept is understood by the Act. Nor was it disputed that, pursuant to s 39A(1A)(b) of the Act, it was appropriate for the application to be made to the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	In accordance with s 39A(2) of the Act, both parties to the proceeding and the Commonwealth Attorney-General were given an opportunity to be heard on the application. Correspondence was received by the Registrar of this Court from the Attorney-General’s Department to the effect that neither the Attorney-General nor the Minister for Justice wishes to be heard.
	
	
	Both the applicant and the Crown were represented by counsel, and the latter opposed the granting of the certificate.
	


Procedural history


	
	The background of the application may be shortly stated. In 1989, the applicant was convicted of conspiring to import a traffickable quantity of heroin, contrary to s 233B of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). He was sentenced to many years in prison. Mr Oti was a significant Crown witness at the trial.
	
	
	In December 1989, an appeal against conviction to this Court was dismissed: see R v Chidiac; R v Asfour (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 15 December 1989, unrep).
	
	
	In 1991, special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia was refused: see Chidiac v R [1991] HCA 4; (1991) 171 CLR 432.
	
	
	The applicant spent many years in prison. His sentence has now completely expired, and he is at liberty.
	
	
	On 9 March 2015, Beech-Jones J referred “the entire matter” to this Court as an appeal against conviction, pursuant to s 79(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW): see Re Chidiac [2015] NSWSC 157. It can be seen that an important factor in the reasoning of his Honour was that there was material to the effect that Mr Oti had recanted the evidence he gave in the trial, by way of a signed document in 1994, and in a video-recorded interview that was broadcast on television in 1997.
	
	
	The matter came on for hearing before Macfarlan JA, Button J and Fagan J on 28 October 2015. Ultimately, an application for an adjournment was made and granted, so that all of the fresh evidence to be relied upon by the applicant could be, to the extent reasonably practicable, placed into an admissible form. That included making efforts either to have Mr Oti attend to give evidence orally in the witness box; or to have his evidence taken on commission in the Solomon Islands (where he was last known to reside); or to have his evidence taken by audio-visual link from that nation; or, if none of those things can be achieved and all of the preconditions of admissibility pursuant to s 65 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) are able to be made out, by way of the tender of documents.
	
	
	On 10 February 2016, a number of notices to produce were issued by this Court; at this stage, some documents have been produced, and some of the notices are pending.
	
	
	As for inquiries made with regard to the whereabouts of Mr Oti, they have been reasonably extensive on the part of both parties. They have not borne fruit. On the evidence one cannot be satisfied that Mr Oti is indeed still alive, and, if he is, that he is still present in the Solomon Islands.
	


Submission


	
	Senior Counsel for the applicant submitted that all of the mandatory matters for consideration contained in s 39A(3) of the Act argued in favour of the certificate being granted.
	
	
	The point was also made that, on the last occasion, the court indicated that fresh evidence must be presented in accordance with the rules of evidence. Accordingly, it was submitted, all that can reasonably be done to obtain the evidence of Mr Oti should be done, and this Court should play its part in that.
	
	
	It was emphasised that the assessment of the credit of Mr Oti will be a very significant part of the conviction appeal.
	
	
	It was accepted by senior counsel that it is most unlikely that, within the two weeks between the day of the application and the day of the hearing, the certificate will be transmitted from Sydney to Canberra; the request will issue from Canberra to Honiara; Mr Oti will be located by the government of the Solomon Islands; arrangements will be made for the taking of videotaped evidence; and arrangements will be able to be made for the attendance of counsel so that examination-in-chief and cross-examination can take place. The submission was made, however, that one can but try.
	
	
	Finally, it was made clear that the ancillary motivation for the application is so that, as necessary, the applicant can in due course submit that he has taken all reasonable steps for the purposes of s 65 of the Evidence Act, in support of a submission that Mr Oti is unavailable and that hearsay evidence of his prior representations should be admitted.
	
	
	The Crown opposed the granting of the certificate, albeit not forcefully.
	
	
	It was first said that the application had come too late, and should have been made shortly after the referral by Beech-Jones J, almost one year ago.
	
	
	The second submission in opposition was that, reasonably extensive enquiries having been made by both parties, the granting of the certificate, and the making of any request of the Solomon Islands, will almost certainly be a futile exercise.
	


Determination


	
	Turning to my determination, there is force in the proposition of the Crown that all of this is being done very late; indeed, perhaps too late.
	
	
	One can also accept that the issue of a certificate by this Court is very unlikely to lead to Mr Oti being located and examined on oath.
	
	
	Having said that, it is quite correct that an assessment of the credibility of Mr Oti is a very significant part of the conviction appeal. That assessment could be made far more readily if there were a recent video-taped examination of him, rather than if the court were merely seeking to discern where the truth lies in a number of documents (including the film of the interview broadcast in 1997). Whilst one may accept that a certificate and a request are very unlikely to find success, still and all there is force in the argument that the extra effort should be made, on the off-chance that it bears fruit.
	
	
	Turning to the mandatory matters for consideration, no material was placed before us as to the likelihood of the Solomon Islands granting such a request: s 39A(3)(a) of the Act. But I think that one can take judicial notice of the fact that Solomon Islands is a close neighbour of Australia, and that the two nations are on generally friendly terms.
	
	
	Secondly, if the court is deprived at the hearing of the appeal of recent evidence on oath from Mr Oti, it will not otherwise be available: s 39A(3)(b) of the Act. As I have said, assessment of his credibility on the basis of documents only will be a much inferior procedure.
	
	
	Thirdly, if Mr Oti were able to be located and examined on oath, it is highly likely that the Court of Criminal Appeal would admit that material into evidence in the conviction appeal: s 39A(3)(c) of the Act.
	
	
	Fourthly, sworn evidence of Mr Oti of 2016 relating to the truthfulness or otherwise of his evidence in the Crown case in 1989 would be likely to be of very high probative value in the conviction appeal: s 39A(3)(d) of the Act.
	
	
	Fifthly, I do not believe that the applicant would be unfairly prejudiced, in the strict sense, by the unavailability of a recent sworn version of Mr Oti: s 39A(3)(e) of the Act. But it would be highly advantageous to him (and indeed the Crown) for such evidence to be available.
	
	
	In short, every mandatory consideration, along with the overarching factor of the centrality of the assessment of the credibility of Mr Oti in a conviction appeal for a very serious offence (with respect to which a judge has experienced a sense of doubt or unease), argues in favour of us granting the certificate, despite the fact that it will very likely be fruitless.
	
	
	In short, I consider that this Court should grant a certificate that it would be in the interests of justice for the Commonwealth Attorney-General to make a request to the Solomon Islands that the appropriate authority of that nation arrange for evidence to be taken in the Solomon Islands from Mr Alfred Oti; arrange for a tape-recording to be made of the taking of that evidence; arrange for a copy of that tape-recording to be sent to Australia; and that an opportunity be given for Mr Oti, when giving evidence, to be examined and cross-examined (either in person or through a video link to Australia) by the legal representatives of the applicant, Mr Neil Chidiac, and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions.
	
	
	I propose the following order:
	



	
	A certificate is to be issued by the Registry of the New South Wales Criminal Court of Appeal pursuant to s 39A of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 (Cth) that it would be in the interests of justice for the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth to make a request to the Solomon Islands that evidence be taken from Mr Alfred Oti of unknown address and occupation; that that evidence be tape-recorded on video tape; and that an opportunity be given for the legal representative of Mr Neil Chidiac and of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to examine and cross-examine Mr Oti, either in person or through a video-link from Australia.

2702023,Elwood v R [2016] NSWCCA 18,"Judgment


	
	MEAGHER JA: At about 6pm on 1 May 2011, four men went to a house in Marshall Street, Ashmont, a suburb of Wagga Wagga. Mr G lived at that address with his son, JG, who at that time was 17 years old. Because JG was a juvenile when the relevant offences were committed, the full names of the victims cannot be used: Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW), s 15A. Mr G was a small-time dealer of marijuana. In the events that followed he was assaulted and stabbed to death. His son, who was in the house, was also stabbed.
	
	
	On 11 March 2014 Luke Elwood, who I will refer to as the appellant, and three co-accused, Bevan McKellar, his brother Ethan McKellar and the appellant’s cousin, Douglas Dennis, were each arraigned for trial before R A Hulme J on the following three charges:
	


1.   That on 1 May 2011 at Ashmont in the State of New South Wales he did murder Mr G.

2.   That on 1 May 2011 at Ashmont in the State of New South Wales he wounded JG with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

3.   That on 1 May 2011 at Ashmont in the State of New South Wales, being armed with an offensive weapon, he assaulted Mr G with intent to rob him.


	
	Each pleaded not guilty to the three charges.
	
	
	On 9 April 2014 the jury found Ethan and Bevan McKellar guilty of murder (count 1), wounding with intent (count 2) and armed assault with intent to rob (count 3). The appellant and Mr Dennis were found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter (count 1). Each was found not guilty of wounding with intent (count 2). The appellant was found guilty of armed assault with intent to rob (count 3) and Mr Dennis was found not guilty of that count.
	


The grounds of appeal


	
	The appellant seeks leave to appeal from his conviction on count 3 under s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). Two grounds are relied upon. They are:
	


1.   The verdict was not reasonable or supported by the evidence.

2.   When regard is had to the verdicts of the jury in relation to the co-accused Mr Dennis on counts 1 and 3, the verdict of guilty in relation to the appellant on count 3 is a miscarriage of justice.

The Crown case

Overview


	
	The Crown’s case was that the four co-accused went to the deceased’s home with an intention to rob him, and that two weapons were brought with the men; a machete and a knife. The Crown alleged that the appellant and Mr Dennis were aware, before they arrived at the house, that Ethan McKellar was carrying the machete. The armed assault (count 3) occurred when the deceased was punched by Bevan McKellar at the front door of the Marshall Street premises. The murder of Mr G was charged on the basis that there was either a joint criminal enterprise to rob Mr G or a joint criminal enterprise to assault him, the latter arising once the initial intention to rob, as charged by count 3, had been thwarted by JG’s presence and Mr G’s response to being punched at the front door.
	
	
	None of the four accused gave evidence at the trial. JG was the principal witness for the Crown. There were two other eye witnesses to the stabbing of Mr G. They were Samuel Avo and Marie Uwase who lived next door to the deceased. The appellant and Mr Dennis gave electronically recorded interviews (ERISPs) to the police. Those recordings were tendered in the case against each interviewee, and admitted on that limited basis.
	


The facts


	
	1 May 2011 was a Sunday. On that afternoon the offenders, other than Mr Dennis, were drinking at a house in Connorton Street. At some stage they were joined by Mr Dennis. Around 6pm the four men travelled to Mr G’s house in a car driven by Mr Dennis. On the way they stopped at a house in Blakemore Avenue, where Ethan McKellar left and then returned to the vehicle. Marshall Street runs in a north-south direction with the even numbered houses commencing at its southern end (and on its western side) where it forms a T-intersection with Mumford Street. The car was parked around the corner and in Mumford Street, about five or six houses distant from Mr G’s address.
	
	
	The four men were wearing “hoodies” which were pulled over their heads. At least two of them were also wearing caps. It was becoming dark. They proceeded on foot in a northerly direction along Marshall Street to Mr G’s address. Bevan McKellar and Mr Dennis stood outside the front door, which was on a small raised verandah, whilst the appellant and Ethan McKellar stood at the bottom of the three steps leading to that verandah. From where they were standing, with their backs to the front brick wall of the house, the latter two could not be seen by someone opening the door from inside the house. However, by leaning forward or moving slightly the appellant and Ethan McKellar could see what was going on at the top of the stairs. The house had an exterior screen door and a wooden door. When facing the door from the outside, the screen door hinged from the right and opened outwards. The wooden door hinged from the right and opened inwards. Bevan McKellar was standing to the left of Mr Dennis, who was facing that front door.
	
	
	When the deceased answered the door, Mr Dennis asked for a “stick”. JG, who was in a bedroom of the house with his girlfriend and watching a movie, heard the knock on the door, heard his father go to the door to answer it and heard an exchange along the lines: “fuck, there’s a few of yas” and “we are just looking for a stick”. The deceased moved back into the house to retrieve the “stick”, returned a short time later and started to open the screen door. According to the appellant’s ERISP, as the deceased went back into the house, Ethan McKellar pulled the machete out from underneath his shirt and started to walk up the steps.
	
	
	The next thing that JG heard was a thudding on the ground and loud noises. He opened the door from his bedroom to see his father lying on the ground on his back with his feet towards the door. A person in a white or grey jumper (identified as Bevan McKellar) was standing over his father, just inside the doorstep, “trying to come in”. As he was looking to “walk over” Mr G, the person glanced up at JG “really quick” and then turned around and ran outside. At the same time, Mr G got up and chased the man in the white hoodie. JG followed behind his father, who ran down the verandah steps, to the left and onto the neighbour’s front lawn, where he tripped. That was the lawn of the premises in which Marie Uwase and her boyfriend, Samuel Avo, were having dinner with her children.
	
	
	According to the evidence of JG, after Mr G fell over, the man in the white hoodie turned around and kneed him in the body area. JG then punched that man in the face. JG turned around and saw another man in a black jumper, who he identified as Ethan McKellar, pull out a knife with a blade about 20 cm long. Ethan McKellar stabbed JG when he put his right arm up to protect himself. Bevan McKellar shouted “kill the cunt”. JG turned around and ran back up the stairs and onto the verandah. He then remembered that his girlfriend was inside. He stopped, turned and jumped the railing at the front of the verandah, landing on his father’s car which was parked on the lawn. He rolled off the car and was kneed in the face by the man in the white hoodie. He then felt a “cool feeling” across his lower back, and continued to run to his right and into the neighbouring property. That was the second time he was stabbed. These two stabbings were the subject of count 2. The two men then stopped chasing JG.
	
	
	The Crown case was that whilst the McKellars were assaulting JG, the other two offenders must have had some physical altercation with Mr G that resulted in his moving to a position on the grass near the streetlight outside the front of Ms Uwase’s property. After he had retreated to the front verandah, JG saw his father near that streetlight on his hands and knees, curled over and surrounded by four men. He described two of those men as holding his father by the back of his shirt. He saw one of the men, wearing a black hoodie, stab his father in the back. He yelled out “get off him” and then saw the four men run off and down Marshall Street, in a northerly direction towards Webb Park. JG ran inside to get his phone and call emergency services. As he returned to the front door, his father walked into the house. He was bleeding. The ambulance and police arrived shortly afterwards.
	
	
	Dr Stephen Wills, the forensic pathologist who carried out an autopsy of Mr G, found and described four stabbing or sharp force injuries. The principal and fatal injury was a large stab wound to the left side of the back of the chest, which penetrated through two ribs and into the upper lobe of his left lung. There was a further stab wound in the middle of the back penetrating through a right rib and entering the chest cavity. The remaining injuries were a shallow puncture type mark to his front, on the left side of the chest, and a shallow wound on the underside of his chin.
	
	
	Mr Avo gave evidence that from his front door (behind a closed flyscreen) he saw one man on his knees surrounded by four people in the front yard, almost at the end of the grass and close to the street. There were two people “right in front of the person on the ground on all fours and there were two behind him”. Three of the men wore dark clothing and one wore light clothing. The man in the light clothing was kicking the person on the ground in the chest and head area. He also had a metal object in his hand, but did not use it. The two men standing right behind the man on the ground were dressed in dark clothing. One of them, standing to the left of the man on the ground was urging the others by saying “get the cunt, get the cunt”. Mr Avo saw all of the men run in the direction of Webb Park, leaving together.
	
	
	Ms Uwase gave evidence that she was standing outside on the front porch and saw four people around a person lying on the ground at the front of her property. Those men were kicking the man on the ground and preventing him from getting up. She saw them stop him from fleeing on three occasions. She also recalled one of the men, although she could not remember which one, holding something like a knife. Eventually JG came out and the men started telling each other “let’s go, let’s go, let’s go”.
	


The appellant’s case at trial


	
	The appellant denied that he was a party to any plan or agreement, either to rob Mr G or to assault him. He also denied that he was aware that Ethan McKellar was carrying the machete before it was produced at the bottom of the stairs leading to the deceased’s verandah (see [10] above). He gave two ERISPs. In the first he said that he and the others went to the deceased’s house to buy a “stick” and that he did not see who stabbed the deceased. He agreed that one of the four had stabbed him. He denied it was him. In the second he maintained that he believed they were going to pay for the “stick”. He agreed that the vehicle had stopped in Blakemore Avenue before it was parked near Marshall Street. He maintained his denial that he became aware that Ethan McKellar was carrying the machete before it was produced. He recalled Ethan McKellar chasing JG around the car, and stated that Ethan must have “come across and stuck the knife in him”. He said it all happened “real quick”, that he was “standing up in shock” and “just took off”. He denied being involved in the deceased’s death, or in the assault on either the deceased or his son. Those denials in relation to Mr G were inconsistent with the evidence of JG, Mr Avo and Ms Uwase which, whilst not identifying the appellant, implicated four persons in the assault in which the deceased was fatally stabbed.
	


The elements of the Crown case on counts 1 and 3

Count 1 – alternative verdict of manslaughter


	
	The alternative verdict of manslaughter was founded on a robbery-based or assault-based extended joint criminal enterprise. It was accepted at trial and on appeal that to succeed on this charge, the Crown was required to prove:
	


1.   That at the time Mr G was stabbed, there was an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement, the object of which was to rob him; or an agreement, the object of which was to assault him;

2.   That the relevant accused was present and a party to that agreement;

3.   That the relevant accused contemplated the possibility of deliberate infliction of bodily harm on Mr G by a person who was a party to the agreement;

4.   That one of the parties to the agreement deliberately inflicted bodily harm on Mr G by an act that was both unlawful and dangerous; and

5.   That Mr G died as a result of that act.


	
	Again, it was not controversial at trial or in this Court that, irrespective of whether the agreement was to rob or to assault Mr G, it was necessary that the jury be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the infliction of bodily harm by stabbing, as occurred, was reasonably within the scope of what the relevant accused contemplated might possibly occur in the course of the robbery or assault. In other words, as the trial judge directed the jury in writing, what occurred in relation to the infliction of bodily harm had to be consistent with what was contemplated.
	


Count 3 – armed assault with intent to rob


	
	To make out the charge of assault with intent to rob, again on the basis that there was a joint criminal enterprise, the Crown was required to prove:
	


1.   That at the time Mr G was punched by Bevan McKellar, there was an understanding or arrangement, amounting to an agreement, the object of which was to rob him;

2.   That the relevant accused was present and a party to that agreement;

3.   That the relevant accused was aware that a party to the agreement was armed with an offensive weapon; and

4.   That a party to the agreement assaulted Mr G, with the intention of taking his property without his permission.

Ground 1: unreasonable verdict on count 3

Relevant principles


	
	The question for this Court is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of the appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt; in other words, “whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant’s guilt”: Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at [113] (Hayne J, Gleeson CJ and Heydon J relevantly agreeing), citing M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 492-493.
	
	
	In answering that question the Court has to make its own independent assessment of the sufficiency and quality of the evidence: SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400. In doing so, it is required to give full weight to the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt, and has had the advantage of having heard and seen the witnesses: M v The Queen at 493. Ordinarily a reasonable doubt entertained by this Court would be one which the jury also ought to have experienced, except where the jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence could have resolved that doubt. The jury’s advantage is diminished but not removed where that evidence is or includes, as it does here, video recordings of police interviews given by the accused. However even where that is so, there remain the advantages identified by McCallum J in Hawi v R [2014] NSWCCA 83 at [480], which include, when evaluating all of the evidence, that of having seen other witnesses give any conflicting evidence.
	
	
	The appellant’s argument focusses on whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was an agreement to rob Mr G to which the appellant was a party and that he was aware before they arrived at the house that Ethan McKellar was armed with the machete.
	


Reasonable doubt as to whether there was a joint criminal enterprise to rob


	
	The Crown’s case was that the only reasonable explanation for the actions and conduct of the four co-accused, up to and including the point at which Bevan McKellar punched Mr G, was that there was an agreement between them that they would assault and rob him.
	
	
	The principal matters on which the Crown relied as justifying that conclusion were that the vehicle in which the four men arrived had not been parked outside or near the deceased’s house, but rather around the corner in Mumford Street; that all four men went to the house and stood at or nearby the front door, something which would have been unnecessary if the intention was merely to buy a “stick” of cannabis; that each of the men wore a garment with a hood covering his head, and two of them wore caps, those garments serving to obscure at least partially their appearance; that one of the men (Bevan McKellar) had, to the knowledge of the others, previously “ripped [the deceased] off for three sticks”, making it most unlikely that there was any innocent reason for Bevan McKellar to be present at the front door, if there was to be a straightforward purchase of drugs; that Ethan McKellar had concealed and brought a weapon (the machete) with him and pulled it out when Mr G went back into the house to get a “stick”; that Bevan McKellar punched the deceased as soon as he had partially opened the screen door, taking the first opportunity to do so after he had returned to the door and before it was likely that Mr G would recognise him; and that Bevan McKellar then moved to enter the premises by stepping over the prone Mr G, something he would not have done if his intention was merely to assault him.
	
	
	The first argument made by the appellant is summarised as follows in his written submissions:
	


… a critical inadequacy in the Crown case on Count 3 was that there was no evidence that any of the four offenders at any time attempted to take any of the property of the deceased or [JG’s] property either when he was in his house or when he was being assaulted on the front lawn. The cannabis stick which the deceased had brought to the front of the house at the request of the offenders was found by the police to remain in the pocket of the deceased …. None of the offenders made any attempt to grab it or even to reach towards the deceased in any way either when he was standing up or on the ground in his house …


	
	In the absence of such evidence, it was submitted that the Crown had not excluded the reasonable possibility that the four men were there to assault the deceased, or that they were there for some purpose, not necessarily innocent, which was other than to rob him.
	
	
	In response, the Crown points to the following evidence of JG: (tcpt 13/03/14, pp 123-125)
	


Q.   What happened next?

A.   I then heard - that's when I heard the thudding on the ground and loud noises and then I opened my door to see my dad laying on the ground.

Q.   Please, [JG], tell us how he was lying on the ground. Was he on his back or on his side or on his stomach?

A.   On his back.

Q.   Was he lying with his feet towards the door or away from the door?

A.   Towards the door.

Q.   How close to the door were his feet?

A.   Pretty much right, right at the front door.

Q.   Did you see anybody else besides your father when you walked out of your room?

A.   The person in the white jumper. He was standing over him a little bit trying to come in.

Q.   Was he on the doorstep or inside the house or outside before you get to the doorstep still?

A.   He was just inside on the doorstep.

…

Q.   What was this person in white, what was he doing when you first saw him?

A.   He was trying to come into the house.

Q.   How?

A.   By walking over dad.

Q.   You appeared. What happened next?

A.   He looked up at me really quick and then turned around and ran outside.

Q.   Did you get a look at his face?

A.   No.

Q.   What happened next?

A   I seen dad get up and run outside after, and I followed dad outside as well.


	
	These actions of Bevan McKellar (the person in white) were said not to be consistent with his purpose being merely to strike or assault Mr G. If that had been his purpose, it would have been satisfied by the punch thrown and its outcome, or by his continuing to assault Mr G. There would have been no need to step over Mr G in an attempt to enter the house. The Crown also submits that the events which followed – that Mr G got up and ran after Bevan McKellar and was followed by JG – explained why there were no further attempts to take the “stick” or other property of the deceased. Once it became apparent that the deceased was not alone, and that there was another person in the house, the four men withdrew. The events that ensued were a response to the resistance shown by Mr G and JG.
	
	
	In my view the jury were entitled to conclude that the only plausible reason for Bevan McKellar’s attempt to enter the house, having punched Mr G to the ground, was to seize his property, most likely a quantity of cannabis. The fact that he did not take the cannabis that Mr G may have brought to the door was explained by the absence of an opportunity to do so. Bevan McKellar proposed to enter and search the house for cannabis and his punching Mr G, and moving to step over him, were an attempt to do so. The absence of evidence of the kind described in the passage extracted at [26] above did not make it necessary that the jury entertain a reasonable doubt as to whether the plan included the robbing of Mr G.
	
	
	The appellant’s second argument is that several of the circumstances relied upon by the Crown, as justifying the conclusion that there was a plan to assault and rob Mr G, were not made out by the evidence admitted against him. It was also submitted that, to the extent that there was evidence of those circumstances, it did not exclude the reasonable possibility that any agreement between the men fell short of an agreement to rob Mr G.
	
	
	The circumstances to which this argument is directed are described in the appellant’s written submissions (omitting transcript references) as follows:
	


The fact that the car driven by Dennis was not parked on Marshall Street (first point).

The appellant and the three other offenders went to the deceased's house with their hoodies on and their face partially or wholly concealed (second point).

Bevan McKellar was involved by his own admission to Jaykarta Merritt in an act of dishonesty against the deceased where he ripped off the deceased for a number of marijuana cigarettes (third point).

After introducing himself at the front door, Bevan McKellar punched the deceased once causing the deceased to fall to the ground (fourth point). [JG] saw the offender with the white hoodie (Bevan McKellar) start coming in at the door. When [JG] presented himself, that person turned and ran down the stairs (fifth point).

The appellant admitted to the police that he became aware when they arrived at the deceased’s house that Ethan McKellar had concealed a knife under his shirt. He described that knife as a machete (sixth point).


	
	The jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was aware that Ethan McKellar was armed with the machete before the men arrived at the house because in the way the Crown put its case the agreement to assault and rob existed by the time they had arrived at the house. The appellant says that the jury could not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was aware before the machete was produced that Ethan McKellar was armed or that, after that point in time and before Mr G was punched at the front door, he became party to an agreement to assault and rob him.
	
	
	This argument is formulated as follows:
	


True, an agreement to rob can theoretically emerge spontaneously. However the Court would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it emerged spontaneously in this case. Accepting that the appellant only became aware of the machete when they arrived at the house, there was very limited time for such an agreement or understanding to be reached. It was equally possible that there was no agreement or understanding between all four offenders as to what would happen at the deceased’s house. … Alternatively, if an agreement or understanding were reached between the offenders, it is reasonably possible that the agreement was to assault the deceased or intimidate him.


	
	It is convenient to address the appellant’s evidentiary argument first, and then to consider whether for one or other of the reasons argued, the jury should necessarily have entertained a reasonable doubt as to his guilt on count 3.
	
	
	As to the first point: it was submitted that the evidence that the vehicle had not been parked in Marshall Street only emerged from Mr Dennis’ ERISP, which was not admitted against the appellant. That is not correct. There was evidence in the appellant’s first ERISP (Q+A 5) and in his second ERISP (Q+A 94-95, 167-175) of the fact that the vehicle had been parked on one of the corners at the T-intersection formed by Marshall and Mumford Streets.
	
	
	As to the second point: it was not in issue that the appellant was wearing a cotton, short sleeve hoodie on the evening in question. His evidence was that he always wore his hood up. This was said to diminish the significance of his doing so on this occasion. The evidence also was that each of the other three men wore “hoodies” with the hood up. The Crown argued that it was significant that all four men were wearing such clothing on a mild evening that would partially obscure their appearance and make them difficult to identify. That was consistent with their purpose not being an innocent one.
	
	
	As to the third point: it is said that the evidence of Bevan McKellar’s statement to Jaykarta Merritt was not admitted against the appellant. That is correct and the jury was so directed. However, there was also evidence admitted against the appellant that, about a week before the events in question, Bevan McKellar had told him that he “went about a week before and … ripped [Mr G] off for three sticks”: second ERISP (Q+A 138).
	
	
	As to the fourth point: there was evidence, including from the appellant, that he saw Bevan McKellar punch the deceased immediately upon his return to the front door. At that time the appellant was nearby, at the bottom of the stairs: second ERISP (Q+A 95, 142-143, 176-186).
	
	
	As to the fifth point: it is said that there was no evidence that the appellant was aware that anyone had entered or tried to enter the deceased’s house. That is so. The evidence of JG established that Bevan McKellar attempted to enter the residence. It did not establish that the appellant saw him do so. However the Crown did not have to establish that the appellant saw him do so to make out the elements of its case. That case included evidence that the appellant had initially positioned himself with Ethan McKellar at the bottom of the steps leading to the verandah; that before the punch was thrown (and before the deceased had returned to the door) Ethan McKellar had pulled out the machete and walked up the steps; and that when that occurred the appellant had stayed where he was: second ERISP (Q+A 279-280).
	
	
	As to the sixth point: the appellant says that by his answers given in his second ERISP he admitted only that he became aware that Ethan McKellar was carrying the machete when it was actually produced. In the absence of his knowing that fact before they arrived at the house, it is said that the jury should have entertained a reasonable doubt as to whether he was party to any plan to rob Mr G made before that time.
	


Reasonable doubt as to whether appellant knew Ethan McKellar was armed with machete


	
	The appellant’s account on this subject is contained in the following questions and answers in his second ERISP, which was conducted with his mother present. The references to Theresa Honeysett’s house are to the house in Blakemore Avenue where Mr Dennis’ vehicle stopped on the way to Mr G’s house (see [8] above):
	


MRS ELWOOD

Did you see Ethan with the knife?

A   Well, that's the thing, you know, I never seen him but ---

MRS ELWOOD

   When youse got in the car ---

…

MRS ELWOOD

   I just want him to tell the truth, you know.

DETECTIVE SENIOR CONSTABLE TINDAL

Q104   Yeah, that’s all right.

MRS ELWOOD

   … he don’t know what I’m going through.

A   Yeah, I know mum, I understand, that’s what I’m saying fucken, well, [pause] before we jumped in the car I’m pretty sure he had a big machete.

…

Q202   And at that time did you see Ethan carrying anything?

A   Well, that’s when, that’s when we pulled up at Theresa’s.

MRS ELWOOD

   Theresa Honeysett’s?

A   The mother-in-law place. I am sure he told Doug to stop there, but he ran in and grabbed something and come out

…

Q215   So when he got back in the car what did you see Ethan was carrying?

A   I never seen him carrying nothing then, until we got round to the house.

…

Q235 ….

MRS ELWOOD

   How do you know he had a machete then?

A   Well, like I said, I didn’t know until we got around the house, he pulled it out.

MRS ELWOOD

   Oh

A   That’s what I’m telling them.

…

Q311   When was the first time you saw the knife?

A   When we got actually to the house, when old mate was bringing the stick back to the door.

Q312   And where was, who had that, who had the knife?

A   Ethan.

Q313   Ethan had it at that stage or whereabouts was it?

A   Ethan had it.

Q314   Was it out or where was it?

A   Underneath his shirt.

Q315   Underneath his shirt. Could you see the knife at that stage?

A   No.

Q316   Can you describe the knife for us?

A   No.

…

Q322   And is that what he got from the house in Blakemore?

A   Yeah.

Q323   Rightio. How did you know that it was down the front of his pants?.

A   Well, that’s where he pulled it out when he got around to the house.

…

Q350   Yeah. When the car pulled up in Blakemore and Ethan got out of the car and came back with something ---

A   Yeah.

Q351   --- you mentioned before that it was pretty big, so how big was it or is it?

A   About that big.

Q352   And do you know roughly how big that is or not?

A   No.

Q353   O.K. So it’s about probably half a metre?

A   Yeah.

Q354   All right. So you didn’t see it when he sat in the car?

A   (NO AUDIBLE REPLY) [video shows appellant shaking head consistent with indicating no.]

Q355   Cause if it was down his shorts you wouldn’t think you’d be able to sit down, would you?

MRS ELWOOD

   Hey.

A   Well, that’s another thing too, Sarge, that had me buggered, you know.

DETECTIVE SENIOR CONSTABLE TINDAL

Q356   Yeah.

A   And he’s there sitting right next to me, just like you.

DETECTIVE SENIOR CONSTABLE HARRIS

Q357   Yeah.

A   That’s what I’m there thinkin’ too.


	
	The Crown case was that it was open to the jury to treat Q+A 104 as an admission by the appellant that he knew as they sat in the car and before they arrived at Mr G’s house that Ethan McKellar was armed with a machete. It is said on behalf of the appellant that his answer does not in terms describe something that was appreciated at that time, rather it represents his later conclusion as to what the position had been at that earlier point in time. This is said to be apparent from his subsequent answers, especially at Q+A 215, 235, 311 and 323, which deny that he had seen the “machete” or “knife” before it was produced at Mr G’s house. A question for the jury was whether they interpreted the appellant’s account in this way and treated it as sufficiently plausible to give rise to a reasonable doubt as to whether he knew when he was in the car that Ethan McKellar had the weapon (with the result that the Crown would not have discharged its onus).
	
	
	The appellant said that he did not see Ethan McKellar “carrying” anything until they were at the house (Q+A 215); that McKellar did not pull the machete out until that time (Q+A 235); and that the first time he saw the knife was at the house (Q+A 311). It is to be noted that these answers do not in terms deny earlier knowledge that Ethan McKellar was carrying some form of offensive weapon. He also said that Ethan McKellar had asked Mr Dennis to stop at the Blakemore Avenue house and described him as having run in, “grabbed something” (Q+A 202) and come back “with something” (Q+A 350). He said the machete was probably half a metre long (Q+A 353).
	
	
	The jury had to assess those answers in circumstances where other aspects of the appellant’s account were contradicted in critical respects by the evidence in the trial of the three eye witnesses. They had to take account of the size of the machete, the fact that when he returned to the car, Ethan McKellar was seated in the backseat and next to the appellant and that the appellant knew that Ethan McKellar had come back to the car with “something”. They were also entitled to take into account Mrs Elwood’s occasional interruptions (see in particular Q+A 103, 104, 235) and the way in which the appellant answered (especially Q+A 104, 235, 315, 357). Taking all of these matters into account, the jury was entitled to conclude that the appellant believed that, when Ethan McKellar returned to the car and sat beside him, he had a bladed weapon with him, which was concealed under his shirt. The certainty expressed by the answer at Q+A 104 acknowledges as much, as do his later descriptions of where the weapon was concealed.
	
	
	Taking account of that and the other matters relied on by the Crown (see [25] above), it was open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant understood that the plan was to assault and rob Mr G of a quantity of cannabis.
	
	
	For those reasons, and having considered all of the evidence and the arguments made on behalf of the appellant, it is my view that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to his guilt on count 3.
	


Ground 2: miscarriage of justice with respect to count 3 on account of inconsistent verdicts in relation to the co-accused Douglas Dennis


	
	The appellant submits that the jury’s verdicts in finding Mr Dennis guilty of manslaughter and not guilty of assault with intent to rob cannot logically and reasonably stand with their verdict that the appellant was guilty on count 3. In that circumstance it is submitted that this Court should set aside that guilty verdict in order to prevent a possible injustice.
	
	
	There is a distinction between cases of legal or technical inconsistency and, as relied on here, a case of suggested factual inconsistency. As the Court acknowledged in MacKenzie v The Queen [1996] HCA 35; 190 CLR 348 at 366 (proposition 2), the latter may arise between different verdicts affecting the same accused and between different verdicts affecting co-accused or persons tried separately in relation to connected events.
	
	
	In a case such as the present, the test of whether a verdict of guilty should be set aside for inconsistency is one of logic and reasonableness and takes account of the ways in which the jury may realistically reason or rationalise their verdicts. In MacKenzie, at 367, the plurality (Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ) agreed with the following observations of King CJ in R v Kirkman (1987) 44 SASR 591 at 593:
	


[J]uries cannot always be expected to act in accordance with strictly logical considerations and in accordance with the strict principles of the law which are explained to them, and courts, I think, must be very cautious about setting aside verdicts which are adequately supported by the evidence simply because a judge might find it difficult to reconcile them with the verdicts which had been reached by the jury with respect to other charges. Sometimes juries apply in favour of an accused what might be described as their innate sense of fairness and justice in place of the strict principles of law. Sometimes it appears to a jury that although a number of counts have been alleged against an accused person, and have been technically proved, justice is sufficiently met by convicting him of less than the full number. This may not be logically justifiable in the eyes of a judge, but I think it would be idle to close our eyes to the fact that it is part and parcel of the system of administration of justice by juries. Appellate courts therefore should not be too ready to jump to the conclusion that because a verdict of guilty cannot be reconciled as a matter of strict logic with a verdict of not guilty with respect to another count, the jury acted unreasonably in arriving at the verdict of guilty.


	
	Ultimately, the question for this Court is whether the different verdicts are so inconsistent that it is necessary to intervene to prevent a possible injustice if a guilty verdict is allowed to stand: MacKenzie at 368 (proposition 5). I approach that question from the position, explained in relation to ground 1, that I am satisfied on a consideration of all the evidence that it was open to the jury to be satisfied of the appellant’s guilt on count 3 to the required standard.
	
	
	The steps in the appellant’s argument are as follows. First, the verdict of guilty of manslaughter (count 1) for both Mr Dennis and the appellant meant that the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each of them contemplated the possibility of the deliberate infliction of bodily harm through a stabbing injury to the deceased. It is said to follow that the jury must have concluded that each of them was aware that Ethan McKellar had brought a bladed weapon to the deceased’s house.
	
	
	The argument then directs attention to the elements of count 3 (see [20] above), and in particular the requirement that each accused have been party to the agreement to rob. It is submitted that the reason for the jury’s verdict of acquittal on count 3 in relation to Mr Dennis must have been that they were not satisfied that he was party to such an agreement. It is then said that the jury’s different conclusion in relation to the appellant was unreasonable and illogical because in their ERISPs each made similar admissions about why he had gone to the deceased’s premises and as to what had occurred when he arrived. The problem for this argument is that, even if each did make similar admissions, it offers no explanation as to why this Court should proceed on the basis that the jury acted unreasonably in returning its verdict of guilty in relation to the appellant, rather than unreasonably in acquitting Mr Dennis on the same count.
	
	
	There are, in any event, rational bases that may account for the different verdicts. One is that the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was a party to the joint criminal enterprise to rob the deceased, but were not so satisfied in relation to Mr Dennis. That conclusion is not inconsistent with the guilty verdicts on the charges of manslaughter because the Crown’s case on those charges included an assault-based extended joint criminal enterprise. The jury had to assess separately the credibility of the appellant and Mr Dennis in relation to the ERISP of each. It was open to the jury to reject the appellant’s denial of his participation in a plan to assault and rob Mr G, whilst at the same time regarding as reasonably possible Mr Dennis’ account that he did not know what they were going to do.
	
	
	The different verdicts on count 3 may also be reconciled on the basis that, although the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each was party to an agreement to assault and rob Mr G, they were not satisfied that Mr Dennis was aware when they arrived at the house that Ethan McKellar had a knife or similar sharp force weapon. That being the position is not inconsistent with the jury’s verdict of guilty of manslaughter in relation to Mr Dennis because they may have concluded that he only became aware of the existence of a knife after the men had arrived at the premises, but before the assault and stabbing which resulted in Mr G’s death. In his third ERISP, Mr Dennis denied that he had known prior to the stabbing of the deceased that Ethan McKellar had either a machete or a knife. To find him guilty of manslaughter, the jury must have found that he contemplated the possibility of the use of a knife by one or other of the McKellars. When considering count 3 and assessing Mr Dennis’ evidence, including his answers suggesting that he was aware that the machete had been collected from Blakemore Avenue, the jury were entitled to take into account, not only his repeated denials of such knowledge, but also that he was the driver of the vehicle (rather than a passenger seated next to Ethan McKellar) and had not made any admission of seeing McKellar produce the machete at the house.
	
	
	For those reasons I am not satisfied that there was any necessary factual inconsistency between the different verdicts on count 3 in relation to the appellant and Mr Dennis. Furthermore, even if it was difficult to reconcile those verdicts factually, I am not satisfied any inconsistency necessarily indicates that the jury acted unreasonably in returning their verdict that the appellant was guilty on count 3, in circumstances where that verdict was open on the evidence.
	


Conclusion


	
	The orders I propose are that the appellant be granted leave to appeal against his conviction on count 3, but that the appeal be dismissed.
	
	
	McCALLUM J: I agree with Meagher JA, for the reasons his Honour has stated. The critical issue raised by the appellant's grounds is the sufficiency of the evidence that the appellant knew Ethan McKellar was armed with an offensive weapon before the four men arrived at Mr G's house. On the strength of my own assessment of the evidence, I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he did. The position occupied by each man in the car was an important factor against the appellant and an important difference between the cases as against the appellant and Mr Dennis, who was in the driver's seat. The jury may well have reasoned that the appellant could not possibly have missed the fact that Ethan McKellar was armed whereas the Crown had not excluded the reasonable possibility that Mr Dennis remained ignorant of that fact until after their arrival at the house. Based on my viewing of the video of the ERISP tendered by the appellant in the appeal, I am not persuaded that the jury must have entertained a reasonable doubt as to when the appellant became aware of the weapon. He was cooperative, even personable, but not wholly convincing on that issue.
	
	
	I agree with the orders proposed by Meagher JA.
	
	
	BUTTON J: I have made my own assessment of the evidence. I agree with Meagher JA.

There were also a number of matters on two separate Form 1 documents attached to each of the series of offences.


	
	The supply offences were contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The maximum penalty in respect of each of the supply offences was imprisonment for 15 years and/or a fine of $220,000. The possess precursor offence was contrary to s 24A(1)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 in respect of which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 10 years and/or a fine of $220,000. There was no standard non-parole period applicable to any of the offences.

	The applicant was also dealt with for various related offences which were before the Court on two certificates, pursuant to s 166 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Arising from the 2013 arrest there were three charges of possess prohibited drug (5.23 grams cannabis, .73 gram pseudoephedrine and .47 grams heroin) and one charge of possess equipment for administering prohibited drug. From her 2014 arrest, there was a charge of dealing with property reasonably suspected to be proceeds of crime ($5,485). With respect to each of these offences, his Honour entered a conviction with no other penalty pursuant to s 10A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) on the following grounds:
	


(i)   The sentencing judge erred in sentencing the applicant on the basis that she had some criminal history.

(ii)   The sentencing judge erred in combining and/or averaging the applicable discount referable to the applicant’s pleas of guilty for the offences in question.

(iii)   The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND


	
	At about 6.40am on Tuesday, 30 April 2013 police attended an address in Pyrmont Street, Ultimo and executed a search warrant. When police knocked on the door and identified themselves, there was no response and entry was forced into the unit. The applicant and co-offender, Pang Liu, were inside the premises. Pang Liu was the applicant’s de facto partner at that time. The applicant informed the police that she was the sole occupant of the premises and that Mr Liu was only staying the night. Lease papers for the property identified Mr Liu as the only lessee.
	
	
	During a search of the premises, police located two small resealable bags containing a white crystalline substance on a computer desk in the lounge area. They also located an ice pipe and other drug paraphernalia on the kitchen table. When asked about these matters, the applicant said “Because I have a back problem I have to use ice to wake up otherwise I can’t stand up, my back, yeah my back problems”. The applicant was then arrested but remained in the premises during the rest of the execution of the search warrant.
	
	
	Police continued searching the premises and found two small resealable bags containing a white crystalline substance which were located in a black container on top of the speaker in the computer desk. Testing subsequently identified the substance to be 6.92 grams of methylamphetamine. Police found one black coloured set of knuckle dusters under a table in the bedroom, three resealable bags containing four half blue coloured tablets and one brown coloured tablet within a metal tin in a black bag under the computer desk. Police found two resealable bags containing white/brown coloured powder in the same bag, two resealable bags containing white/brown coloured powder under the television in the lounge room. One pouch and two sets of digital scales were found on the computer desk as were one black coloured torch shaped Taser on the computer desk and one black coloured Taser in a box under the computer desk. Police found one black coloured digital money counter on the table in the lounge room, one resealable bag containing a white crystalline substance in a blue coloured Swarovski box in the lounge room and five resealable plastic bags containing 43 brown coloured tablets in a container on a shelf in the dining room. Testing identified those tablets as 10.69 grams of 3, 4-methylenedioxyamphetamine.
	
	
	Three resealable bags containing a clear crystalline substance were found in a sunglasses case in the dining area. Testing identified the substance as 10.46 grams of methylamphetamine. Police found a glass bottle containing a clear liquid on a shelf near the dining table. Testing identified the substance as 47.8 grams of 1-4 butanediol. Police found one resealable bag containing a brown coloured tablet on the table in the dining room and one resealable bag containing brown powder on the dining room table. Testing identified the substance as 0.47 of a gram of heroin.
	
	
	Police found one resealable bag containing a white crystalline substance on a table in the dining room and four resealable bags containing vegetable matter. Testing identified the vegetable matter as 5.23 grams of cannabis leaf. Police found $9,220 in Australian cash under the bed in an envelope in three bundles and a further $800 in cash was found in other parts of the unit. Police found a black notebook and three Apple iPhones and an iPad near the cash underneath the bed and two resealable bags containing white/brown powder. Testing identified this as 0.73 of a gram of pseudoephedrine.
	
	
	The applicant was charged and read her rights. A total of $1,185 in US currency was located in her purse and this was also seized by police. The applicant voluntarily participated in an electronic interview with a Mandarin interpreter present.
	
	
	In the statement, the applicant said that she was unemployed and was not receiving any form of income. She was renting the premises for $580 a week. She allowed friends and other people unknown to her to sleep in the apartment for a small fee. She used ice to self-medicate her back pain. She admitted possession of the cannabis, heroin and what was initially believed to be cocaine but subsequently analysed to be pseudoephedrine. She denied any knowledge of MDMA, methylamphetamine and what was initially believed to be GHB, but subsequently turned out to be 1-4 butanediol. She was in a de facto relationship with Mr Liu. She said that the cash which was located came from him and that he gave her the money to cover a debt and to pay her rent.
	
	
	Mr Liu was searched and three mobile phones were found. His motor vehicle was searched and a quantity of drugs were found. He was charged in relation to the matters arising out of the search of his car and in relation to the drugs and other items located in the apartment.
	
	
	On 17 November 2014 a lawyer representing Mr Liu advised the Court that he had returned to China where he had been arrested and was in custody for drug offences. The court was told that Mr Liu would be unable to return to Australia until his court matters in China were resolved.
	
	
	The applicant obtained bail in relation to this first series of offences in October 2013.
	
	
	The second series of offences occurred on 29 April 2014. On that day police executed a search warrant in respect of premises in Forest Road, Hurstville. The applicant was the sole lessee and resident of those premises. The premises comprised an apartment with one small bedroom, a laundry, bathroom, open kitchen and a combined lounge and dining room. It was necessary for police to force entry into the apartment.
	
	
	When entry was obtained, three persons were in the premises – the applicant, a Mr Silik and a Ms Cruise. Mr Silik tried to prevent the officers from entering by placing a shopping trolley against the door and when entry was obtained he was observed to throw a glass bottle containing brown liquid into the toilet. The bottle smashed and the brown liquid covered the toilet floor and the wall.
	
	
	At the time of entry, the applicant was seated on a couch with a small table in front of her. On the table was a computer and a set of keys attached to a security swipe card. The swipe card belonged to the applicant and provided access to the lift area of the apartment complex. There was a small table to the left of the applicant. On that table was a book entitled ‘Paper Planes’. Police conducted a search of the premises.
	
	
	In the lounge room police found a storage box which contained identification in the name of the applicant and two clear resealable bags containing 2.42 grams of methylamphetamine and one clear resealable bag containing a single 3, 4-methylenedioxyamphetamine tablet, i.e. an ecstasy tablet, weighing 0.29 grams. In other parts of the lounge room police found a clear resealable bag containing 0.88 of grams of heroin and a clear resealable bag containing 0.53 of a gram of crystalline ephedrine. The police located numerous empty resealable bags as well as mobile phones and digital scales in the premises.
	
	
	Police searched the applicant’s purse and located $1,385 in Australian currency in $50 notes. Concealed within a cushion, police found a bundle of Australian currency totalling $1,000 consisting of $50 and $100 notes. Within the bedroom police located a further bundle of $3,100 in Australian currency consisting of $50 and $100 notes concealed within a wrapped up curtain. In total the amount of money seized was $5,485. The applicant said that this money was the proceeds of sex work which she had carried out.
	
	
	When police inspected the ‘Paper Planes’ book on the table in the lounge room they found that it contained a small concealed lockable compartment. Police used a key attached to the applicant’s swipe card to open the compartment. It contained four resealable plastic bags which held 13.89 grams of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	Police took swab samples from the dark brown liquid in the bathroom and located four bottles containing a similar brown liquid. The total weight of the liquid was 3.77 kilograms. This liquid was analysed and found to contain ephedrine. Police also located one litre of xylene in the premises.
	
	
	Police located a 1.25 litre bottle containing 1.364 kilograms of a clear liquid which was later found to contain hypophosphorous acid. These substances, in conjunction with ephedrine and iodine, produce methylamphetamine.
	
	
	On this occasion the applicant declined to participate in a record of interview.
	


Sentence proceedings


	
	Having reviewed the agreed facts, his Honour found that the offences were serious as was demonstrated by the maximum penalties attaching to them. He found that it was clear that the applicant was dealing in drugs to some significant extent and as a consequence, the appropriate penalty would be one of fulltime custody. His Honour noted that no submission to the contrary had been made. He found that the applicant and Mr Liu in relation to the first series of offences, were running a significant drug supply business.
	
	
	His Honour found that the fact that the applicant was prepared to continue her drug supply business while on bail for the first series of offences was a serious aggravating factor. In that context, his Honour said:
	


“I note that the offender has little by way of prior criminal history and is entitled to a finding that she is a person of prior good character. These episodes appear to be out of character for her. She is entitled to be treated with some leniency as a result of this finding.” (Sentence judgment 8.7)


	
	His Honour had regard to the applicant’s subjective case and in particular to a report of Dr Richard Furst, psychiatrist, dated 10 February 2015. The applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings.
	
	
	His Honour found that the applicant started using drugs in 2009 when she met Mr Liu. Mr Liu had returned to China and was not expected back in Australia for a lengthy period of time. It was after meeting him that the applicant became involved in using the drug ice. She had not been a drug user before this.
	
	
	The applicant had a son from an earlier relationship but because of her drug use, her mother came from China and took the child back to China where he currently remains.
	
	
	The applicant continued to use drugs, principally ice and ecstasy. Due to her need for cash, she started working as an escort and sex worker in 2012. Before her involvement with Mr Liu, the applicant had been working for Vodafone for three years. His Honour concluded that the drugs consumed by the applicant had put her into a downward spiral in her life.
	
	
	The applicant in evidence and in the psychiatric report, said that she would like to rehabilitate from drug use and go back to China to retrieve her son. At the time of the sentence proceedings he was aged eight and the applicant wanted him to be educated in Australia. She no longer had any connection with Mr Liu and her son was her major incentive to continue rehabilitation.
	
	
	His Honour concluded that the applicant had reasonable prospects of full rehabilitation. His Honour also found that the applicant had shown some contrition by her plea and he took that into account.
	
	
	It was at this point in the sentence judgment that his Honour said:
	


“Given the seriousness of the offending overall had these cases gone to trial a sentence of seven years imprisonment would have been applied. I note in relation to the first series of offences the offender pleaded guilty just before trial, that is it was a late plea of guilty. In relation to the second series of offences she pleaded guilty in the Local Court. I will allow a combined discount of 17.5% in respect of her pleas of guilty.” (Sentence judgment 9.8)


	
	His Honour found special circumstances and proceeded to impose the sentence set out earlier in these reasons.
	


THE APPEAL

Ground 1 – The sentencing judge erred in sentencing the applicant on the basis that she had some prior criminal history.


	
	The applicant submitted that his Honour made a factual error when he referred to her having “little by way of prior criminal history” when she in fact had no criminal history. She submitted that even though his Honour gave her the benefit of a finding of previous good character, he did so in the context of a finding that she did have some previous (albeit limited) criminal history. The applicant submitted that once clear error is established the Court should not assess whether and to what extent the error influenced the outcome but should proceed to re-sentence.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that the applicant had no criminal history. It submitted that although this was a factual error by his Honour, it did not cause the sentencing discretion to miscarry in that the sentencing judge treated the applicant as a person of good character. The error had no practical consequences and as a result, did not amount to the sort of error identified in House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499.
	


Consideration


	
	In relation to the first series of offences his Honour was clearly in error and at that time the applicant had no criminal history. In relation to the second series of offences, however, the situation is different. At that time the applicant did have a criminal history and the fact of the earlier offending of a similar kind was relevant to the sentence process.
	
	
	In any event, it is clear from the sentence judgment that his Honour’s error produced no practical consequences in the sentence which was imposed and that this is not the sort of error which would entitle this Court to intervene and re-sentence the applicant. This ground of appeal should be dismissed.
	


Ground 2 – The sentence judge erred in combining and/or averaging the applicable discount referable to the applicant’s pleas of guilty for the offences in question


	
	The applicant submitted that his Honour erred when he averaged or combined the applicable discounts as between the first and second series of offences. The applicant submitted that the pleas in each series of offences were of significantly different utilitarian value in that the 2013 pleas were early and worthy of a 25% discount whereas the 2014 pleas were late, coming the day after the date set for trial, and were probably worth in the order of 10%.
	
	
	The Crown accepted this submission and agreed that where there were multiple offences and pleas at different times, the utilitarian value of the plea needed to be separately considered with respect to each offence (R v SY and Anor [2003] NSWCCA 291; R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; 195 A Crim R 1 at [32].) The Crown also accepted that the discounts suggested by the applicant in her submissions of 10% and 25% were appropriate.
	
	
	The Crown identified an error in the applicant’s submissions in that it was the first series of offences in 2013 which were subject to a late plea of guilty and it was the series of offences which occurred in 2014 which were early pleas and thus entitled to a discount of 25%.
	
	
	The Crown having accepted that the sentencing judge was in error by applying a combined discount, also accepted that it would be open to this Court to find that his Honour’s discretion miscarried and that it was necessary for this Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh.
	


Consideration


	
	As the Crown properly conceded, his Honour was in error in applying an average discount to the indicative sentences. For the reasons set out by both the applicant and the Crown, the correct procedure was for his Honour to apply the appropriate discount to each of the indicative sentences. The correct approach was set out by Hamill J (Leeming JA and Fagan J agreeing) in Glare v R [2015] NSWCCA 194:
	


“12   Where a sentencing judge imposes an aggregate sentence under s 53A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), the Judge must record the individual sentences that would have been imposed on each count. These individual “indicative” sentences should represent the sentence after the application of a discount for a plea of guilty or similar: s 53A(2)(b); R v Cahill [2015] NSWCCA 53. In R v Cahill Johnson J (with whom Leeming JA and Schmidt J agreed) said:

“107    The indicative sentences here constituted a series of head sentences. The indicative sentences should have factored in the discount for the Respondent’s pleas of guilty: s.53A(2)(b); JM v R [2014] NSWCCA 297 at [39](3).

108    The sentencing Judge did not comply with the requirements of s.53A(2)(b) and s.54B(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Compliance with s.53A(2)(b) would have seen indicative sentences assessed by taking into account such matters in Part 3 (ss.21-43) or elsewhere in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as were relevant. These included, amongst other things, the Respondent’s pleas of guilty and any factors under s.21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which applied.

109    It was erroneous to select an aggregate sentence and then apply a 25% discount for the Respondent’s pleas of guilty to that sentence. The purpose of s.53A should be kept in mind. In the course of a valuable summary of principles surrounding aggregate sentencing, RA Hulme J (Hoeben CJ at CL and Adamson J agreeing) said in JM v R at [39](1):

‘Section 53A was introduced in order to ameliorate the difficulties of applying the decision in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 in sentencing for multiple offences: R v Nykolyn [2012] NSWCCA 219 at [31]. It offers the benefit when sentencing for multiple offences of obviating the need to engage in the laborious and sometimes complicated task of creating a ‘cascading or 'stairway' sentencing structure’ when the principle of totality requires some accumulation of sentences: R v Rae [2013] NSWCCA 9 at [43]; Truong v R; R v Le; Nguyen v R; R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 36 at [231]; Behman v R [2014] NSWCCA 239; R v MJB [2014] NSWCCA 195 at [55]-[57].’”


	
	Since this error was of significance and may well have affected the aggregate sentence to the detriment of the applicant, it is necessary for this Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh in accordance with the High Court’s decision in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA37; 252 CLR 601 at [40] – [43].
	


Ground 3 – The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive


	
	It is not necessary to further consider this ground of appeal given the applicant’s success in establishing error in respect of ground 2.
	


Submissions on re-sentence of applicant


	
	The Court was advised that during her time in prison the applicant had completed the EQUIPS Addiction Program which comprises 20 sessions. The applicant had advised her solicitors that she would also be willing to participate in any further drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs which were available to her while in custody.
	
	
	The Court has taken these matters into account in re-sentencing.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that although she was on both occasions of offending found in possession of drugs and other illicit substances, the supply offences were deemed rather than actual. She submitted that the quantities of methylamphetamine, which made up all but one of the supply offences were well below the applicable commercial quantities (250g) and fell towards the bottom of the indictable range. The applicant submitted that it was clear that at least some of the drugs were for her personal use. She accepted that while this latter matter was not a mitigating factor per se, it did inform the Court of her motivation for the offending under consideration.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that she was aged 42 at the time of the 2013 series of offences and had no criminal history before that time. Before meeting the co-offender, Pang Liu, and her introduction through him to illicit drugs, she had been gainfully employed and had otherwise led a law abiding life.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that she should not be characterised as a “principal” in relation to either the 2013 or 2014 offences although her involvement was by no means insignificant. She submitted that the drug enterprise on the available evidence could only be described as a relatively unsophisticated street level operation. She submitted that as such her drug addiction as the motivation for the offending was important.
	
	
	In proceedings before this Court (although not raised in the sentence proceedings below) the applicant submitted that the Court should take into account her “relative vulnerability” in relation to the co-offender, Pang Liu. The applicant referred to her evidence that not only did her drug use commence relatively late in life, following the commencement of her relationship with him, but she had lied to the police in relation to the 2013 offences telling them that everything was hers because she was “very scared about this man” (T.13.2.2015 at p5.50). The applicant submitted that her vulnerability to Pang Liu and her exploitation by him was relevant to the objective seriousness of the offending. The applicant also referred to what she had told Dr Furst “that Pang changed and was not treating her well in 2012”.
	
	
	The applicant noted that although his Honour had on several occasions referred to the offending being serious and had indicated that had matters gone to trial a sentence of 7 years would have been likely, he made no specific finding as to the objective seriousness of the offending. The applicant submitted that taking everything into account the objective seriousness of the offending fell comfortably below the midline of objective seriousness for offences of this kind.
	
	
	The applicant placed before the Court a summary of 50 decisions handed down by the courts between 1993 and 2015 where the supply of amphetamines in a less than commercial quantity had been involved. She submitted that by reference to the sentences imposed in those cases, the aggregate sentence imposed in this matter was towards the top of the range. In making that submission, the applicant conceded that there were significant limitations in the use of that statistical material, particularly because of the abbreviated information available in respect of each of the matters.
	
	
	The applicant relied specifically on two decisions as providing a useful guideline to the Court when re-sentencing. The applicant submitted that in R v Wicks [2012] NSWCCA 208 the offender had pleaded guilty to two offences of supply methylamphetamine attracting a 25% discount (the quantities being 28.9g and 26.9g). There were four further supply matters taken into account on a schedule. The offender was involving in the supply of drugs with others, including members of his family. He was of prior good character before the offending. It was the offender’s first time in custody. The sentence imposed (affirmed on appeal) was one of 3 years and 3 months with a non-parole component of 1 year and 9 months.
	
	
	The second case relied upon by the applicant was Miletic v R [2008] NSWCCA 74. There the offender had pleaded guilty (25% discount) to multiple counts of supply (10) including one count of ongoing supply. There were a further eight offences on a schedule of a similar nature. The weights involved were less than a commercial quantity. Except for two of the offences, the drug involved was cannabis. The offender had a prior record although not for drug offences. The offender was the main participant in the enterprise. He received a head sentence of 4 years and 8 months with a non-parole period of 3 years.
	
	
	In summary, the applicant submitted that even allowing for the limitations of such statistics and the fact that only two cases were referred to in detail, this material supported the proposition that the overall offending in this case was such that a lesser sentence was warranted in law. This was particularly so because of her strong subjective case.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the applicant failed to have regard to the findings made by his Honour, i.e. “that the offender was dealing in drugs to some significant extent” and that the applicant and Pang Liu “in relation to the first series of offences were running a significant drug supply business. The fact that the offender was prepared to continue her supply business while on bail for an earlier series of offences is a serious aggravating factor on sentence”. (Sentence judgment 8.3)
	
	
	The Crown submitted that neither of the cases relied upon by the applicant involved offences committed while on bail for earlier serious offences for which the offender was to be sentenced which was a serious aggravating factor in this matter. The Crown also noted that the utilitarian discount for the plea of guilty in each of R v Wicks and Miletic v R was 25%.
	
	
	In relation to R v Wicks the Crown submitted that the offender was a young man aged 24 at the time of sentence whose offending was out of character in that he had otherwise been a good parent and citizen and had not used any prohibited drugs following his arrest. There was evidence before the court of a significant change for the better on his part after his arrest. Importantly, the only ground of appeal was one of parity.
	
	
	In relation to Miletic v R the Crown submitted that there was no evidence that the offender was involved in a large network. He was conducting a small scale drug supply enterprise involving small quantities. He did not have the benefit of good character due to a criminal record for offences other than the supply of prohibited drugs. The offences on the Form 1 in his case were less serious than either of the Form 1 schedules in this case. The only grounds of appeal considered by the Court were the degree of accumulation and parity.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that neither case could demonstrate that the sentence imposed in this matter was beyond the wide discretion available to his Honour and that the applicant was entitled to a lesser sentence.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that by the time of the commission of the first series of offences, the applicant was aged 42 and was using methylamphetamine daily. She no longer had the care of her child and with Pang Liu was in joint possession of a variety of prohibited drugs. There were indicia of supply and of drug usage, a number of prohibited weapons and more than $11,000 in cash being the proceeds of crime. The Crown submitted that these were matters which supported his Honour’s conclusion that the applicant was dealing in drugs to a significant extent at that time.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that in accordance with what Dr Furst was told the applicant was drug free at the time of her release on bail in October 2013 after having spent more than five months in custody. By this time, Pang Liu was in China and played no role in the 2014 series of offences. The Crown noted that in breach of her bail conditions, the applicant had not only resumed using drugs In January of 2014, but had also resumed drug supply by the time of her arrest on 29 April 2014. The Crown noted that on this occasion the applicant was not only involved in the supply of prohibited drugs, but was in possession of precursor chemicals from which it could be inferred that she was involved in the manufacture of prohibited drugs.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that because the applicant was a user of methylamphetamine and MDMA, the finding of a “plethora and variety of small quantities of different drugs” was consistent with them being for supply rather than personal use. The Crown submitted that the $11,005 found in the premises on 30 April 2013 was accepted as being as the proceeds of crime and provided some indication of the extent of the drug supply operation being conducted by the applicant and her co-offender.
	
	
	The Crown took issue with the applicant’s submission that her aggregate sentence was towards the top of the range of sentences imposed for drug supply involving less than a commercial quantity. The Crown submitted that the comparison was between an aggregate sentence imposed for multiple offences and the sentence imposed for a principal offence. This was to compare quite different things. On that issue, the Crown relied upon the observations of RA Hulme J (with whom Macfarlan JA and Garling J agreed) in Knight v R [2015] NSWCCA 222 where his Honour said:
	


“7   Selection of the variable ""multiple offences"" is of no real utility in this context either. It does not confine the database to multiple instances of the offence of knowingly taking part in the supply of amphetamines in less than the commercial quantity. The ""multiple offences"" variable simply selects cases in which an offender was sentenced for a particular offence as well as one or more offences of any type. Comparing a case such as the present where a person was sentenced for four counts of drug supply with cases which might involve one drug supply offence and other possibly unrelated offences not necessarily of the same level of seriousness is of no utility.

8   Then there is the problem identified by Garling J that the Judicial Commission does not maintain statistics for overall or aggregate sentences imposed in multiple offence sentencing exercises. The statistics only relate to what is identified as the ""principal offence"" in any sentencing exercise. …”


	
	In summary, the Crown submitted that no lesser sentence than that imposed by his Honour was warranted in law because the criminality engaged in by the applicant was serious, she was a woman of mature years and one who appeared to be of above average intelligence when she embarked upon these offences. She was running a significant drug supply business with her co-accused in April 2013 involving a variety of different prohibited drugs in quantities comfortably over trafficable quantities. When considering the sentences imposed for that series of offences and for those which took place in 2014, the matters on the Form 1 had to be taken into account. The Crown noted that having been arrested and imprisoned for a period of more than five months, the applicant upon her release, again started using prohibited drugs and again became involved not only in the supply of prohibited drugs but also their manufacture. It was a significant aggravating factor in relation to the 2014 series of offences that they were committed while on bail for similar offences.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the aggregate sentence was one which was wholly warranted in law on the given facts.
	


Consideration


	
	In re-exercising the sentencing discretion this Court has to make its own assessment of the applicant’s offending. In doing so, I accept the thrust of the Crown’s submissions which in my opinion accord with the available evidence and the findings by the sentencing judge which have not been challenged.
	
	
	Little assistance is provided by R v Wicks and Miletic v R upon which the applicant relied. This Court has emphasised on numerous occasions (applying R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368) that it is impermissible to reason by reference to the result in a limited number of cases that do not form a comparable range of sentences. In Pham v R [2014] NSWCCA 115 at [57] with the agreement of Adams and Hall JJ, I said:
	


“57   There are, however, considerable limitations in relying upon a series of individual cases to establish some kind of range of sentences. In that regard, the observations recently made by Adamson J (with whom Simpson and Davies JJ agreed) in Dang v R [2014] NSWCCA 47 are apposite:

""55   Care must be taken in drawing direct comparisons between sentences passed, those to be passed and those which are, or have been, the subject of appeal: see generally, Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2005] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [53]- [56] per French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ. Sentencing requires the exercise of discretion. The factors that are germane to the exercise of the discretion include deterrence, both general and specific, rehabilitation and punishment. The exercise of the discretion requires consideration of objective circumstances (the seriousness of the offending conduct) as well as subjective circumstances pertinent to the offender. The number of factors to be taken into account as either mitigating or aggravating under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides an indication of the complexity of the exercise and the concomitant difficulty of identifying ""comparable cases"". Although it is orthodox for such cases to be identified for the benefit of the sentencing judge, they can be no more than a guide.""”


	
	In Vandeventer v R [2013] NSWCCA 33 at [45] Adamson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreed) observed:
	


“45   One cannot adjudge whether a sentence falls within an appropriate range by reasoning from particular instances. Applicants will always be able to find cases where offenders appear to have been dealt with more leniently. So, too, will the Crown be able to find cases where offenders have apparently been dealt with more severely than the applicant for leave to appeal on sentence. This is not, however, the way in which this Court determines whether a sentence is manifestly excessive.”


	
	The summary of fifty cases provided to the Court is of little assistance because of the paucity of information in relation to each case. In any event, eight of those cases involved sentences significantly higher than that imposed in this case. The cases do not appear to form an applicable range because of the different factual circumstances and subjective features in each of them. None of the cases had the seriously aggravating feature of similar offences being committed while on bail.
	
	
	As the applicant accepted, the statistics from the Judicial Commission in support of her submissions are a “blunt tool” given the lack of particularising details about both the offences and the offenders. Statistics show a range of sentences actually imposed in the past, not the correctness of that range nor its applicability to a given case: Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [59]. As was observed in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [48], [54] – [55] with respect to consistency of sentencing, what is sought is consistency in the application of relevant principles not some numerical or mathematical equivalence.
	
	
	In R v Chidiac [2015] NSWCCA 241 by Price J (with whom Bathurst CJ and Beech-Jones J agreed) said:
	


“40   Little weight can be placed on the Judicial Commission sentencing statistics referred to by the applicant. In offences involving the manufacture and supply of amphetamines (less than the commercial quantity), there is a broad range of weight and purity of the drug that is not identified by the statistics. Furthermore, the role of offenders in the commission of such offences can vary greatly. The statistics do not identify whether other offences on a Form 1 were taken into account on sentence or whether there were aggravating features, such as being on conditional liberty at the time of the offending, that were factors in the sentencing exercise.”


	
	Given the circumstances of the applicant’s offending and notwithstanding the errors to which reference has been made, I am not persuaded that any of the indicative sentences were excessive. Furthermore, the circumstances surrounding the commission of the 2014 series of offences render them significantly more serious than those which occurred in 2013. Not only was the applicant on bail at the time, but she was on bail for offences of a similar kind. Indicative sentences imposed for the 2014 supply offence should be substantially higher than those imposed for the supply offences of 2013. Similarly, the sentence imposed for the possession of the precursor should be significant. This is despite the fact that the applicant would have been entitled to a 25% discount in respect of those sentences. Moreover, indicative sentences imposed in respect of the 2013 series of offences would have been discounted by no more than 10%.
	
	
	Taking all those matters into account I am satisfied that in the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion in respect of both series of offences, no lesser sentence than the aggregate sentence imposed by his Honour is warranted in law.
	
	
	Accordingly, the orders which I propose are as follows:
	



	
	Leave to appeal is granted.
	
	
	The appeal is dismissed.
	



	
	RS HULME AJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL and with his Honour’s reasons.

		19 February 2016",2016-02-18 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2702065,Kim Sean Mann v R [2016] NSWCCA 10,"Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgments of Hidden J and Davies J. I have also read the material which they relied upon in reaching their conclusion.
	
	
	I agree with the orders proposed by their Honours and with their Honours’ reasons.
	
	
	HIDDEN J: The appellant was tried in the District Court on an indictment containing three counts: affray, firing a firearm in a public place, and wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. He was found guilty of affray but acquitted of the other two counts. He was sentenced to a short term of imprisonment, which has since expired. He appeals against conviction only.
	


The Crown case


	
	The charges arose from an incident at a park in Canley Vale in the night of 15 June 2013, during which Caine Little, to whom I shall refer as the victim, sustained a gunshot wound to his right wrist. The victim had been involved in a fight with another man, Sogeat (“Jet”) Ouch, and a third man approached them and fired a gun at the victim, causing his injury. It was the Crown case that this man was the appellant.
	
	
	The victim, Mr Ouch and a number of men who were present at the park gave evidence. It would be an understatement to say that, for the most part, that evidence was unsatisfactory. Their evidence was significantly in conflict, and there were internal inconsistencies in the evidence of most of them. Further, all of them were cross-examined by the Crown prosecutor pursuant to leave under s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995, in some cases because of evidence inconsistent with what they had told police during the investigation. All in all, the inference was available that they were reluctant to tell the truth about the incident.
	
	
	That said, there are a number of matters in the evidence which were not in dispute or where findings were clearly available to the jury. The victim owed Mr Ouch a long standing drug debt, and at some time on 15 June 2013 there was an arrangement to settle that debt by a fight between the two of them at the park. The victim went to the park accompanied by two friends, Bill Nguyen and Jimmy Chovnlamontry. Two cars arrived and stopped opposite the park. From them emerged a number of people, including Mr Ouch and a witness, Tristan Khannara. Mr Ouch and some, at least, of the other men went to the park. The fight began, the shot was fired, and Mr Ouch and the men who came with him ran back to the cars and departed.
	
	
	As one might expect, the principal focus of the evidence was upon the firing of the gun and the identity of the person responsible. The victim’s evidence was that he did not see the person who shot him, and during the investigation he was shown a photographic array which included the appellant but did not identify him. Both Mr Nguyen and Mr Chovnlamontry knew the appellant and gave evidence that he was present at the park. Both of them had told police that it was the appellant who shot the victim, but both resiled from that position in evidence. Mr Ouch and Mr Khannara also knew the appellant, but neither implicated him in the shooting. Indeed, their evidence was that they did not see him at the park at all.
	
	
	Nothing further need be said about the evidence pointing to the appellant as the shooter. In this Court the Crown prosecutor accepted that, given his acquittal of the two counts arising from the shooting, the Crown could no longer assert that he had done so. The question for this Court is the adequacy of the other evidence to establish his complicity in the offence of which he was convicted, affray. This involves examination of the evidence concerning his attendance at the park. That evidence was also unsatisfactory, particularly as a result of prevarication on the part of Mr Nguyen and Mr Chovnlamontry.
	
	
	The victim had told police that he heard a couple of cars pull up, saw a black car and saw Mr Ouch and four or five people standing with him. He also told police that he, Mr Nguyen and Mr Chovnlamontry walked into the park and then Mr Ouch’s “friends” were standing on the edge of the park, watching on. He resiled from both those propositions in evidence, saying that Mr Ouch was by himself and there were other people some distance from him. He also said in evidence that he was not sure that those other people were Mr Ouch’s friends. There were people standing on the edge of the park but he did not think that they were associated with Mr Ouch.
	
	
	Mr Nguyen said that he saw about ten men near the two cars. At the time of the fight these men were in the park, but “everywhere, not all in one position.” He could not see whether they seemed to be watching the fight. He told police that the appellant was at the park, that he assumed that everyone there was “against” the victim, and that he said to the appellant, “Don’t get involved.” In evidence he prevaricated about this, but at one stage he acknowledged that it was a truthful account.
	
	
	Mr Chovnlamontry said that there were two cars parked in the street and there were ten men, including the appellant, in that area. He saw the appellant get out of one of the cars. When he, Mr Nguyen and the victim walked to the park those men were “scattered around everywhere”, some near the cars and others around the park area. He had told police that he, the victim, Mr Nguyen, Mr Ouch, Mr Khannara and the appellant walked into the park, but in evidence he said that he could not remember the appellant walking close to him at that stage. He said that the other men approached the area of the fight when it started.
	
	
	As I have said, both Mr Ouch and Mr Khannara denied having seen the appellant at the park. Both also denied that he had travelled to the park with them. It was their evidence that they travelled to the park in a car driven by Mr Khannara. Mr Ouch could not recall whether there were others in the car with them. Mr Khannara said that there were two other men in the car, but he did not know them. Mr Ouch agreed in cross-examination by the Crown prosecutor that there were about ten people at the park, including the victim, Mr Nguyen and Mr Chovnlamontry. He was unsure whether there were about seven other men, arriving in two cars, who were part of his group. He said that during the fight with the victim there were two or three people about six metres away, watching, and other people scattered around everywhere. Mr Khannara said that when they arrived at the park, Mr Ouch got out but he remained in the car. He denied having entered the park with the appellant and others.
	
	
	Mr Nguyen, Mr Chovnlamontry and Mr Ouch gave evidence of their memory being affected because they had taken drugs and, in the case of Mr Ouch and Mr Chovnlamontry, also alcohol on the day of the incident.
	
	
	The Crown’s primary case against the appellant on the affray count was that he shot the victim. However, if it were not established beyond reasonable doubt that he did so, the alternative case put was that he was a participant in a joint criminal enterprise with Mr Ouch to engage in an affray. That case, as it was explained to the jury by the trial judge in summing up, was that he travelled with Mr Ouch to the park for a fight that had been pre-arranged, that he entered the park with Mr Ouch, and that he was there, “willing and able or encouraging and enabling, the fight to occur.” The appellant did not give evidence, but the conduct of his case put all those matters in issue.
	


The appeal


	
	Two grounds of appeal were argued: firstly, that the jury’s verdict is unreasonable and, secondly, that the trial judge failed adequately to put the defence case to the jury. As I am satisfied that the first ground is made out, I do not find it necessary to determine the second.
	


Unreasonable verdict


	
	The familiar principles governing this Court’s consideration of a ground that a verdict is unreasonable were re-stated in the plurality judgment in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13, 243 CLR 400, at [11] – [14] (405-6):
	


“11.   It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen  by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:

‘Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.’

12.   This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to ‘unsafe or unsatisfactory’ in M is to be taken as ‘equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence.'

13.   The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses.  However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:

‘In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced.  It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.’

…

14.   In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make ‘an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality’.  In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:

‘In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict.  Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1).  The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, ‘none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand’.”

(footnotes omitted).

The cases referred to in that passage are M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 and MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606.


	
	From the shifting sands of the evidence I have attempted to extract those aspects which present the Crown case at its highest. Counsel for the appellant, Mr McLachlan, argued that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant travelled to the park and was present at the relevant time. In my view, there is considerable force in that submission. The only witnesses who identified him as being present at the park were Mr Nguyen and Mr Chovnlamontry, whose evidence was anything but compelling.
	
	
	However, the main focus of the argument on appeal was whether, assuming the appellant was present, it was open to the jury to be satisfied that he was complicit in the offence. Mr McLachlan’s submission was that, absent the evidence that it was the appellant who shot the victim, it could not be established that he was a party to the joint criminal enterprise alleged. On this issue the Crown prosecutor in this Court referred to authority.
	
	
	In R v Coney (1882) 8 QBD 534, the appellants were spectators at a prize fight. They had not taken any active part in the management of the fight, nor had they said or done anything during it. They were convicted of assault as principals in the second degree. Their appeals were allowed by majority on the basis that the jury had been misdirected to the effect that those who were present at the prize fight are guilty because, by their presence, they encouraged it. Cave J recorded (at 539) that the direction was that “if the prisoners were not merely casually passing by, but stayed at the place, they encouraged it by their presence, although they did not say or do anything.” As to that Cave J said:
	


“Now it is a general rule in the case of principals in the second degree that there must be participation in the act, and that, although a man is present whilst a felony is being committed, if he takes no part in it, and does not act in concert with those who commit it, he will not be a principal in the second degree merely because he does not endeavour to prevent the felony, or apprehend the felon.”


	
	Later in his judgment Cave J said (at 540, 543):
	


“Where presence may be entirely accidental, it is not even evidence of aiding and abetting. Where presence is prima facie not accidental it is evidence, but no more than evidence, for the jury.

                                                                                                                  …

This summing-up unfortunately appears to me capable of being understood in two different ways. It may mean either that mere presence unexplained is evidence of encouragement, and so of guilt, or that mere presence unexplained is conclusive proof of encouragement, and so of guilt. If the former is the correct meaning, I concur in the law so laid down, if the latter, I am unable to do so.”


	
	Lopes J said (at 552):
	


“I cannot hold, as a proposition of law, that the mere looking on is ipso facto a participation in or encouragement of a prize-fight. I think there must be more than that to justify a conviction for an assault. If, for instance, it was proved that a person went to a prize-fight, knowing it was to take place, and remained there for some time looking on, I think that would be evidence from which a jury might infer that such person encouraged, and intended to encourage, the fight by his presence.”


	
	Hawkins J said (at 557- 8):
	


“In my opinion, to constitute an aider and abettor some active steps must be taken by word, or action, with the intent to instigate the principal, or principals. Encouragement does not of necessity amount to aiding and abetting, it may be intentional or unintentional, a man may unwittingly encourage another in fact by his presence, by misinterpreted words, or gestures, or by his silence, or non-interference, or he may encourage intentionally by expressions, gestures, or actions intended to signify approval. In the latter case he aids and abets, in the former he does not. It is no criminal offence to stand by, a mere passive spectator of a crime, even of a murder. Non-interference to prevent a crime is not itself a crime. But the fact that a person was voluntarily and purposely present witnessing the commission of a crime, and offered no opposition to it, though he might reasonably be expected to prevent and had the power to do so, or at least to express his dissent, might under some circumstances, afford cogent evidence upon which a jury would be justified in finding that he wilfully encouraged and so aided and abetted. But it would be purely a question for the jury whether he did so or not.”


	
	In R v Allan & Ors [1965] 1 QB 130, a case concerning a charge of affray, Coney was described by Edmund Davies J as the “locus classicus on this branch of the law” (at 135). The case raised a specific issue concerning directions to the jury which does not arise here. However, his Lordship, delivering the judgment of the Court, said (at 138):
	


“In our judgment, before a jury can properly convict an accused person of being a principal in the second degree to an affray, they must be convinced by the evidence that, at the very least, he by some means or other encouraged the participants. …

                                                                                                             …

Indeed, in our judgment, encouragement in one form or another is a minimal requirement before an accused person may properly be regarded as a principal in the second degree to any crime.”


	
	These passages from the judgments in Coney and Allan have been cited with approval, albeit in different contexts, by this Court: R v Phan [2001] NSWCCA 29, 53 NSWLR 480, per Wood CJ at CL at [70] – [72] (485 – 6); R v Chishimba & Ors [2010] NSWCCA 228, per Macfarlan JA at [137] – [139].
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor also referred to R v Donnelly [2001] NSWCCA 394, a case concerned with complicity in an offence of robbery with wounding. Giles JA (with whom Wood CJ at CL agreed) referred to the liability of principals in the first and second degree by reference to the judgment of McHugh J in Osland v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 316 at 341 – 2, and Hunt CJ at CL in R v Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545, and said at [77] – [79]:
	


“77   The material distinction is between liability as principal in the second degree, being a derivative liability where the person was present but not acting in concert with the person who committed the acts alleged to constitute the crime, and liability as principal in the first degree, being a primary liability where the person was not only present but also acting in concert with the person who committed the acts alleged to constitute the crime.

78   In the former category is a person who was “merely present, encouraging but not participating physically”. By “merely” is meant that the person was not present by reason of a pre-concert or agreement with the person committing the acts alleged to constitute the crime. …

79   But the acting in concert may in the circumstances be established by presence and participation, without direct evidence of reaching an understanding or arrangement at an earlier time, and the ‘unspoken understanding or arrangement’ established may be one formed between the persons at the time the crime is committed as distinct from at some earlier time. Encouragement may in the circumstances be part of establishing acting in concert, the critical constituent of liability as principal in the first degree. … presence and encouragement by readiness to give aid if required, described as encouragement, may be sufficient to found a joint criminal enterprise to commit the crime. The presence of the accused as a party acting in concert may be shown by encouragement or assistance at the time the crime is committed, and readiness to give aid short of overt assistance may be sufficient.”


	
	In the present case the trial judge, having explained the Crown’s alternative case in the passage which I have quoted above, directed the jury about joint criminal enterprise and concluded:
	


“The Crown argument is that the accused arrived with Sogeat Ouch to attend a pre-arranged fight, that he walked with Sogeat Ouch and others into the park and was there in the vicinity ready, willing and able to encourage and/or to assist Sogeat Ouch in that fight. You must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was more than just a spectator.”


	
	Applying the analysis of Giles JA in Donnelly, it appears that the Crown case was put as one of pre-concert rather than principal in the second degree. The Crown prosecutor in this Court submitted that it was open to the jury to find that the appellant was one of a group of men who went to the park with Mr Ouch, that he entered the park, and was present when the fight occurred. From this, the Crown prosecutor argued, it was open to the jury to infer his complicity in the affray on the basis for which the Crown contended.
	
	
	I do not agree. Let it be accepted for present purposes that the appellant attended the park with Mr Ouch and others, that he entered the park with Mr Ouch, that he was counselled by Mr Nguyen not to get involved, and that other men who had travelled to the vicinity with him also entered the park and approached the area where the fight took place. Absent the evidence that the appellant shot the victim, the evidence is silent as to where he was or what, if anything, he did at the time of the fight. The evidence falls well short of proving the encouragement of the participants in the fight, or the readiness to assist in it, necessary to establish the appellant’s involvement in the offence, whether through pre-concert or as principal in the second degree. It could establish no more than that he was a spectator. When the assertion that he shot the victim fades away, the offence of affray fades away with it.
	
	
	Accordingly, I am satisfied, to use the words of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, that the verdict cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. The verdict should be set aside and the appellant acquitted. I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction, and would direct that a verdict and judgment of acquittal be entered.
	
	
	Since drafting this judgment I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgment of Davies J. I agree with his Honour’s additional observations.
	
	
	DAVIES J:   I have read the judgment of Hidden J. I agree with his Honour’s reasons and the orders he proposes. Since, however, ground 1 asserts that the verdict on count 1 was unreasonable I wish to add a few remarks of my own.
	
	
	The acquittal on counts 2 and 3 necessarily mean that the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the shooter was the Appellant. The only evidence that the Appellant was the shooter came from Nguyen and Chovnlamontry, and indirectly from the victim Little who told the police that it was Kim (the Appellant) because Bill (Nguyen) and Jimmy (Chovnlamontry) told him to say that.   
	
	
	Having read all of the evidence it was not surprising that the jury could not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was the shooter.
	
	
	None of the witnesses gave any other evidence concerning the Appellant’s involvement in the fight apart from evidence from some but not all of them that he was present at the park that night and some evidence that he arrived at the park with other people who were present. There was, for example, no evidence where the Appellant was situated relative to the fight nor was there any evidence of his saying or doing anything whilst there that night. It could not be said that the Crown showed him to be present at the fight and ready to assist Ouch.
	
	
	The Crown opened the case principally dealing with counts 2 and 3. The Crown said this:
	


The Crown case is that the accused is identified by two people who knew him as the shooter, and he was – other people say he was there as well, was there. And the question is – the issue will be, had the Crown proven beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was present and that he was the shooter and did he do the things that were alleged in the indictment.


	
	Counsel for the Appellant then briefly conferred with the Crown Prosecutor and the Prosecutor then said this:
	


Your Honour – reasonable request for just a little clarification on the way the Crown puts its case in relation to count 1 which I am happy to cooperate with. Count 1 ladies and gentlemen you see “Used unlawful violence to Caine Little by conduct that would cause a person of reasonable firmness present” etc etc. The conduct is of course alleged to be the shooting, but it’s also, and the Crown says that would be enough, but it’s also that he was present with a group of people who were intent on having a brawl in a public place and participated in that activity. It’s those two things but obviously the more significant aspect of that is the shooting.


	
	Counsel for the Appellant correctly submitted that there was no evidence at all to suggest that what was arranged was other than a one on one fist fight between Little and Ouch. There was no evidence that the Appellant was a person who was intent on having a brawl in a public place.
	
	
	Putting aside the act of shooting Little, the only way the Appellant could have been guilty of affray was if he or he and others had used or threatened unlawful violence, in which case the conduct of those persons may be taken together and considered for the purposes of determining whether an offence of affray has been committed (Colosimo v Director of Public Prosecutions [2005] NSWSC 854; (2005) 64 NSWLR 645 at [19]) or if a joint criminal enterprise in relation to the arranged fight could be demonstrated even if he did nothing at the scene: Youkhana v R [2015] NSWCCA 41 at [15] and [22].
	
	
	In relation to the former there was, as I have said, no evidence concerning the Appellant other than that he was present and may have arrived with Mr Ouch or others at the park. As to the latter, the evidence all pointed to a one on one fight having been arranged by Mr Ouch (although he denied it) in an endeavour to extract the money that Little owed him.
	
	
	Particularly in the light of the acquittals on counts 2 and 3, the verdict on count 1 was unreasonable and should be quashed.

		19 February 2016",2016-02-11 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2702069,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 20) [2016] NSWSC 75,"Judgment – EX TEMPORE (REVISED)


	
	Counsel for the accused McNamara wishes to cross-examine the current witness, Hubert Sha, about matters which counsel concedes go only to his credit. The Crown objects to that line of cross-examination. The issue arises in this way.
	
	
	Mr Sha was asked in cross-examination whether or not he had taken any drugs before giving evidence today. He answered no to that question. He was also asked whether or not he had taken any drugs prior to giving evidence in these proceedings last Friday. His answer was again no.
	
	
	Counsel wishes to put to Mr Sha details of convictions recorded against, and penalties imposed upon, him in the latter part of 2015 in relation to his possession of illegal drugs. On the basis of that evidence, counsel will submit in due course that Mr Sha’s denial of drug use prior to giving evidence is untruthful. Counsel accepts that the acceptance of such a submission would depend, at least in part, upon an assessment of Mr Sha’s demeanour in the witness box.
	
	
	It is apparent that on 21 October 2015 Mr Sha was charged with possessing a prohibited drug, namely a quantity of ecstasy. He was fined in respect of that offence.
	
	
	On 29 October 2015 he was charged with possessing a prohibited drug, namely a quantity of Ice. He was again fined.
	
	
	On 14 December 2015 he was charged with possessing prohibited drugs, namely amounts of Ice and cannabis. The outcome of that matter is not apparent.
	
	
	The amounts of prohibited drug of which Mr Sha was in possession on each of those three occasions appear consistent with the drug being for personal use.
	
	
	The credibility rule is expressed in s. 102 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”) in the following terms
	


""Credibility evidence about a witness is not admissible"".


	
	Section 103 of the Act, upon which counsel relies, is in the following terms:
	


Exception: cross-examination as to credibility

(1)  The credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in cross-examination of a witness if the evidence could substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of the witness.

(2)  Without limiting the matters to which the court may have regard for the purposes of subsection (1), it is to have regard to:

(a)  whether the evidence tends to prove that the witness knowingly or recklessly made a false representation when the witness was under an obligation to tell the truth; and

(b)  the period that has elapsed since the acts or events to which the evidence relates were done or occurred.


	
	The Crown submitted that the evidence was incapable of substantially affecting the assessment of the credibility of Mr Sha. The Crown submitted, in particular, that Mr Sha's appearance and demeanour in the witness box were matters which lent themselves to a subjective assessment and that in any event, there was no evidence at all which might indicate that Mr Sha's demeanour and appearance in the witness box today, and/or last Friday, were any different to how he might normally present.
	
	
	In determining whether or not the evidence could substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of Mr Sha, I am required to take into account the matters in s. 103(2)(a) and (b) of the Act. In terms of s. 103(2)(a), Mr Sha is obviously under an obligation to tell the truth when giving evidence. However, I am not satisfied that the evidence to which I have referred tends to prove that his denials of drug use prior to giving evidence are necessarily false. Counsel for McNamara submitted that Mr Sha’s demeanour when giving evidence was consistent with recent drug use. That is possible, but as the Crown has submitted, it may well be that such demeanour is consistent with how he generally presents.
	
	
	In terms of s. 103(2)(b), the events about which counsel seeks to cross-examine Mr Sha occurred only a matter of months ago. That factor may weigh in favour of allowing the cross-examination to proceed.
	
	
	However, I am not satisfied that in all of the circumstances the evidence could substantially affect the assessment of Mr Sha’s credibility. The mere fact that there are recent occasions on which he has been found in possession of prohibited drugs in amounts consistent with personal use does not, without more, support a conclusion that his denials of drug use prior to giving evidence are false. As I have said, there is nothing to suggest that his demeanour when giving evidence is any different to his normal presentation.
	
	
	For those reasons, the cross-examination will not be permitted.

		15 June 2016",2016-02-14 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2702070,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 19) [2016] NSWSC 74,"Judgment – EX TEMPORE (REVISED)


	
	The Crown has led evidence from a number of friends and acquaintances of the deceased who went searching for him in the Padstow area at or about the time of his disappearance. In the course of that evidence, reference has been made to the presence of two Asian males who were seen in the vicinity of the location at which the parked car of the deceased was found.
	
	
	One of the witnesses who has given such evidence is Hubert Sha. The Crown is seeking to lead the contents of paragraph 23 of a statement made by Mr Sha on 7 July 2014 which is in the following terms:
	


“These Asian males told us they were from Hong Kong and they were with Jamie earlier to do a drug deal. I recall they told us it was a large amount of Ice and that they gave the drugs to Jamie. I know some of this conversation was in Mandarin so I did not understand the entire thing as I only speak Cantonese and English. During this conversation the Asian males said that when they gave the drugs to Jamie he left his car and belongings with them and went to get in another car but they did not see the other car. They said this happened during the afternoon.”


	
	It will be evident that that paragraph contains a number of representations said to have been made by one or other of the Asian males to Mr Sha. It is these representations upon which the Crown seeks to rely. In doing so, the Crown calls in aid the provisions of ss. 65(1) and (2) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”) which are in the following terms:
	


65 Exception: criminal proceedings if maker not available

(1)  This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact.

(2)  The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation:

(a)  was made under a duty to make that representation or to make representations of that kind; or

(b)  was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication; or

(c)  was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable; or

(d)  was:

(i)  against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made; and

(ii)  made in circumstances that make it likely that the representation is reliable.

Note:          Section 67 imposes notice requirements relating to this subsection.

…


	
	In addition, s. 4 of Part 2 of the Dictionary to the Act is in the following terms:
	


Unavailability of persons

(1)  For the purposes of this Act, a person is taken not to be available to give evidence about a fact if:

(a)  the person is dead; or

(b)  the person is, for any reason other than the application of section 16 (Competence and compellability: judges and jurors), not competent to give the evidence; or

(c)  the person is mentally or physically unable to give the evidence and it is not reasonably practicable to overcome that inability; or

(d)  it would be unlawful for the person to give the evidence; or

(e)  a provision of this Act prohibits the evidence being given; or

(f)  all reasonable steps have been taken, by the party seeking to prove the person is not available, to find the person or secure his or her attendance, but without success; or

(g)  all reasonable steps have been taken, by the party seeking to prove the person is not available, to compel the person to give the evidence, but without success.

(2)  In all other cases the person is taken to be available to give evidence about the fact.


	
	Ms Shead, who appears on behalf of the accused McNamara, has objected to the evidence, and has submitted that I could not come to the conclusion that either of the Asian males is a person who is not “available"" for the purposes of s. 65. Even if I were to reach a contrary conclusion, Ms Shead submits that I should nevertheless exclude the evidence pursuant to s. 137 of the Act. In that regard, she points, in particular, to the admission made by Mr Sha that he did not understand the entirety of the conversation due to the fact that it was conducted in a language with which he was not completely familiar.
	
	
	In support of the proposition that the two Asian males to whom Mr Sha spoke are not available, the Crown called evidence from Detective Phillips, who is one of the police in charge of the investigation. Detective Phillips purported to identify the two Asian males as being a Mr Chan and a Mr Fung. He gave evidence that both of those persons have left Australia and have not returned.
	
	
	However in the course of being cross-examined by Ms Shead, and particularly at T269 L21-26, Detective Phillips effectively conceded that despite thorough investigations, he could not positively identify the persons in question as being Mr Chan and Mr Fung. He said that he held a ""strong suspicion"" as to their identity, but could not go further than that.
	
	
	In my view, before one reaches the position of having to consider the question of availability for the purpose of s. 65, there is a preliminary issue, namely whether or not the person who is said to be unavailable can be positively identified. In my view, the evidence falls short of affirmatively establishing that the two persons in question are in fact the persons Chan and Fung. It may well be that Detective Phillips holds a strong suspicion that this is the case. However in my view that suspicion, in the terms in which he expressed it, falls substantially short of a positive identification of either person.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that even if that point were reached, it would not preclude a conclusion that the two persons were not available. Indeed, the Crown went so far as to submit that if I concluded that neither person could be positively identified as Mr Chan or Mr Fung, its position would be strengthened. I am unable to accept that submission. In my view, as a matter of common sense, one cannot assert that a person is not available unless and until that person is positively identified in the first instance. For that reason, it is not open to the Crown to rely upon s. 65 as I am not satisfied that either of the two Asian males to whom Mr Sha refers is not available to give evidence. The evidence should therefore be rejected.
	
	
	In view of the conclusions that I have reached, it is not necessary for me to consider Ms Shead's alternative submission in respect of s 137. However I should say that had I concluded that it was open to the Crown to rely upon s. 65, I would have been minded, subject to hearing any further submissions from the Crown, to exclude the evidence under s. 137 in any event. Clearly, on the basis of Mr Sha's own evidence about the language in which the conversation was conducted, he was not in a position to understand the majority of what was being said.
	
	
	For all of those reasons, the evidence is rejected.

		15 June 2016",2016-02-14 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2702081,Pannowitz v R [2016] NSWCCA 13,"Judgment


	
	Hoeben CJ at CL:   I agree with Davies J.
	
	
	Davies J:   The Applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court on indictment to one count of supply a prohibited drug namely 62.62 grams of methylamphetamine. The Applicant also pleaded guilty before the Local Court to a further count of supplying a prohibited drug, namely 40.05 grams of methylamphetamine. He was committed to the District Court for sentence. The maximum penalty for each offence is 15 years imprisonment.
	
	
	In relation to each matter the Applicant asked that a number of matters on a Form 1 be taken into account. Those matters were three counts of deal with suspected proceeds of crime, one count of possessing a prohibited drug being methylamphetamine, and one count of possessing a prohibited weapon being a Taser. The three counts of dealing with suspected proceeds of crime concerned (1) $6,600 in Australian currency (attached to Count 1), (2) $7,000 in Australian currency (attached to Count 2), and (3) concerned various goods including laptops and a medal/coin collection (attached to Count 2). The counts of possessing a prohibited drug and a prohibited weapon were attached to Count 2.
	
	
	On 23 January 2015 Judge McLoughlin sentenced the Applicant as follows:
	


On count 1, a fixed term of four years and six months imprisonment commencing 15 July 2013 and expiring 14 January 2018;

On count 2, a non-parole period of three years commencing 15 June 2015 and expiring 14 June 2018 with an additional term of one year and nine months expiring 14 March 2020.

The overall sentence was a non-parole period of four years and 11 months commencing 15 July 2013 and expiring 14 June 2018 with a balance of term of one year and nine months expiring 14 March 2020.


	
	The Applicant now seeks leave to appeal on two grounds as follows:
	


1.   The learned sentencing judge failed to have proper regard to principles of totality in the manner in which he partially accumulated the individual sentences imposed.

2.   The effective sentence and the individual sentences imposed are manifestly excessive.

Factual background


	
	The following summary is taken from two Statements of Facts and the Sentencing Judge’s Remarks on Sentence:
	
	
	On the morning of 24 January 2013 Senior Constable Robert Banks, Senior Constable J Chapman and Senior Constable Michael Allen were patrolling the Swansea area in an unmarked police car. They were tasked that morning to patrol specifically the area of Walsh Street, Swansea as there had been intelligence reports of drug activity in the area. Both Senior Constable Banks and Senior Constable Chapman had also previously made arrests in the area for drug related matters.
	
	
	At about 8am on 24 January 2013 they observed a red Commodore with three occupants drive into Wallace Street and then into the driveway of a Housing Commission complex at 15-19 Wallace Street, Swansea. The officers followed the car into the driveway and observed the rear passenger, a person called Wayne Stevens, look around out the back of the car a number of times. The red Commodore then stopped out the front of unit number 12. Senior Constable Chapman had previously arrested the occupant of unit 12 for drug related matters. Senior Constable Banks had also arrested persons leaving the unit complex for drug related matters.
	
	
	Based on the intelligence reports and the knowledge of drug activity in the area, the officers suspected that there might be drugs in the car. Senior Constable Banks activated the flashing lights. The Applicant got out of the front passenger seat. Senior Constable Banks approached and spoke to the Applicant. The Applicant said he was visiting a mate named Mark but did not know his last name. Senior Constable Banks observed that the Applicant appeared nervous, unsure and hesitant in his answers. That, in combination with the area being known for drug activity, led to the officers deciding to search the car. Senior Constable Banks asked the Applicant for some identification. He then saw the Applicant approach the front passenger side of the vehicle and lean into the car.
	
	
	Senior Constable Chapman and Senior Constable Allen watched the Applicant walk to the front passenger door, reach into a grey backpack that was located in the front passenger footwell, remove his wallet from the backpack and return to Senior Constable Banks. When the Applicant stood up he had a wallet and gave it to Senior Constable Banks. Senior Constable Banks observed the grey Caribee backpack sitting in the footwell of the front passenger side. He saw the zipper was open and he saw a number of $50 notes sitting inside. He removed the backpack and asked who owned it. The Applicant and the other two persons all denied ownership.
	
	
	The bag was searched and inside the backpack was $6,600 in cash in $50 notes, syringes, electronic scales, 25 clear resealable bags, some personal items such as deodorant, hairbrush and mobile phone, et cetera. Inside a sunglass case was a large resealable plastic bag containing methylamphetamine, three smaller plastic bags with methylamphetamine, a black pouch that had more methylamphetamine wrapped in foil. In total there was 62.62 grams of methylamphetamine. One of the large bags was tested and returned a purity level of 88%.
	
	
	The Applicant was arrested and taken to Belmont Police Station. At the police station the Applicant was observed having blue electrical tape on a cut on his finger. A roll of blue electrical tape was located taped to the grey backpack where the drugs were located. The Applicant declined to be interviewed.
	
	
	The second offence occurred at about 3pm on 25 November 2013. The police attended the home of the Applicant at 70 Charlton Street, Lambton to execute a search warrant. At that time the Applicant was on bail for the first offence, bail having been granted on 4 June 2013.
	
	
	While searching the laundry area police located a black coloured toiletry bag sitting on top of the washing machine. Police unzipped the bag and located a substantial amount of $50 notes as well as clear resealable bags containing a clear crystal substance. The Applicant was cautioned and then questioned with regard to the contents. The Applicant said, ""I don't know about the drugs."" He did, however, claim ownership of the toiletry bag.
	
	
	Police removed the items from the bag which contained $4,200 in cash, two Nokia brand mobile phones, several sets of keys, a white coloured hairbrush, a small leather wallet and several clear resealable bags containing a clear crystal substance. The substance was later analysed at 40.75 grams of methylamphetamine at a purity of 80.5%.
	
	
	The Applicant claimed ownership for the bag, one of the Nokia mobile phones and the hairbrush. At this time police also located the wallet of the Applicant on top of the bench within the dining area and, upon opening the wallet, police located $2,800 in cash, as well as a small clear resealable bag containing a clear crystal substance. In regard to the contents of the resealable bag the Applicant claimed ownership and made admissions that the contents were amphetamines for his personal use. The total cash recovered was $7,000.
	
	
	An ice cream container and a small brown box with numerous packets containing small clear plastic resealable bags and two digital sets of scales on a bench were found within a shed at the premises. Police continued a search of the shed and the carport of the premises and found a number of goods being a black coloured Dell brand laptop computer, a black coloured Asus brand laptop computer, two leather cases containing a XII Commonwealth Games Brisbane 1982 coin collection and a large quantity of electric battery and power tools. Many of the items appeared to be brand new and still in their boxes or with tags attached. Police also located in the shed a silver coloured Taser that looked like a mobile phone. Police activated the device which appeared to be functioning.
	


Subjective matters


	
	The Applicant gave evidence at the sentencing hearing. In addition, there was a detailed and lengthy report from a forensic psychologist, Ms Caroline Hare, who met with the Applicant on 5 December 2014. The Applicant said in his evidence that Ms Hare had correctly recorded what he told her and he had told her the truth. The evidence that he gave at the sentencing hearing was consistent with what Ms Hare had reported.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge provided a lengthy summary in his Remarks of Ms Hare’s report. What follows is largely taken from those Remarks.
	
	
	The Applicant was born on 13 June 1970. At the time of sentencing he was aged 44.
	
	
	Ms Hare was of the view the Applicant’s mood was stable throughout the meeting with no evidence of psychopathology. The Applicant described to her a difficult upbringing, being the youngest of six children. When he was aged between 2 and 9 years his father spent time in custody. The Applicant did not visit his father and was unable to develop a relationship with him. There was no improvement in the relationship after his father's release and that led to his feelings of anger and resentment and an ongoing tumultuous relationship with his father punctuated by verbal arguments. Having worked for his father, he walked out following disputes between them.
	
	
	He described a positive relationship with his grandmother but frequent absences of his mother from the family home when she was working. When aged 12 his parents separated, and he remained living with his mother, relocating to an area where he was exposed to negative peers because of the absence of constant supervision by his mother. He became increasingly enmeshed in the antisocial subculture engaged in by his newly formed negative peers.
	
	
	He went to reside with his older brother in Scone for a period of time leading to disagreements between himself and his mother during his teenage years, and he described the relationship with her going downhill. He described the death of his grandmother. He did not manage his grief well and misued illicit substances to cope. He denied exposure to sexual or physical childhood abuse beyond infrequent physical discipline. The Applicant estimated that since the age of 18 he had spent a total of eight years residing in the community, the remainder of the time being spent in prison.
	
	
	He set out an educational and vocational history, attending some five high schools, engaging in physical fights with other students and verbal altercations with teachers. He was engaged in frequent truanting, and attended school drug-affected which resulted in suspensions. He changed high schools, which he maintained prevented him forming enduring friendships. The last year at school he completed was Year 10.
	
	
	On release from his first custodial sentence he worked at his father's demolition business for approximately two years, which coincided with the development of his present relationship and the birth of their first daughter. This was the last extended period of relative stability which he had achieved within the community. He described having worked periodically for his father over the years and difficulty achieving employment when released from custody, which appears to have continued to manifest itself on the many times thereafter that he has been released from custody. He endorsed a mindset that the world was out to get him.
	
	
	Ms Hare was of the view that the Applicant would require considerable support to complete forms, secure appropriate identification, prepare for the interview process and develop appropriate time-management and budgeting skills, and in her view he would require support to develop these areas prior to release if he was to break the cycle of crime and imprisonment that had dominated his adult life.
	
	
	The Applicant is currently still in the long-term relationship with his partner of 25 years. They have known each other from high school and had developed a romantic relationship when the Applicant was 19. The Applicant described his partner as a very strong individual who maintained a pro-social lifestyle and did not engage in misuse of substances, and having been primarily responsible for the raising of their four daughters, currently aged 23, 20, 16 and six.
	
	
	He identified difficulties in being emotionally intimate with his partner due to his long history of residing in custody and blocking out thoughts of family. Apart from his immediate family, the only persons he knew were from gaol. He was able to confide in other inmates in custody and it apparently caused him difficulties when he was released because there was no one there to listen. Ms Hare noted that he avoided sharing his problems with his partner because he perceived that she had enough to deal with and he felt guilty if he burdened her with his own problems.
	
	
	He commenced using alcohol at the age of 12 and ceased consuming alcohol in his early 20s. He commenced taking cannabis at about the same time until about the age of 17 years because he did not like the down feeling that it provided. He commenced using amphetamines at the same age when one of the older persons with whom he was mixing injected him with amphetamines. After 12 months he was engaged in daily usage. Such usage had been declining between the ages of 19 to 21 and he had consistently maintained abstinence within gaol over the years despite the availability of substances. He described this as a part of a pattern of behaviour he created for himself in gaol. He said the pressure was off in gaol and that allowed him to maintain abstinence.
	
	
	He said he had completed a number of educative SMART Programs that had been ineffective and had not addressed his underlying deficits in core living skills which ultimately caused him distress within the community. His inability to manage these situations and emotions led to his relapse and the substance abuse. He said that he engaged in problematic gambling, smoking up to 50 grams of tobacco each week, and drinking a lot of caffeine.
	
	
	Ms Hare also thought that in conjunction with substance misuse intervention the Applicant would benefit from access to psychological intervention to help him effectively manage his emotions, including frustration, concerns regarding protection, anxiety and panic. She thought that within custody he should be referred to the centre psychologist to address this area. In the community a referral to a psychologist could be made via a general practitioner or referral under the Medicare guidelines. She was of the view that upon release gaining employment would provide Mr Pannowitz with a meaningful and structured way to spend his time within the community and promote positive feelings of self-worth as well as providing him a reliable income and bring him into contact with more positive supports.
	


The Applicant’s criminal record


	
	The Applicant has a criminal record extending back to January 1984 when he was 13 years of age. He was given an 18 months recognisance at that time for attempted stealing.
	
	
	Apart from drug offences the matters in respect of which the Applicant has been convicted include driving and property offences with a number of convictions for break and enter in respect of which he has been in prison, as well as three offences of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his or her duty.
	
	
	His history of drug offending is of most significance. On 24 March 1988 when he was aged 17 he was convicted of possessing a utensil for the administration of drugs and self-administering a prohibited drug. On 13 January 1995 and on 7 September 1998 he was convicted on each occasion of possessing a prohibited drug.
	
	
	On 28 November 2001 he was imprisoned for six months for supplying an indictable quantity of a prohibited drug not being cannabis.
	
	
	On 17 February 2004 he was imprisoned for one month for possessing a prohibited drug. On 4 June 2007 he was sentenced to a non-parole period of one year and four months with an additional term of 11 months for supplying a prohibited drug. He was released on parole on 2 May 2008. During his parole period he was charged again with both possessing a prohibited drug and supplying an indictable quantity of a prohibited drug not being cannabis. On the supply charge he was sentenced on 15 May 2009 to a non-parole period of two years and ten months with an additional term of 12 months. He said the parole authorities would not release him because he was institutionalised. The Applicant in fact served the full sentence and was released on 7 November 2012.
	
	
	The first of the offences the subject of the present application for leave to appeal was committed on 24 January 2013. The Applicant was released on bail in respect of count 1 and was then arrested and charged with the second count on 25 November 2013.
	


Ground 1:   Totality


	
	In his Remarks on Sentence the Sentencing Judge said (ROS 14.5):
	


I have regard to totality because of the two matters, notwithstanding the second offence is totally removed from the first, committed in the circumstances where he had been released on bail from the first.


	
	The Applicant submitted that, despite that statement, his Honour did not expressly consider principles arising from Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 “in any principled fashion”. The Applicant submitted that the degree of partial accumulation was too extreme given the nature of the offences. The Applicant did not submit that there should have been no accumulation, having accepted at the sentencing hearing that there had to be a partial accumulation by reason of two very distinct acts.
	
	
	As the Applicant acknowledged the matter of the extent of accumulation is a matter of judicial discretion made in accordance with established principle: R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 at [7]. In Regina v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115 Hall J (with whom Tobias JA and Kirby J agreed) set out at [52] a number of propositions that his Honour said could be derived from the case law. Those propositions focused on a consideration of the similarity, differences and the degree of connection between the offending both in time and type to ascertain the extent to which the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other. To those matters may be added a need to ensure public confidence in the administration of criminal justice to avoid the perception that an offender will not be punished more severely for committing multiple offences: Khawaja v R [2014] NSWCCA 80 at [24]-[25] following R v Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130; (2007) 171 A Crim R 267 at [46].
	
	
	Because the determination of accumulation and concurrency is a matter of discretion the Applicant is required to show a House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 error. No such error was identified apart from the submission that the extent of the accumulation was too great.
	
	
	It is clear that the Sentencing Judge had regard to the principle of totality. It was not necessary for him specifically to refer to Pearce. Nor is it apparent what else needed to be said. The Applicant submitted that his Honour should have exposed his reasoning for the view he came to about accumulation. However, this aspect of sentencing is as much a matter of instinctive synthesis as the selection of an individual sentence.
	
	
	His Honour accumulated the sentence for count 2 by one year and 11 months on the sentence for count 1. Thereafter the Applicant was required to serve a non-parole period of three years. That was a discretionary decision. In circumstances where the Applicant had earlier three times been convicted of supplying a prohibited drug and where count 2 was committed whilst he was on bail for count 1 there is nothing in the extent of the accumulation that even faintly suggests that the discretion miscarried.
	
	
	I would not uphold this ground.
	


Ground 2:   Sentence manifestly excessive


	
	His Honour considered that the notional starting point in respect of count 1 would be a sentence of five years imprisonment. The plea in respect of that offence was only entered after the trial was not reached. A discount of 10% for the utilitarian value of the plea was extended.
	
	
	In respect of count 2, which included the taking into account of four matters on a Form 1, his Honour said the notional starting point would be six years and four months. That was reduced by 25% for an early plea in the Local Court.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge found that count 1 was in the mid-range of objective seriousness and in respect of count 2 found that “because of the matters (sic) of aggravation” it was well above the mid-range.
	
	
	The Applicant submitted that the only matter of aggravation identified in respect of count 2 was the fact that the Applicant was on bail at the time. The Applicant submitted that the Sentencing Judge’s statement (at ROS 8.5) that:
	


“… the offender has continually, when at liberty, engaged in the supply of drugs of addiction for reward”

was not established. Rather, he had been convicted of supply offences in 2001, 2007 and 2008.


	
	The Applicant submitted that the Sentencing Judge had placed undue weight on R v Roby [2003] NSWCCA 242, an authority relied upon by the Crown at the sentencing hearing, and made no reference to the cases or the statistics referred to by the Applicant’s counsel. However, his Honour makes no mention of this case and the sentences he imposed were more lenient than even the reduced sentence ordered by this Court in Roby. It is not apparent, therefore, that his Honour placed any weight on it.
	
	
	Counsel for the Applicant in this Court made reference to the decisions of Stanton v R [2008] NSWCCA 326, Huynh v R [2008] NSWCCA 216 and Wicks v R [2012] NSWCCA 208 to suggest that by reference to the sentences in those cases in similar circumstances, the sentences in the present case were manifestly excessive. The Applicant submitted that, accepting that statistics are a blunt tool, the individual sentences on counts 1 and 2 each fell within the top 10% of all sentences imposed. The Applicant submitted that those cases and the statistics demonstrate that the starting points for the two counts in the present matter were starkly out of step with an identifiable range notwithstanding the Applicant’s record.
	
	
	The cases relied upon by the Applicant do not provide assistance. In each of Stanton and Wicks the Applicant appealed against the sentences imposed seeking a reduction on the grounds of parity with a co-offender. In Wicks that application was refused and in Stanton the sentence was reduced but solely by reason of the disparity with the co-offender. In Huynh this Court dismissed the Applicant’s appeal which raised issues relating to special circumstances and that the sentence was manifestly excessive. Nothing said in any of those cases provides any indication of what an appropriate sentence might be in a case like the present. Somewhat ironically in Huynh Johnson J (with whom Allsop P and Price J agreed) said at [61] :
	


… The practice of approaching sentencing appeals by a search for, and comparison with, sentences passed in other cases, is neither helpful nor supported by authority: R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371; R v George (2004) 149 A Crim R 38 at 47 [48]-[49].

See also in that regard Dang v R [2014] NSWCCA 47 at [55], Pham v R [2014] NSWCCA 1115 at [57] and Vandeventer v R [2013] NSWCCA 33 at [45].


	
	The statistics do not assist the Applicant. The sentences imposed fall within the range of those statistics, albeit they are at the upper end.
	
	
	The Applicant submitted that his Honour made no findings about the Applicant’s subjective case except that he found the Applicant to be remorseful but impermissibly dealt with that matter by the discount for the pleas.
	
	
	A reading of his Honour’s Remarks as a whole lead me to the view that his Honour accepted what Ms Hare said and also accepted the evidence the Applicant gave which, as noted earlier, was consistent with Ms Hare’s report. The evidence certainly demonstrates a somewhat unsatisfactory childhood and upbringing. However, although the Applicant’s counsel made reference to Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2012) 249 CLR 571 little that was discussed in that case has any application to the present case
	
	
	The Applicant’s childhood and adolescence did not involve any form of abuse nor of abandonment by his parents. Alcohol and drugs were not features of his home life. Whether he should be regarded as being addicted to drugs was unclear on the evidence. The Applicant himself says that he remains abstinent, by choice it appears, from drugs whilst in prison, despite their availability yet he was using every day when not in prison. There was no psychiatric diagnosis of the Applicant nor any conclusion from Ms Hare about his drug use other than his need for treatment and therapy to address drug and other issues.
	
	
	There must be set against his background and his drug use the fact that he has been in a relationship for some 25 years and has four children to a woman who has stood by and supported him, and who is not involved in the drug scene nor in any criminal nor anti-social behaviour. His mother, sister and adult daughter were present in support at the sentencing proceedings.
	
	
	It may be accepted that the only matter of aggravation identified by the Sentencing Judge in relation to count 2 was the fact that he was on bail at the time of its commission. There is no ground challenging his Honour’s determination that the second offence was “well above the middle of the scale” of objective seriousness although that determination is submitted as forming an explanation for the manifestly excessive sentence. The commission of this offence while on bail, and in the light of the Applicant’s criminal history, was a seriously aggravating factor. Further, four matters, only one of which could be regarded as not serious, were taken into account on a Form 1.
	
	
	His Honour’s statement that the offender had continually when at liberty engaged in the supply of drugs of addiction for reward is difficult to dispute when in periods outside prison totalling two and a half years from the time of his conviction on 28 November 2001 until the commission of the offence constituted by count 1 he had supplied drugs on four separate occasions. When the offence in count 2 is added the statement was entirely justifiable.
	
	
	The Applicant’s counsel also drew attention to the weight of the drugs to suggest that his Honour should have had regard to the fact that the weight on each occasion was well below the top of the indictable range when he assessed objective seriousness. Apart from the fact that this submission was not made to the Sentencing Judge and there is no ground of appeal (as has been noted) challenging the assessment of objective seriousness, the weight of the drug was of less significance in the present case. This was not a single offence committed for the first time where the weight and purity might have more significance. These offences were the fourth and fifth time the Applicant had been charged with supplying drugs. The charges on the Form 1 certificates tended to suggest an ongoing and well-organised drug supply business. In those circumstances the weight of the drugs which happened to be found in the possession of the Applicant at the time of each search is of far less significance.
	
	
	In my opinion the Applicant does not demonstrate that either of the sentences nor the overall sentence was manifestly excessive.
	


Conclusion


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


(1)   Leave to appeal granted.

(2)   Appeal dismissed.


	
	Beech-Jones J: I agree with Davies J.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL: 
	


SUMMARY OF CROWN AND DEFENCE CASE

CROWN CASE

The Crown put its case as follows. Shortly after 10pm on 23 November 2000 [AB] drove in a northerly direction on Kathleen Street, Punchbowl. His wife, [the deceased] was seated in the front passenger seat of their white Toyota Corolla hatchback. Their young child was seated in the rear of the car. Two of [AB]’s friends, Monzer El Husseini and Jalal Al Zahab, were driving ahead of [AB] in a separate car, a blue Holden utility.


	
	A stolen, maroon coloured Nissan Pulsar sedan approached [AB]’s car from behind and flashed its lights. [AB] slowed down and the Pulsar drove alongside the driver’s side of his car. One of the occupants of the Pulsar, using a revolver, fired approximately four shots into [AB]’s car. There were at least two other persons in the Pulsar. It was alleged that the shooting took place in the vicinity of 8 Kathleen Street. It was the Crown case that the applicant fired the shots.
	
	
	[AB] was shot through the neck and seriously wounded. The deceased was shot twice, one bullet skimmed the front of her abdomen and caused minor injuries. The second bullet entered her right upper back and proved fatal. It was not possible to establish the order of the shots. The child passenger was not injured in the shooting.
	
	
	At the time of the shooting, the blue Holden utility was further up Kathleen Street towards the intersection with the street named “The Boulevarde”. After the shots were fired, the assailant’s car accelerated, drove past the blue utility and turned left into The Boulevarde. [AB] managed to drive his car to the intersection and turned right into The Boulevarde. His car came to a stop shortly afterwards. The blue utility followed [AB]’s car into The Boulevarde and stopped just behind it.
	
	
	An unmarked police car was driving eastbound along The Boulevarde at the time that the white Toyota and blue utility turned into that street. The occupants, Officers Callaghan and Campbell, observed the cars driving in an erratic manner before they came to a stop. They saw [AB] exit his car in a wounded condition. They also saw El Husseini and Al Zahab exit the blue utility. [AB] approached the police vehicle waving and shouting, which then drove a short distance away from [AB]. Officer Campbell exited the police car and drew his firearm. At some point [AB] collapsed near the side of the road and the police officers eventually realised that he was the victim of a shooting.
	
	
	Other police officers arrived and unsuccessful attempts were made to resuscitate the deceased. [AB], El Husseini and Al Zahab spoke to the police officers at the scene. The content of these conversations was disputed at trial. The issue was whether [AB] said at this time that he did not know the identity of the assailant. This evidence is dealt with in detail later in this judgment.
	
	
	The assailant’s car was driven to a nearby street in Wiley Park and set on fire. [AB] was taken to a hospital for urgent medical treatment. He underwent surgery to his neck area (repair of a pharyngeal injury and tracheostomy) which was completed at about 2.51am on 24 November 2000. For some days after [AB] regained consciousness, he was either unable to speak or could only speak with difficulty.
	
	
	Two detectives, Karras and Apolony, attended the hospital at about 1pm on 24 November 2000. From this time until 5 December 2000 Detectives Karras and Apolony regularly visited [AB] and spoke to him about the shooting. [AB] was unable to speak for most of this period.
	
	
	Notes were taken during these attendances. The notes were made in a spiral notebook, on hospital notepaper, in Detective Apolony’s notebook and some on loose pieces of paper. On the Crown case, these notes contained [AB]’s handwritten responses to questions from the detectives. The notes are undated. Questions asked by the detectives were not recorded in the notes. No video or sound recording was made of these meetings. Three handwritten statements were taken from [AB] in a police notebook on November 24, 25 and 29. The statements are in a question and answer format.
	
	
	The content of these communications is set out later in this judgment. It was the Crown case that these notes recorded [AB]’s identification of the applicant (referred to as “Fairy”) as the shooter, the applicant’s older brother, Mohammed Dib as the driver of the Pulsar and a third male, Bashar Ibrahim as a rear passenger in the car. The applicant’s motive was said to be that he believed that [AB] was an informer and could implicate him in the killing of Edward Lee.
	
	
	In early December 2000 shortly after his discharge from hospital, [AB] indicated to investigating police that the statements which he made in the hospital were untrue. Police officers attended [AB]’s home and sought to persuade him not to change or retract his evidence. On 15 December 2000 [AB] attended Bankstown Police Station and gave a detailed statement in which he retracted his nomination or identification of the applicant, Mohammed Dib and Bashar Ibrahim, as the assailants.
	
	
	From that time onwards, in the course of giving evidence on a number of occasions in committal, pre-trial and trial proceedings, [AB] maintained that he was unable to identify the shooter and the other assailants. Since then [AB] has consistently stated that the shooter’s face was concealed by a balaclava. Both Monzer El Husseini and Jalal Al Zahab gave evidence that [AB] said words to this effect immediately after the shooting. Monzer El Husseini gave evidence that he observed that the occupants of the Pulsar were wearing balaclavas.
	
	
	The three witnesses to the shooting each gave evidence that was contrary to the Crown case. Leave was granted to the Crown under s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 to cross-examine each of them.
	
	
	The Crown alleged that a baseball cap was found in the vicinity where the shooting occurred. An unfired automatic cartridge was located approximately 10 metres from the cap. The cartridge could not have been used in the handgun that fired the shots. DNA material from at least three people was detected on the cap. Evidence was adduced that a DNA profile matching that of the applicant was extracted from the cap. The name “Omar” was handwritten on the cap. There was evidence that the applicant’s youngest sibling was named Omar. The significance of this evidence was challenged by the defence in a number of ways.
	
	
	With the concurrence of the Crown, the jury was directed that it had to be independently satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of [AB]’s identification of the applicant. In other words, the jury was not permitted to take the DNA evidence into account on the issue of identification of the applicant as the shooter.
	
	
	The Crown also relied upon a witness who gave evidence under the pseudonym “John Lee”. He was a convicted drug dealer who undertook to give evidence against the applicant. He received a substantial discount to his sentence for assisting the authorities. The Crown sought to establish through this witness that the applicant asked about procuring a “hottie” – a stolen car – prior to the shooting. The Crown sought to prove that the applicant had spoken, in the witness’ presence, about [AB] being a police informer and, following media reporting of the incident, had attempted to justify the results of the shooting on this basis.
	
	
	This evidence was relevant to the Crown case on motive. On 17 October 1998 when the applicant was aged 15, he was involved in the stabbing homicide of Edward Lee. At the time of the shooting, the applicant had not been charged with any offence in relation to the Edward Lee matter. The applicant later pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Edward Lee. The incident arose from an altercation between two groups of young males in Telopea Street, Punchbowl where the applicant lived with his family. The applicant lost control and stabbed Lee, a 14 year old, after he saw his older brother knocked unconscious by one of Lee’s friends. This incident was the subject of a large amount of publicity. [AB] was allegedly present at the aftermath of the stabbing and therefore in a position to give incriminating evidence against the applicant.
	
	
	The Crown alleged that the applicant had motive to kill [AB] because 1) he believed that [AB] was a police informer and 2) he knew [AB] was in a position to implicate him in the Edward Lee stabbing. Evidence was given that in July 2000 [AB] gave an induced statement to the NSW Crime Commission which implicated the applicant in the stabbing. There was no evidence that the applicant was aware of this fact (the statement was kept confidential by police in the period leading up to the shooting incident).
	


THE DEFENCE CASE


	
	The applicant was born in December 1982 and was aged 17 at the time of the offences. He was aged 15 when he killed Edward Lee. The applicant did not give evidence in the trial. He relied upon exculpatory evidence given by the key Crown witnesses, i.e. [AB], Monzer El Husseini and Jalal Al Zahab in their evidence in chief, together with other evidence adverse to the prosecution case that was elicited during the cross-examination of Crown witnesses. It was the defence case that the evidence did not establish that the applicant was involved in the shooting incident.
	
	
	The evidence and contentions relied upon by the defence included the following:
	


[AB] gave his first account of events immediately after the shooting before he was taken to the hospital for treatment. There was evidence that [AB] believed he was going to die at the roadside. At this time, Monzer El Husseini asked [AB] if he knew who it was (i.e., if he knew who the shooter was). [AB] responded “No, I don’t, they were wearing balaclavas”.

The first police officers to arrive on the scene were concerned that [AB], El Husseini or Al Zahab were armed and challenged them on this basis. [AB] responded by saying “Don’t fucking say shit, there is no fucking gun, we don’t know who fucking did it”.

The shooting bore the hallmarks of a planned assassination. Deliberate efforts were made at concealment, particularly through the use and subsequent destruction of the stolen car. It would be expected in the circumstances that the assailants would seek to conceal their identity. The use of balaclavas was consistent with this expectation.

It was the defence case that [AB] in his exchanges with police at the hospital did not “identify” the assailants; rather he “nominated” them. The nomination of the assailants was a combination of supposition, confusion and anger on his part and was influenced by the conduct of the investigating detectives and his desire for vengeance. [AB] gave evidence to that effect.

It was argued that the circumstances of the shooting did not allow for an identification of the shooters, let alone the identification of at least two (and possibly three) other occupants in the Pulsar. These circumstances included the lighting conditions at the time, the relative movements of the two cars, the fact that [AB] was being fired at from the time the Pulsar drew alongside his car and was seriously wounded, the rapidity of the shots, and the emission of “muzzle flash” close to [AB]’s face when the pistol was fired.

There was a concentrated attack on the integrity of the investigating police officers. It was alleged that the detectives took advantage of [AB]’s vulnerable and drug affected state following his surgical treatment and during his convalescence. It was argued that Detectives Karras and Apolony attended the hospital with the intention of obtaining evidence against the applicant and thereby influenced [AB] to nominate the applicant as the shooter.

A number of aspects of the investigation were relied upon in support of the attack upon the integrity of the detectives: [AB]’s allegations about the detectives placing improper pressure upon him to implicate the applicant, their failure to keep a reliable record of the hospital interviews with [AB], expert pharmacological evidence given by Professor Starmer concerning [AB]’s susceptibility to influence due to the various drugs administered to him during his hospital stay.

[AB] gave evidence to the effect that he would have personally sought retribution against the person responsible for killing his wife if he knew this persons’ identity. [AB]’s violent criminal history established a capacity to carry out this threat. This evidence was emphasised by the defence, as was the absence of any evidence capable of explaining why on the Crown case theory, [AB] retracted his nomination of the applicant as the shooter.

The defence emphasised that the three key witnesses in the case gave evidence contrary to the Crown case. The Crown’s recourse to cross-examining each of these witnesses, pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 was the subject of criticism, as was the tension between the Crown’s submission that the hospital statements of [AB] provided a sound basis for guilty verdicts, notwithstanding that [AB] was attacked by the Crown as being a thoroughly unreliable and untruthful witness.

The location of DNA on the baseball cap was irrelevant, given that the jury had to be independently satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that [AB] identified the applicant as the shooter.

The DNA evidence was challenged on a number of bases:


	
	No witness gave evidence that the shooter was wearing a cap.
	
	
	Notwithstanding that police utilised gunshot residue testing in the investigation, the cap was never tested for gunshot residue.
	
	
	A crowd gathered in the aftermath of the shooting and for periods of the investigation the crime scene was not properly secured.
	
	
	Due to the phenomenon of transference of DNA onto surfaces like caps, the DNA evidence could not establish whether the applicant wore the cap, or merely came into contact with someone who did.
	
	
	The DNA evidence could not determine when the relevant DNA profile was placed onto the cap.
	


The Crown’s motive case was disputed on a number of bases. John Lee was an unreliable witness by reason of his major drug addiction and the benefit he stood to receive in assisting the authorities. When John Lee was cross-examined, he gave evidence which undermined or contradicted important inferences sought to be drawn by the Crown, particularly those concerning the conversation about procuring a “hottie” and the conversations following media reporting of the incident.

The defence relied on the content of a second statement that [AB] gave to the Crime Commission in which he provided information about the participation of a significant number of others in serious criminal activity. This established that there were potentially others with a motive to kill [AB].

There was no evidence that the applicant knew about [AB]’s statement to the police concerning the Edward Lee stabbing. The proposition that the Edward Lee stabbing was somehow relevant to the shooting incident, was no more than speculation.

The defence relied on the evidence of Armani Derbas, a close friend of the deceased, in the period leading up to her death. She gave evidence that the applicant’s family supported the deceased and were very good friends with [AB], right up to the time of the shooting. The evidence tended to contradict John Lee’s evidence and the Crown case on motive.

TRIAL AND SENTENCE


	
	There had been two previous trials of the applicant for the offences relating to the deceased’s death and the attack on [AB]. Both trials did not proceed to verdict for reasons which are not presently relevant. [AB] gave evidence in the first of those trials and in the trial, the subject of this appeal.
	
	
	The applicant was tried before Barr AJ and a jury in the Supreme Court on an indictment that contained the following counts:
	


Count 1 – The applicant on 23 November 2000 at Punchbowl in the State of New South Wales did murder [the deceased].

Count 2 – The applicant on 23 November 2000 at Punchbowl in the State of New South Wales did wound [AB] with intent to murder [AB].


	
	The applicant was arraigned on 13 June 2012. The jury found him guilty of both counts on 9 July 2012. He was sentenced on 23 November 2012 (R v Moustapha Dib [2012] NSWSC 1431) as follows:
	


Count 1 – Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 25 years with a balance of term of 10 years.

Count 2 – Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 years with an additional term of 5 years.

The individual sentences were partially accumulated resulting in an overall sentence of 40 years with an effective non-parole period of 30 years. The non-parole period expires on 8 July 2041.


	
	The applicant has appealed against the convictions pursuant to ss 5(1)(a) and (b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 upon the following grounds.
	


Ground 1 - The learned trial judge erred by admitting evidence of [AB]'s identification of the appellant.

Ground 2 - The directions in relation to identification evidence were inadequate and occasioned a miscarriage of justice.

Ground 3(a) - The learned trial judge erred by admitting evidence that the appellant was responsible for killing Edward Lee.

Ground 3(b)   - The learned trial judge erred in failing to limit the evidence of motive.

Ground 4 - The warning against impermissible use of evidence of motive was inadequate in the circumstances of the case and occasioned a miscarriage of justice.

Ground 5(a)   - The learned trial judge erred by granting leave to the witness John Lee to revive his memory in court.

Ground 5(b) – A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the impermissible manner in which the Crown Prosecutor was permitted to examine the witness John Lee.

Ground 6 - The learned trial judge erred by refusing to direct the jury that the omission on the part of investigators to test the cap for gunshot residue detracted from proof of the prosecution case.

Ground 7(a) - The learned trial judge erred in failing to give a fair and balanced summing up.

Ground 7(b)   - The learned trial judge erred in failing to adequately put the defence case to the jury.

Ground 8 - The verdicts of guilty are unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence.

Ground 9 – A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the failure of the trial judge to give an adequate warning in respect of “John Lee” pursuant to s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995.


	
	In the hearing of the appeal, the applicant did not press Ground 6.
	


EVIDENCE AT TRIAL

The evidence of [AB] at trial


	
	[AB] gave evidence at trial. He said that he had a good memory of that particular night. He had been at school with the applicant’s older brother and referred to the applicant as his “mate’s brother …” and he saw him on a fairly regular basis. On the evening of Thursday, 23 November 2000, close to dark, [AB], the deceased and their young son were in a white Toyota Seca driving north in Kathleen Street, Wiley Park towards The Boulevarde. His friends, Monzer El Husseini and Jalal Al Zahab were driving ahead of them.
	
	
	A maroon Nissan Pulsar drove past the car [AB] was driving. When it was slightly in front of [AB]’s car (having first drawn level with it) the person sitting in the front passenger seat of the Pulsar, less than two metres away, fired about four shots. The shooter was wearing a balaclava and his arm was out through the car’s window. [AB] did not initially realise that both he and the deceased had been hit. The Pulsar then “took off” up Kathleen Street, as did [AB]. However, the Pulsar turned left at The Boulevarde . [AB] turned right into The Boulevarde, then stopped his car. Al Zahab and El Husseini also turned right into The Boulevarde. They removed the deceased and her son from the car.
	
	
	[AB]’s evidence at trial as to the events at The Boulevarde was:
	


“I jumped out of the car and there was a police car driving down the road in a real quick and I jumped in front of it and when I did jump in front of it, the police officer came down and one of them held the gun straight at me … but when he realised that my neck was bleeding and he seen my wife on the ground he knew there was something wrong … Jalal was trying not to let the blood get out of my neck – him and Monzer, they try and put their fingers on my neck where the holes were … I remember people asking me that who did it, but at that time, my neck, I didn’t know who did it, they were telling me before – in case you die, who did it – a lot of people not only – there was other people there that asking me who did it and I just remembered doing things with my hand and telling them that I think – I don’t know who did it but they were wearing balaclavas.” (T.367.22, T.368.19)


	
	[AB] said that he was unable to identity the shooter, as both the shooter and the driver were wearing balaclavas. He thought that there was at least one person in the back seat, maybe two. He explained what he had told the police at the hospital as follows. He said that the police “were coming every day” and that he communicated with them by writing answers to their questions. He said, “at the beginning they were telling me this was what happened to you because of the statement about Edward Lee that was the main thing they were telling me. That’s what happened here because of what happened with Edward Lee because you didn’t assist us” (T.374.18). [AB] said that the persons he nominated at the hospital were friends of his and he had not had any difficulties with them.
	
	
	Two or three days after he was discharged from hospital (in early December 2000), [AB] went to a police station and “told them I don’t remember who did it”. When he was asked why he had changed what he was saying, he said that after he left hospital he had a chance to think without the police influencing him (T.384.27). He said:
	


“Not changed. I made a statement on them three people, Z, Bashar Ibrahim and Mohammed Dib – them three people. I made a statement against them because of the statement that I already made against Edward Lee. I didn't pursue that statement and I told the police, ""I'm not going to go ahead with that"". So regarding that statement the only thing I got shot for was because I made a statement against Edward Lee, so it made sense, I made a statement against the accused for Edward Lee. Getting shot after it, the police made me realise, ""That's the only way you got shot"", so I had no other choice to say Bashar Ibrahim, Z and Mohamed Dib, that's the only three that I could say that. There was no other way to say anyone else would have did that to me but because of that statement, it made me think that these people really did it to me but did I see them? I didn't see no one in the car, everyone was wearing balaclavas.” (T.385.10)


	
	When asked to explain why he had nominated the applicant as his assailant the day after the shooting, [AB] said that the investigating police put pressure on him and “took advantage of the medication and they took advantage of the circumstance I was in” (T.406.35). He also said:
	


“A. Because there was no - there was no other explanation for it. I made a statement and - that's what happened - that's how I thought that - there's nothing else - I couldn't think of anything else or anyone else - I'm not a good bloke, I done a lot things and I been involved in a lot of shootings but I couldn't think of that day especially with the pressure of the police and that telling me it was them, from the statement you've made - that's why it happened to you…” (T.397.29)

“A. I don't know why I nominated them but it was just, like I told you, the pressure from the police made me think they're the only ones that had something to do with my wife's murder and my shooting I told you, there was no other alternative. I made the statement I couldn't think of anyone else that could do something like this and especially at the time I was under the pressure I was under and I was going through the process of healing and that I wasn't even being told that my wife was dead yet - all of that together was a lot of pressure on my head - I didn't even know what to do, I needed to blame someone, and the easiest people to blame was them for it.” (T.399.7)


	
	[AB] said that except for what he wrote in hospital, he had always maintained that he did not know who shot him and the deceased. He said that this is what he said in his statement on 15 December 2000 and in subsequent court proceedings. He referred to an affidavit which he swore before his then solicitor in Jordan in 2008. The effect of the affidavit was that he was willing to return to Australia to give evidence and that he had not seen the shooter’s face. The affidavit went on to say that he was told in hospital by the police (who had earlier threatened to charge him with his involvement in disposing of evidence in the Edward Lee murder), that he was shot because he did not take up their offer to give evidence in that matter. The affidavit asserted that as a result of what the police told him, he formed the opinion that the shooting was because of his statement against the applicant about the Lee matter; his mind was playing games and he was trying to reconstruct events by placing different people as the shooter; the information he gave to investigating police was a combination of what they had told him and his own imagination.
	


What was said at The Boulevarde


	
	The first time that [AB] said anything about the shooting was when police arrived at the scene of the shooting. His evidence at trial about this was that after the shooting he thought he was going to die and he said the “Ashad”, which is a prayer said by Muslims when they expect to die. He said that in such circumstances he would not have told a lie. His evidence of what he told the police officers at the scene was:
	


“Q. Because they were making a fuss about Jalal and Monzer, they thought that Jalal and Monzer had guns and they were asking them, ""Where are the guns?"" Do you recall that?

A. No, I don't recall that.

Q. You don't recall that. Well, there's evidence here that they were asking, ""Where are the guns, where are the guns?"" or ""Where's the gun?"" Did you do you recall yelling out to the police, ""Don't fucking say shit. There was no fucking gun. We don't know who fucking did it"", do you recall saying that?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Was that being said because the police were treating Jalal and Monzer as though they were the ones who shot you?

A. They thought we done the shooting because that's when they came down the road they pulled the gun on me straightaway and told me to get down on the floor but when they saw blood out of my neck and my wife on the floor they straightaway ran and helped us.” (T.545.29)


	
	The evidence of Al Zahab at trial on this issue was:
	


“Q. What happened then?

A. WITNESS: I thought he was going to die so I said to myself I got the son, give it to him before he goes, you know. Then I came close, then I gave him to [AB]. As soon as I gave him to [AB], [AB] hugged it. Then what I done, I smashed [AB]. Before I smashed [AB], I heard Monzer saying to [AB], ""Who did it? Who did it"". “Balaclava, he was wearing a balaclava.” That's when I grabbed the son and put him on the side and that's when I moved away from the scene because I was worried about the kid. I grabbed the kid and made sure he was okay.” (T.337.15)

“Q. Who said, ""Who did it? Who did it?""

A. WITNESS: Monzer said that, he says, ""Who did it?""

Q. Can you tell us did [AB] say anything at that stage?

A. ""They were wearing balaclava"".

Q. The words that you say he used were, ""They were wearing"" -

A. WITNESS: ""Balaclava"". (T.338.19)


	
	The evidence of El Husseini on this issue was:
	


“A. We pulled up behind [AB], [AB] jumped out of his car, he's running around going berserk, he had blood pissing out of his neck, I went to [AB] to help him, to see what happened to him, [AB] was talking to me, he was shouting, going berserk, I tried calming him down, by then people had come out of the houses and that. So Islamic Islamic Sheikh come out, Islamic priest, tried talking to me about helping me with [AB], or made [AB] lay down on the floor and [AB] was saying he's going to die, he's going to die, he's going to die, he thought he was going to die and then I asked him a question, I asked him ""did you know who it is"". He said to me ""no, I don't, they were wearing balaclavas"" and then the Islamic priest told me to put my hands around his neck to stop the bleeding, I done that, but [AB] was going berserk, he was going berserk, and then I remembered his wife - that his wife was in the car.” (T.1184.9)

“Q. It's at that time that you asked him, around that time, ""Who did this?"", yes?

A. Yes.

Q. And according to you he said ""They were wearing balaclavas""?

A. That's correct.” (T.1194.37)

“Q. Do you recall [AB] calling out something like ""Don't talk shit. We don't know who did it""?

A. To me or -

Q. To you, to the police; to the police?

A. He was telling them, he was calling out to the police telling them about me, that it wasn't me. Yeah, that's right.

Q. He was telling the police it wasn't you?

A. That's right.

Q. Do you recall hearing him say ""We don't know who did it?""

A. That's correct.” (T.1195.22)


	
	Constables Campbell and Callaghan were the first police officers to arrive. They were there entirely by accident. Constable Campbell in his statement described [AB] running towards their vehicle, throwing his arms from side to side and screaming in an aggressive way. He was yelling “What are you cunts going to do? Fucking help me”. He then ran back to his vehicle and drove towards the police vehicle causing Constable Campbell to raise his pistol and direct him to stop. His vehicle came to a stop approximately three metres from the police vehicle. He again rushed towards the police vehicle waving his hands but then fell to the ground. In his statement read at trial Constable Campbell said:
	


“At this time between 10 and 20 Middle Eastern males had started gathering from nearby residences. Duty Officer Hallinan has also arrived and has attempted to move some of these persons from the scene. I said to El Husseini, ""Where's the gun? Who shot him Who has a gun""?

After asking these questions [AB] has started screaming from the ground and started kicking out. [AB] said, ""Don't fucking say shit, there was no fucking gun, you don't know fucking did it"".” (T.194.41)

In cross-examination Constable Campbell accepted that the comment “Don’t fucking say shit” could have been directed at him, rather than at El Husseini. He also agreed that rather than “You don’t know fucking did it” [AB] may have said “We don’t know who fucking did it” (T.213.20).


	
	Constable Callaghan in his statement said:
	


”[AB] has then whilst holding his throat leaned up to his right of the roadway and looked at El Husseini and yelled “Don’t fucking say shit. There was no fucking gun. We don’t know who fucking did it”. [AB] has then become aggressive and started kicking his legs out towards El Husseini’s direction and in doing so, has struck Duty Officer Hallinan’s leg.” (T.292.14)


	
	In his evidence at trial, he said:
	


“Q. In your evidence you said the words, ""Don't fuckin say shit. There was no fuckin gun. We don't know who did it."" Was anything else said before the reference to ""who did it""?

A. Yes. It was, that was that reaction to me was said after when I've written here I heard El Husseini say ""Don't worry man, it's only a .22,"" and then that led into ""Where's the gun? Who shot him?"" And then that reaction came.” (T.295.37)

“Q … The record that you have in your statement is 'There was no fuckin gun' but I'm asking you whether it's possible given what [AB] was reacting to whether he might have said 'there is no fuckin gun'?

A. No. Definitely ""Don't fuckin say shit. There was no fuckin gun. We don't know who fuckin did it.”

Q. I'll just take you to those last words. Your definite recollection is ""We don't know who fuckin did it""?

A. Yes.” (T.303.40)


	
	Detective Inspector Hallinan, who was then a detective sergeant, arrived shortly after Constables Campbell and Callaghan. In his statement, he said:
	


“I went back to where [AB] was lying to speak with Constable Callaghan. Before I had the opportunity to speak with Constable Callaghan I heard Constable Campbell say, 'Where's the gun, who shot him?' I looked around and saw El Husseini and Constable Campbell a few steps behind me. Without warning, [AB] lent up and suddenly kicked me in the legs twice. Simultaneously he screamed out, 'Don't fucking say shit, there was no fucking gun. We don't know who did it'.” (T.910.23)


	
	At trial, he said:
	


“Q. At the stage when Constable Campbell is yelling at El Husseini and Al Zahab, ""Where's the gun? Where's the gun? Who shot him?"" it's at that stage that [AB] suddenly arks up, he kicks you in the legs twice yes?

A. Yes.

…

“Q. He was yelling at the police officers, wasn't he?

A. Well, he was yelling I don't know who he was yelling to but he was certainly yelling.

Q. He was, as you perceived him, responding to what the police were saying?

A. Yes.

Q. And in the course of that he is saying, ""We don't know who did it""; correct? That's quite clear, he's saying, ""We don't know who did it""?

A. Well, he's saying, you know, ""We don't know shit"".

Q. No, he wasn't saying, ""We don't know shit"", he was saying, ""We don't know who did it""?

A. Yes.” (T.913.21)


	
	At no time did any of the police officers see a Muslim religious person or cleric approach or speak to [AB].
	


The hospital statements


	
	The evidence of what happened at the St George Hospital came from Detectives Karras and Apolony. Except where indicated, their statements and evidence were in identical terms. This was a source of cross-examination and adverse comment at trial.
	
	
	The evidence of what [AB] wrote while in the St George Hospital was of fundamental importance in the trial. It formed the basis of the Crown case. If that evidence was not accepted by the jury as honest and reliable, the Crown had no case. It is for this reason that I have set out this evidence in its entirety. As can be seen from the summary of [AB]’s evidence at trial, he did not deny that he wrote what was recorded by the police officers, but said that what he had written was untrue. He also challenged the circumstances in which he wrote those responses, i.e. that certain suggestions were made to him by the police officers.
	
	
	The first interview at the hospital took place on 24 November 2000 between 1pm and 2.10pm. The following conversation took place with Detective Karras asking questions and [AB] writing the answers:
	


“KARRAS (K): How are you going [AB]? Can you tell me who did this to you?”

[AB] then wrote in the notebook “fairy”.

“Did you show them statements?”

K: “ No, you know I wouldn't do that. I have had nothing to do with them"".

[AB] then wrote:

""Why did this happen?""

K: ""I don't know. Can you tell me what type of car they were driving?""

[AB] wrote:

“Tinted windows. expt 2 windows open/

front fairy

back don't know"".

K: “I want to speak with you further about this and take notes”.

[AB] wrote: “I want to sleep”. (Exs AJ, AK; T.640.12 – 641.17)


	
	24 November 2000 – 2.10pm – 3.22pm
	


K: “[AB] I want you to tell me what actually happened?:

[AB] wrote: “I will handle it”.

K: “No, no you leave that up to us.”

[AB] wrote: “Bad luck.

My wife is dead.”

K: “Look we need your assistance can you tell us anything about the car?”

[AB] wrote: “Maroan Pulser.

Station wagon.” (Ex AL; T.642.1)


	
	24 November 2000 – sometime before 3.22pm
	


K: “What else can you tell us?”

[AB] wrote: “Give me my statements and I’ll think about it.

The original.

My copy.”

K: “I’m not going to do that.” (Ex AM, T.642.32)


	
	24 November 2000 – 3.38pm – 4.01pm. Detectives Karras and Apolony returned to the Intensive Care ward.
	


K: “[AB] was Monzer with you last night?”

(There is a dispute as to what was written in answer to that question. The Crown asserted that what [AB] wrote was “Maybe funny”. [AB] said that what he wrote was “Maybe fairy”.)

The written response is Ex AN. It is a scrawled response which could be the word “funny” or “fairy”. The response “maybe funny” makes no sense. The response “maybe fairy” makes more sense in the context of the question but is not fully responsive (Ex AN, T.643.13).


	
	As the officers began to read [AB]’s last response, he indicated that he wanted to write more. [AB] then wrote:
	


“Help me Monzer.

My wife is dead.

Bro all the way.

Brother.”

Below this statement is [AB]’s signature. [AB] then wrote:

“Help the op cops only.

Karris.”

K: “Do you want me to show him that?” (Ex AO, T.643.17)

[AB] nodded his head.

K asked: “A do you want to tell me in statement form who shot you?”

[AB] nodded in agreement.

The official jurat was inserted in sticker form. The following was then recorded in Detective Apolony’s notebook on page 3:

K: “Can you tell me who shot at you and your wife last night at 10.15pm in Kathleen Street Lakemba?”

[AB]: “Fairy” and signed his name.

K: “By “Fairy” do you mean [the applicant] from xxxx Punchbowl?”

[AB]: “Yes” and signed his name (Ex AP, T.644.2)


	
	Detectives Karras and Apolony left the ward at 4pm. Subsequently they spoke to Monzer El Husseini, who declined to give a statement or assist with the matter. At about 9.15pm they again entered the Intensive Care ward. They were accompanied by [AB]’s brother, MB. MB was allowed time to speak to [AB] alone. A short time later, MB approached the detectives and handed over a page of hospital clinical note paper which contained the following:
	


“Basher

Dib Mohammed

Fairy Moustapha”.

This document was Exhibit AQ.


	
	24 November 2000 – shortly after 9.15pm. Detectives Karras and Apolony entered the room with MB and Detective Karras said:
	


“How many people were in the car that shot at you?”

[AB] wrote:

“4 Dib MOH

fairy Dib

Basher Ibra”

K: “Can you tell me where each person was seated in the car?”

([AB] identified the positions in the car and Detective Karras wrote the names in the square which he had drawn.)

MB showed [AB] the same piece of paper and said to him:

“Is this where they were sitting?” pointing to the square. [AB] nodded.

K: “[AB] is it all right if we write all this in a notebook interview?”

[AB] wrote: “Tomorrow”.

The depiction shows “Fairy” in the front passenger seat, Moha as the driver and Basher in the backseat behind the driver (Ex AR, T.645.48).


	
	25 November 2000 - Detectives Karras and Apolony returned to the hospital to speak to [AB] who had been moved to the Day Surgery ward. The detectives met [AB]’s parents, who were accompanied by MB. MB gave Detective Karras a piece of paper on which was written “I give authorisation to bury my wife tomorrow” (Ex AT).
	
	
	The following then took place:
	


K: “[AB] are you ready to give us a statement?”

[AB] wrote: “Is it going to affect my breathing?

He started it”.

K: “If you feel up to it, we will get on with it.”

[AB] wrote: “Give me the original copy and I’ll sign it.”

K: “You mean the original statements you have already given us?”

[AB] wrote: “I’m sure if they weren’t shown this would of not happened.”

Detective Karras wrote “They were” … then stopped writing. He then said “They were never shown”.

[AB] then wrote on another piece of paper “Where’s Monzer?”

K: “He was charged with breaching his bail. I showed Monzer your note you wrote yesterday and he told me he is not giving any statement and he is not going to help”.

[AB] wrote: “I’m not helping”.

K: “Why not?”

[AB] wrote: “Something up there”.

K: “We really need you to give us a statement to assist us with the investigation”.

[AB] wrote: “My wife is dead and she was pregnant.

I’m going to fuck em.

One week.

One yer.

One month.

I’m going to fuck em.”

[AB] pointed to his head.

K: “Do you have a headache?”

[AB] nodded.

K: “Do you want us to go and come back later?”

[AB] nodded. (Exs AU, AV and AW, T.651.28 – 652.19)


	
	25 November 2000 – 3.15pm
	


Detectives Karras and Apolony returned two hours later.

K: “A are you ready to give us a statement now?”

[AB] nodded and tried to say the name “Monzer”.

K: “Do you want to tell me about Monzer?”

[AB] wrote: “His a good bloke.

We’ve been going to the mosque together.”

K: “He’s not prepared to assist us. Will you give us a further statement?”

[AB] wrote: “What’s going to happen after this?”

K: “We’re going to put you in witness protection.

[AB] wrote: “Am I allowed to go were ever I want?”

K: “That’s up to witness protection people. They will be looking after you.”

[AB] wrote: “Denmark”

K: “After all the court matters are finished, you can do what you like. Until then you have to stay in the country, abide by what they say. Will you assist us in the Edward Lee murder as well?”

[AB] shook his head.

K: “Why not?”

[AB] wrote: “I’ll see this is personal.

The other isn’t.”

K: “Are you prepared to give us a statement now?”

[AB] wrote: “Later”.

K: “When?”

[AB] wrote: “When I got my demands.”

K: “How much are you willing to assist?”

[AB] wrote: “Not the Kalache cas.

Only edward Lee.” (Exs AX, AY; T.653.12)


	
	Detective Apolony placed the official jurat into his police notebook. The following sets out what is recorded on pp 4-6 of that notebook.
	


“K: A do you agree yesterday, Friday 24th, you wrote on a piece of paper with St George Hospital letterhead on it the number 4 and the names “Dib Moh, Fairy Dib and Basher Ibra”?”

[AB] wrote: “Yes” and signed his name.

K: “Are these the names of the people in the car that shot at you?[AB] wrote: “Yes” and signed his name.

K: “Can you tell me which of these males in the car shot at you?”

[AB] wrote: “fairy Dib” and signed his name.

K: “By the name Dib Moh are you referring to Mohammed Dib?”

[AB] wrote: “Yes” and signed his name.

K: “Are you prepared to give evidence in relation to the murder of Edward Lee at Punchbowl on 17 October 1998 as per the statement you have already supplied to Detective Karras and Apolony?”

[AB] wrote: “Yes” and signed his name. “Ex AZ, T.654.17)


	
	Detective Karras left the room to collect MB. While he was gone, Detective Apolony said to [AB] “Can I ask you a few questions, just to confirm what happened? I’m not going to ask you to sign anything, I just want to ask you some background questions.”
	


[AB] nodded.

A: “Which side was the car on when they shot at you, the driver’s side or the passenger’s side?”

[AB] drew two cars, side by side, and identified where various persons were seated by writing “wife/me/Dib Fairy/Moh/Bash”. As depicted on that document, Dib Fairy was in the front passenger seat, Moh was the driver and Bash was in the rear seat behind the driver.

A: “Did you see the car when you drove down the street? Did it pass you from the other side or from behind?”

[AB] did another sketch which illustrated “thier car”, “my car” and “Monzer car/15M”. ([AB] drew an arrow from “thier car” up beside the driver’s side of his car.) (Exs BA, BB, T.772.1)


	
	Detective Apolony said “How far down the street from your car was Monzer’s car?”
	


[AB] wrote: “15 metres” on the sketch beside Monzer’s car.

A: “Did the others in the car have guns?”

[AB] shrugged.

A: “Was Fairy the only person you saw with a gun?”

[AB] nodded.

A: “When you drove down Kathleen Street, did you see their car in the street?”

[AB] shook his head.

A: “Do you think they were hiding around in Melrose Avenue.”

[AB] shrugged.

A: “Was Fairy’s window down?”

[AB] nodded.

A: “Were any other windows down?”

[AB] pointed to the rear nearside passenger position of the offending vehicle.

A: “How many shots did they fire?”

[AB] shrugged.

A: “More than six?”

[AB] shook his head.

A: “More than three?”

[AB] nodded.

A: “So between three and six?”

[AB] nodded. (Detective Apolony said that this conversation was recorded by way of notes made contemporaneously by him on p 84 of a diary.)


	
	Detective Karras returned to the ward with MB. MB requested to speak to [AB] alone. MB and [AB] spoke for about 10 minutes in Arabic and during this time, both [AB] and MB were very emotional. A short time later, MB called the detectives into the room.
	


MB said: “He wants to tell you something about Basher.”

K: “What do you want to tell me [AB]?”

[AB] wrote: “I seen his face, if it was him.

From the corner of my eye but I’m not sure if it was him.” (The pen ceased working and [AB] wrote the second sentence in pencil.)

[AB] and MB spoke alone. MB handed a paper to the officers on which [AB] had written “I don’t think basher was thier.

But the other 2 – 1 hundred percent.” On the reverse of the page [AB] wrote: “Tell them.” (Exs BC, BD; T.655.23 – 656.15).


	
	29 November 2000 – 12.30pm
	


Detectives Karras and Apolony attended St George Hospital and spoke to [AB].

K: “[AB] are you still not sure about Basher?”

[AB] shrugged.

K: “Is the fourth person Basher’s brother?”

[AB] wrote: “Jail”

K: “Is he Lebanese?”

[AB] nodded.

K: “Have you seen this person before?”

[AB] nodded.

K: “Does he hang around with them?”

[AB] nodded.

K: “Is he from Telopea Street?”

[AB] mouthed “no”.

K: “Did you see the four wheel drive?”

[AB] shook his head.

K: “Did you see Shadi’s white Prado?”

[AB] shook his head and then wrote: “Did you find the car?”

K: “Yes”

[AB] wrote: “Stolen car”.

K: “Did you tell MB that you saw a black four wheel drive?”

[AB] shook his head.

K: “Did you see your son today?”

[AB] nodded and wrote: “He got scared”.

K: “Did you talk to the doctors?”

[AB]: “They lie too much”

K: “We will need a statement to keep them in when they go for Supreme Court bail. Is that okay?”

[AB] nodded.

K: “We’ll need to speak to you further about Basher.”

[AB] wrote: “If you really think about it there really all out and about.

They all stick together”

K: “It doesn’t matter because you saw it”

[AB] wrote: “Leave Basher for me”.


	
	29 November 2000 – 7pm
	


Detectives Karras and Apolony, together with a Constable Melby, returned at about 7pm, at which time Detective Karras said:

“[AB] are you ready for us to ask you some questions in the notebook in relation to your wife’s murder?”

[AB] nodded.


	
	Detective Apolony placed the official jurat in the notebook.
	
	
	The following is taken from Detective Apolony’s notebook, pp 10 – 18.
	


K: “As you know, Detective Apolony and I are investigating the shooting murder of your wife, xxxxx, and the shooting of yourself at Lakemba on 23 November 2000, do you understand that?”

[AB] wrote: “Yes”.

K: “Do you agree, on 25 November 2000 I spoke to you at St George Hospital?”

[AB] wrote: “Yes.”

K: “Do you agree you signed Detective Apolony’s notebook to say there were four people in the car that shot at you?”

[AB] wrote: “Yes”.

K: “Do you agree that you signed the notebook to say that you recognised three of those people?”

[AB] wrote: “Yes”

K: “Do you agree that you signed Detective Apolony’s notebook stating that Basher Ibrahim was one of those three people?”

[AB] wrote: “Yes”.

K: “Do you agree that later that afternoon, you stated that you were not 100 percent sure about Basher Ibrahim being the third person?”

[AB] wrote: “Yes”

K: “Can you tell me who that third person was in the car that shot at you?”

[AB] wrote: “Basher Ibrahim.”

K: “Can you tell me why you stated to Detective Apolony and myself you were not sure Basher Ibrahim was in the car?”

[AB] wrote: “Because he was a friend but it got personal revenge.”

K: “What do you mean by personal revenge?”

[AB] wrote: “For what they did to my wife I wanted to get him myself.”

K: “Where was Basher Ibrahim sitting in the car that shot at you?”

[AB] wrote: “Behind the driver’s seat of Moh Dib.”

K: “How long have you known Basher Ibrahim?”

[AB] wrote: “10 years.”

K: “Can you tell me where he lives?”

[AB] wrote: “x xxxx Street, Greenacre.”

K: “What was your relationship with Basher Ibrahim?”

[AB] wrote: “Good friends.”

K: “Do you know who the fourth person in the car was?”

[AB] wrote: “No.”

K: “Have you seen the fourth person in the car before that night?”

[AB] wrote: “Yes.”

K: “Can you tell me when you have seen this person before?”

[AB] wrote: “Don’t remember.”

K: “How long before this incident was it that you saw this person?”

[AB] wrote: “Either 97 to 98 when I was in or out of jail.”

K: “As far as you’re aware, is this person an associate of Mohammed or Moustapha Dib?”

[AB] wrote: “Don’t remember.

Only telephone calls.”

K: “How do you know that this person used to ring the Dib brothers?”[AB] wrote: “They used to call him Sam Merreekville. Slang terms but didn’t like each other.”

K: “Would you be able to recognise this person again?”

[AB] wrote: “Yes.”

Constable Melby asked: “Have you made this statement of your own free will?”

[AB] wrote: “Yes.”

Constable Melby asked: “Has any threat, promise or inducement been held out to you to make this statement?”

[AB] wrote: “No.”

Constable Melby asked: “Have you any complaints to make about this statement or the way you were interviewed?”

[AB] indicated “No” and the officer wrote this down.

Constable Melby asked: “Were you able to read this statement?”

[AB] responded: “Yes”

Constable Melby asked: “Are you willing to sign this statement as a true and accurate statement made by you?”

[AB] answered: “Yes” and signed. (Ex BE, T.658)


	
	Detective Karras spoke to [AB] on 1 December 2000. The following exchange took place.
	


[AB] wrote: “Where’s Apolony?”

K: “He’s on the phone. Who’s name is your unit in?”

[AB] wrote: “[the deceased]”

K: “What is the unit address there. We have to search your unit.”

[AB] wrote: “x xxxx Melrose Avenue.

Are they searching the house now?”

K: “Shortly.”

[AB] wrote: “All of it is mine and hers.”

K: “Where are your keys to the unit?”

[AB] wrote: “bunch of keys” and mouthed the word “car”.

Were’s the doctor?”

K: “He’s in the next room” and asked [AB]: “Who do you rent from?”

[AB] wrote: “Community Housing Bankstown.”

K: “Are you ready to answer some questions in the notebook about that?”

[AB] wrote: “Not now for this one.”

K: “Can you tell me who Sam Marrickville is?”

[AB] wrote: “I still have to see Sam Marrickville to make sure it’s him.”

[AB] wrote: “I’m having bad dreams” and started to cry. (Ex BK, T.660.45 – 662.36)


	
	Detectives Karras and Apolony attended the St George Hospital on 5 December 2000 and spoke to [AB].
	


K: “Are you prepared to make a statement in the matter of Edward Lee and the murder of your wife?”

[AB] (speaking rather than writing): “Yes”.

A formal typed record of interview was conducted by Detective Karras and typed by Detective Apolony. When [AB] was shown his statement of 13 July 2000 about the death of Edward Lee, he refused to continue saying “I’m not answering that. I don’t want to be interviewed and I’m not making any statement.” (Ex BL)

The evidence of Detectives Karras and Apolony at trial


	
	Detective Karras said that his involvement in the investigation concerning the shooting was limited to dealing with [AB] because of a pre-existing relationship. His previous dealings with him had been in the context of him giving an induced witness statement on 13 July 2000 about the death of Edward Lee. [AB] was to be a witness before he became a victim on 23 November 2000.
	
	
	Detective Karras said that [AB] was “perfectly co-operative” when spoken to in hospital. He said that he (Karras) had not asked how the shooting had happened and who was responsible because “he was not in a condition to give me a lengthy story. They were very short answers [and he] was using his own slang … straight up he said “Fairy”.” (T.759 – 60) Both Detectives Karras and Apolony gave their evidence by reading substantial parts of their witness statements before the jury.
	
	
	Detective Karras said that except for the first two occasions, he had a video camera with him when he spoke with [AB]. It was not used because [AB] did not want to be recorded. He agreed that it was probably standard procedure by the time of trial to video record a person giving information, but as at November 2000 it was “not for a witness … I treated him as a victim of crime [and] a witness.” He agreed that [AB] had at an earlier time named upward of 20 or more serious criminal persons for various serious crimes and agreed that any of these persons might have had a motive to kill [AB].
	
	
	Detective Karras was cross-examined to the effect that making his statement on 19 December 2000 with Apolony was improper because corroborating officers should produce independent records of the event. Detective Karras denied that proposition. He said that the statement was made by reference to duty books, TIMS running sheets and intelligence reports. When cross-examined about the contemporaneity of the notes recording the conversations with [AB], and the fact that his statement was not made until 19 December 2000, Detective Karras referred to the contemporaneous records which set out each interaction with [AB] and which enabled him to prepare an accurate statement.
	
	
	Detective Karras specifically denied that he “stood over” [AB], that he nominated any person to him as responsible for the shootings, or had persuaded him that the applicant and Basher were involved. He denied that his evidence was “a tissue of lies”.
	
	
	Detective Karras was re-called on the issue of running sheets/information/intelligence reports and explained the process of creation and storage of that information. He denied the proposition that the running sheets, although commenced on the dates specified, were in fact completed later or amended between their creation and being entered on the police information system. Detective Karras rejected the proposition that he and Detective Apolony had “fabricated or doctored” documents once it became known that [AB] was “not going to help”.
	
	
	Unlike Detective Karras, Detective Apolony had attended the crime scene, arriving at about 1am on Friday 24 November 2000. He spoke to various police and was later involved in the execution of a search warrant before being sent with Detective Karras to attend St George Hospital to speak to [AB]. He was present when the applicant was arrested.
	
	
	Detective Apolony said that he and Detective Karras had “attempted to video record the conversations and interviews with [AB] but that [AB] had objected to this by raising his right hand and waving the video camera away indicating that he did not want it recorded”.
	
	
	Detective Apolony was the officer in charge of the investigation into the death of Edward Lee on 17 October 1998. He agreed that after [AB] gave him the statement on 13 July 2000, he did not immediately arrest the applicant for that offence. He was still investigating the offence when on 25 July 2000 [AB] said that he did not want to give evidence or assist the police. He was unable to say why the applicant was not arrested immediately after he and Detective Karras had [AB]’s identification of the shooter. The decision to arrest or not to arrest the applicant was not his.
	
	
	Detective Apolony denied that in conversations with [AB], he or Detective Karras had said that it was the applicant who shot him because of his witness statement implicating him in the Edward Lee killing. He said in cross examination that he did not know why [AB] and the deceased were shot because “those statements he made were never shown to anyone between July and November when this happened. So there was no evidence or there’s no indication that it related to his statement because we had not told anyone about it” (T.806).
	
	
	Detective Apolony said that neither he nor Detective Karras had decided anything about who was responsible before speaking to [AB] who immediately told them who was responsible. He agreed that the first few pages of his spiral notebook (Ex BF), immediately before the page where [AB] wrote “Fairy”, contained some details of the applicant, Ahmed and Mohammed Dib and the name of a solicitor who acted for some of them. Detective Apolony explained that these details related to the investigation into the Edward Lee killing, and included the applicant as the person who had done the stabbing.
	
	
	Detective Apolony was cross-examined extensively about how his statement and that of Detective Karras were in almost all respects identical when setting out the exchanges with [AB]. Like Detective Karras, he referred to the joint compilation of the statements from the TIMS documents, information reports and running sheets. He explained that the practice was not to include running sheets and a brief of evidence but rather, as occurred here, to include in the witness statement those parts of the running sheets which were relevant.
	
	
	Detective Apolony denied that the time taken between 1pm and 2.10pm (the first exchange between Detective Karras and [AB]) was spent persuading [AB] that the applicant was responsible for the shooting which had occurred because of [AB]’s statement implicating the applicant in the killing of Edward Lee.
	
	
	He denied that during the search of Monzer El Husseini’s home he had heard one of the police say “we will take him back, charge him with murder and see what he says” although he was aware that El Husseini had been arrested and as “it was the early stages yet, we [didn’t] know what involvement he had”. He also denied that he had put [AB] up to writing Exhibit AO. He said that [AB] “off his own bat grabbed the note pad and wrote down “help me Monzer” …”. He also disagreed that [AB] had written “maybe Fairy” rather than “maybe funny”.
	


The evidence of John Lee


	
	A witness using the pseudonym “John Lee” was called in the Crown case. Lee had been at school with the applicant (whom he knew as “Fairy”) and his brothers. He also knew [AB] and others in the Punchbowl area. He did not, however, regard himself as being “close” to either the applicant or [AB].
	
	
	He left school in 1996 and after some time began selling cocaine and heroin in Kings Cross daily. He “wanted to do what my friends were doing and I just wanted to be cool and stuff”. He sold those drugs for about a year or a little longer (he was aged about 18) and it was in about 1998/99. At the time he was using cannabis, heroin and cocaine. For eight months to a year he was selling heroin and cocaine on Telopea Street, Punchbowl doing the “afternoon shift” until he was arrested in November 2000. At that stage he was using drugs every day himself, mainly heroin and cannabis.
	
	
	He said that at that time he saw the applicant every day and had spoken to him on occasions. In a conversation with him in Telopea Street the applicant said “[AB] was a dog”. Lee could not remember if others were present, although there were lots of people there every day. He said that the applicant “used to say that [AB] was a dog” and “if you testify your next of kin will die”. Lee said that the applicant used to say this “in different conversations, like we used to bring it up all the time that [AB] was a dog but I didn’t know what reason for”. The description “dog” was understood by Lee to mean a person who “gives statements to the police”. Lee said that the term was used more than once by other people as well as the applicant, although the latter “was the main one saying it, like that’s how I knew, but I really didn’t know why he was a dog”.
	
	
	Lee came to hear of the shooting of [AB] after arriving in Telopea Street to sell drugs and “[the applicant] and a couple of other boys, they had a newspaper and they were reading it, and they told me [AB] had been shot and I saw a picture of his wife’s car”. Lee said, “No, shoot him, but why his wife and [the applicant] said if you kill someone, you have to kill the witness too or otherwise they become a witness”. Lee said that the police would have found the shells to which the applicant replied “No, they would have found shit because they wore gloves and balaclavas and stuff like that”.
	
	
	Lee was given leave to refresh his recollection from his witness statement as to these conversations and confirmed his earlier evidence that the applicant had referred to [AB] as a “dog” “Like, no more than a week” before the shooting. The applicant also said that [AB] “was going to testify the next day”. A person “Wally” said that Monzer [El Husseini] was also a “dog” but the applicant said he was not, although he named Alex Popovic and Joey Allen as “dogs”. The following is the more detailed evidence which Lee gave by refreshing his memory from time to time from his statement.
	
	
	Lee was in Telopea Street with the applicant and others “probably a couple of days” before [AB] was shot when the applicant asked “Freckles” [Mohammed Ismail] “Can you get me a hottie [a stolen car]? If you can’t get me one, I’ll just get someone else, one of my other people that used to get Michael Kanaan stolen cars, to get me one”. In a separate conversation the applicant said “If you testify your next of kin will die”. The applicant said that he wanted to put something about Punchbowl in the newspaper.
	
	
	Lee said that “probably the day after [AB] had been shot and his wife” again in a conversation in Telopea Street with the applicant and others, the applicant said “If you shoot someone you have to shoot the witness too because the witness will become a Crown [witness] and that’s how people get done for murder”. Later in that conversation, the applicant said “the stolen car was burnt up the road and the police are probably going to raid here … They found a hottie up the road, next to Tony Haddad’s house”. The applicant also said “If you shoot someone, you have to shoot the witness too. I don’t feel sorry for no-one because that’s how people get done for murder”.
	
	
	Lee said that within “one or two days after the shooting … I just rocked up there [Telopea Street] and they were really looking at the [Daily Telegraph] paper. We were all looking at the paper, together yeah and just talking about the incident … I remember [the applicant] telling me that [AB] got shot twice in the neck and his wife – and he lived and he got shot in the voice box so he won’t be able to testify now and his wife got one shot in the stomach and she just died … and he deserved it for all the bad things he’s done” (T.944).
	
	
	In another conversation with the applicant about the newspaper article, Lee commented that police would find “shells, bullet casings” from the gun to which the applicant replied “No they wouldn’t have found shoot because they would have been professionals, they would have used a revolver, balaclavas, stolen car, they would have wore gloves” (T.943).
	
	
	Within a few days Lee, the applicant and a number of others were arrested at Telopea Street by police. Lee was charged with various offences, including the supply of drugs. He later received a 60 percent discount on sentence for his assistance to authorities, including his statement to police of 30 November 2000 relative to this matter, and information concerning the killing of Edward Lee. Lee said that at the time of the events just related, he was using drugs every day and spending his daily earnings on them. He smoked heroin daily, sometimes snorted cocaine and also used cannabis.
	
	
	In cross-examination Lee agreed that he had been dealing in drugs for a long time and that he faced charges with a maximum sentence of 20 years. He also agreed that he knew (because he had done it before), that if he gave police information – that assistance would or could garner a big sentence discount. He agreed that on 28 November 2000 when he was examined on oath before the Crime Commission he said he had no information about [AB]’s shooting. He disagreed that the conversation about the “hottie” was “information for the shooting”; in fact he had “never heard [the applicant] shot anyone”. Lee agreed that the applicant was not at that time “big noting himself to be a big man like Gee, look what I’d done … all the discussions were about what was in the newspaper”.
	
	
	Lee agreed that he had not himself prepared his witness statement and that it used language he would not use. The police had prepared it. Nevertheless, he said that the contents were true. He agreed that he was addicted to heroin at the time of his arrest in November 2000 and had suffered withdrawal following his arrest. He agreed that at the time his witness statement was being prepared [when he was visited by police “more than a couple of times”] because of his withdrawing from heroin, he was not in a state to do anything much but agree with police and sign it.
	
	
	He agreed that nothing the applicant said made him think that he had anything to do with the shooting. The discussions about the shooting followed publicity concerning it and the applicant did not say what it was that [AB] had been “dogging” about, including whether it had anything to do with the applicant, nor any killing. He was aware that the applicant’s brothers were involved in car re-birthing and that the “hottie” may have had something to do with that.
	
	
	Armani Derbas, a friend of the deceased, gave evidence. She said:
	


“A. Yeah, she was concerned [AB] had been going around shooting at

people, something to do with he had done his time for something about Canterbury Road or some boys but he had been going around shooting at guys and she was really worried about his safety.

Q. Was she concerned that he had enemies? That is [AB]?

A. Yeah, he'd shot at people so she was concerned about that and she was worried about they were going to get back at him.” (T.1178.50 – 1179.7)


	
	She agreed in cross-examination that the Dib family were very supportive of the deceased.
	


“Q. So far as the Dibs were concerned, [AB] and [the deceased] were friends with the Dib family right up until the death?

A. They were. The Dibs supported - the Dibs were the only ones that supported [the deceased]. Nobody supported her. Only them. So they were very, very good friends and [AB] as well.” (T.1180.28)


	
	Professor Starmer gave evidence as to the possible effect on [AB] of the drugs administered to him while he was in hospital. Professor Starmer had forty years experience in research on the effects of drugs and alcohol. He had been a professor of pharmacology at the University of Sydney for in excess of 25 years.
	
	
	Professor Starmer identified the following substances which were administered to [AB] during his first 24 hours in hospital: morphine, 10 milligrams. Metocloprimide, 10 milligrams. Midazolam, which was a short acting Benzodiazepine. Professor Starmer said that [AB] was operated on as soon as he arrived at hospital and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit at approximately 3am on 24 November 2000. From his reading of the notes, it was Professor Starmer’s understanding that [AB] was being treated with morphine throughout 24 November 2000, but he was not able to say how many 10 mg doses he would have received during that time. He regarded 10 mgs of morphine as being “a reasonably hefty dose”.
	
	
	Professor Starmer described the effects of Morphine as follows:
	


“A.   … Morphine is a drug which is used to enable the patient to cope with pain, and it's not a drug that you use would use for trivial pains. In fact it works in quite a different way. There are two main sorts of analgesic, that is the thing that deals with pain, the first sort is called a nonnarcotic analgesic, and that would include drugs like Aspirin and Paracetamol, and these drugs act at the site of initiation of a pain impulse, usually by some method like anti inflammatory action, or antipyretic action, and these drugs are relatively simple, and act peripherally.

Morphine, like analgesics, have an effect on the patient's appreciation of pain. In other words, to put it somewhat - well, in not a scientific way, would be the pain effect of morphine is to reduce the appreciation of pain, rather like it was not happening to you yourself but somebody at the far end of the room, who you didn't really care about. And under those circumstances the patient will usually fall asleep, or at least get very drowsy.” (T.102.13)


	
	When asked about the medication [AB] would have been taking at 12pm on 24 November, Professor Starmer said:
	


“A. Well he appears to have been put under patient control analgesia, which is probably also using morphine. When patients are put on this particular apparatus, the apparatus consists of a pump driven syringe, and a line is taken from the syringe into a vein in the patient, and the patient is given a thing, a bit like one of those controls that you use on the television, and if you feel as though you need pain relief you can press the button which you are given to hold in your hand, and that will deliver a small amount of morphine into the patient. There is of course an electronic override which prevents the patient going crazy and, pump pump pump pump pump to get more morphine in. It's also useful for coping with other situations like a patient's in pain in a hospital bed, you can see the physiotherapist advancing down the ward, and a shot of morphine might be considered to be helpful.” (T.103.7)


	
	Because [AB] was also receiving Panadeine Forte, Professor Starmer was asked to explain the effect of that preparation on him.
	


“Q. And was that something that he was prescribed to take 4 to 6 hours?

A. That would be an appropriate dose for this preparation. Panadeine Forte is a mixture of, well it is a compound tablet which contains codeine. Now this one, the Forte, is a strong one so it is 30 mg of codeine, codeine being a close relative of morphine which is in fact converted to morphine in the body, at least about ten per cent of it is.

Also in the Panadeine Forte formulation is paracetamol which is an analgesic of the other type that I spoke about right at the beginning of this afternoon. There is some evidence that a mixture of codeine and paracetamol is more effective than you would expect for the individual pain relief given by the two drugs. But it is a drug mixture or drug formulation that patients become easily dependent on and that is why Panadeine Forte is on schedule 4 of the Poisons Act and can only be obtained on prescription.” (T.107.29)


	
	Professor Starmer said that one of the effects of morphine was to cause drowsiness. It could also cause changes in mood and could cause what is referred to as “mental clouding”. Professor Starmer pointed out that once [AB] was started on Panadeine Forte, the administration of morphine would probably have ceased. Professor Starmer thought that if mental clouding was occurring in relation to [AB], it would be due to morphine. Professor Starmer also explained that hallucinations as a result of morphine were reasonably common.
	
	
	In relation to those issues, the following answers were given by Professor Starmer:
	


“Q. Is there any indication in the medical information that you received, that suggested that at any point he was, that is [AB], was suffering from any type of hallucination?

A. No.

Q. Is there anything in the medical reports that you saw which suggested that he was suffering from any mental clouding?

A. No but it would be very difficult to be sure.

Q. If a person was alert and reactive whilst on this medication of morphine, would that tend to suggest that he was not suffering from some type of mental clouding?

A. Yes.

Q. Is it the situation, sir, in terms of the position that you are in, you can't rule out some type of mental clouding in relation to this patient, [AB]?

A. No, I mean, I ended up with the thought that it was possible, but as indeed it is with anyone who takes morphine under the circumstances to experience that, I hate the expression but I can't think of a better one, the ""mental clouding"", but it is possible, but I can't say with any surety it did occur.” (T.111.3)


	
	Under cross-examination, it was suggested to Professor Starmer that the administration of certain general anaesthetics could cause a temporary loss of memory. He said:
	


“Q. I am not suggesting it is abnormal, but it is just the nature of the anaesthesia he underwent would also indicate something about the period of recovery or the effects it might have on memory?

A. Yes.

Q. Because anaesthesia can effect not only consciousness, but recollection?

A. Yes.

Q. It can create a situation where people imagine things?

A. It is worse than that. Having lost their memory, they often incorporate information that they have acquired from others, not with any real attempt, but because there is a genuine hole in their recollection.” (T.114.11)


	
	The following proposition was put to Professor Starmer in cross-examination:
	


“Q. The whole area of the effect of morphine and so on on cognitive functions, you're familiar with an article, ""The effects of immediate and long term use of opioids on cognition in patients with chronic pain"" by a number of worthy authors, some of whom have even referred to your writing?

A. Yes.

Q. Their conclusions are this, and I'll ask you whether you agree with it:

“There is a great need for more data to answer the critical questions of which cognitive functions are affected. So to what degree, with which opioids, at what dose level, after what duration of use and for which patients? The bulk of research has generally revealed a greater potential impairment in cognitive function with the use of opioids during the first few several days of use.”

A. Yes.

Q. You agree with that?

A. That applies to methadone and all sorts of other things.” (T.123.21)


	
	In re-examination the following proposition was put to Professor Starmer by the Crown:
	


“Q. You were asked a number of questions about the effect upon an individual who had taken this medication of morphine in circumstances where answers were being suggested to an individual; do you recall being asked those questions?

A. Yes.

Q. Sir, if it's the situation that an individual such as [AB] is asked open ended questions which he then answers, does that give you some indication of his ability to answer questions?

A. It could do.

Q. And would it be of some importance that questions asked of him be open ended, that is, not suggest answers?

A. It would be cleaner.

Q. When you say ""cleaner"", can you explain that?

A. Well, I suppose what I was thinking about was capable of a single interpretation.” (T.126.37 – 127.3)

Further evidence concerning the crime scene


	
	In addition to the evidence of what [AB] was reported to have said when first spoken to by the police after the shooting, there was other evidence concerning the crime scene. All of the police who attended gave evidence that Al Zahab, El Husseini and [AB] were behaving aggressively towards the police at the scene. There was evidence that between 10 and 20 males of Middle Eastern appearance had come from nearby residences and were standing about the crime scene. There was also a small number of onlookers observed near the parked vehicles. Neither Al Zahab nor El Husseini when interviewed could provide any information about the identity of the shooter or the other persons in his car. Despite the directions of the police, onlookers were ducking under the crime scene tape and walking about the area. Police witnesses agreed that it was very difficult to control the crime scene.
	
	
	Senior Sergeant Palywoda, in company with Constable Broadhurst and Detective Lowry, saw a baseball cap on the roadway. Sergeant Palywoda agreed in cross-examination that her statement contained no reference to the baseball cap. She explained that at the time she made her statement, the baseball cap was not thought to be relevant.
	
	
	Constable Broadhurst also saw the baseball cap in the middle of the road in front of number 6 Kathleen Street. He also found one Winchester .38 auto round in the middle of Kathleen Street, in front of house number 8. These items were referred to in his notebook entry for the night.
	
	
	The jury conducted a view of the crime scene on the evening of 19 June 2012. They viewed the relevant roads, i.e. Melrose Avenue, Kathleen Street and The Boulevarde, when it was dark. They observed the suspected location of the shooting outside houses 6 and 8 in Kathleen Street. The jury saw the intersection of The Boulevarde and Ernest Street and the location where the two vehicles stopped in The Boulevarde. Reference was made to a sketch plan drawn by one of the detectives at the scene.
	
	
	Detective Sergeant Horn gave evidence concerning gunshot residue. He agreed in cross-examination that the decision to look for gunshot residue could be critical because there were time limits for such testing. Such residue was generally propelled 1 – 1.5 metres from a pistol, although a longer barrelled firearm would propel it further. He agreed that although various items were tested for such residue, the baseball cap was not. He agreed that had the baseball cap been worn by the shooter, one would have expected “some” residue on it. Detective Sergeant Horn was surprised that the cap had not been tested for gunshot residue.
	
	
	Constable Edgar was another police officer who attended the crime scene. She observed the words “Omar 6A” written on the peak of the baseball cap. Presumptive tests were conducted on several stained areas on the cap, but no result was obtained. It was common ground that the applicant’s younger brother, Omar Dib, was born in 1988 and was in class 6A at the Greenacre Public School in 2000.
	
	
	The baseball cap was tested for DNA. DNA samples were taken from both the applicant and his brother, Mohammed Dib. Michelle Franco, the forensic biologist who carried out the testing, concluded that one of the areas on the cap contained a complex mixture from at least three individual contributors preventing the determination of the individual profile. The effect of that and other testing was that while the applicant’s brother, Mohammed Dib, could be excluded as a wearer of the cap, the applicant could not.
	
	
	Detective Constable Cini was a forensic ballistician who examined the lead projectiles recovered from [AB]’s car. He was able to establish that the unfired cartridge recovered from the roadway came from a different cartridge case to the bullets taken from the car and from the deceased and that it could not be fired from the same weapon. In relation to gunshot residue, he said that it would depend on the ammunition in each case whether the propellant or primer particles would “carry a distance of up to one and a half metres”.
	
	
	Detective Sergeant Grima was also a forensic ballistician. He examined the bullets found in [AB]’s car. He was satisfied that a total of four shots had been fired into the car. Of the bullets recovered, he was able to say that two had been discharged from the same weapon but was not able to express an opinion in relation to the other two bullets. He thought that the shots would have had to have been fired from some distance in front of the windscreen and downward in quite an angle, i.e. 20 degrees or more and that the shooter would have been firing downwards, or from a vehicle higher than that of [AB]. In the alternative, he thought that the hand and arm of the shooter could account for the angle of the shot. He also agreed that the unfired .38 cartridge retrieved from the roadway was of a totally different calibre to the bullets taken from the car and could not be fired from the same weapon. He would expect to find gunshot residue on the peak of the cap, depending on the proximity of the cap to the weapon.
	
	
	Mr Molina made a statement to the police on 24 November 2000. He was then aged 47. At about 10.15pm on 23 November 2000 he was in Kathleen Street having come home from work. When he got out of his car, he heard engines revving and saw two cars drive past him in Kathleen Street very quickly. They were heading towards The Boulevarde. Mr Molina was standing at the front of his house at the time. He described one car as being white or light in colour and the other as either red/brown or darkish in colour. He described the white car as being just slightly ahead of the other car, but that they were almost abreast of each other. After a few seconds, he thought he heard noises that sounded like gunshots.
	
	
	He observed that the white car was on the correct side of the road and the darker car was on the wrong side of the road. Otherwise he did not take any particular notice of the vehicles as they went past because it was dark. He described the conditions in Kathleen Street at the time as follows:
	


“A. It was night time, 10 o'clock and that street during that time it is a tree lined street, there were big trees exactly on the side of the road so even though there are street lights they not, they don't illuminate the street very well.” (T.608.- 39)


	
	In cross-examination Mr Molina agreed that it was very dark and that there was “absolutely no way you could tell how many people were in that car”. From his side of the street, the red car was closer to him than the white car. He thought that there were five shots in total and that it took barely a second for the shots to be fired.
	


MB


	
	Police had been unable to locate [AB]’s brother, MB. During his evidence, AB offered to contact his brother and get him to court which duly occurred. MB denied that he had ever been left alone with his brother in the hospital. He said that when he was taken to the St George Hospital by Detectives Karras and Apolony to see his brother, he asked [AB] what had happened. [AB] first gestured by raising his hands to each side of his head and pulling them down. He said that later [AB] wrote on a piece of paper “balaclava”.
	
	
	MB was cross-examined by the Crown, pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995. He agreed that [AB] had written down the three names Basher, Dib and “Fairy” on a piece of paper. He said that the word “balaclava” was “maybe on another piece of paper, I don’t know … the first thing he said was – made an action like this (indicated) balaclava and then he wrote the three names after I asked him who did this”. (T.880.36) He agreed that he had given evidence on two previous occasions when he made no mention of balaclavas but denied that his evidence on this occasion was false.
	
	
	Included in the exhibits was a photo of a revolver being fired, showing the flash thereby created (Ex 1). While the purpose of that exhibit was to demonstrate the blow-back of gunshot residue, it was also effective to demonstrate the flash effect associated with the discharge of any firearm, including a pistol.
	


The appeal


	
	I propose to deal first with Ground 8. A consideration of this ground requires a close analysis of the evidence. Once that analysis has been carried out, it can, if necessary, be used and relied upon when considering the other grounds which are more narrowly focused. Moreover, if the applicant is successful on this ground, he is entitled to an acquittal whereas success on any of the other grounds would, at best, entitle him to a re-trial. It follows that this Court will have to consider this ground in any event. When considering this ground, I have accepted that all the evidence before the jury was properly admitted.
	


Ground 8 - The verdicts of guilty are unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence.

The law


	
	Subs 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides, inter alia, that:
	


“6(1)    The court on any appeal under section 5(1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence ...”


	
	The correct approach to determining a ground of appeal which asserts that verdicts are unreasonable or cannot be supported was considered by the High Court in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400. The plurality (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ) summarised the relevant principles as follows:
	


“The task of the Court of Criminal Appeal

11    It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:

""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty"".

12   This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"" in M is to be taken as ""equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'.""

13    The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:

""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""

14   In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"". In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:

""In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'.""”


	
	There are other caveats. As McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ observed in MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at [59] the determination by an appellate court of the reasonableness of a jury’s verdict “involves a function to be performed within a legal system that accords special respect and legitimacy to jury verdicts deciding contested factual questions concerning the guilt of the accused in serious criminal trials”. Tortuous reasoning in order to explain every individual circumstance as being consistent with innocence should not be engaged in (R v Micallef [2002] NSWCCA 480; 136 A Crim A 127 and Burrell v R [2009] NSWCCA 193 at [55]). Finally, the burden of persuasion that appellate interference is required rests with the party who impugns the verdict (MacKenzie v The Queen [1996] HCA 35; 190 CLR 348 at [370]).
	
	
	The key issue in this trial was the identification of the shooter. There was no issue that all of the other ingredients for the offences with which the applicant was charged, had been made out. Because of the importance of identification, I am troubled by the part played by the DNA evidence. As his Honour made clear in his summing up, and as was conceded by the Crown, the DNA evidence from the baseball cap could not be used by the jury as part of the identification process of the applicant. The trial was run on the basis that the jury had to be otherwise satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the identification of the applicant as the shooter before they could use the DNA evidence. In other words, while the DNA evidence was relevant to issues in the trial, in the sense that it and the finding of the baseball cap formed part of the background and context, the DNA evidence was irrelevant to the identification issue.
	
	
	What troubles me is that a considerable amount of time in the trial generally and in the summing up was spent on the DNA issue when it was peripheral insofar as the fundamental question of identification was concerned. Although that point was made in the summing up, there was a real risk that the DNA evidence would have been misused by some members of the jury as strengthening the Crown’s case on identification.
	
	
	Although that is a different issue to that which is raised in this Ground of Appeal, it does feed into it to some extent. It needs to be understood that when considering the Crown case on identification of the applicant as the shooter, no weight can be given to the DNA evidence. It is irrelevant to that issue.
	


The applicant’s submissions


	
	The applicant submitted that the Crown case against him on identification comprised two strands:
	



	
	[AB]’s identification of him in the hospital.
	
	
	Evidence that he had a motive to kill [AB].
	



	
	He submitted that the most important strand of the Crown case required the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that [AB] had truthfully and reliably identified him as the shooter. He submitted that the evidence of motive was of marginal relevance. He submitted that even if one accepted that the evidence of John Lee was credible and reliable (which he did not) it went no further than establishing that he [the applicant] was one of a number of people in [AB]’s milieu who had a possible motive to harm [AB].
	
	
	The applicant developed his submissions as follows. [AB] gave persistent and unwavering evidence in the face of protracted cross-examination by the Crown that he was unable to identify the shooter. [AB] gave evidence that the assailants were wearing balaclavas. This was consistent with the nature of the crime which involved other acts of concealment, e.g. the use of a stolen car and the incineration of the car immediately after the shooting. That evidence was corroborated by the evidence of what [AB] said in the immediate aftermath of the shooting when he said that he was unable to identify the assailant. The two other witnesses to the shooting, Al Zahab and El Husseini, gave evidence that they heard [AB] say that the shooter was wearing a balaclava.
	
	
	There was an inherent contradiction in the Crown case. On the one hand, the Crown submitted that [AB] was untruthful in what he said at the scene of the accident and subsequent to leaving hospital, yet on the other hand what he wrote while in hospital was to be accepted as true. The Crown had not demonstrated why what was written in the hospital should be accepted as identifying beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was the shooter, in preference to what [AB] said at the scene of the accident and in court. No motive was established for why [AB], Al Zahab and El Husseini should wish to exculpate the applicant. It was clear from their evidence that they had not colluded with one another in preparing their evidence.
	
	
	It was clear why [AB] may have created an unfavourable impression on the jury. It was accepted that he had lost his temper on a number of occasions under cross-examination and made unresponsive outbursts. This was understandable in circumstances where he was giving evidence more than 12 years after the incident. He had been a victim of the crime and had suffered the loss of his wife. Although he denied on oath that he could identify the assailants, the authorities did not accept that denial and he was charged with perverting the course of justice. He had been arrested overseas and held in a Syrian prison for 7 months and tortured. He was extradited to Australia and was then accused of lying about the circumstances that caused the death of his wife and from which he barely survived (T.475.34).
	
	
	It was against this background that what [AB] wrote in hospital was to be evaluated. If the Crown successfully established that [AB] was a witness completely lacking in credibility, then as a matter of logic, this impacted adversely on the weight which could be given to what he wrote in hospital.
	
	
	Even if what [AB] said at the scene of the accident and in evidence was to be disregarded, there were other matters that cast serious doubt on the reliability of the identification evidence given in hospital.
	


The opinion of Professor Starmer impacted upon the reliability of what occurred in hospital in that high doses of morphine and the effects of anaesthesia might well have clouded [AB]’s thinking and adversely affected his recollection.

There were many inconsistencies and contradictions in the series of responses provided by [AB] in hospital.

[AB]’s identification evidence was obtained in a piecemeal and haphazard manner while in hospital without there being a reliable record of the dealings between him and the detectives.

There was evidence that the detectives attended hospital to interview [AB] with preconceived ideas about the applicant’s involvement in that Detective Apolony’s notebook (Ex BF) contained entries which related to the applicant, the applicant’s brother and the Edward Lee investigation.

There were other circumstances prevailing at the time of the shooting which made reliable identification unlikely, if not impossible:


	
	Darkness: In the summing up his Honour referred to the shooting taking place on the side of Kathleen Street which was opposite the street lights. The resident, Mr Molina, pointed out that Kathleen Street was a tree-lined street with big trees so that even though there were street lights, they did not illuminate the street very much and that he was unable to identify the cars because they were moving too fast and it was dark. He was unable to observe the number of occupants in the cars because of the darkness.
	
	
	Muzzle flash from the pistol. It could be accepted (Ex 1) that the sudden muzzle flash of the pistol when the first shot was fired would have significantly interfered with [AB]’s capacity to make any useful observations thereafter.
	
	
	The immediate commencement of the shooting and the rapidity of the shots, further reduced the opportunity and capacity of [AB] to identify the shooter.
	
	
	The possibility of [AB] having been struck by one of the first shots would have further reduced his capacity to accurately observe.
	
	
	The relative movement of the cars throughout the incident and the assailants’ hasty departure would have further reduced the opportunity for observation.
	



	
	In relation to motive, there was no evidence that the applicant knew that [AB] had given a statement to the Crime Commission on 13 July 2000 about the Edward Lee killing. The evidence went no higher than that the applicant was aware that [AB] could give evidence against him in relation to that matter. There was evidence that many other persons in the criminal milieu, with which [AB] was associated, had a motive to kill him.
	
	
	There were serious problems with the evidence of John Lee. He was a convicted drug dealer, who received a substantial sentence discount (60 percent) for assisting the authorities. He was in a desperate state after his arrest and undergoing withdrawal at the time when he made a statement. He was heavily addicted and consuming drugs at the time of the events covered by his evidence so as to adversely affect its reliability. John Lee appeared to be suffering from memory problems when he gave his evidence. Despite having refreshed his recollection by reading his statement before giving evidence, he was unable to give evidence without being led in detail by the Crown through his statement.
	
	
	Under cross-examination the effect of John Lee’s evidence in chief was seriously undermined. The applicant had never admitted to John Lee that he was involved in the shooting in any way. John Lee never believed from his conversations with the applicant that the applicant was implicated in the shooting. John Lee gave evidence that the course of the conversations was triggered by the reading of a newspaper which referred to the shooting. The fact that [AB] was referred to by the applicant and others as a “dog” did not advance the motive issue very far since other named persons were also referred to as a “dog” and John Lee was not told what [AB] was said to have informed the police about. The reference by the applicant to a “hottie” (stolen car) was of only limited relevance since both his brothers were actively involved in car re-birthing activities.
	
	
	The effect of the conversations referred to by John Lee after cross-examination was that, if they occurred, they were of a far more general character than was alleged by the Crown. The effect of John Lee’s evidence was that the conversations were in the nature of loose talk amongst members of a criminal milieu. It would be inherently unsafe to draw specific incriminating inferences from this type of evidence, given its general nature and its source.
	
	
	In oral submissions in the appeal, the applicant’s case was put somewhat differently.
	


“… It wasn’t an ordinary Crown case in assessing these witnesses of whether they were telling the truth or not. It was submitted by both sides that [AB] was a liar, so this idea that this person central to the Crown case could some how be assessed was one that required some qualification, at least in terms of what you do with the assessment of that witness. If you assess [AB] to be a liar, what do you do with that? How it does flow through into the process that you have to undertake?” (AT 61.39)

“The other way to look at this – and the problem that is brought up by all of this is ordinarily when you’ve a key Crown witness and you give a direction like that and you say well, you consider from the demeanour whether he was making an honest attempt to answer the questions truthfully and what that flags, if there is a prospect that the witness wasn’t being truthful, that’s going to impact negatively on the Crown case in the context of the onus of proof. Whereas here, you have actually got this odd reverse type situation where the key witness in the Crown case – what you are really interested in about the key witness in the Crown case is whether there was a possibility that he was telling the truth. In other words, not a question of whether there is a possibility he is lying. Can you tell from the demeanour whether he is lying? There is actually a chance that he is being truthful.” (AT 64.1)

“One of the problems for the defence case is somehow the defence case became aligned with [AB]. [AB] was not by the time he gave evidence a particularly attractive character. Can I say this. Perhaps I should have prefaced my submissions with this. His Honour didn’t have an easy job in summing up this case because it was a trial in which the sort of usual type of summing up where you go through the Crown witnesses and you put the various parts together wasn’t going to be sufficient because ultimately what you are talking about is trying to sum up a case to a jury where the Crown case is entirely reliant on out of court statements made primarily by [AB], but also Mr Lee. You have got this case that has no actual in court testimony that the Crown relies on in the usual way. You have got a witness who, it’s fairly plain, either truthfully or otherwise is certainly trying to assist. It would appear he would be trying to assist the accused. The Crown says well he is untruthful insofar as when you view him giving evidence you wouldn’t accept he is a witness of truth but the hospital versions are in a sense attached in part to [AB], but they are also associated with the police witnesses and ultimately attain a degree of respectability as a consequence of their association with the police witnesses.” (AT 64.42 – 65.9)

“The defence case wasn’t entirely dependent on misconduct by the police officers but rather even if one accepted that the police officers had behaved entirely appropriately, it was necessary to stress to the jury that nonetheless there were issues having regard to the drugs to the various statements made in the unfolding of events …” (AT 68.14)

“… What was perhaps less obvious was the subtler case that even if one accepted that these officers conducted themselves entirely properly there was still real questions …” (AT 68.32)

“Except that ultimately you’re still dealing with the question of what does the Crown need to establish proof of guilt and as soon as you start asking the question what needs to be established with respect to establishing guilt, even if you object – put it another way, let’s say it wasn’t the defence case at all, you still have to say to the jury “before you can be satisfied of the Crown case even without the defence case you do have these problems with Starmer and you do have to be satisfied as to the utterances in the hospital. In that regard you can’t really properly look at the utterances in the hospital without looking at the earlier utterances and the unfolding.” (AT 69.1)


	
	The applicant submitted that insofar as what was written at the hospital was concerned, the jury was in no better position than this Court to assess it. Whereas the jury may have been in a position of advantage in relation to the evidence given by [AB] at trial, they did not have that advantage in relation to what was written in the hospital. The applicant submitted that it was likely that the defence case became somehow bound up with the credit of the main prosecution witness, [AB]. The jury may well have thought that if they disbelieved [AB] when he gave evidence about the assailants wearing balaclavas and accepted the truthfulness and reliability of the evidence from the two policemen, it followed that the identification of the applicant at the hospital must be correct. The applicant submitted that this reasoning was defective. What the jury needed to do if they rejected [AB]’s evidence at trial and accepted that of the police was to still critically analyse what happened in the hospital to see whether it was capable of establishing beyond reasonable doubt that he was the shooter. The applicant submitted that the evidence was not capable of doing so.
	
	
	The applicant pointed out that there was another difficulty in relation to the Crown case. Normally one would be able to cross examine a witness such as [AB] in order to test how he was able to identify the shooter by reference to darkness, the discharge of the pistol and the position of the cars. This testing process could not be carried out because [AB]’s position at trial was that he did not see who the shooter was.
	


Crown submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that the jury had clearly rejected [AB]’s evidence about the assailants wearing balaclavas and that they were entitled to do so because there had been no mention of a balaclava to the police at the time of the shooting, nor had there been any mention of a balaclava at the hospital. The evidence concerning the assailant’s wearing balaclavas had only emerged after [AB]’s discharge from hospital and in the case of the other two witnesses, much later.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that once that evidence was rejected, it was necessary to consider the evidence of what [AB] wrote in hospital. The Crown relied upon the fact that the very first response made by [AB] to the questions asked of him was to write “fairy”. The Crown submitted that this was a clear and unqualified identification of the applicant which the jury were entitled to accept. That identification was confirmed subsequently by the statement written in Detective Apolony’s notebook and signed by [AB]. The Crown submitted that there was ample time and opportunity available to [AB] to identify the shooter, given that the car in which the shooter was travelling had for a period of time driven behind [AB]’s car, then been level with it before the shots were fired. When one added to that the facts that [AB] knew the applicant well and would have been positioned no more than 2 metres from him when the cars were level, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that [AB] was able to identify the applicant.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that on those issues the jury was in a better position than this Court because it saw [AB] give evidence and be cross-examined for a protracted period and was able to form an opinion as to his demeanour which was an advantage not available to this Court. This was of particular importance when the jury had to assess the reliability and honesty of [AB]’s “retraction” of what he had written in the hospital. Although the effect of demeanour was subtle, it should not be underestimated.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it was open to the jury to be satisfied that the applicant had a motive to kill [AB]. It was not in dispute that the applicant knew that [AB] was in a position to give evidence against him in relation to the death of Edward Lee. It was open to the jury to accept the evidence of John Lee that the applicant believed [AB] to be a “dog” and that the applicant seemed to have a particular interest in the shooting. The Crown submitted that this evidence was sufficient to allow the jury to draw an inference as to motive adverse to the applicant.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the crucial finding, which the jury was entitled to act upon, was whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was the shooter. It did not matter who else was in the car and where they were seated. The Crown accepted that those matters may be relevant to reliability and credit but they did not directly impact on the fundamental question.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there were other indicia in what [AB] wrote in hospital which indicated that he was endeavouring to tell the truth at that time. The Crown referred specifically to the identification of the car in which the assailants were travelling as a maroon Pulsar. This evidence was verified when the car was subsequently found and linked to the incident. The Crown relied upon the diagram which showed that Monzer’s car was in front of his car, approximately 15 metres away. The Crown submitted that this diagram was likely to be correct as it was consistent with other evidence on that issue (Ex BB). The Crown also relied upon the internal consistency of what [AB] wrote at the hospital. The Crown submitted that the contradictory evidence concerning Basher was readily explainable in that [AB] wanted to exact his own retribution on that person.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that because of [AB]’s familiarity with the applicant, it would not have required much time for him to recognise him. The Crown submitted that on the assumption that the shooter was not wearing a balaclava or some other facial covering, and that the shooter was the applicant, recognition of him by [AB] would have been almost immediate. The Crown submitted that such recognition could have taken place immediately before the shots were fired. The Crown submitted that due weight had to be given to the evidence of Detective Apolony that what was written by [AB] in hospital was “maybe funny” rather than “maybe Fairy”.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that looked at as a whole, particularly the early exchanges between Officers Karras and Apolony on 24 November 2000, there is a clarity of thought in the responses of [AB] which is not consistent with the suggestion that his mind was clouded either by the residual effects of anaesthesia or by the dosage of morphine which he was receiving. The Crown relied upon the evidence of Professor Starmer to the effect that [AB]’s capacity to respond to “open” questions, i.e. non leading questions, was consistent with his mind being clear and not affected by medication.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the exchanges on 25 November between [AB] and the two police officers concerning witness protection also showed clarity of thought. This was particularly so in that [AB] was in effect making demands as a condition of providing information.
	


Consideration


	
	There is a major problem for the Crown arising from what happened and what was said when police first arrived at the scene of the shooting. As was obvious and not disputed, there was considerable initial confusion. The police were not sure what had happened and when they ascertained that [AB] had been shot, they were not sure who had done the shooting. They were clearly concerned that it may have been either or both Al Zahab and El Husseini. It was in this context that three of the attending police officers gave evidence of what they heard. The evidence is set out at [36] – [40] hereof.
	
	
	The evidence of Constable Campbell was that he said to El Husseini “Where’s the gun? Who shot him? Who has a gun?” His recollection was that it was [AB] who responded by saying “Don’t fucking say shit, there was no fucking gun, you don’t know who fucking did it”. The Crown submitted that this exchange should be interpreted as a warning by [AB] to El Husseini not to say anything to the police. I find that interpretation somewhat strained. This is particularly so in circumstances when [AB] knew that he had been shot and was seriously hurt (he was lying on the ground covering the wound in his neck at the time) and he knew at this stage that, at the very least, his wife had been seriously hurt. If Constable Campbell’s evidence was the only evidence on the subject, it would be equally open to the interpretation suggested by the defence, i.e. that what [AB] said was directed at Constable Campbell and not at El Husseini and that [AB] was angry with the police for misinterpreting the situation and that he was rather bluntly trying to explain what had happened.
	
	
	The latter interpretation is supported by the concession by Constable Campbell that the comments could have been directed to him and that the concluding sentence was “we don’t know who fucking did it”. Further support for that interpretation came from the evidence of Constable Callahan and Detective Inspector Hallinan. Both agreed that the concluding sentence was “We don’t know who fucking did it”. There was no doubt in Detective Inspector Hallinan’s mind that [AB]’s comments were directed to the police, not to El Husseini.
	
	
	It may have been that [AB]’s distrust of the police was so deep seated that even in circumstances where he believed that he had been seriously wounded and was possibly in danger of death, he would still be unwilling to co-operate with them. It is equally open to infer from what he said that in such circumstances he was being truthful, i.e. they did not have a gun and they did not know who did the shooting. In that regard, it needs to be kept in mind that [AB] had co-operated with the police in the Edward Lee killing.
	
	
	The important consideration is that [AB]’s first comment in relation to the matter was a denial of any knowledge of who the shooter was. This was at a time immediately following the incident when his recollection would have been at its best and before it had been affected by other extraneous influences.
	
	
	In referring to the evidence, I have entirely disregarded that of [AB], Al Zahab and El Husseini at trial concerning [AB] mentioning the word “balaclava”, [AB] saying the Ashad and any attendance by a Muslim cleric. They were matters which depended upon the jury’s assessment of what those witnesses said at trial. That evidence was clearly rejected by the jury and they were entitled to do so.
	
	
	The importance of the evidence of the attending police officers is that it did not depend upon the credit of [AB] and was consistent. The kicking out by [AB] towards Detective Inspector Hallinan was consistent with him being frustrated and angry at the interpretation of the attending police of what had happened being so completely wrong. It is difficult to see what other motivation there could have been. It also seems difficult to argue against the proposition that at the time [AB] must have realised he was seriously hurt.
	
	
	The jury were in no better position than is this Court to interpret what [AB] said as recorded by the attending police officers.
	
	
	An important part of the Crown case was that when asked by Detective Karras “Can you tell me who did this to you?”, without hesitation [AB] wrote in the notebook “fairy”. The Crown submission is that this response was made without qualification or prevarication and was an immediate and responsive answer to the question.
	
	
	While that submission is certainly available, it does not exclude two scenarios which are also equally available. These are that [AB] was reconstructing what he thought might have happened or that he was simply not telling the truth and deliberately named an enemy.
	
	
	In support of the first of those alternatives, i.e. that [AB] was making a genuine attempt to reconstruct events so as to identify the shooter, is that immediately following “fairy” are the words “Did you show them statements?” Given that this interview took place at approximately 1pm on 24 November 2000 and [AB] left the operating theatre at about 2.30am, he had approximately ten and a half hours within which to think about what had happened. This undermines the spontaneity of the response upon which the Crown placed such reliance. In further support of that alternative is the proximity in the notebook of what [AB] wrote in relation to the “statements”. It was accepted, of course, that the “statements” to which reference was made were the statements by [AB] to the police concerning the applicant’s responsibility for the death of Edward Lee.
	
	
	The fact that [AB] queried whether the “statements” had been shown to the applicant and did so on the same page and immediately after the entry “fairy” is strongly suggestive that he had been thinking of a motive for “fairy” being involved in the shooting before the two police officers spoke to him. While such an approach is still consistent with [AB] having actually identified “fairy” as the shooter, it is also equally consistent with him trying to work out who in fact was the shooter by reference to who might have had a motive.
	
	
	Since these words were written in a notebook, which was simply placed before the jury, and which the police officers verified as accurate, the jury were in no better position than this Court to determine the meaning and inferences to be drawn from those entries in the notebook. I can see no logical basis for how it was open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that one interpretation was correct and that the other was not.
	
	
	If anything, the third entry on that notebook page “Why did this happen?” is consistent with both interpretations since the response of Detective Karras is contrary to [AB]’s belief as to motive at that time. This is either because he actually recognised “fairy” or because this motive formed part of the process of reconstruction which led him to conclude that “fairy” was the shooter. The written response to the question about the car does not take the issue further.
	
	
	The subsequent entry on Ex AK is difficult to place in time. It was written by [AB] on the same occasion as the earlier entries and on the same notebook but as Detective Karras pointed out (T.641.18) the process of putting questions to [AB] and him writing his responses was interrupted during the whole of the time by nursing staff providing treatment. That fact and the final written response “I want to sleep” gives rise to the issues raised by the evidence of Professor Starmer, i.e. not only that [AB] had been seriously injured but that he was emerging from the effects of a general anaesthetic and had received a high dosage of morphine. Not only does that impact on what interpretation should be given to what [AB] wrote but it impacts on the reliability of the whole exchange generally. In that regard, it should be kept in mind the third scenario is that [AB] may have been simply lying with a view to implicating the applicant.
	
	
	The next exchange which took place at 2.35pm was quite different to the first. [AB] was not co-operative and his answer to at least one question was not particularly responsive. Was this the effect of medication? Had [AB] simply changed his mind? Did he change his mind because of what he was told by Detective Karras in the first interview? In any event, the content of this second exchange between [AB] and the detectives in hospital does not provide a strong basis for regarding [AB]’s responses as reliable.
	
	
	That unco-operative approach continued in the third exchange at 3.22pm. Even at that early stage, [AB] was endeavouring to negotiate with the police, albeit unsuccessfully. Again, this exchange impacts adversely on the reliability of what [AB] wrote in hospital.
	


What occurred at the fourth meeting


	
	Ex AN is controversial. The Crown relies upon the evidence of the detectives that what [AB] wrote was “Maybe funny”. Of course their evidence on that issue is of no probative value. They did not hear [AB] say anything. All that happened was that they were present when he wrote a response to a question. This Court is in as good a position as the detectives and the jury to interpret what was written. The second word is scrawled. I found it equally consistent with being interpreted as “fairy” as “funny”. As already indicated, I find the answer “Maybe funny” to be completely unresponsive to the question asked. The answer “Maybe fairy” while also not completely responsive, certainly makes more sense than that suggested by the Crown. Importantly and persuasively, it is in line with the truculent attitude displayed by [AB] in the two earlier meetings at 2.35pm and 3.22pm.
	
	
	The further response, spontaneously written by [AB] in the course of 3.38pm meeting, is difficult to understand. It is not clear what assistance [AB] was asking for, nor is it clear what assistance Monzer could give to the police. That, of course, assumes that during the course of this meeting [AB] was lucid and unaffected by medication.
	
	
	There is no doubt that at the end of that meeting, [AB] signed a statement to the effect that “fairy” shot him and his wife the previous night. His change of mind and apparent co-operation with the detectives in contrast to his approach earlier in the day is unexplained. Moreover, there remains this issue. If, as clearly happened, the jury disbelieved what [AB] said in court and accepted the Crown’s interpretation of what he said at the crime scene, on what basis were they able to find beyond reasonable doubt that his identification of “fairy” as the shooter in hospital was truthful and reliable.
	
	
	That problem is highlighted when consideration is given to the result of the discussion between [AB] and his brother, MB, which took place at 9.15pm that night. As a result of that discussion, MB produced to the two detectives the names of three persons whom he said were in the car. That, of course, contradicts what [AB] said in the first meeting about “fairy” being in front and not knowing who was in the back (and also by implication, who was the driver). It also is inconsistent with the circumstances of how the shooting occurred.
	
	
	This highlights a further problem with what was written by [AB] in the hospital. Does one accept as truthful and reliable what [AB] wrote at 1pm or what he wrote at 9.15pm on 24 November 2000 and on what basis does one choose between what appear to be two incompatible statements. This is despite the fact that there is a consistency in the identification of the applicant. My difficulty is in identifying a logical basis available to the jury for preferring one part of [AB]’s evidence and rejecting all the rest.
	
	
	There are a number of other difficulties which emerge when one looks at what [AB] wrote while in hospital. For example, the written responses to the questions asked of [AB] set out in Exs AU, AV and the early part of AW, are simply not responsive to the questions asked. In the first exchange, it is clear that [AB] was still convinced that the police had shown the statements which he had made concerning Edward Lee, to the applicant. In any event, [AB] in his responses on that day was essentially unco-operative and in Ex AX was attempting to negotiate a witness protection arrangement. The exchanges in those exhibits do not demonstrate a clarity of mind such as one would expect in somebody who was unaffected by medication. On the contrary, except towards the end of Ex AX, the answers written by [AB] to the questions asked were at best only marginally responsive. It is against that background that the second statement (Ex AZ) was written and signed.
	
	
	The subsequent exchanges between the detectives and [AB] in hospital focused essentially on whether Basher was in the car and what part, if any, was played in the shooting by Marrickville Sam. A fair reading of the exchanges shows that [AB] was prepared to provide conflicting information as to the presence of Basher in the car, depending upon his particular whim at the time.
	
	
	Taking into account the whole of the exchanges between Detectives Karras and Apolony and [AB] at the hospital, I am unable to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that what he said there is to be taken as reliable and honest as distinct from what the attending police officers recorded at the scene of the shooting when they attended. In reaching that conclusion, I accept that it was open to the jury to reject the evidence of [AB] at trial containing as it did so much additional detail which was not mentioned at the times and places one would have expected such matters to have been referred to.
	
	
	The jury clearly accepted what [AB] wrote at the hospital as reliable. As indicated, I have difficulty in identifying a logical and acceptable basis to underpin that finding. What may well have happened, as the applicant submitted, was that the jury’s acceptance of this evidence was a product of the way in which the trial was run.
	
	
	Detectives Karras and Apolony were cross-examined at length and it was submitted on behalf of the defence that their evidence was not honest and accurate and that they had suggested to [AB] that the applicant was the shooter. This challenge to their evidence was also clearly rejected by the jury. In doing so, however, the jury may well have thought that once the challenge to the detectives’ evidence was rejected, it followed that what [AB] had written in the hospital was reliable and truthful.
	
	
	As a matter of logic that conclusion does not necessarily follow. What had to be done was to assess what [AB] wrote in the hospital on its merits and to determine quite separately from the police evidence whether it was truthful and reliable. In carrying out that process, the jury were in no better position than this Court. Their advantage of having seen and heard [AB] give evidence in the trial would not have assisted them in performing that function. On the contrary, the assessment they must have made of that evidence at trial was that [AB] was untruthful or unreliable or both.
	
	
	For the reasons set out above, I have real doubts as to the reliability of what [AB] wrote in the hospital, in particular, his identification of the applicant as the shooter. Had the jury carried out the same critical analysis of that evidence they should have had the same doubt.
	
	
	The evidence as to the applicant’s motive is thin. In that regard, the submissions of the applicant at [132] – [135] have considerable force. There was no evidence that the applicant was aware of the statement made by [AB] to the police. The evidence of John Lee went no further than to establish that [AB] (like some others who were named) was thought to be a police informer and that the subject of his wounding and his wife’s murder was actively discussed by persons within the criminal milieu, including the applicant after its occurrence.
	
	
	There is another consideration which has to be taken into account. Even if one completely disregards (as the jury must have done) the defence case that the shooter and others in the car with him were wearing balaclavas, the circumstances of the shooting were such that there were otherwise inherent difficulties in [AB] being able to identify the shooter.
	
	
	[AB]’s evidence of the events leading up to the shooting was not challenged by the Crown. On the evening of 23 November 2000, having returned home from a visit to the Lakemba Mosque with his friend, Al Zahab, he and his wife decided to take their son, go for a drive and have something to eat. They were joined by his friends, Al Zahab and El Husseini, who were driving ahead of them in another car. At a point in Kathleen Street, [AB] brought his car to a halt when a car behind flashed its lights. When [AB] failed to recognise the car, he commenced driving forward again. The other car then drew level and shots were fired when it was slightly in front of [AB]’s car.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it would have been possible for [AB] to identify the persons in the other car when it was positioned behind his car and when it drew level and drove past. There is no evidence to support that submission. On the contrary, to the extent that there is evidence, it is to the opposite effect.
	
	
	The unchallenged evidence of [AB] was that having initially stopped when the lights flashed from the car behind, he commenced driving again because he did not recognise the car. Implicit in that evidence is that he did not recognise anyone in the car. That is not surprising given the time of night and the poor lighting which was prevalent in Kathleen Street at the time, as described by Mr Molina.
	
	
	The jury had the advantage of participating in a view of Kathleen Street at night. We do not know what observations they made. Some idea of what they saw can be extracted from the following part of the trial judge’s summing up:
	


“You will have to consider the light. As far as we know the light on the night was something like the light on the night that we all went to Kathleen Street.” (SU 25.9)

“[AB] had the maroon pulsar coming up on his offside on the driver's side and the shots fired. Now, there were - if that was so, and if it did happen in that place that has been suggested to you, then you know that there were no lights on the street that would have illuminated the faces of persons in the car - in the pulsar - from [AB]'s point of view. The lights were all on the other side of the street, on the eastern side of the street and the maroon pulsar was on the eastern side of [AB]’s car.” (SU 26.8)


	
	Accordingly, I do not accept that it would have been possible for [AB] to have identified anyone in the assailant’s car until it drew level with his car and even then, for the reasons given by his Honour, identification would have been very difficult.
	
	
	The only two factors favouring an ability to identify the assailant was that [AB] did know the applicant and that the distance between him and the shooter at the time the shots were fired would have been approximately two metres. All the other factors are against identification being possible in the circumstances prevailing on that night. Even such identification assumes that before the shots were fired, [AB] must have turned and looked towards the front seat passenger in the other vehicle.
	
	
	There are other matters which tend strongly against [AB]’s ability to identify the shooter. The muzzle flash (as shown in Ex 1) produced by the first shot would have had the effect of destroying [AB]’s night vision and preventing him from making any further useful observations.
	
	
	The only evidence is that the shots were fired very quickly. Consistent with that evidence, it can be inferred that an assailant driving up alongside a target vehicle and firing into it, would do so as quickly as possible. Accordingly, the time available for any identification would have been very short and would only encompass the period up until the first shot was fired.
	
	
	There is no evidence as to which of the fusillade of shots struck [AB]. From that point onwards it can be safely inferred that [AB]’s ability to make any identification must have been destroyed. The evidence of Mr Molina as to the speed of the cars, the rapidity of the shots and lighting conditions generally provides further support for the applicant’s submission that it was not open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that in the circumstances of this shooting, [AB] was capable of identifying his assailant.
	
	
	Even if that proposition were not accepted, what does seem clear is that in the circumstances prevailing on the night of 23 November 2000, it would not have been possible for [AB] to identify the persons in the car other than the shooter. That factor must place very considerable doubt on the reliability of what [AB] wrote in the hospital when on two occasions he purported to identify the other persons, apart from the shooter who were in the shooter’s car.
	


Conclusion


	
	Even though the jury was entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence in this matter, my analysis of the evidence has led me to conclude that it was not open for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was the person who shot [AB] and the deceased. The evidence has left me with a reasonable doubt on that issue and that is a doubt which the jury should also have had. It is not a doubt which could have been resolved by the position of advantage of the jury in seeing and hearing the witnesses. In relation to the crucial evidence on which the identification of the applicant turned, i.e. what [AB] wrote in the hospital and what the police who attended the scene of the shooting saw and heard, this Court is in as good a position as the jury to make an assessment.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has been made out.
	
	
	In view of the applicant’s success on this ground which entitles him to an acquittal, there is no need to decide the other issues raised on the appeal which primarily concern the admissibility of evidence. I have reached the conclusion which I have on the basis that the evidence before the jury was properly admitted. Any success which the applicant may have enjoyed in relation to the other grounds would only confirm that result. In those circumstances, the proper order is for a verdict of acquittal to be entered.
	
	
	The orders which I propose are as follows:
	



	
	Leave to appeal be granted and the appeal be allowed.
	
	
	The jury’s verdict of 9 July 2012 be quashed and in lieu thereof a verdict of acquittal be entered.
	
	
	The applicant is to be released from custody forthwith.
	



	
	ADAMS J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	McCALLUM J: I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Judge, for substantially the reasons his Honour has stated. I would respectfully not share his Honour's view that [AB] could not have identified the shooter. On my assessment of the evidence, it is possible that he had the opportunity to identify the applicant and to do so reliably. The critical problem for the Crown is the impossibility, in the circumstances, of excluding the reasonable possibility that he did not in fact identify the applicant but only nominated him as the person he believed must have been the shooter. On that issue, I would respectfully adopt the Chief Judge's careful analysis of the reasons the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the applicant's guilt.

2702086,O’Brien v Pittwater Council [2016] NSWDC 32,"Judgment

A. Introduction


	
	The plaintiff, Naomi O’Brien, owns a property below the escarpment at Whale Beach. During rainstorms, water comes over the escarpment and onto Mrs O’Brien’s property.
	
	
	Many years earlier, before the mid-1950’s, Warringah Council obtained an easement on a neighbouring block of land (15 Norma Rd) upslope of Mrs O’Brien’s property for the purpose of draining stormwater. It constructed an open drain on that block within the area of the easement. Rainwater runoff from even higher land flowed into a pit on the high side of Norma Rd adjoining the neighbouring block, and by means of a pipe under Norma Rd water flowed into and along the open drain onto the lower areas of the block, from where it flowed over the escarpment and down onto Mrs O’Brien’s property. The defendant, Pittwater Council (“Council”), admits that it is the statutory owner of the drainage system and succeeds to any liability of the former Warringah Council.
	
	
	Mrs O’Brien says that by the Norma Rd pit and pipe and the open drain (together “Council drain”) Council has increased the volume and concentration of water flowing onto her block and sues Council in nuisance. She seeks an order to block the pipe to prevent the water from the high side of Norma Rd being channelled, ultimately, onto her land. In the alternative, she seeks damages for the nuisance.
	


B. The issues


	
	The volume of water which runs onto Mrs O’Brien’s land during rain is affected by the intensity of the rainfall and the catchment area of the pit and of Mrs O’Brien’s land. Mrs O’Brien alleges that Council enlarged the catchment area of her land, thus increasing the volume of water flowing onto her property.
	
	
	Council disputes the enlarged catchment area and also alleges that the presence of a natural watercourse creates an entitlement to discharge water onto Mrs O’Brien’s property.
	
	
	The level of intensity of a storm affects how much of the rainfall in the catchment area flows onto Mrs O’Brien’s land. One reason for this is that the Norma Rd pit has a limited opening through which water can flow into it, and then through the pipe into the open drain. Any water flow approaching the pit that is greater than the maximum volume allowed by the opening to the pit flows principally down the gutter on the high side of Norma Rd and away from Mrs O’Brien’s land. Sometimes the opening to the pit is blocked by leaves and other debris, thus further lessening the volume of water entering the pit and the pipe. The impact of the limited opening to the pit must be considered as it affects the level of upslope water flowing onto Mrs O’Brien’s land.
	
	
	Mrs O’Brien also claims that the increased concentration of water constitutes a nuisance, on the basis that the open drain concentrates water flowing onto her land at a particular location at the north-east corner of her lot. The extent and impact of the concentration of water is disputed by Council.
	
	
	Council and Mrs O’Brien also disagree as to whether the damage suffered by Mrs O’Brien justifies an order for an injunction, and the amount of damages that should be awarded if damages are a sufficient or more appropriate remedy. Council also asserts that it has statutory authority to channel the water down the open drain onto Mrs O’Brien’s property, and relies on statutory defences in s 733 of the Local Government Act 1993, s 582A of the Local Government Act 1919 (“1919 Act”) and s 43A of the Civil Liability Act 2002.
	
	
	Accordingly, the issues in these proceedings can be categorised under the following headings:
	



	
	The catchment areas.
	
	
	The opening to the pit.
	
	
	Nuisance and the existence of a natural watercourse.
	
	
	The concentration of water.
	
	
	The statutory defences.
	
	
	Injunction.
	
	
	Damages.
	


(1) The catchment areas


	
	Mrs O’Brien and Council each retained experts who prepared reports and plans indicating the catchment of Mrs O’Brien’s land at various times. In each case they have assessed the catchment area of the rear boundary of Mrs O’Brien’s property, and any water flowing onto the land from either side boundary has been ignored. Whether or not this approach is strictly correct, no party took issue with it and I propose to adopt it.
	


(a) The existing catchment


	
	The experts agreed that the existing catchment area included 15 Norma Rd, as well as part of the two blocks immediately to the southwest of 15 Norma Rd (presumably 11 and 13 Norma Rd), and that the western boundary of the catchment area ran along the middle of Bynya Rd and Norma Rd. The north-eastern boundary of the existing catchment was likewise not the subject of significant disagreement.
	
	
	The real areas of dispute concerned the northwest boundary of the existing catchment, near the corner of Bynya Rd and Cynthea Rd, and the easterly boundary including the extent to which lots 17 and 19 Norma Rd, and Norma Rd itself, formed part of the catchment.
	
	
	During the course of a site visit at the trial, the expert retained by Mrs O’Brien, Dr Daniel Martens, accepted that there was a collection of rocks extending to the northeast of Mrs O’Brien’s northern boundary which resulted in a significant part of numbers 17 and 19 Norma Rd falling within the catchment area. I also noted during that site visit that the westerly part of the rear of number 17 sloped toward the channel on number 15, and this ensured that water falling on that part of the land would reach the open drain and thus be within the catchment of Mrs O’Brien’s land. I understood Dr Martens, by his subsequent drawings, to concede that the existing catchment included this area.
	
	
	Mr Andrew Bewsher, the expert retained by Council, conceded that his assessment of the extent to which the catchment extended down Norma Rd was exaggerated.
	
	
	In the result, there was ultimately little difference between the experts on the eastern extent of the existing catchment area. In my view, the dark blue line (Mr Bewsher’s catchment) on the contour plan known as Figure 1 of Dr Martens’ Second Statement of Evidence (Exhibit A, Tab 10) most accurately shows the existing catchment, save that the boundary shown on Norma Rd concluded before the driveway to number 19 Norma Rd, and extended no further down Norma Rd than the point where the dark blue line crossed the Norma Rd boundary of 17 Norma Rd.
	
	
	The difference between the experts regarding the upper or north-western boundary of the existing catchment was more difficult to resolve. However, Mr Bewsher’s larger area there added approximately the same amount to the catchment he determined as was added by Dr Martens in including additional parts of numbers 8 and 11 Norma Rd and the Norma Rd roadway, and thus, the total existing catchment areas determined by Mr Bewsher and Dr Martens did not differ significantly.
	
	
	Accordingly, in my view, the square metre area of the existing catchment is that determined by Mr Bewsher, less a small amount of about 20m2 from the Norma Rd roadway. I thus accept the area of 1.47ha determined by Mr Bewsher (Exhibit 1, Mr Bewsher’s report dated 29 February 2012 at [3.27]) to be the existing catchment. Dr Martens, at least initially, also assessed the existing catchment area to be 1.47ha (Exhibit C, Statement of Evidence of Dr Martens dated 19 November 2014 at [12.d]).
	
	
	Mr Ralph Williams, another expert retained by Mrs O’Brien, estimated the existing catchment area to be 1.21ha (Exhibit C, Mr Williams’ report dated 28 July 2011 at p2). The reasoning behind this conclusion is not clearly disclosed, and the annexures, Annexures C and D, he relied on do not appear to allow an accurate calculation. For that reason, I prefer the evidence of Mr Bewsher and Dr Martens on this issue. A lesser existing catchment area, it should be noted, would lessen the amount of water in a rainstorm that would currently impact Mrs O’Brien’s land and thus would diminish any nuisance.
	
	
	Accordingly, I conclude that the current catchment area is 1.47ha.
	


(b) The natural catchment


	
	The differences between the parties as to the area of the natural catchment are more significant. Mr Williams assessed the “pre-development catchment area” to be “0.6 hectares” (Exhibit C, Mr Williams’ report dated 28 July 2011 at p2). This opinion appears to be based on a hand drawn area by Mr Williams (see Exhibit C, Mr Williams’ report dated 12 May 2008 at p4) which was based on a site inspection, although the method of calculation is not apparent.
	
	
	Mr Bewsher calculated the natural conditions as producing a catchment area of 1.38ha (see Exhibit 1, Mr Bewsher’s report dated 29 February 2012 at p13), which was based on analysis of a contour map and a site inspection.
	
	
	Dr Martens used a flow path analysis derived from the contour map to calculate a catchment area of 0.43ha for natural conditions.
	


(i) The reliability of a contour map


	
	As a tool to determine the catchment area, the contour maps used by the experts have limitations. These limitations were not disputed by the experts.
	
	
	Firstly, the contours are drawn at 500mm intervals. Plainly, the direction water flows can be affected by differences in levels much smaller than half a metre. As a result, the direction water flows between the contours is not revealed by the contour maps.
	
	
	Secondly, the contour maps have other inaccuracies. Rocky outcrops at the rear of 17 Norma Rd were not reflected on the contour maps, a matter Dr Martens conceded to be an inaccuracy. Nor is the open channel along the northeast side of 15 Norma Rd indicated by the contour plan. The contours appear to ignore houses and other man-made structures, which means they must only show approximate land levels where buildings and walls are located. Whether they reflect more modern landscaping is unclear. The slope of the land towards the channel on both its sides, both on 15 and 17 Norma Rd, is not reflected on the contour plan.
	
	
	Thirdly, the contour maps result from drawing lines between points determined to be at the same level. There is necessarily a degree of interpolation between points, and the accuracy of the contour between those two points must be uncertain.
	
	
	Fourthly, water flow can be impacted by vegetation and other objects on or connected to the ground, which are not indicated by the contour map. If water flow is affected, so also must be the catchment area.
	
	
	Fifthly, the orthodox method of determining a catchment area from contours involves assuming water flows from a point on a contour line in a perpendicular direction to that line, and then flows perpendicular to the next contour. This assumption may work tolerably well, even perfectly, with a smooth surface with no obstacles and where the slope is constant between contours, and where the contours are accurate, but it is, at best, an unreliable approximation on a natural, rugged and uneven surface covered with rocks, ridges and vegetation. This is the nature of the land above Mrs O’Brien’s property.
	
	
	Sixthly, the catchment area itself may be affected by the level of the rainfall event. Fast running water may be unaffected by a small ridge. But a small ridge may, in lesser rainfall events, operate to redirect a smaller or slower flow of water.
	
	
	Seventhly, contour maps created in recent years are less accurate in assessing a catchment area that existed decades ago. Excavation and the building of houses, driveways, gardens, walls, and roadways all impact on the catchment area, now and then. The contours appear to reflect, at least to some extent, a driveway on (presumably) number 10 Norma Rd opposite number 17, and also reflect Norma Rd itself. But as indicated above, it is unclear what if any other changes to the landscape are recorded by the contour plans. The result is that determining a catchment area in the 1950s or earlier from contour maps of the last decade must be inaccurate, even if some adjustment can be made for the location of roads.
	
	
	At various stages of their evidence, each of the three experts conceded limitations or inaccuracies in the contour maps. In the joint report (Exhibit D, Joint Report of Hydrology Experts dated 5 July 2013, para 6), Mr Williams stated that the use of a contour survey to ascertain actual flow patterns was “not very accurate on steep and rocky terrain as these features can completely change flow paths.”
	
	
	For all these reasons, I conclude that the catchment area in the 1950s for Mrs O’Brien’s land cannot accurately be determined from present day contour maps alone.
	


(ii) Other observations about the natural catchment area


	
	Dr Martens’ approach was to calculate the catchment area by the orthodox method where the water flow is assumed to be perpendicular to the contour. But this method was abandoned in several instances when determining the current catchment area, as his boundary of the existing catchment is on several occasions drawn parallel to, or close to parallel to, the contour (see green boundary in Figure 1, Tab 10, Exhibit A). This involves recognition of the limitations of the “perpendicular to the contour” rule when applying it to real terrain, especially rough terrain, or terrain with natural obstacles such as rocks and vegetation.
	
	
	Secondly, Dr Martens accepted (Exhibit C, Dr Martens’ Statement dated 19 November 2014, Figure 1) that the natural catchment included an area at the southern corner of 19 Norma Rd, which was subsequently, without explanation, not included by him in a more recent diagram (Exhibit A, Tab 10, Figures 1 and 2) for either the current or natural catchment. But at an onsite view and in oral evidence, Dr Martens accepted that an arrangement of rocks, extending about 6.5m along the lower border of 19 Norma Rd, currently directed water onto Mrs O’Brien’s land, and, if it was natural, the natural flow of water would include some of the western part of 17 and 19 Norma Rd. This was Mr Bewsher’s opinion of the natural catchment. There was a dispute about whether the arrangement of rocks was natural or artificial, but there was no suggestion that Council was responsible for it.
	
	
	Thirdly, there was nothing in the observable levels of the rear yards of 15 and 17 Norma Rd which indicated that the rainfall at the rear of 15, and on the western side of the rear of 17 Norma Rd, would flow to a location other than beside, and immediately to the west of, the house at 19. This is the location where the Council drain currently directs water.
	
	
	Fourthly, both Mr Bewsher and Dr Martens include the whole of the front boundary of 11 Norma Rd as within the current catchment (Exhibit A, Tab 10, Figure 1). Why half of that boundary is excluded by Dr Martens from the natural catchment (see Exhibit A, Tab 10, Figure 2 and Exhibit C, Dr Marten’s Statement dated 19 November 2014, Figure 1) was not explained, other than that it was a product of the orthodox, perpendicular to the contour method of determining the direction of water flow.
	
	
	For these reasons, including my concerns about the reliability of the contour maps in determining catchment areas, I am not satisfied that the natural catchment area determined by Dr Martens directly from the current contour maps is accurate.
	
	
	Mr Bewsher also reviewed the contour maps. He also engaged in a process which he called “ground-truthing”. This process involved a site assessment to check on conclusions indicated by the contours. While I think that some anomalies unrevealed by the contour plans may be detected from a careful site inspection, I do not think that visual observations of themselves would be a reliable guide to the extent of the natural catchment area, at least when rugged terrain is involved. Even after a view of the catchment area as part of the trial, differences remained in the natural catchment area drawn by Mr Williams and that drawn by Mr Bewsher, indicating that errors are not always corrected by a site inspection.
	
	
	Although not strictly analogous, the problems may be illustrated by a professional golfer assessing the fall of a golf green. The golfer has the advantage of years of experience, a limited area of the green, and a smooth surface without obstacles. Yet minor gradients, and their impact on the path of a golf ball, are commonly undetected or misinterpreted. In my view, error is far more likely when visually assessing the impact of a significant area of uneven ground covered with vegetation and rocks on the flow of water.
	
	
	Mr Bewsher called in aid site features – ridges, valleys, outcrops and the like – as support for his conclusion that a much larger natural catchment area existed. However, I was not persuaded that larger rock features observable from a distance fairly indicated the direction of water flow on the ground.
	
	
	In the result, I was not persuaded that the natural catchment area below Norma Rd (“the lower catchment”) substantially differed from the current lower catchment. At least, there did not seem to me to have been anything done by Council which increased the area of the existing lower catchment. In my view, doing the best I can, the natural lower catchment most closely resembles the area shown by Mr Bewsher, an area equivalent to the current lower catchment.
	
	
	The relief sought by Mrs O’Brien, to block water flow from the area above Norma Rd (“the upper catchment”) by means of the Council drain, indicates that her primary concern was with the upper catchment area.
	
	
	The area of the upper catchment is more problematic. Dr Martens did not, above Norma Rd, extrapolate the lower catchment area determined by Mr Bewsher. Rather, Dr Martens has indicated, by points D and F on Figure 2 (Exhibit A, Tab 10), that some points within Mr Bewsher’s catchment may drain to locations other than Mrs O’Brien’s land. And Mr Bewsher’s conclusions, particularly regarding the north-eastern area of the catchment, seem to have only his observations to support them. His north-eastern boundary differs markedly from his assessment of the existing catchment and I am not persuaded that such a difference is justified, notwithstanding the impact of the driveway on 10 Norma Rd opposite number 17.
	
	
	Mr Williams concluded that the pre-development or natural catchment area was 0.6ha (Exhibit C, Mr Williams’ report dated 28 July 2011 at p2). In Dr Martens opinion the area was 0.43ha (Exhibit C, Dr Martens’ Statement dated 19 November 2014 at [12.a]), and in Mr Bewsher’s, 1.38ha. I have concluded that the natural lower catchment is equivalent to the existing lower catchment for the reasons given. But Mr Bewsher’s north-eastern area of the upper natural catchment is enlarged compared to the existing catchment and must be discounted. He gave evidence (transcript, 3 June 2015, 125.40) that he was “essentially assuming that the topography…under natural conditions, is the same - would have been the same as what's out there today.” This is not reflected in the enlarged north-eastern area. Conversely, Dr Martens excludes a significant amount of the north-eastern area of the existing catchment in his determination of the natural catchment. In my view, neither change is justified on the evidence.
	
	
	The current catchment area exceeds the natural catchment area, in my view, principally because of the impact of Bynya Rd and Norma Rd. Those roads operate to direct stormwater from lots fronting these two roads, and lots near the intersection of Bynya Rd and Norma Rd, along the northern side of Norma Rd to the inlet to the pit at the commencement of the pipe. This area appears to add about 0.4ha to the catchment area and is shown as the south-western area of the current catchment on the drawing of each of Mr Williams, Mr Bewsher and Dr Martens, and includes the north-eastern corner of the Bynya Rd and Norma Rd intersection. Bynya Rd has also changed the location of the catchment area at the upper northern end, but the difference in area produced by that change does not appear, on Dr Martens’ or Dr Bewsher’s drawings (Exhibit A, Tab 10), to produce a significant change in area to the existing catchment.
	
	
	It is impossible to be precise about the area of the natural catchment. Principally because of the impact of Bynya Rd and Norma Rd adding an additional approximately 0.4ha to the catchment area, I conclude that there is, and propose to adopt, an area of 1ha as the natural catchment area. This is close to halfway (0.99ha) between the areas of the natural catchment assessed by Mr Williams on the one hand and Mr Bewsher on the other.
	
	
	As I have assessed the current catchment to be 1.47ha and the natural catchment to be about 1ha, the current catchment area exceeds the natural catchment area by 0.47ha. This almost 50% increase in the catchment area is, as indicated, largely due to the extension of the existing catchment to the Bynya Rd, Norma Rd intersection.
	


(iii) Natural catchment, or catchment after the road was constructed but before the pipe was installed?


	
	Mrs O’Brien submitted that the proper comparison with the existing catchment area ought not to be with the natural conditions but with the conditions immediately before the installation of the Council drain. She submitted that I should conclude that, at that time, there was no upper catchment because the rainfall above Norma Rd would be diverted to travel along the northern side of Norma Rd and would not flow to the southwest according to the natural fall of the land. This submission was based on the alleged circumstance that the road was installed before the Council drain (including the pit and the pipe), and that the camber of Norma Rd ensued that water would not travel across it.
	
	
	The evidence of the timing of the construction of the road, the pit and the pipe is thin. Mr Williams gave evidence that the owner of 15 Norma Rd told him that the open drain was constructed in 1958. I have no means of assessing the reliability of that evidence. Although I do not doubt Mr Williams was told this, whether the owner of 15 Norma Rd had personal knowledge by his or her own observation, was told by an earlier owner, or was informed by some other means, was not the subject of evidence. The owner of 15 Norma Rd did not give evidence and no notice in compliance with s 67 of the Evidence Act 2005 was in evidence before me. Nor was any application made under s 67(4) of that Act.
	
	
	Mr Williams also gave direct evidence, from his experience, not objected to, that the drainage system appeared to be constructed in the 1940s or 1950s, and that “the type of construction is indicative of that period and earlier periods”. This period also covers the period that the road was constructed. Photographic evidence indicates that roads were in place in 1951, as were some houses, although whether those roads operated to divert water away from Mrs O’Brien’s property is not clear. There was no indication that the pipe was installed after the road was constructed, and in the absence of direct evidence, I would conclude that it was installed as part of the road construction.
	
	
	The easement for the open drain was obtained by Council sometime after December 1940. The drain (in its present form) may have been constructed after the road was constructed, although Mr Williams’ opinion evidence indicates that it was at about that time. There is no evidence to indicate that water from the pipe would have flowed along a different path from the one which the open drain now takes.
	
	
	In Gartner v Kidman (1962) 108 CLR 12 at 48, Windeyer J of the High Court stated: “What is a natural use is a question to be determined reasonably having regard to all the circumstances, including the purposes for which the land is being used and the manner in which the flow of water was increased”.
	
	
	In these circumstances, I accept Council’s submission that these works were all part of the one project. The flows of water at any particular time in the course of that project should not be determinative of whether the current flow of water is a nuisance. Why, if Mrs O’Brien purchased the land in 2003 with a water flow created by Council works in the 1950s, should the current water flow be compared to a year in the 1950s (when the flow may have been somewhat retarded by partially completed works) rather than any earlier year, was not made clear.
	
	
	In my view, a comparison of the current water flow caused by Council’s works must be compared with the natural flow that existed before Council’s works. Those works include the road, the pit, the pipe and the open drain. I have found that the Council drain and road works have increased the natural catchment area by about 50%.
	


(2) The limitations in the drainage system: the opening to the pit


	
	The rainwater from this additional area of approximately 0.4ha captured by the camber on Norma and Bynya Roads, and also the rainfall from the residue of the upper catchment above the centre of Norma Rd, does not flow directly onto 15 Norma Rd, but via the Council drain constituted by the pit, pipe and channel. The opening to the pit limits the amount of water that can reach Mrs O’Brien’s property via the channel in two ways, indicated earlier.
	
	
	First, the opening is about 540mm by 150mm, or 810 cm2. As this is significantly less than the area of the pipe opening it limits the water that can enter the pipe. Excessive water that is unable to enter the pit opening flows around the pit and down Norma Rd away from the pipe, channel and Mrs O’Brien’s property.
	
	
	The water flowing down the pipe is increased slightly, beyond the area of the pit opening, by at least one stormwater pipe from a property upslope of Norma Rd that feeds directly into the pit. A 100mm diameter pipe would increase the opening to the pit by 78cm2 but this says little about its carrying capacity (which may be affected by its diameter along its entire length). The pipe, it might be inferred, carried water from one property only, the identity and area of which is not defined. Thus, the amount of water it would carry in any storm was not specified. There was no evidence as to the extent to which it would increase the capacity of the pit to receive water, and in what storms it would deliver such an increase. As it has not figured in any of the calculations of the experts, I propose to ignore it quantitatively, although noting its existence.
	
	
	The second limitation resulting from the pit opening is that refuse or debris, especially leaf litter and other vegetable waste, is commonly carried by the water flowing towards the pit in a rainstorm. That refuse can block, wholly or partially, the opening to the pit. If the opening is blocked, negligible water would travel via the pipe into the channel, but rather would be diverted around the pit and continue down the northern side of Norma Rd in an easterly direction. As more debris is carried by more significant rainfalls, a blockage may be thought more likely to occur at those times. Dr Martens stated that there was a “high likelihood of the…pit being substantially blocked” during rainfall events (Exhibit C, Dr Martens’ Second Statement dated 29 May 2015 at [13]). There was evidence of blockages occurring and of pressure upon Council by neighbours to the east of the pit (presumably complaining) who would experience a greater flow of water down the street when the pit opening was blocked.
	
	
	Thus, not all of the water flowing from the catchment area ends up in the channel. Some may be diverted because of the limited opening to the pit or because of a further reduced opening resulting from leaf matter and other debris. These limitations are more significant in more extreme rainfall events because of the limiting effect of the pipe opening and because of the increased likelihood of the transporting of debris to block the opening in times of increased water flow.
	
	
	Mr Bewsher calculated the maximum flow through the pit into the pipe and channel via the upper catchment to be about 122 l/s. He concluded that such a level of flow down Norma Rd towards the pit would not occur in a “once a year” event but would occur in more significant, less frequent events. In other words, the water flow from a rainfall event of a magnitude that is expected to occur once every two years, or a greater magnitude event, will be moderated because of the limited opening to the pit. Any partial blockage of the pit opening by vegetation would further moderate the flow, even in more frequent, lesser magnitude events. Mr Williams calculates a greater maximum flow but made no response to Mr Bewsher’s criticism of his calculation (see Exhibit 1, Mr Bewsher’s report dated 29 February 2012 at [3.29]). I found his calculation difficult to follow. Dr Martens’ calculation appears to derive a maximum flow through the pit opening of 133 l/s (see Exhibit C, Statement of Evidence of Dr Martens dated 19 November 2014 at [14(a)(iv)] and [14(a)(v)]), not materially different from Mr Bewsher’s figure. I have adopted Mr Bewsher’s figure for convenience and because I found his reasoning to be more transparent.
	
	
	Because of the limited opening to the pit, comparing the current flows with the natural flows has complications. The natural flow rate is dependent, in part, on the area of the natural catchment. I have found the natural catchment to be about 1ha, and I accept the natural lower catchment area of 0.36ha (approximately the same as the existing lower catchment) as determined by Mr Bewsher. Thus, the natural upper catchment is 0.64ha, some 0.38ha or 37% less than the area of 1.02ha calculated by Mr Bewsher. Assuming water flow is directly proportional to the catchment area, which seems both reasonable and adopted by the experts, it might be expected that the amount of water flowing from the upper catchment into the pit under natural conditions should be 37% less than the natural flow calculated by Mr Bewsher. On this assumption, a once in every two-year magnitude event would produce, from the upper catchment, a natural water flow of not 220 l/s as currently calculated by Mr Bewsher (Exhibit 1, Report of Mr Bewsher dated 29 February 2012, p 16, Table 2), but 138.6 l/s (220 – 37/100 x 220). This is still marginally higher than the maximum water flow allowed by the pit opening of 122 l/s. In other words, on Mr Bewsher’s figures, the limited opening to the pit would preclude a greater water flow from the upper catchment than would occur under natural conditions, in a storm of a magnitude expected to occur once every two years or a greater magnitude event.
	
	
	Dr Martens calculates lesser flows under existing conditions than Mr Bewsher, whereas Mr Williams used figures from ACOR Consultants Pty Ltd, which show a higher rate. Mr Bewsher’s figure is about midway (for a 100-year event) between the figures derived by Dr Martens and Mr Williams, the two experts retained by Mrs O’Brien.
	
	
	So far as the natural catchment is concerned, Dr Martens’ figures for water flow in different magnitude rainfall events are between 10 and 20% of the figures calculated by Mr Bewsher. But Dr Martens’ catchment area is 0.43 ha, about 30% of the catchment area determined by Mr Bewsher. Dr Martens accepted that the differences in the flow rates were “largely because of differences in the catchment area”, although he indicated that the differences might also be due to a failure to recognise that a natural catchment yields lower flow rates than an urban catchment because of the greater presence of a permeable surface of soil and vegetation in the natural environment. However, the extent to which the increased flows resulted from increased development by others, and the extent to which the building works of others can be attributable to Council, was not the subject of evidence or submissions. I do not regard Council as responsible for the increased flow resulting from the actions of others (cf Gartner at 48) but only for the increased flow that results from the Council drain enlarging the upper catchment.
	
	
	For these reasons, and because I found Mr Bewsher’s reasoning to be more clearly disclosed, and because he distinguishes between the upper and lower catchments, I have adopted Mr Bewsher’s figures modified according to my conclusions about the catchment area.
	
	
	In my view, Mrs O’Brien’s land suffers from an increased water flow (compared to natural conditions) from the upper catchment. It receives more water during storms of lesser magnitude than a once in two-year storm. But in higher magnitude events, expected to occur every two years or less often, Mrs O’Brien’s land receives less water flow from the upper catchment than it would naturally receive, because of the limited opening to the pit. The increased flow in lesser magnitude events results from a larger existing upper catchment. Mr Bewsher calculates the existing upper catchment to be 1.1ha (see Exhibit 1, Mr Bewsher’s report dated 29 February 2012, Figure 6, p 13). This is 72% larger than the size of the natural upper catchment calculated above (at [62]) to be 0.64ha. Across the whole of the catchment, the existing catchment (1.47ha) is almost a 50% increase on the natural catchment of 1 ha, and in lower magnitude events it would produce a proportional increase in water flow onto Mrs O’Brien’s land.
	


(3) Nuisance and the existence of a natural watercourse


	
	Council submitted that it was entitled to discharge water onto Mrs O’Brien’s property because of the existence of a natural watercourse on the land. This issue raises questions concerning the law of nuisance in relation to flowing water, the relevance of a natural watercourse and the existence of riparian rights in Council.
	


(a) Nuisance and the flow of water


	
	Windeyer J stated in Gartner at 37:
	


“There is no right on the part of one landowner to drain the water from his land over that of his neighbour without the latter's consent. This rule prevents the gathering of water into a body and casting it onto the lower owner, or collecting it in artificial ditches for that purpose, or changing the course of drainage.”

Nevertheless, “the respondent was entitled to discharge upon [the appellant’s land] any water that would naturally flow there from his land in the normal use by him of his land and…the appellant was obliged to receive that water.”


	
	In Melaleuca Estate Pty Ltd v Port Stephens Council (2006) 12 BPR 23,743 at [22]-[23], the Court of Appeal held that “[d]ischarge of water onto the appellant’s land could be a nuisance if it was an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the land.”
	
	
	Council is not entitled to unreasonably enlarge the catchment area and thereby direct more water onto Mrs O’Brien’s property. Council may be liable for the concentration or alteration of this natural flow (see Gartner at 48). But the Council drain does more than this: it also restricts the amount of water flowing to Mrs O’Brien’s property in high magnitude events by reason of the limited pit opening.
	


(b) Is there a natural watercourse?


	
	The common law meaning of a ""watercourse"" is considered by Barwick CJ in Knezovic v Shire of Swan-Guildford (1968) 118 CLR 468 at 475 – 476. The Chief Justice determined that:
	


“it is settled that a watercourse consists of a stream with a bed, with banks, and water. That the flow of the water in the stream is intermittent or seasonal will not prevent what would otherwise be a watercourse from being accounted such: but though it is quite true that a watercourse may exist though its bed be dry for some periods, the watercourse, in my opinion, must exhibit features of continuity, permanence and unity, best seen, of course, in the existence of a defined bed and banks with flowing water. It must, in my opinion, essentially be a stream and be sharply distinguished from a mere drain, or a drainage depression in the contours of the land which serves to relieve upper land of excess water in times of major precipitation. It is not enough that the water, when it does flow, does so in what may be seen as a defined course or channel. In the case of a drainage depression, the water being drained off can be expected to flow in the lowest portion of the contours confined by the rising levels of the adjacent land: thus water can be seen when flowing to do so in what could be called a defined channel. If the seasonal rainfall is within an average tolerance in amount and timetable, the flow in the depression may well exhibit some regularity in the depth of water flowing in the contour depression and in the extent to which it spreads as it flows. If there is some such normality in the volume flowing, the impression of a defined channel with limiting margins will be enhanced. If, as I would expect to be the case, there is considerable variation in the rainfall and in the volume and velocity of the water flowing in the depression, the impression of a defined channel may be considerably less. But, in any event, the existence of such a defined channel will not make the drainage depression a watercourse nor the limiting margins of the water's flow in a rainy season or period ‘banks’ of a stream. Thus, though water when it flows in such a period flows in what can be called a defined channel, such a drainage depression will lack banks and a bed in the proper sense of that term, that is to say, identifiable margins of a continuous and permanent stream which contribute to its unity whether or not water is in fact continuously flowing over the bed. The word ‘occasional’ in the quotation from Angell on Watercourses will here, in my opinion, embrace seasonal events, even if they occur with some regularity from season to season.”


	
	As Windeyer J stated in Gartner at 27:
	


“[T]he depressions which provide the natural course or outlet for [surface water flooding] may be called watercourses. But the law treats such valleys and depressions very differently from watercourses that have the qualities of rivers and streams.” 


	
	In Gales Holdings Pty Limited v Tweed Shire Council [2013] NSWCA 382 at [132]-[133], the Court of Appeal stated that:
	


“nuisance is a wrongful interference with another's enjoyment of land by the use of other land occupied or owned by the alleged wrongdoer...A balance must be maintained between an owner or occupier's right to do what it likes with its land and a neighbour's right not to be interfered with. The proper test to apply in most cases is what is reasonable, according to the ordinary usages of a particular society…

The flow of water can give rise to nuisance. There is a difference between the flow of surface waters and the flow of natural watercourses. Riparian rights attach to the flow of natural watercourses such as rivers or streams, but not to the flow of surface waters. The word ‘riparian’ derives from the Latin ripa for riverbank. A riparian owner, being the proprietor of land on the banks of a natural stream of running water, is entitled to enjoy, and is obliged to accept, the flow of water past the land. The law of natural watercourses, not surface waters, applies even to waters of a river flowing in a wider channel than usual, when the river is swollen in time of flood, even though they flow on land outside the riverbed while still following the river's general course. Such flood channels are treated as part of the alveus, or riverbed. [Emphasis in original]


	
	Thus, it appears that the downstream owner must accept water in or flooding from a natural watercourse, and from surface waters which flow naturally onto the land. But, other than a natural watercourse, “[t]he higher proprietor may be liable if surface waters are caused to flow onto the lower land in a more concentrated form than they naturally would” (see at Gales Holdings at [135]-[136]). And, as indicated in the Gartner passage at 48 quoted earlier, what is “natural use” involves questions of reasonableness.
	
	
	Whether there is a natural watercourse on Mrs O’Brien’s property depends upon whether there is a riverbed, riverbanks and a regular flow of water. Here there was a drainage depression so that during storms water would flow, roughly in the region of the channel on 15 Norma Rd and into the drainage system on Mrs O’Brien’s property. But there was no evidence of beds or banks, and no regular water flow outside of a storm event.
	
	
	Council relied on the title documents to submit that there was a natural watercourse on the land. The Deposited Plan contains a reference to a natural watercourse running in roughly the location of Mrs O’Brien’s drainage system. The Deposited Plan also makes reference to a natural watercourse on the adjoining block to the south and on the block three blocks to the north. The terminology on the Deposited Plan is not determinative of whether a natural watercourse existed. That the notation on the Deposited Plan was evidence that “water flowed at that location” (at least during a storm), as Council submitted (defendant’s submissions dated 24 July 2015, [128(v)]), does not establish the existence of a natural watercourse rather than a drainage depression.
	
	
	In my view, the features of Mrs O’Brien’s land do not satisfy the elements of a bed, banks and a regular flow of water so as to constitute a natural watercourse. Rather, there existed only a “drainage depression” where water flowed in times of rain. It follows that the features of Mrs O’Brien’s land were not such as to allow Council to direct increased quantities of water onto her property.
	
	
	Nor does the existence of an easement over 15 Norma Rd provide any justification for directing water onto Mrs O’Brien’s property. Just as a lower proprietor cannot divert water onto the land of a third proprietor (Gartner at 49; Gales Holdings at [136]), neither can Council divert water onto Mrs O’Brien’s property.
	


(c) Abolition of riparian rights


	
	In case I found a natural watercourse, Mrs O’Brien argued, in the alternative, that any argument of Council based on riparian rights was not pleaded and thus ought not be permitted to be raised, that Council was not the owner of the land, and that in any event, riparian rights were abolished by s 393 of the Water Management Act 2000. As I have found that no natural watercourse existed, dealing with these questions is not strictly necessary. However, as parties have made some submissions on them I propose to add some brief comments. I would not regard a failure to mention riparian rights in the pleadings as a reason to refuse to consider that matter; the issue of the existence of a natural watercourse was clearly raised. As to whether, if there existed a natural watercourse, Council would be the owner of the banks of the watercourse, I am inclined to the view that the easement acquired by Council would put Council in the same position as a landowner.
	
	
	Section 393 provides:
	


“393 Abolition of common law riparian rights

Any right that the owner of riparian land would, but for this section, have at common law with respect to the flow of any river, estuary or lake through or past the land, or to the taking or using of water from any such river, estuary or lake, is hereby abolished.”


	
	The title of the provision refers to the “Abolition of common law riparian rights”. However, the text of the provision itself confines the abolition of rights to those which the owner of riparian land had “with respect to the flow” of the watercourse “through or past the land, or to the taking or using” of that water. Thus, the Water Management Act 2000 abolishes an entitlement to use the flow of water but does not in terms deal with an entitlement to direct water into the watercourse, or the obligation on a downstream owner “to accept the flow of water past the land” (Gales Holdings at [133]). Whether these particular rights and obligations, riparian in nature, remain unaffected by the terms of s 393 of the Water Management Act 2000 is uncertain. A wide view of the words “with respect to the flow” would embrace a right to add to that flow, but generally a common law right would not be found to have been statutorily denied, in the absence of clear words. I prefer not to express a concluded view on this matter in circumstances where no decision is required.
	


(4) Concentration of water, and the nature of the nuisance


	
	Mrs O’Brien has, as part of the approval to build her house, installed a drainage system to cope with significant, 1 in 100-year rainfall events. As a result, damage from the flow of water itself is not of concern, as the drainage system that she installed is designed to, and apparently does, cope with that flow. Moreover, the drainage system she installed was required irrespective of the Council drain, because of the magnitude of the stormwater events with which it was designed to deal. Although the existence of abatement works does not relieve Council of liability for nuisance (see Melaleuca Estate at [31]-[33]), nevertheless the existence of the works affects whether the flow of stormwater substantially interferes with Mrs O’Brien’s use and enjoyment of her land, and whether that flow impacts on its value.
	
	
	The end of the open drain within the easement is about 20m upslope of the escarpment, which is 3m to the rear of Mrs O’Brien’s property. Water flowing through the drain flows at the end of the drain over a rock face then across the rear of 15 and 19 Norma Rd until it reaches the escarpment. It is not visibly confined in its flow path by any natural or artificial features. To some extent the concentration of the water flow is thus dissipated. However, by one route or another, it appears that all or most of this water flows over the escarpment and onto the northwest corner of Mrs O’Brien’s property.
	
	
	The space of 20m between the end of the Council drain and the escarpment operated to slow the speed of the water flow, but did not appear to substantially lessen the concentration or volume of water flowing over the escarpment. Nevertheless, it was not clear that the concentration operated as a disadvantage to Mrs O’Brien. The concentration may have resulted in the water more readily being directed into Mrs O’Brien’s drainage system.
	
	
	The acceptance of responsibility by Council for any liability of its predecessor in constructing the Council drain removes the need to consider whether Council is in any way relieved by having “come into” the nuisance. But as Ward J noted in Quick v Alpine Nurseries Sales Pty Ltd [2010] NSWSC 1248 at [142], an occupier will be liable for continuing a nuisance if “with actual or constructive knowledge of its existence, he or she fails, within a reasonable period of time, to take reasonable measures to bring it to an end”. Although Council submitted that I should not conclude that Council “knew or ought to have known that stormwater flows would exceed those flowing naturally through the watercourse” I do not see that conclusion as being available. Mr Bewsher’s report obtained by Council establishes that in lower magnitude events commonly occurring annually or more frequently, the pit allows a greater volume of water to pass via the Council drain onto Mrs O’Brien’s property than would occur in natural conditions. The circumstance of the road funnelling water into the pit indicates this, even to the casual observer. In my view, there can be little doubt that any nuisance occurring by means of the Council drain has been continued by Council, with knowledge.
	
	
	Mrs O’Brien’s primary complaints concern the consequences of the water flow rather than merely the flow itself. Firstly, the water brings silt and debris which litters her property and her drainage system on the side of her property and so it requires regular maintenance. Secondly, the water flow is noisy and thereby disturbs her amenity. She also raised some other more general complaints about the consequences of increased and concentrated water flow onto her property.
	


(a) Litter and other debris


	
	I accept the evidence of Mrs O’Brien that debris is brought down the channel and deposited in her drainage system. Dr Martens’ observations provide some support for this conclusion (see Exhibit C, Dr Martens’ Second Statement dated 29 May 2015, p 8). It was not demonstrated what level of debris would be brought by a natural water flow. Nevertheless, it must be concluded that for regularly occurring and frequent (less than once every two-year) storms the magnitude of water flow is increased, and the water flow is more concentrated by the channel. This renders the water flow more capable of transporting debris. The possibility of debris blocking the pit entrance, and thus eliminating the transfer of debris through the pipe and into the channel towards her property, may lessen the transfer of debris to her property to some degree, but I am not satisfied it would reduce it substantially.
	
	
	Council submitted that there was an absence of meaningful evidence about the debris and pollutants. But there was evidence of debris, and that it might likely be caused by the increased flow of water along Norma Rd. That is sufficient, in my view, to conclude, on the balance of probabilities, that there is an increased level of debris attributable to the increased flow of water flowing into and from the Council drain. By reason of the Council drain, the catchment area includes an additional approximately 150m of roadway along Bynya and Norma Roads, thereby increasing the amount of debris transported by the water flow. The circumstance that the roadway is a likely place for debris because of human traffic, and the increased concentration and speed of flow resulting from the camber of the roadway are both relevant in assessing the existence and genesis of increased litter and debris. In my view, the transport and deposit onto Mrs O’Brien’s property of debris is an inconvenience that results from the Council drain that would not be present with the same regularity if the Council drain did not exist, even allowing for water flow from the natural upper catchment. The debris is a product of the increased amount of water from the upper catchment, some 72% more in frequent storms, and the concentrated flow of that water on the high side of Bynya Rd and Norma Rd into the Council drain.
	


(b) Silt


	
	The magnitude of the silt and litter deposited by the Council drain in a 12-month period was not indicated by the evidence, save that the silt is removed from Mrs O’Brien’s property twice a year. The added concentration of water in the channel may cause the transportation of silt picked up in the 20m or so between the end of the channel and the escarpment. On the other hand, the flow of the water on the sealed roadway of Bynya Rd and Norma Rd, and through the artificial channel may result in less silt being picked up and transported than in natural conditions. The presence of silt seems more likely to result from the impact of a concentrated flow of water from the end of the channel, rather than by being carried from the upper catchment. Is this sufficient?
	
	
	Council submitted that:
	


“[I]t is difficult to see, with the possible exception of some unidentified increase of pollutants that would be carried by the artificial channel, how a finding could be made that sand and sediment, could be attributed to the excess rather than natural flows.”  


	
	A greater concentration of water flow is likely to increase the amount of silt transported. But the extreme events expected to occur less often than every two years would be expected to carry and deposit a larger amount of silt, and the effect of those events are moderated by the limited pipe opening. The evidence does not persuade me that the current conditions produce more silt on average than the natural conditions, especially when less frequent and more extreme events are moderated by the limited opening to the pit. I am not able to conclude that Mrs O’Brien suffers from an increased level of silt by reason of the Council drain.
	
	
	In my view, the increased level of debris but not an increased level of silt, resulting from the increased flow of water, including along the roadway and into the pit, is a substantial interference with Mrs O’Brien’s use and enjoyment of her land. It constitutes a nuisance to which Mrs O’Brien is entitled to a remedy, including in an appropriate case by an injunction (see Gartner at 49).
	


(c) Noise


	
	Noise alone is sufficient ground for an injunction if a proper case of nuisance is made out: Vincent v Peacock [1973] 1 NSWLR 466, 470. But trifling inconvenience is insufficient; it must materially diminish the comfort and enjoyment of property (J M Paterson, Kerr on Injunctions, (6th ed, 1927, Sweet & Maxwell) at 185). See also Wherry v K B Hutcherson Pty Ltd (unreported, NSWSC, Hodgson J, 4 April 1986) at 16; Gray v New South Wales (unreported, NSWSC, Young J, 31 July 1997) at 1). There must be a “serious and not merely slightly additional interference with the comfort of the plaintiff and [her] family in the occupation of [her] house, according to the ordinary notions of reasonable persons in the locality” (Kerr, ibid). Although the learned author gives many examples of nuisance (see also Vincent at 470), none concern water noise. No cases were cited to me that indicated that the noise of flowing water would of itself suffice to require a remedy.
	
	
	Mrs O’Brien complains about the noise of the water flow. There was some evidence of the noise indicated in a video in evidence: that noise was particularly apparent at the rear of Mrs O’Brien’s property below the escarpment. However, the rear of the property is quite rugged and not easily accessed. Its topographical features indicate that it would rarely be accessed, especially during periods of rain, and there was no evidence of regular use of the rear of the property during storms.
	
	
	Although there would undoubtedly be noise from flowing water through the drainage system, there was no analysis done of how that noise near the house compares with the noise of the rain on the roof and surrounds and the noise of the surf on the other side of Whale Beach Rd (cf. Seidler v Luna Park Reserve Trust (unreported, NSWSC, Hodgson J, 21 September 1995 at e.g. [58]). The noise of the surf was noticeable when standing below the escarpment at the rear of Mrs O’Brien’s property during the site visit.
	
	
	There was no evidence to indicate that the noise of water flow was present other than during an actual storm, nor evidence that the noise caused disturbance inside Mrs O’Brien’s home when doors and windows were closed. Because of the increased flow in regular rainstorms (compared to natural conditions), it might be expected that outside of extreme events, the noise is more significant than it would be in natural conditions. But inside the house is where Mrs O’Brien and her family, if on the property, might be expected to be situated during a rainstorm. Closing windows and (presumably external) doors is a method Mrs O’Brien uses to abate the noise. The necessity of closing windows and external doors in a rainstorm, irrespective of the noise, might be expected (especially if wind is present) but that was not the subject of evidence.
	
	
	Although water flow through the drainage system on Mrs O’Brien’s property would persist beyond the period of a storm - up to two days said Mrs O’Brien – there was no evidence that that water was causally connected to water flowing through the Council drain. It may also have resulted from seeping groundwater from sodden soil. In any event, the level of noise of flowing water outside of the period of a storm was not the subject of evidence.
	
	
	In these circumstances, I am not persuaded that the noise from the water flow during a storm was an unreasonable interference with Mrs O’Brien’s use and enjoyment of her land so as to constitute an actionable nuisance.
	


(d) General matters


	
	Mrs O’Brien also alleged that she was “deprived of using her land” and that:
	


“The quantity, velocity and power of this water means that the part of Property over which that water flows can never be used or developed by Mrs O’Brien, whether for landscaping, building or other purposes. All that the land can be used for is to allow the water to flow and to endeavour to abate its effect.”


	
	The part of the land referred to is where Mrs O’Brien’s drainage system is located. That drainage system was required to cope with a 1 in 100-year flood as part of her development approval. There was evidence that it may have been conservatively designed or over-engineered so as to more than cope with that event. But it was not suggested that this was as a result of any requirement of Council.
	
	
	In my view, it is the drainage system rather than the water flow that operates to limit Mrs O’Brien’s use of that part of the land. The size of the drainage system was not increased by the water flow generated by the Council drain. On the contrary, the limited opening to the pit lessens the impact of a 1 in 100-year magnitude event and thus, if that limited opening had been considered, it would have reduced the size of the necessary drainage system. The water that flows more regularly through that drainage system arises from lesser magnitude events.
	
	
	Mrs O’Brien also relied upon evidence that, in respect of the previous building on the property, “some footings [had] been washed out and collapsed” and that sand beneath the previous residence and a garage showed “signs of water flow through” it.
	
	
	It was not in dispute that the property historically had been significantly affected by water flow, and that the property now receives a significant flow of water. But the evidence did not establish that the washed out footings and water flow through the garage, of a previous building, which would not now recur because of the drainage system installed by Mrs O’Brien, were attributable to the Council drain magnifying a low level event, or attributable to a high level event which would be lessened by the Council drain’s limited pit opening. I am not persuaded that these observations of an earlier time assist in determining the impact of the Council drain on Mrs O’Brien’s property.
	
	
	Further, the mere existence of water flow through the drainage system does not establish damage (see Bonaccorso v Strathfield Municipal Council [2003] NSWSC 408 at [49]). Mrs O’Brien is benefitted by having less water flow onto her property in high magnitude events, estimated to occur less than once every two years. Greater damage might ordinarily be expected to result from extreme events, yet in this case the Council drain moderates the impact of the event and also Mrs O’Brien has a drainage system designed to cope with extreme events. I am not satisfied that the mere water flow resulting from the Council drain deprives Mrs O’Brien of using her land or otherwise constitutes a nuisance.
	


(5) The statutory defences


	
	Council relied on certain statutory defences.
	
	
	Section 43A of the Civil Liability Act 2002 provides:
	


“43A Proceedings against public or other authorities for the exercise of special statutory powers

(1) This section applies to proceedings for civil liability to which this Part applies to the extent that the liability is based on a public or other authority’s exercise of, or failure to exercise, a special statutory power conferred on the authority.

(2) A special statutory power is a power:

(a) that is conferred by or under a statute, and

(b) that is of a kind that persons generally are not authorised to exercise without specific statutory authority.

(3) For the purposes of any such proceedings, any act or omission involving an exercise of, or failure to exercise, a special statutory power does not give rise to civil liability unless the act or omission was in the circumstances so unreasonable that no authority having the special statutory power in question could properly consider the act or omission to be a reasonable exercise of, or failure to exercise, its power.

(4) In the case of a special statutory power of a public or other authority to prohibit or regulate an activity, this section applies in addition to section 44.”


	
	This provision raises two issues: whether the power exercisable by Council under subs (2)(b) “is of a kind that persons generally are not authorised to exercise without specific statutory authority”, and whether the act or omission of Council was “so unreasonable” under subs (3).
	
	
	The resolution of these issues depends upon the specific act or omission of Council. Is it the act of installing the Council drain in the 1950’s, or the failure to amend the system to protect Mrs O’Brien’s property in recent times when complaint was made?
	
	
	So far as Mrs O’Brien is concerned, no nuisance could occur until after she had purchased the property. So it is appropriate to focus on the more recent omission of Council to take any steps to remedy the problem.
	
	
	For that omission to be a “special statutory power”, the power of amending the Council drain so as to ameliorate the nuisance must be a power unable to be exercised “without specific statutory authority”. That may depend upon the means taken to relieve the nuisance. Would the installing of a grate to capture debris before it is channelled onto Mrs O’Brien’s property require specific statutory authority or is the power to do so a power “of a kind” that any person could exercise in managing drainage systems on their land or on easements benefitting them?
	
	
	Section 634 of the Local Government Act 1993 prohibits an unlicensed person from doing any stormwater drainage work. Does the requirement for using licensed tradespersons, or to work under their supervision, mean that the power to do the work is “of a kind that persons generally are not authorised to exercise”? I do not think it is. Persons generally are authorised to do the work, although if a particular person is not licensed then they must do the work under appropriate supervision. Further, s 634 is not a provision giving Council specific statutory authority. Instead, it imposes conditions on the exercise of a power by anyone.
	
	
	Council also relied on s 59A of the Local Government Act 1993, which permits Council to act in respect of the Council drain “to ensure that, in the opinion of the council, the works are used in an efficient manner for the purposes for which the works were installed.”
	
	
	Council is also granted ownership of the Council drain by s 59A. As the pit and pipe are on the roadway, the grant in s 59A is unnecessary in respect of them. As to the channel, the grant of the easement for drainage should ordinarily grant power to Council to do works in respect of the channel, even if, absent s 59A, it remained owned by the registered proprietor of 15 Norma Rd.
	
	
	Unquestionably the Council drain was installed to drain water. But I remain unsatisfied that that is a fair description of the extent of the Council’s opinion of the system’s purposes under s 59A. The purposes of the Council drain might be to mitigate water flow easterly down Norma Rd, it might be to preserve the quality of Norma Rd for public or driver safety or there may be other purposes. There was no evidence from Council on this matter and in the absence of evidence, I would not infer that Council held the opinion that the Council drain was being used in an efficient manner for its purposes unless Council believed it was not causing to others damage by nuisance or negligence, see Bankstown City Council v Alamdo Holdings Pty Ltd (2005) 223 CLR 660 at [16]. Council would be negligent unless it conducted the operation “with all reasonable regard, and care for the interests of other persons”: Melaleuca at [47]-[48].
	
	
	I was not addressed on the question of whether s 59A overrides s 634, a matter which may affect whether there was “specific statutory authority” under s 43A(2)(b). Could Council use unlicensed tradespersons under s 59A notwithstanding s 634? Section 634(3), which exempts Council from the application of s 634(1) and (2) in certain circumstances, seems to indicate that Council is not absolved generally under s 59A. Further, s 634(3) makes no reference to stormwater drainage work, and thus indicates that in doing that kind of work, Council is subject to the prohibition in s 634(1) and (2) notwithstanding s 59A. It follows that Council has no more or less authority under s 634 to do the work than any other person: both are subject to the restraint of using licensed tradespersons.
	
	
	Recent authority has broadened the circumstance where activities can be “based on” a special statutory power: see Curtis v Harden Shire Council (2014) 88 NSWLR 10 and Roads and Maritime Services v Grant [2015] NSWCA 138. This does not affect the need for this power to be a “special statutory power”, including that the power is of a kind not authorised without specific statutory authority. For the reasons given, I do not accept that modification to the pit and pipe “could not be performed without the special statutory power” (Council’s reply submissions dated 27 July 2015 at [21], see also Gales Holdings at [199]).
	
	
	Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the stormwater drainage work of the type contemplated to relieve Mrs O’Brien from the nuisance requires the exercise of a special statutory power. It follows that I am not persuaded that s 43A(2)(b) of the Civil Liability Act 2002 is satisfied by ss 59A and 634 of the Local Government Act 1993, in the present case.
	
	
	The second issue concerns whether Council, in omitting to take any steps to ameliorate the nuisance to Mrs O’Brien, has acted unreasonably within the terms of s 43A of the Civil Liability Act 2002.
	
	
	Council submitted that there “is no expert opinion that a stormwater drainage authority should have regard to [less frequent than biennial] rainfall events in managing its drainage system” (Council’s submissions dated 24 July 2015, [211]). I do not accept that Council need only consider 1 in 100-year events when considering whether it is committing a nuisance. In my view, Council should have regard to a potential nuisance when it is concentrating and enlarging a flow of water, whether in larger or lesser magnitude events, onto a property over which it has no drainage easement. No authority could properly consider it reasonable to direct water onto another landowner’s property without legal authority, at least without considering the consequences to the landowner. There was no evidence that Council gave the matter any consideration. In my view, this omission satisfies the “so unreasonable” test within s 43A(3) (see Dubois v Noarlunga District Council [1959] SASR 127 at [122]).
	
	
	Section 582A of the Local Government Act 1919 provides:
	


“Exculpation from liability—flood liable land. 

582A. (1) A council shall not incur any liability in respect of— 

… 

(b) anything done or omitted to be done in good faith by the council in so far as it relates to the likelihood of land being flooded or the nature or extent of any such flooding. 

(2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), that 

subsection applies to— 

… 

(e) the carrying out of flood mitigation works; and 

(f) any other thing done or omitted to be done in the exercise of a council's powers, authorities, duties or functions under this or any other Act. 

(3) Without limiting any other circumstances in which a council may have acted in good faith, a council shall, unless the contrary is proved, be deemed to have acted in good faith for the purposes of subsection (1) if the advice was furnished, or the thing was done or omitted to be done, substantially in accordance with the principles contained in the relevant manual published under subsection (4) at that time. 

… 

(6) This section applies to and in respect of any advice furnished or thing done or omitted to be done before the commencement of this section, as well as to and in respect of any advice furnished or thing done or omitted to be done after the commencement of this section.”


	
	This provision was repealed in 1993. It has no application to the conduct of Council in continuing the nuisance, and I have already found that Mrs O’Brien can have no claim in respect of the Council drain prior to her owning the property.
	
	
	In any event, in the absence of any evidence from Council, I am not satisfied that Council held any regard and care, let alone all reasonable regard and care, for the interests of Mrs O’Brien, when it continued to divert additional water onto her property during storms. Nor in the absence of evidence from Council, could I conclude that Council has weighed up the benefit to Mrs O’Brien in limiting the water flow in higher magnitude events against the increased flow in lesser magnitude events, so as to have had reasonable regard for Mrs O’Brien’s interest.
	
	
	In Dubois at [122], Piper J held:
	


“Indeed, it seems to me that the method of draining the water off the road onto the plaintiff’s land without making provision for carrying it through the land was one which, on the face of it, was so unreasonable, so fraught with manifest danger to the plaintiff, that no council acting bona fide and rationally, having regard to its obligations to the plaintiff, would ever have undertaken it”.


	
	Accordingly, I am not satisfied that s 43A of the Civil Liability Act 2002 grants any immunity from civil liability in the circumstances of this case.
	
	
	The only other statutory provision relied upon by the Council was s 733(1) of the Local Government Act 1993. It provides:
	


“733 Exemption from liability—flood liable land, land subject to risk of bush fire and land in coastal zone

(1) A council does not incur any liability in respect of:

…

(b) anything done or omitted to be done in good faith by the council in so far as it relates to the likelihood of land being flooded or the nature or extent of any such flooding.

…

(3) Without limiting subsections (1), (2) and (2A), those subsections apply to:

…

(g) any other thing done or omitted to be done in the exercise of a council’s functions under this or any other Act.

…”

“Flooded” is defined in the dictionary at the end of the Local Government Act 1993. It provides:

“flooded, in relation to land, means inundated by waters derived from the runoff of rainfall on land.”


	
	Section 733 does not identify a statutory power, but rather specifies a privilege or immunity of council. Powers are not the same as privileges or immunities (see Brennan CJ in Arena v Nader & State of New South Wales (1997) 71 ALJR 1604; [1997] 17 Leg Rep SL1).
	
	
	Section 733 purports to grant Council immunity, apparently replacing s 582A of the 1919 Act. The extent of that immunity and whether it has application to the present case must be considered.
	
	
	First, damage from water flow and damage from flooding are not synonymous. The principle of legality (see Coco v The Queen (1994) 179 CLR 427, 437) militates against extending the immunity from common law liability beyond the strict terms of s 733 (see Clissold v Perry (Minister for Public Instruction) (1904) 1 CLR 363, 373; Bonaccorso v Strathfield Municipal Council [2003] NSWSC 408 at [41]-[45]). Mrs O’Brien makes no claim against Council in respect of flooding, but in respect of water directed onto her property, depositing debris, causing noise and thereby disturbing her amenity.
	
	
	Secondly, Council led no evidence to prove that any act was done in good faith. As held in Gales Holdings at [181]:
	


“A defendant can only rely on the defence once it has identified the thing that it did or omitted to do in good faith. Further, good faith is more than honest ineptitude. There must be a real attempt to exercise a relevant power”.


	
	The remarks in Dubois cited earlier, are also apposite. The Court should, in accordance with Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298, be reluctant in the circumstances of this case to infer that Council’s actions in continuing to direct water onto Mrs O’Brien’s property, over which it has no easement, was an act done in good faith, or involved the good faith exercise of a power, in circumstances where no evidence was called by Council to establish this, and no evidence was called to explain this lack of evidence. The purposes for which the Council drain was installed (under s 59A of the Local Government Act 1993) are not established by any evidence.
	


(6) Remedies

(a) Injunction


	
	Mrs O’Brien submits that the appropriate remedy is to block the pit or pipe so that the water continues along the high side of Norma Rd. She submits that the pit entry is sometimes blocked by leaf litter which results in Norma Rd property owners having to cope with the flow of water. To block the pipe permanently would have the same effect.
	
	
	As noted earlier, Mr Williams gave evidence that the pit “does block fairly regularly” and Council takes action to remedy this problem “only under pressure from residents”. This suggests to me that blocking the pit to allow water to travel down Norma Rd has an adverse effect on those property owners sufficient to cause them to “pressure” Council. There was reason to believe that heavy flows of water may cross to the southern side of Norma Rd further down (east) from the pit and flow onto properties on the low side. There were drains at the top of driveways near the roadway on that side of the road. Also, that section of Norma Rd, as seen on the view and as indicated on the contour plan east of Pacific Rd, appeared to have a slight depression in the centre of the roadway: at least there was no significant camber to prevent flows across the road. I think the Court should be cautious in making an order that has potentially detrimental effects on other property owners without hearing from them.
	
	
	Mr Williams’ gave evidence in respect of allowing water to continue down Norma Rd:
	


“It does not appear that there has been a major issue downstream. So whatever the drainage system [downstream] is doing, it might not be perfect but it coping”.

This does not persuade me that I should make orders resulting in the water being redirected to flow down Norma Rd.


	
	The decommissioning of the Norma Rd pit would regularly direct an additional amount of up to 121 to 133l/s of water easterly down Norma Rd. Although there is a further drainage system further down Norma Rd, it has a 300l/s capacity. When this is exceeded, water would flow to the southern side of Norma Rd, with possible adverse effects to downslope housing on both sides of Norma Rd. To direct more water to those properties than would normally flow upon them, by directing water from the upper catchment some of which would naturally flow to Mrs O’Brien’s property, may be to create a nuisance to them of the same type which Mrs O’Brien complains of in these proceedings.
	
	
	If the only significant interference with Mrs O’Brien’s use and enjoyment of her property is the increased amount of debris that is deposited, then changing the course of the water flow seems an unnecessary and excessive step to remedy the problem.
	
	
	The flow of debris onto Mrs O’Brien’s land could be remedied by Council acting to place a grate or mesh over the Norma Rd pipe to prevent debris travelling down the pipe into the channel. The transport via the Council drain of debris such as bottles, plastic bags and the like produced by human activity could thus readily be prevented without reducing the water flow. Installing such a grate will marginally reduce the opening to the pipe but will not reduce the water flow because of the limited pit opening: the pipe capacity already well exceeds the capacity of the pit opening. It would need to be regularly inspected to clear away any build-up of debris, but that action already needs to be done in relation to the pit opening. And no issue of safety or other matter would seem to preclude a grate on the pipe. It would also seem relatively economical to install. On the material before me, it seems that a mandatory injunction to compel the installation of a grate would be appropriate.
	
	
	In my view, the installation of a grate would remove the unreasonable interference with Mrs O’Brien’s use and enjoyment of her land by precluding debris from being carried onto her land via the pit opening and channel, and thus removing the actionable nuisance to Mrs O’Brien. As this remedy should not increase the flow of water down Norma Rd, I need not consider any adverse impact on other residents or property owners.
	
	
	An alternative method of eliminating the nuisance and reinstituting a flow equivalent to natural conditions would be to divert part (on my calculations 42%) of the water coming from the enlarged upper catchment so that it flowed past the opening to the pit. That may well be possible. But if natural water flows are to be restored to Mrs O’Brien’s land, rather than merely channelling them in the direction of other property owners, the pit opening would also need to be enlarged to cope with the higher flows during infrequent high magnitude rainfall events which have been moderated by the Council drain. The result would be less water being directed down the pipe in frequent, lower magnitude storms, because of the diversion, but in heavier and infrequent (less than biennial) rainfall events the enlarged pit opening may result in a greater flow to Mrs O’Brien’s property even though some water has been diverted. Neither party asked for this remedy nor do I think it cures the nuisance as economically and fairly as installing a grate to eliminate debris. By the installation of a grate, Mrs O’Brien would retain the advantage she possessed when she purchased her property, of having the upper catchment limited by the pit opening, no matter how heavy or extreme the storm.
	


(b) Damages


	
	Mrs O’Brien claims damages in the alternative to an injunction.
	
	
	The claim for damages is based upon the reduced value of Mrs O’Brien’s property by reason of the increased water flow through the Council drain onto Mrs O’Brien’s land (see Exhibit C, Report of Paul Chaloner dated 8 August 2011 at [1.1]). As I have not proposed to compel Council to block the Council drain, the question of damages remains. Further, diminution in the value of the property might evidence the extent of a nuisance: see Kerr on Injunctions at 138. Mrs O’Brien did not make this claim, however. Rather, she asserted that the diminution in value was relevant only as the proper measure of damage in the event that no injunction were granted.
	
	
	The valuation expert relied upon Mr Williams’ figures as to the extent of the water flow caused by the Council drain (see Exhibit C, Report of Paul Chaloner dated 8 August 2011 at [1.2]) and stated that the diminution in value is “by reason of the [Council drain] drainage system…continuing to discharge stormwater onto the land in excess of the natural flow that would otherwise flow upon it” (Exhibit C, Report of Paul Chaloner dated 8 August 2011 at [10], my underlining). I have not accepted Mr Williams’ figures. In extreme events such as 1 in 100-year storms there is no “excess of the natural flow” but rather a reduction of the natural flow by reason of the limited pit opening. As the foundation of Mr Chaloner’s opinion of reduced value is based upon the assumption of an increased water flow onto Mrs O’Brien’s property, apparently in all storms regardless of magnitude, and that assumption is not established, the opinion is left without a factual foundation.
	
	
	Mr Chaloner also assessed that the property value was diminished because “a much larger pipe and overland flow system has been installed than what would normally have been required” (see Exhibit C, Report of Paul Chaloner dated 8 August 2011 at [1.2]). But there is no basis to attribute this drainage system of Mrs O’Brien to the existence of the Council drain.
	
	
	Mrs O’Brien utilised a 2m wide area for her drainage system reserved for the inclinator rather than a 1m wide area that may have been sufficient to accommodate the water flows. There was no evidence that this was due to the additional flows created by the Council drain. Nor could it be, since the drainage system was designed to accommodate a 1 in 100-year event as assessed by experts retained by Mrs O’Brien, and the Council drain would moderate or lessen flows in that event rather than magnify them. Accordingly, no diminished value by reason of the larger area reserved for Mrs O’Brien’s drainage system can be attributed to the works of Council.
	
	
	Mrs O’Brien correctly submitted that no contrary valuation evidence was served and Mr Chaloner was not challenged on his evidence. But this does not mean that Mr Chaloner’s opinion must be accepted. His opinion evidence relied upon assumptions about water flow and that the size of Mrs O’Brien’s drainage system resulted from the Council drain, assumptions which were not established by the evidence. In my view, any diminution in value based upon an increased water flow is mistaken, and any diminution in value based upon the size of Mrs O’Brien’s drainage system cannot be attributed to the Council drain.
	
	
	In my view, once the measures I have indicated are implemented to prevent debris from flowing through the Council drain, there is then no factor impacting on the value of Mrs O’Brien’s home. There is a more regular, but less extreme flow of water through her drainage system, but I am unable to conclude that that represents a negative impact on the value of her property. That matter was not considered by Mr Chaloner.
	


C. Conclusion


	
	I find that Council is liable in nuisance in directing an increased water flow onto Mrs O’Brien’s land in frequent lower magnitude events. This impedes Mrs O’Brien’s reasonable use and enjoyment of her land by depositing a significantly increased level of debris, but not in the other respects claimed by her.
	
	
	My preliminary view is to order that Council, by the installation of a grate or other device on the pipe opening in the pit, preclude the transport through the pipe of plastic bottles, bags and other artificial refuse greater than approximately 25mm in diameter. I note that Mrs O’Brien did not seek that any injunction be enforced immediately. In any event, as this particular remedy has not been the subject of submissions, I propose to hear from the parties as to whether it may be inappropriate.
	


D. Orders and costs


	
	Accordingly, the orders of the Court are:
	



	
	Direct the parties to bring forward orders that reflect these reasons.
	
	
	In the event of disagreement, the matter will be relisted in respect of orders.
	
	
	In any event, the matter will be relisted in respect of costs.

		08 August 2016",2016-02-15 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2702088,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 21) [2016] NSWSC 79,"Judgment – EX TEMPORE (REVISED)


	
	Hubert Sha, who is currently giving evidence in the Crown case, made a statement to police on 7 July 2014. Paragraphs 22 and 23 of that statement relate to a conversation at which the witness was present with two persons he has described as ""two Asian males"". The conversation is said to have occurred in the area of Davies Road in Padstow on 20 May 2014 at a time when the witness and a number of other persons were searching for the deceased.
	
	
	Paragraphs 22 and 23 are in the follows terms:
	


“22. At this point the four of us and Ronny went over to speak with the Asian males further about Jamie. While we were speaking with the Asian males, I remember basically the four of us asked them questions at different times and both Asian males answered at different times. I recall these Asian males spoke Cantonese and Mandarin.

23. These Asian males told us they were from Hong Kong and they were with Jamie earlier to do a drug deal. I recall they told us it was a large amount of Ice and that they gave the drugs to Jamie. I know some of this conversation was in Mandarin so I did not understand the entire thing as I only speak Cantonese and English. During this conversation the Asian males said that when they gave the drugs to Jamie he left his car and belongings with them and went to get in another car but they did not see the other car. They said this happened during the afternoon.”


	
	Mr Thomas of counsel, who appears on behalf of the accused Rogerson, seeks to cross-examine the witness with a view to eliciting the contents of those two paragraphs, but particularly the contents of paragraph 23.
	
	
	Paragraph 23 was the subject of an earlier judgment which I delivered yesterday: R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 19) [2016] NSWSC 74. On that occasion, the Crown had sought to rely upon s. 65 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”) to support the admission of representations said to have been made by the two Asian males to Mr Sha as set out in paragraph 23 of his statement. In the light of the evidence that was tendered in relation to that application, I was not able to conclude that either of the Asian males could be regarded as being ""unavailable"" in the sense contemplated by the Act.
	
	
	I also observed that even if I had reached a contrary view in respect of that issue, I would have been minded to exclude the evidence pursuant to s. 137 of the Act. As will be apparent from the reasons I gave on that occasion, I placed some emphasis on Mr Sha’s concession that he understood only part of the conversation because it was conducted principally in Mandarin which is not his mother tongue.
	
	
	The circumstances in which the issue has now arisen are slightly different, in the sense that the evidence is sought to be elicited in cross-examination. In that regard, I have been referred to s. 65(8) of the Act:
	


Exception: criminal proceedings if maker not available

(a) evidence of a previous representation adduced by a defendant if the evidence is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, or

(b) a document tendered as evidence by a defendant so far as it contains a previous representation, or another representation to which it is reasonably necessary to refer in order to understand the representation.

Note : Section 67 imposes notice requirements relating to this subsection…”


	
	Although, when the matter previously arose, reliance was placed by the Crown on ss. 65(1) and (2), it remains the case, for the reasons set out in my earlier judgment, that I am not satisfied that either of the Asian males is not available.
	
	
	Further, in the course of Mr Sha being cross-examined before the jury on 12 February 2016, he said the following (commencing at T631 L4):
	


“Q. Who else spoke to them?

A. To my knowledge only me and Ronnie.

Q. What languages were spoken?

A. They could talk brief, like a little bit of Cantonese but mainly Mandarin which is not my ‑ not the tongue ‑ that wasn't my mother tongue.

Q. So is Cantonese your mother tongue?

A. Yes.

Q. Was there some of the conversation in Cantonese?

A. Yes.

Q. Was the name of one of those Asian males given?

A. Yes.

Q. What was the name?

A. I believe Adut, in English I believe it would be A‑D‑U‑T.”


	
	Irrespective of questions of the availability of either person, counsel for McNamara objects to the evidence being given on the basis that the circumstances lend themselves to the application of s. 135 of the Act which is in the following terms:
	


135 General discretion to exclude evidence

The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might:

(a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or

(b) be misleading or confusing, or

(c) cause or result in undue waste of time.


	
	Ms Shead has pointed, in particular, to the fact of Mr Sha’s limited understanding of Mandarin (that being the language in which Mr Sha says that the majority of the conversation was conducted) and has submitted that in those circumstances, any evidence which might be given by Mr Sha is likely to be misleading or confusing.
	
	
	Mr Thomas has submitted that the evidence ought not be excluded. He pointed to the fact that Mr Sha, on any view of the evidence, has stated that only some of the conversation was in Mandarin, and that there is therefore a clear inference that part of the conversation was in a language, or languages, that Mr Sha could understand. Mr Thomas has submitted that in those circumstances, none of the provisions of s. 135 are applicable.
	
	
	It is apparent from Mr Sha’s statement that there were parts of the conversation which were in Mandarin, and which he therefore he did not understand. It is also clear that Cantonese is Mr Sha’s mother tongue, and that there was, as he described it, only ""a little bit"" of the conversation which was conducted in that language.
	
	
	In my view, issues of availability aside, the difficulty with the evidence being admitted is that on Mr Sha’s own admission he could understand only part of the conversation. It follows that any evidence Mr Sha can give of the conversation is not a complete account of what was said, such that his account would be necessarily disjointed and incomplete. That gives rise to the possibility of the evidence being misleading or confusing.
	
	
	For all of these reasons, I refuse to admit the evidence.

2702099,Bignill v DPP [2016] NSWCA 13,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

Mr Thomas Mason Bignill (the applicant) was driving a vehicle on Clark Road, Neutral Bay at around 9 am on Saturday 19 April 2014. He was pulled over by Senior Constable Luke Polak who required him to submit to a random breath test under clause 3 of Schedule 3 of the Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW) (the Act). After alcohol above the statutory limit was detected on his breath, the applicant was arrested and taken to North Sydney police station.

At 9.36am the applicant submitted to a breath analysis under clause 5 of Schedule 3 of the Act, which delivered a result of .054 grams of alcohol in 210 litres of breath. The applicant made a request under clause 21(1) of Schedule 3 of the Act to have a sample of his blood taken by an authorised person. This was performed at around 10.36am and the blood analysis produced a result of 0.049 grams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.

The applicant was charged under s 110(3) of the Act with the offence of driving whilst there was present in his breath or blood the low range prescribed content of alcohol. Under s 108 of the Act, low range prescribed concentration of alcohol is defined as a concentration of .05 grams or more but less than .08 grams of alcohol in 210 litres of breath or 100 millilitres of blood. At a hearing in the Local Court the applicant submitted the results of the blood analysis while the prosecutor submitted the results of the breath analysis. The magistrate dismissed the charge, however, an appeal was allowed by the Supreme Court who ordered the matter be remitted to the magistrate.

The primary issue on appeal to the Court of Appeal was the effect of the deeming provision in clause 31 of Schedule 3 of the Act, namely, whether the applicant could use the results of a blood analysis that recorded an alcohol concentration below the statutory limit to prevent a conviction based on a breath analysis recording an alcohol concentration above the statutory limit.

The Court held (Bathurst CJ, Ward JA agreeing, Emmett AJA writing separately), dismissing the appeal:

(1)   There is no statutory basis for preferring the results of a blood analysis to that of a breath analysis. Clause 31(2) of Schedule 3 of the Act gives no primacy to either a breath or a blood analysis: [26] (Bathurst CJ); [38] (Ward JA); [47] (Emmett AJA).

R v Relton (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 28 July 1994, unrep)

(2)   Once either a breath or a blood analysis is tendered showing an alcohol concentration over the statutory limit, the offence under s 110 of the Act is established. The tender of such evidence produces a rebuttable presumption, by virtue of clause 31(3) of Schedule 3 of the Act, that alcohol concentration at the time the defendant was required to submit to a breath test was above the statutory limit [27], [30], [33] (Bathurst CJ); [38] (Ward JA); [47] (Emmett AJA)

Macquarie Bank Ltd v Fociri Pty Ltd (1992) 27 NSWLR 203; R v West (1974) 3 PSR 1273

(3)   The onus cast upon a defendant by clause 31(3) of Schedule 3 of the Act is not satisfied merely by tendering the result of a test which provides a reading below the statutory limit. To discharge the onus a defendant must prove that the concentration of alcohol was below the statutory limit at the time he or she was required to submit to a breath test: [28], [32], [34] (Bathurst CJ); [38] (Ward JA); [46]-[47] (Emmett AJA).

Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: On Saturday 19 April 2014 at about 9am the applicant, Thomas Mason Bignill (the applicant), was driving a Toyota Kluger vehicle on Clark Road Neutral Bay. He was stopped by Senior Constable Luke Polak who conducted a passive breath test on him which detected alcohol on his breath. He then conducted a non-passive breath test which returned a positive sample of .063.
	
	
	Constable Polak then took the applicant to North Sydney police station where a breath analysis was carried out. This was completed at 9:36am and showed a result of .054 grams of alcohol in 210 litres of breath, which fell within the definition of low range prescribed concentration of alcohol in s 108 of the Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW) (the Road Transport Act).
	
	
	Clause 21(1) of Part 3 of Schedule 3 of the Road Transport Act provides that a person who is required by a police officer to submit to a breath analysis may request the police officer to arrange an authorised sample of the person’s blood to be taken, in the presence of the police officer, for analysis in accordance with Part 4 of Schedule 3 to determine the concentration of alcohol in the person’s blood at that person’s own expense. Clause 21(2) provides that such a request does not excuse the person from submitting to a breath analysis.
	
	
	Senior Constable Polak offered the applicant the opportunity of a blood test, which offer was accepted. At 10:35am the blood test was taken and produced a result of .049 grams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. There was no dispute that both the breath analysis and the blood test were carried out in accordance with the provisions prescribed by the Road Transport Act.
	
	
	The applicant was charged with the offence of driving whilst there was present in his breath or blood the low range prescribed content of alcohol. He was acquitted by the magistrate but an appeal was allowed by the primary judge who remitted the matter to the magistrate to be dealt with in accordance with law (DPP v Bignill [2015] NSWSC 668 (Supreme Court Judgment)).
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal from the decision of the primary judge.
	


The relevant legislation


	
	To understand the reasons of each of the magistrate and the primary judge it is necessary to have regard to a number of provisions of the Road Transport Act.
	
	
	Section 110(3) of the Road Transport Act provides that it is an offence for a person to drive a vehicle whilst there is present in the person’s breath or blood the low range prescribed concentration of alcohol. Low range prescribed concentration of alcohol is defined in s 108 of the Road Transport Act to mean a concentration of .05 grams or more but less than .08 grams of alcohol in 210 litres of breath or 100 millilitres of blood.
	
	
	Section 109 of the Road Transport Act provides as follows;
	


“109   Measurement of alcohol concentrations

(1) For the purposes of this Act, the concentration of alcohol present in a person’s breath or blood may be expressed as follows:

(a)    in the case of a sample of breath that is measured by a breath analysing instrument or other breath testing device that provides a reading or result by reference to alcohol present in the breath – the amount of alcohol in grams in 210 litres of breath,

(b)   in the case of a sample of breath that is measured by a breath analysing instrument or other breath testing device that provides a reading or result by reference to alcohol present in the blood – the amount of alcohol in grams in 100 millilitres of blood,

(c)    in the case of a sample of blood – the amount of alcohol in grams in 100 millilitres of blood.

(2) An amount of alcohol in grams present in breath when measured by reference to 210 litres of breath is equivalent to the same amount of alcohol in grams present in blood when measured by reference to 100 millilitres of blood.

(3) Accordingly, any offence against this Act relating to the presence of a specified concentration of alcohol in a person’s breath or blood at the time of the occurrence of a particular event is a single offence regardless of whether the concentration of alcohol concerned is measured by reference to the amount of alcohol present in breath or in blood (or both).”


	
	It can be thus be seen that for the purpose of determining the concentration of alcohol, no distinction is made between results from a breath analysis or blood analysis.
	
	
	Schedule 3 of the Road Transport Act deals with testing for alcohol or drug use. Clause 3 of Division 2 of the Schedule confers power on a police officer to require a driver to submit to a breath test. It is in the following terms:
	


“3   Power to conduct random breath testing

(1) A police officer may require a person to submit to a breath test in accordance with the officer’s directions if the officer has reasonable cause to believe that:

(a)   the person is or was driving a motor vehicle on a road, or

(b)   the person is or was occupying the driving seat of a motor vehicle on a road and attempting to put the motor vehicle in motion, or

(c)   the person (being the holder of an applicable driver licence) is or was occupying the seat in a motor vehicle next to a learner driver while the driver is or was driving the vehicle on a road.

(2) Before requiring a person to submit to a breath test under subclause (1), and for the purpose of determining whether to conduct such a test, a police officer may conduct a preliminary assessment to determine if alcohol is present in the person’s breath by requiring the person to talk into a device that indicates the presence of alcohol.

(3) Without limiting any other power or authority, a police officer may, for the purposes of this clause, request or signal the driver of a motor vehicle to stop the vehicle.

(4) A person must comply with any request or signal made or given to the person by a police officer under subclause (3).

Maximum penalty: 10 penalty units.”


	
	Clause 4(1)(c) of Schedule 3 provides that if it appears to the officer from the breath test carried out under clause 3(1) that there may be present in the person’s breath or blood the low range prescribed concentration of alcohol he may arrest the driver, take him or her to a police station and detain him or her for the purpose of submitting to a breath analysis.
	
	
	Clause 5(1) of Schedule 3 empowers the police officer to require the person arrested to submit to a breath analysis.
	
	
	Clause 16(1)(b) of Schedule 3 makes it an offence to refuse to submit to a breath analysis.
	
	
	As I indicated above, clause 21 entitles a person who is required to submit to a breath analysis to request an authorised person to take a sample of the person’s blood. In the second reading speech to the Motor Traffic (Amendment) Bill 1968 (NSW), which introduced the prescribed concentration of alcohol provisions into one of the Road Transport Act’s predecessors, the Motor Traffic Act 1909 (NSW) (the Motor Traffic Act), this entitlement was described as an important safeguard. However, the second reading speech stated (consistent with the present clause 21) that the taking of a blood sample was not an alternative to a breath analysis.
	
	
	Clause 31 of Schedule 3 is critical to the outcome of the application. It provides as follows:
	


“31   Evidence of alcohol concentration in proceedings for offences against section 110

(1) This clause applies to any proceedings for an offence against section 110 (Presence of prescribed concentration of alcohol in a person’s breath or blood).

(2) Evidence may be given in proceedings to which this clause applies of the concentration of alcohol present in the breath or blood of the person charged as determined by:

(a)   a breath analysing instrument operated by a police officer authorised to do so by the Commissioner of Police, or

   (b)   an analysis of the person’s blood under this Schedule.

(3) In any such proceedings, the concentration of alcohol so determined is taken to be the concentration of alcohol in the person’s breath or blood at the time of the occurrence of the relevant event referred to in clause 3 (1) (a), (b) or (c) if the breath analysis was made, or blood sample taken, within 2 hours after the event unless the defendant proves that the concentration of alcohol in the defendant’s breath or blood at the time concerned was:

(a)   in the case of an offence against section 110 (1) – zero grams of alcohol in 210 litres of breath or 100 millilitres of blood, or

(b)   in the case of an offence against section 110 (2) – less than 0.02 grams of alcohol in 210 litres of breath or 100 millilitres of blood, or

(c)   in the case of an offence against section 110 (3) – less than 0.05 grams of alcohol in 210 litres of breath or 100 millilitres of blood, or

(d)   in the case of an offence against section 110 (4) – less than 0.08 grams of alcohol in 210 litres of breath or 100 millilitres of blood, or

(e)   in the case of an offence against section 110 (5) – less than 0.15 grams of alcohol in 210 litres of breath or 100 millilitres of blood.

(4) Nothing in subclause (3) affects the operation of section 110 (6) and (7).”


	
	Clause 35 is also of relevance. It is in the following terms:
	


“35   Certificate evidence about breath analysing instruments

   (1) This clause applies to any of the following proceedings:

(a)   proceedings for an offence against section 110 (Presence of prescribed concentration of alcohol in person’s breath or blood),

(b)   proceedings for an offence against clause 3 (4), 16 (1) (a) or (b) or 18 (1) (a) or (b).

(2) A certificate purporting to be signed by a police officer certifying the following particulars is admissible in proceedings to which this clause applies and is prima facie evidence of the particulars certified in or by the certificate:

(a)   the officer is authorised by the Commissioner of Police to operate breath analysing instruments,

(b)   a person named in the certificate submitted to a breath analysis,

(c)   the apparatus used by the officer to make the breath analysis was a breath analysing instrument within the meaning of this Act,

(d)   the analysis was made on the day and completed at the time stated in the certificate,

(e)   a concentration of alcohol determined by that breath analysing instrument and expressed in grams of alcohol in 210 litres of breath or 100 millilitres of blood was present in the breath or blood of that person on the day and at the time stated in the certificate,

(f)   a statement in writing required by clause 5 (3) was delivered in accordance with that subclause.

(3) A certificate purporting to be signed by the Commissioner of Police that the police officer named in the certificate is authorised by the Commissioner of Police to operate breath analysing instruments is admissible in proceedings to which this clause applies and is prima facie evidence of the particulars certified in and by the certificate.

(4) Evidence of the condition of a breath analysing instrument, or of the manner in which it was operated, is not required in proceedings to which this clause applies unless evidence sufficient to raise doubt that the instrument was in proper condition and properly operated has been adduced.

The decisions below


	
	At the hearing before the magistrate the respondent tendered a certificate showing the result of the breath analysis. The applicant tendered a certificate showing the result of the blood sample. The magistrate in effect held that each of the breath analysis and the blood sample were entitled to the benefit of the deeming provision in clause 31 and as a consequence of its operation in relation to the blood sample, the defendant was entitled to be acquitted of the charge.
	
	
	The primary judge reached a different conclusion. She pointed out that Schedule 3 of the Road Transport Act is concerned with assisting police to prosecute drivers affected by alcohol and drugs. She highlighted that there was no basis in the statutory wording or otherwise for according greater weight to a blood analysis than to a breath analysis (Supreme Court Judgment at [32]).
	
	
	Her Honour concluded that any potential ambiguity in clause 31(2) was resolved by clause 31(3) which, she stated, provided that the concentration determined by either of the methods identified is the concentration at the time of the event unless the defendant proves that the concentration of alcohol in his or her blood was within the legal limit at the time concerned, namely, when the defendant was driving (at [33]).
	
	
	Her Honour accepted that either of the two analyses could come within the words “the concentration of alcohol so obtained” in clause 31(3) if viewed in isolation. However, she concluded that that construction was inconsistent with the later words “unless the defendant proves”. Her Honour thus determined that a construction which permitted the defendant to rely on the deeming provision could not be reconciled with the existence of the statutory exception (at [34]). She also considered such a construction would be inconsistent with the generally accepted operation of a deeming provision (at [36]).
	
	
	Her Honour accepted the submission that the magistrate’s decision was inconsistent with two earlier decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal, R v West (1974) 3 PSR 1273 (West) and R v Relton (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 28 July 1994, unrep) (Relton).
	


The appeal


	
	The primary argument advanced by the applicant was that the right to a blood test, conferred upon a person who was subject to a breath analysis, operated as a constraint upon conviction resulting from the level of alcohol in a person’s breath as determined by breath analysis exceeding the statutory limit. As was put colloquially by senior counsel for the applicant, the blood test operated as a “third umpire” in determining whether the offence was made out. Although not specifically stated this submission depended upon one of three alternative propositions.
	
	
	The first of these propositions was that in determining whether the relevant level of alcohol exceeded the statutory limit the result of a blood analysis would be preferred to that of a breath analysis. The second proposition was that the deeming provisions operated in respect of both tests, with the result that the onus cast upon the applicant by clause 31(3) of Schedule 3 was satisfied by him tendering the result of the test which provided a reading below the legal limit. The third proposition, ancillary to the second, was that in circumstances where one reading was above the legal limit of alcohol concentration and the other below it, the deeming provision could not be said to establish the offence.
	
	
	Each of these propositions depends on the correct construction of clause 31 of Schedule 3. As the primary judge pointed out, the task of statutory construction begins and ends with the text considered in context including the general purpose and policy of the provisions (Supreme Court Judgment at [31]). Context includes legislative history and extrinsic material so far as it assists in ascertaining the meaning of the statutory text, but such material cannot displace the meaning of the text. Further, objective discernment of the statutory purpose is integral to contextual construction. Such purpose resides in the text and context of the statute. It neither permits nor requires a search for what those who pass the legislation had in mind when they enacted it (Alcan (NT) Alumina Pty Ltd v The Commissioner of Territory Revenue (Northern Territory) [2009] HCA 41; 239 CLR 27 at [47]; Certain Lloyds Underwriters v Cross [2012] HCA 56; 248 CLR 378 at [23]-[24]; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Consolidated Media Holdings [2012] HCA 55; 250 CLR 503 at [39]; Thiess v Collector of Customs [2014] HCA 12; 250 CLR 664 at [22]-[23]).
	
	
	In the present case, clause 31(2) of Schedule 3 provides that evidence of the concentration of alcohol in a person’s breath or blood as determined by a breath analysis or a blood analysis, made in accordance with the legislation, may be given. Contrary to what I have described as the applicant’s first proposition, clause 31(2) gives no primacy to a breath or blood analysis.
	
	
	Clause 31(3) provides that the concentration determined by a breath or blood analysis is taken to be the concentration in the person’s breath or blood at the time the person is required to submit to a breath test under clause 3 of Schedule 3, unless the defendant proves that at that time he or she was below the legal limit. The evidence thus tendered under clause 31(3) operates by virtue of the deeming provision in the sense described by Gleeson CJ in Macquarie Bank Ltd v Fociri Pty Ltd (1992) 27 NSWLR 203 at 207-208, that is, in the nature of a rebuttable presumption, namely that a state of affairs will be presumed unless and until the contrary is proved. Thus in the present case, once the breath analysis was tendered showing a reading above the legal limit, the onus fell on the applicant to demonstrate that he was below that limit at the time he was required to submit to the breath test pursuant to clause 3 of Schedule 3.
	
	
	In seeking to discharge that onus the applicant was entitled by virtue of clause 31(2) to tender the blood analysis. However, this would only prove the concentration of alcohol in his blood at the time the analysis was taken. The applicant was not entitled to the benefit of the “deeming provision” in seeking to prove that the concentration of alcohol was below the legal limit at the time the applicant was required to submit to a breath test. The only operation of the deeming provision is to raise the rebuttable presumption to which I have referred. It has no operation in assisting the applicant to rebut the presumption.
	
	
	It follows that the construction placed on the section by the learned primary judge was, with respect, correct.
	
	
	That construction is consistent with authority on earlier but somewhat similar emanations of the legislation. In West, Street ACJ, with whom Isaacs and Lee JJ agreed, described an equivalent deeming provision in the then s 4E(11) of the Motor Traffic Act  in the following terms (at 1274-1275):
	


“The sub-section is cast in a context in which the concentration of alcohol at the time of the test would be expected to differ from the concentration of alcohol at the time of the offence, the difference flowing, if from nothing else, merely from the passage of time which would necessarily have elapsed between the offence and the time of the test.

In order to avoid what would otherwise be the virtual impossibility of demonstrating the concentration of alcohol at the time of the offence, sub. s. 11 deliberately and expressly deems the result of the test on the breath analysing instrument to disclose what was the concentration of alcohol in the blood of the person at the time of the occurrence of the offence.

This section is cast in language which is plain and the meaning of which is not difficult to discern. There is no warrant for reading down the ordinary significance which is to be attached to a statutory deeming.

The legislature has used the word “deem” in circumstances where uncertainty would inevitably exist and the word is to be given its full significance.

It should be added that the opportunity conferred within the section for a defendant to prove that there was a less concentration of alcohol in his blood does not cut down the ordinary significance to be attached to the statutory deeming earlier in the section.

The early part of the section is absolute and clear in its operation. The concluding part of the section prescribes the circumstances in which the earlier part can be made the subject of an inroad, namely the circumstance in which the defendant proves the concentration of alcohol in his blood was less than that stated.

If the defendant does not prove that, then the statutory deeming will have full force and effect.”


	
	Relton concerned proceedings in which a blood test analysis pursuant to s 4G of the Motor Traffic Act determined the concentration of alcohol in the applicant’s blood to be .078 per 100 millilitres of blood. The applicant called evidence of a subsequent blood analysis of the same sample which disclosed a concentration below the legal limit. Section 4G(8)(1)(a) of the Motor Traffic Act at that time was in the following terms:
	


“In proceedings for an offence under section 4E(1D), (1E), (1F) or (1G) evidence may be given of the concentration of alcohol present in the blood of the person charged, as determined pursuant to an analysis under this section of a portion of a sample of that person’s blood, and the concentration of alcohol so determined shall be deemed to be the concentration of alcohol in the blood of that person at the time of the occurrence of the event referred to in Section 4E (2A), (a), (b) or (c), as the case may be, where the sample of blood was taken within 2 hours after that event, unless the defendant proves that the concentration of alcohol in his blood at the times was:

(a)    in the case of an offence under Section 4E (1E), less than 0.05 grammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of his blood;”


	
	The magistrate who heard the prosecution held the applicant had not discharged the onus cast on him by s 4G(8). An appeal was dismissed. Blanch J, with whom Meagher JA and Abadee J agreed, made the following comments concerning construction of the section:
	


“It is clear that section 4G(8) of the Traffic Act, 1909 is a provision which deems the concentration of alcohol in the blood to be the concentration determined pursuant to the appropriate analysis where the sample was taken within two hours. As was said by Windeyer J. in The Commissioner for Railways v Bain [1965-1965] 112 C.L.R. 246 at 273. “The word “deemed” is of course often used to give an artificial meaning to a word, or to direct how, notwithstanding the true facts some situation should be understood.” The use of this device by the author of the legislation clearly casts an onus upon the defendant to overcome the state of affairs which are then deemed to exist. So much is clearly recognised in section 4G(8) itself which goes on to state “…unless the defendant proves…” otherwise.

The burden of proof cast upon the defendant in such circumstances is one of providing the deemed circumstance did not in fact exist and he must prove that to the satisfaction of the tribunal of fact on the balance of probabilities. This requires that the defendant must assume the burden of proving his case and that burden is not discharged by evidence which does not outweigh the evidence adduced by the Crown. See the discussion of this in Luxton v Vines (1952) 85 C.L.R. 352.

…

In my view it is clear from the provisions of section 4G(8) of the New South Wales Traffic Act that once the conditions precedent are proved by the prosecution, the deeming provision comes into effect to cast an onus on the appellant to prove affirmatively that the concentration of alcohol in the blood was less than the various prescribed limits. In this case the prosecution did prove the conditions precedent and the deeming provision did come into effect. The appellant called evidence which had the effect of contradicting the evidence of blood analysis called by the prosecution but which left the judge in a position where he could not say he preferred the appellant’s evidence to the prosecution evidence. In that situation the appellant failed to discharge the onus cast upon him.”


	
	Further, the construction preferred by the primary judge is consistent with the purpose of the section which, as Street ACJ pointed out, was to facilitate proof of a matter which would otherwise be extremely difficult, if not as his Honour said, impossible to establish.
	
	
	Contrary to what was suggested by the applicant, the right to obtain a blood analysis does operate as a safeguard to a person required to submit to a breath analysis, albeit not to the extent contended for. Two examples may suffice. First, if the blood analysis produced a result radically different to the breath analysis it may raise doubt that the breath analysis instrument was in proper condition and properly operated so as to require evidence of these matters by virtue of clause 35(4) of Schedule 3. Second, if the blood analysis produced a result which could be shown by expert evidence to be inconsistent with a driver being over the legal limit at the relevant time for the purpose of clause 3, the defendant will have discharged the onus cast on him or her. However, the defendant, in relying on the blood analysis in those circumstances, does not have the benefit of the deeming provision in the opening part of clause 31(3).
	


Conclusion


	
	Because the matter is of some general importance leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal dismissed.
	
	
	As to costs, no error of discretion was demonstrated in the decision of the primary judge to order the applicant to pay the respondent’s costs. The applicant having sought leave to appeal, there is no reason he should not be ordered to pay the respondent’s costs in this court.
	
	
	In the circumstances I would make the following orders.
	



	
	Grant the applicant leave to appeal.
	
	
	Order the applicant file a notice of appeal in the form of the draft notice of appeal dated 28 August 2015 within 14 days.
	
	
	Order the appeal be dismissed.
	
	
	Order the appellant pay the respondent’s costs of the appeal.
	



	
	WARD JA: I agree with Bathurst CJ, for the reasons his Honour has given, that leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal dismissed with costs.
	
	
	EMMETT AJA: These proceedings are concerned with the true construction of cl 31 of Schedule 3 to the Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW) (the Road Transport Act). Sch 3 is concerned, relevantly, with testing for alcohol. The specific question at stake in this case concerns the construction of cl 31(3), which deals with evidence of alcohol concentration in proceedings for offences against s 110 of the Road Transport Act. Under s 110(3), a person must not drive a motor vehicle whilst there is present in the person’s breath or blood the low range prescribed concentration of alcohol, being a concentration of 0.05 grams or more, but less than 0.8 grams of alcohol in 210 litres of breath, or 100 millilitres of blood.
	
	
	Clause 31 of Sch 3 provides that, in proceedings for an offence against s 110, evidence may be given of the concentration of alcohol present in the breath or blood of a person, as determined by either a breath analysis or an analysis of the person’s blood. In such proceedings, the concentration of alcohol as so determined is to be taken to be the concentration of alcohol in the person’s breath or blood at a relevant time. However, that provision only applies if the breath analysis was made, or blood sample taken, within two hours after the relevant time. Further, the clause does not operate if the defendant proves that the concentration of alcohol in the defendant’s breath or blood at the time concerned was less than the prescribed concentration.
	
	
	Under cl 3(1)(a) of Sch 3, a police officer may require a person to submit to a breath test if the police officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person is or was driving a motor vehicle on a road. Under cl 4 (1-2) of the Schedule, if it appears to the police officer that the device by means of which the breath test was carried out indicates that there may be present in the person’s breath or blood a relevant concentration of alcohol likely to constitute an offence under the Road Transport Act, the police officer may arrest the person without warrant, take the person to a police station and detain the person for the purposes of submitting to a breath analysis. Under cl 5, the arresting officer may subsequently require the detainee to submit to a breath analysis. Clause 21 of Sch 3 provides that a person who is required to submit to a breath analysis may request the police officer to arrange for an authorised sample taker to take a sample of the person’s blood for analysis in accordance with Pt 4 of Sch 3.
	
	
	At about 9.00am on 19 April 2014, Mr Thomas Bignill was driving a motor vehicle in Neutral Bay. A police officer stopped Mr Bignill and required him to submit to a breath test under cl 3 of the Schedule. Mr Bignill was arrested and taken to North Sydney Police Station, where he submitted to a breath analysis at 9.26am. Under cl 35 of Sch 3 of the Road Transport Act, the police officer certified that the concentration of alcohol in the breath of Mr Bignill was 0.054 grams of alcohol in 210 litres of breath (the Breath Analysis Certificate).
	
	
	Mr Bignill made a request for a sample of his blood to be taken. Arrangements were made for an authorised sample taker to take a sample of his blood and a sample was taken. Subsequently, an analyst certified, under cl 36 of Sch 3, that alcohol was found to be present in the sample at a concentration of 0.049 grams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood (the Blood Analysis Certificate).
	
	
	Mr Bignill was then charged with an offence under s 110 of the Road Transport Act and appeared at the Local Court to answer the charge. At the hearing, the prosecutor tendered the Breath Analysis Certificate. Mr Bignill tendered the Blood Analysis Certificate. The Local Court dismissed the charge.
	
	
	By summons filed on 17 December 2014, the Director of Public Prosecutions appealed to the Supreme Court under s 56(1)(c) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW). A judge of the Common Law Division (the primary judge) allowed the appeal, set aside the order of the Local Court dismissing the charge against Mr Bignill, and remitted the matter to the Local Court to be dealt with according to law. By summons filed on 28 August 2015, Mr Bignill seeks leave to appeal to this Court from the orders made by the primary judge. Directions have been given that the appeal, if leave is given, be heard concurrently with the application for leave to appeal.
	
	
	The primary judge concluded that, in providing that the concentration of alcohol determined by a breath analysis or an analysis of a person’s blood is taken to be the concentration of alcohol at a relevant time, cl 31(3) operates only for the benefit of the prosecution. The tender by Mr Bignill of the Blood Analysis Certificate did not attract the presumption of cl 31(3). To avoid the operation of cl 31(3), Mr Bignill had the onus of proving positively that the concentration of alcohol in his breath or blood at the relevant time was less than the prescribed concentration. The Blood Analysis Certificate did not discharge that onus since the level of concentration in that certificate could clearly be explained by the further delay after the breath analysis was carried out. Her Honour’s construction of cl 31(3) is correct.
	
	
	I have had the advantage of reading in draft form the proposed reasons of the Chief Justice for concluding that leave should be granted, but that the appeal should be dismissed. I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Justice for the reasons proposed by him.
	


 

NOTE:  It should be noted that the reference in par [27] of the judgment of the Chief Justice ""at the time the person is required to submit to a breath test under clause 3 of Schedule 3"" is referring to the time of the relevant event referred to in clause 3 1(a), (b) or (c) of clause 3 of Schedule 3.

		25 October 2016",2016-02-15 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2702102,R v Jackson [2016] NSWDC 134,"Sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: For many years the Court of Criminal Appeal has made one thing very clear as far as drug dealers are concerned: those who are trafficking to a substantial degree must go to gaol full-time unless there are exceptional circumstances. The Court has also emphasised how limited findings of exceptional circumstances should be.
	
	
	I have no doubt that Mr Jackson, who appears for sentence today, was trafficking to a substantial degree despite his false protestations in evidence before me. He told a lie to the author of the pre-sentence report, he says, because he wanted the best outcome for himself. I am satisfied that he lied to me in his evidence today as to the extent of his drug dealing activities. I have no doubt at all that he was intending to make a substantial profit out of selling the pills that he was found in possession of.
	
	
	Matters came to the attention of police when he was stopped at a random breath testing operation. Things did not start well for him that night because he had been drinking despite being on his Ps. He told police he would be over zero. That proved to be correct. Police discovered some unrestrained passengers in his vehicle too. He was dealt with in the Local Court for his drink driving matter and carrying those two unrestrained passengers at a later date. But having been stopped by police, he was then searched before he was put into the caged police vehicle.
	
	
	This is where things went rapidly downhill for Mr Jackson because in his right pants pocket police found six small zip-lock bags of the type that drug dealers use. They also found a substantial amount of money in his wallet, $735. Police asked him whether there were any illegal substances in the vehicle. He said, “Yeah, you’ll find some pills on the floor of the car.” Police then did search the car. They found an M&Ms lolly container between the driver’s seat and the centre console which contained within it 42 small green tablets. These proved to be ecstasy. Police also found a brown paper bag which contained several more re-sealable bags, alcohol wipes and 15 syringes in the same location.
	
	
	It is apparent that the offender, as well as being in possession of drugs for the purpose of supply, was also planning to take steroids, something he said to me in evidence today. I will get back to this later, but for a person who gets such glowing reports and references from friends and family, to be drink driving, carrying unrestrained passengers, intending to illegally take steroids and to sell drugs for the purposes of profit really calls into question whether Mr Jackson is of the character that his family and friends say that he is.
	
	
	Police asked him what the pills were. He said “ecstasy” and he told them that he had sold them for $20 each. He said he was unable to tell police how many pills he had sold throughout the evening. In evidence today he admitted that was not true. This was a bit of a consistent feature of Mr Jackson’s behaviour; telling lies because he wants to make things better for himself.
	
	
	Up until his arrest, on 9 May 2015, Mr Jackson was of otherwise good character. He had no criminal offences and was at that stage working as an apprentice formwork carpenter. He has now completed his apprenticeship and works six days a week. He is supported by family and friends despite the obvious distress that he has caused to them through his seriously illegal behaviour. His working history is good, a matter for which he is to be commended. He has completed his apprenticeship and works six days a week. He did have a break when he broke his ankle, but has now returned to full-time work.
	
	
	Perhaps not surprisingly, after his arrest he has become anxious and depressed. He is concerned about what will happen to him today. I gather that he has a realistic expectation that he will go to gaol. It is not at all unusual for people who have done the wrong thing to become depressed at the prospect of them being punished appropriately for what they have done.
	
	
	He has expressed his remorse in evidence today, but it is notable that he did not express remorse for having done the wrong thing, because it was against the law and caused serious harm to others. The only remorse he expressed was because his family had been affected and so had he. Remorse involves taking responsibility for a person’s misconduct. Mr Jackson did not do that.
	
	
	I will explain why I have made a finding of fact that it was Mr Jackson’s intention to make a substantial profit out of selling these pills. He had at least seven or perhaps eight re-sealable plastic bags. It is a shame that we do not know how many re-sealable plastic bags there were in the brown bag found by police, but that is entirely consistent with Mr Jackson being the sort of person who was intending to sell, on multiple occasions, the ecstasy pills he had in his possession.
	
	
	He gave evidence before me that he had bought 60 pills for $1,000. At first he said it was on the spur of the moment, but we later learnt that having had the offer made to him, he actually had to go to the ATM and withdraw $1,000 and then go back to the supplier to buy the pills. I have no hesitation at all in rejecting the idea that he was going to take a substantial part of those pills personally himself. Sixty pills are a lot of pills. As well as that there was the cash with which he was found in possession. So he was trafficking to a substantial degree. He supplied that night. He intended to supply in the future.
	
	
	This was far from a single incident of supply which, and this is one thing he did tell the pre-sentence report author which was accurate, he did for financial gain. So I have to sentence a man who was prepared to sell drugs to make money out of it. He was prepared to risk the harm - risk harming people who consume drugs just so he could make money. That is why I have begun to question whether Mr Jackson really is of the character that other people say he is.
	
	
	As I began these remarks on sentence, the Court of Criminal Appeal has said that those trafficking to a substantial degree must go to gaol full-time. One matter which the Court has not yet addressed concerns the impact on that rule of the introduction of intensive corrections orders as an alternative to full-time imprisonment. Many judges, including appellate judges, have recognised that the Court of Criminal Appeal may need to say one way or the other whether that rule needs to be modified now that ICOs are an available sentencing option. Certainly at the time the rule was first formulated and then repeatedly recognised, no ICOs were available. ICOs represent a significant impediment to a person’s liberty, but to say that they are in any way a form of punishment approaching the seriousness of full-time imprisonment is completely wrong.
	
	
	Mr Byrnes, who appears for the offender, submits that I would impose either an ICO or suspended sentence of imprisonment. That, of course, carries with it the concession that imprisonment is required and the implication that I would be considering a sentence of two years’ imprisonment or less. If, of course, I am considering imprisonment for a greater period, then there is no alternative to full-time imprisonment and Mr Jackson must go to gaol today.
	
	
	I have considered Mr Jackson’s behaviour since his arrest. He does appear to have become rather anxious at the prospect of being sent to gaol and as a result seems to have made efforts to minimise the chances of that happening. I suspect his motivation is, as he has said before, to get the best outcome for himself, but it has to be recognised that by seeking counselling and by, as he says, giving up drug use including the drug cannabis, he has set himself up well to rehabilitate himself and so it is to be hoped and it may well prove to be the case that this offence and the other offences he committed that night might be isolated breaches of the criminal law as far as Mr Jackson is concerned.
	
	
	It would, of course, have been better had Mr Jackson been frank with people who have dealt with this matter. It would have been better if he was frank with police about how many pills he had sold that night. It would have been better if he had been frank with the author of the pre-sentence report and, perhaps most importantly, it would have been better if he had been completely honest when he gave evidence today. Mr Jackson’s intention to misrepresent the situation because he just wanted the best outcome for himself may well have seriously backfired for him.
	
	
	The question becomes whether Mr Jackson needs to go to gaol full-time. I have given anxious consideration to that case. I am satisfied that a sentence of two years or less is appropriate and so sentencing options such as an ICO and a suspended sentence are available. The matter is finely balanced. No-one would criticise me for sending Mr Jackson to gaol immediately. The harm that drugs cause to the community is immeasurable and the harm that drug dealers profit from needs to be reflected in a sentence imposed on a drug dealer like Mr Jackson.
	
	
	On the other hand, as I said, his rehabilitation looks promising. I am satisfied that I will give consideration to imposing a sentence of imprisonment on Mr Jackson which he can serve by means of an intensive corrections order. I will therefore continue his bail, refer him for assessment as to his suitability to serve a sentence of imprisonment by means of an ICO and list the matter before me in Sydney on a date that I will discuss with the lawyers.

		13 July 2016",2016-02-11 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2702105,McCabe v R [2016] NSWCCA 7,"Judgment


	
	MEAGHER JA: I agree with Bellew J.
	
	
	ROTHMAN J: I agree with Bellew J.
	
	
	BELLEW J: On 30 October 2014 Shane McCabe (“the applicant”) pleaded guilty in the Local Court to an offence of break enter and steal contrary to s 112(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. He was committed to the District Court for sentence.
	
	
	On 17 February 2015 the applicant was sentenced in the District Court to a non-parole period of 2½ years imprisonment to date from 20 November 2014 with an additional term of 2 years imprisonment commencing on 20 May 2017. In imposing that sentence, the sentencing judge applied a discount of 25% to reflect the applicant’s plea of guilty, and made a finding of special circumstances in accordance with s. 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) 1999 (“the Sentencing Act”).
	
	
	By notice dated 17 August 2015 the applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on the grounds that:
	



	
	the sentencing judge erred by taking into account the applicant’s criminal history when assessing the objective seriousness of the offence; and
	
	
	the sentence is manifestly excessive.
	


THE FACTS


	
	The sentencing judge found the facts to be as follows.
	
	
	On 12 June 2014 the applicant was on bail for a number of offences including common assault, dishonestly obtaining property by deception, larceny, shoplifting, break enter and steal and supplying a prohibited drug. On that day he went to a unit block in Harris Park. The occupiers of one of the units in the block secured their premises before leaving at about 10.45 am. After they had left, the applicant smashed the kitchen window and gained access to the premises. A neighbour heard the smashing of the glass and immediately contacted the police.
	
	
	The police went to the premises where they saw the applicant leaving the unit block through a security door. When confronted by police, the applicant gave an untruthful account of why he was there. Police searched a backpack which was in his possession. Items belonging to occupiers of the premises, valued at approximately $1,000.00, were found. The applicant admitted to police that he had taken the items in order to obtain money. There was no evidence that the premises had been ransacked. All of the items were ultimately returned to the owners.
	


GROUND 1 – HIS HONOUR ERRED BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE APPLICANT’S CRIMINAL HISTORY WHEN ASSESSING THE OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENCE

The findings of the sentencing judge


	
	Having set out the facts of the offending, the sentencing judge said (at ROS 2):
	


“This is not the first offence by this offender, nor is it the first offence of this kind. Including a prior offence of entering a dwelling with intent to steal, it is the ninth offence of the kind of break and enter – and as I say, there are many other offences. The question is whether this should be regarded as a Veen 2 situation. For reasons I shall develop, I have concluded that it would be inappropriate to regard it as a Veen 2 situation.

I do, however, regard the offence as being slightly below the mid-range of objective seriousness by taking into account that past criminal history” (emphasis added).

Submissions of the applicant


	
	Counsel for the applicant, whilst accepting that a prior history of similar offending was a relevant consideration on sentence, submitted that the principle of proportionality required the sentencing judge to set the upper limit of the sentence by reference to the objective seriousness of the offence. It was submitted that by taking into account the applicant’s criminal history in determining such objective seriousness, the sentencing judge had erred.
	
	
	In advancing that submission, counsel for the applicant drew attention to the fact that both parties had submitted to the sentencing judge that the objective seriousness of the offending fell below the mid-range. It was submitted that against this background, and quite apart from the express terms of what the sentencing judge said, the conclusion that the objective seriousness of the offending fell only “slightly” below that range was a further indication that the applicant’s prior criminal history had been taken into account in an impermissible way.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that the applicant’s criminal history was a matter which was highly relevant to the exercise of the sentencing discretion. The Crown also relied upon the conduct of the proceedings before the sentencing judge, and pointed out that neither party had submitted that the applicant’s criminal history was relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending. It was submitted that the finding of the sentencing judge that the offence was slightly below the mid-range was broadly consistent with the submissions advanced by the parties.
	
	
	The Crown also emphasised the reference made by the sentencing judge to the decision in Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465. It was submitted that it would be “somewhat unusual” for his Honour to have expressly referred to the decision in Veen No 2, only then to approach the sentencing of the applicant in a manner which was not consistent with that decision. The Crown further submitted that when the sentencing remarks were read as a whole, it was evident that the sentencing judge had applied his focus to all relevant considerations.
	
	
	Finally, the Crown drew attention to the fact that the sentencing remarks were delivered ex tempore, immediately following evidence and submissions. It was submitted that in these circumstances it was inappropriate to parse, and minutely analyse, what had been said by the sentencing judge.
	


Consideration


	
	The principle of proportionality requires that the upper boundary of a proportionate sentence be set by the objective circumstances of the offence: Veen v The Queen (No 2) (supra); Baumer v The Queen [1988] HCA 67; (1988) 166 CLR 51. Those objective circumstances do not encompass an offender’s prior convictions: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at [24] per Spigelman CJ and at [81] per Barr and Bell JJ.
	
	
	In the present case, the sentencing judge made express reference to the decision in Veen (No 2). He concluded that it “would be inappropriate to regard [the present case] as a Veen 2 situation” and stated that he would develop his reasons for reaching that conclusion. However on a fair reading of the sentencing remarks, the issue was not revisited.
	
	
	Immediately following the reference to Veen (No 2) the sentencing judge concluded that the offending was “slightly below the mid-range of objective seriousness”. On a plain reading of his Honour’s remarks, he reached that conclusion “by taking into account (the applicant’s) past criminal history”.
	
	
	On a number of occasions this Court has cautioned against parsing, and finely analysing, sentencing remarks which are delivered ex tempore: see for example McNaughton (supra) at [48] per Spigelman CJ; Warner v R [2013] NSWCCA 10 at [33] per Campbell J (Hoeben JA and Davies J agreeing); Gommesen v R [2012] NSWCCA 226; 62 MVR 196 at [37] – [38] per Garling J (McClellan CJ at CL and McCallum J agreeing). However in the present case, the remarks were revised by the sentencing judge. So much is clear from the note (at ROS 6) which records that a draft of the remarks “was received …. and revised….”. In these circumstances, I am left to conclude that the revised remarks represent what his Honour in fact said, and meant, when imposing sentence.
	
	
	I have had regard to the Crown’s submission as to the adoption, by the sentencing judge, of an approach which was contrary to the authority he expressly cited. However, acceptance of that submission would require this Court to ignore the plain language used by the sentencing judge, and to then substitute the word “before” for the word “by” in the second paragraph of the extract of the sentencing remarks set out in [9] above.
	
	
	Conceivably there could be cases where, notwithstanding what appears in the sentencing remarks, it is obvious that a slip has occurred which requires those remarks to be read and interpreted in a way which might appear to be contrary to the express language adopted. However the present is not such a case. There is nothing to suggest a slip. The sentencing remarks were revised and effect must be given to the plain language which was used. There is no warrant in the present case for substituting one word for another.
	
	
	In all of these circumstances I am left to conclude that the sentencing judge took the applicant’s criminal history into account when assessing the objective seriousness of the offence. Reaching that conclusion involves no element of parsing, or over analysing, the remarks on sentence. It involves nothing more than ascribing the only available meaning to what the sentencing judge plainly said. In taking the applicant’s criminal history into account as he did, the sentencing judge erred.
	
	
	In reaching that conclusion, I am fortified firstly by the circumstances surrounding the offending, and secondly by the manner in which the case was conducted by the parties before the sentencing judge. Viewed objectively, the circumstances of the offending were unremarkable. The applicant’s conduct was typical of this kind of offending. Consistent with those factors, both parties submitted to the sentencing judge that the offending was below the mid-range. There was no aspect of the objective circumstances of the offending which supported the finding of the sentencing judge that it fell only “slightly” below the mid-range. That finding is consistent with some other factor having been taken into account in a way which increased the level of the objective seriousness of the offending beyond that which was submitted by both parties.
	
	
	For all of these reasons, this ground is made out.
	


GROUND 2 – THE SENTENCE IS MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE

The approach of this Court


	
	Having found error, the provisions of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) apply. In these circumstances, it is not incumbent upon the applicant to demonstrate that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. It is the duty of this Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 601 at [42] – [43] per French CJ, Hayne, Bell and Keane JJ.
	


The evidence


	
	Dr Jonathon Adams, Forensic Psychiatrist, examined the applicant on 11 February 2015. Dr Adams noted (at p. 2 and following) that the applicant commenced to have concerns about his emotional state in his early teenage years. He also noted the applicant’s previous episodes of self-harm and attempted suicide, the first of which occurred at 16 years of age. There had been 10 suicide attempts in total.
	
	
	Dr Adams reported that the applicant had described experiencing symptoms suggestive of a psychosis from the age of 15 years. He also noted the applicant’s history of abuse of drugs and alcohol, as well as the fact that he had been to psychiatric hospitals on several occasions since that time, usually in a disturbed state, and experiencing psychotic features.
	
	
	Ultimately, in terms of the applicant’s mental health, Dr Adams expressed the following opinion:
	


“It is apparent that Mr McCabe has experienced symptoms of psychosis in the context of illicit substance use, hence the diagnosis of substance-induced psychosis in the collateral material reviewed. Given his history of significant emotional instability, I would question the possibility of an underlying bipolar affective disorder as well as a schizoaffective disorder. Longitudinal assessment and review of additional collateral sources of information would be of benefit in clarifying these diagnostic issues.

Commenting definitively upon Mr McCabe’s mental state at the material time of the break and enter offence in June 2014 is difficult, given his inability to recall his presentation at the material time. From a psychiatric perspective his inability to recall his mental health at around this time is plausible, given his reported use of illicit substances and worsening features suggestive of psychosis. If his account is accurate, in my opinion it is reasonable to suggest that Mr McCabe’s likely symptoms of psychosis and methamphetamine dependence would have impacted upon his decision-making capacity and rational thought processes at around this time”.


	
	Dr Adams reported that the applicant had described an improved state of mental health since being taken into custody, in the context of reported compliance with psychiatric medication and abstinence from the abuse of illicit substances. He concluded that the applicant was presently free of symptoms of a major mental illness and that he manifested a reasonable level of insight into his difficulties with substance abuse, mental illness, and repeated offending behaviour.
	
	
	In terms of the future, Dr Adams concluded that the applicant would require “assertive input” from mental health, drug and alcohol, and social services upon his release from custody, so as to increase his chances of stability. He agreed with the view expressed by the applicant that a period of residential drug and alcohol rehabilitation would be of benefit. He said that this should occur simultaneously with monitoring by mental health services, continuing prescription of psychiatric medication, and ongoing psychological therapy in order to address issues of emotional regulation, adaptive coping strategies, and the avoidance of offending behaviour.
	
	
	Dr Adams concluded:
	


“In my opinion if Mr McCabe engaged with the above management strategies positively, it is reasonable to conclude that these strategies will mitigate Mr McCabe’s risk of reoffending.

Whilst Mr McCabe remains incarcerated he would benefit from engaging in the above management strategies, if available.

With regards the duration of Mr McCabe’s treatment upon his release from custody I believe he should remain in engaged for a significant period, for a matter of years, given the chronology of his clinical presentation thus far”.


	
	A pre-sentence report is also before the Court which documents the applicant’s personal history in terms which are generally consistent with those outlined by Dr Adams. The author of that report expressed the view that the applicant “showed little insight into his offending behaviour”.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence before the sentencing judge in which he acknowledged the necessity to undertake, and adhere to, a rehabilitation program upon his eventual release from custody. Whilst the applicant acknowledged (commencing at T7 L5) that there had been several unsuccessful attempts at rehabilitation in the past, he gave the following evidence (commencing at T7 L25):
	


Q.   When you get out of custody, what do you want to do?

A.   I want to go back to work, like trying to start up a family by the time I’m 40.

Q.   In relation to what sort of help do you think you’ll need to be able to do those things?

A.   See the psychiatrist and probably try to go back to rehab again.

Q.   Why do you say you think you need to go back to rehab again?

A.   Because I need help with my drug offending, my drugs.

Q.   Is it fair to say that you have committed this break and enter in relation to feed a drug habit?

A.   Yeah.

Q.   What do you – can you say to his Honour about whether anything will be anything different to the previous times when you’ve been on parole if you – when you eventually get out this time?

A.   My family’s taking me back on again, I’m living with my Mum, I get one more chance, she’s just going to stick by me this time, if it doesn’t work I haven’t got a family any more like last time.

…


	
	The applicant was then asked (commencing at T8 L6):
	


Q.   In relation to – the report talks about you saying certain things to Dr Adams about how you felt about your offending, can you tell the Court how you feel about what occurred in relation to break enter and steal that his Honour is sentencing you today for?

A.   I have never thought about it but I thought about it as I’ve been in gaol this time that it must be terrifying for the people in the house, me breaking in there and upsetting.

Q.   You have been, in the last 10 years it would be fair to say you’ve been in custody longer than you’ve been out of custody?

A.   Yeah.

Q.   Is there anything you think in terms of your future that will change that from happening again?

A.   I’m going to try and see if I can see, I forget what it’s called, people who come out and see me for my mental health problems, Justice Health.

Q.   What about medical treatment?

A.   I’m going to stay on my medication this time because when I started on medication I can’t feel the drugs anyway. It doesn’t work, so I’m going to try and stay on my medication this time.


	
	The applicant’s criminal history is before the Court. It is frankly appalling and contains a multiplicity of entries for offending of a similar kind.
	


Consideration


	
	In my view, the objective seriousness of the offending is below the mid-range, albeit not at the lowest level. In terms of the factors contained in s 21A of the Sentencing Act, the following matters are relevant.
	
	
	Clearly, the applicant has a record of previous convictions, many of which are of a similar kind. That is an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(d).
	
	
	Notwithstanding the observations in the pre-sentence report, I am satisfied on the basis of the evidence given by the applicant before the sentencing judge (which was not challenged) that he has shown remorse for his offending. That is a mitigating factor under s 21A(3)(i).
	
	
	The applicant pleaded guilty to the offence in the Local Court. That is a mitigating factor under s 21A(3)(k). He is entitled to a discount of 25% to reflect the utilitarian value of that plea.
	
	
	Assessing the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation is obviously problematic in light of his criminal history. On his own admission, the applicant has had opportunities in the past to address his abuse of illicit drugs, and the relationship between that abuse and his repeated offending. He has not made good use of those opportunities. In light of this history it is necessary to adopt a cautious approach to assessing his expressed intention to undergo rehabilitation when eventually he is released from custody.
	
	
	Rehabilitative measures will obviously be available to the applicant. The effect of Dr Adams’ conclusions is that the applicant is capable of being rehabilitated. Whether this is successfully achieved will necessarily depend, in large measure, upon whether the applicant is genuinely willing to make the most of any opportunity he might be given and, importantly, to adhere to a program of the kind to which Dr Adams referred. Whilst I have taken into account the applicant’s expressed willingness to do so, his background is such that I am left to conclude that his prospects of rehabilitation are guarded.
	
	
	In light of the opinion of Dr Adams, the applicant clearly has a mental illness. The principles applicable to the sentencing of mentally ill offenders were outlined by McClellan CJ at CL in DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 commencing at [177]. Those principles include the following:
	



	
	where the state of an offender’s mental health contributes to the commission of an offence in a material way, his or her moral culpability may be reduced;
	
	
	as a consequence of the circumstances in (i), the need to denounce the crime may be lessened and reflected in a reduction in the sentence;
	
	
	the state of an offender’s mental health may also have the consequence that he or she is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence, resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed;
	
	
	an offender’s mental health may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on him or her and accordingly, because the sentence will be more onerous, the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be less severe; and
	
	
	an offender’s mental illness may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence.
	



	
	In view of Dr Adams’ opinion, the applicant’s moral culpability is reduced as a consequence of the causal nexus between his mental state and his offending. Further, and because of his mental state, the applicant is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence. Those matters operate to reduce the sentence which might otherwise be appropriate.
	
	
	In Re Attorney General’s Application [No 1] under s 26 of the Criminal Procedure Act; R v Ponfield & Ors [1999] NSWCCA 435; (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 Grove J (with whom Spigelman CJ and Sully J agreed) concluded (at [48]) that a court should regard the seriousness of an offence contrary to s 112(1) as being enhanced, and should reflect that enhanced seriousness in the quantum of sentence imposed, if any of the following factors are present:
	



	
	the offence is committed whilst the offender is at conditional liberty on bail or on parole;
	
	
	the offence is the result of professional planning, organisation and execution;
	
	
	the offender has a prior record, particularly for like offences;
	
	
	the offence is committed at premises of the elderly, the sick or the disabled;
	
	
	the offence is accompanied by vandalism or by any other significant damage to property;
	
	
	the offence is committed on multiple occasions;
	
	
	the offence is committed in a series of repeat incursions into the same premises;
	
	
	the stolen property is valuable to the victim, whether that value is measured in terms of money or in terms of sentimental value;
	
	
	the offence was committed at a time when, absent specific knowledge on the part of the offender, it was likely that the premises would be occupied, particularly at night;
	
	
	there was actual trauma suffered by the victim; and
	
	
	force was used or threatened (other than by means of an offensive weapon or instrument).
	



	
	Grove J observed that if more than one of those circumstances was present there would be a cumulative effect to be reflected in any sentence imposed. However his Honour also stressed (at [49]):
	


“It will of course be requisite for a sentencing court to give appropriate weight to matters in mitigation as manifest in the particular case. These will include evidence of genuine regret and remorse and any rehabilitative steps taken by the offender. Whilst addiction to drugs and alcohol is a relevant circumstance for the Court to consider it is not of itself a mitigating factor; see R v Henry [(1999) 46 NSWLR 246] (at 384 [193]-[203] and 387 [217]-[259]).


	
	In the present case, the factors in [43](i) and (iii) above are present. Balanced against those matters however, must be the various subjective considerations to which I have referred, not the least of which is the applicant’s mental illness.
	
	
	In the event that this Court came to re-sentence the applicant, the Crown relied upon an affidavit of Meagan Betteridge, Solicitor, of 19 October 2015. That affidavit annexes documents provided by the Department of Corrective Services in relation to an incident in August this year when the applicant was found in possession of a syringe. The applicant pleaded guilty to a disciplinary offence and was prohibited from having any contact visits for a period of 28 days.
	
	
	With the Court’s leave, the applicant filed two affidavits in response, one from himself dated 6 November 2015, and the other from his Solicitor, Alexandra Heffernan, dated 5 November 2015. In his affidavit, the applicant explained the circumstances surrounding the disciplinary breach. He also expressed positive sentiments about his future. The affidavit of Ms Heffernan annexes various case notes obtained from the Department of Corrective Services regarding the applicant’s behaviour in custody.
	
	
	In my view, the applicant’s disciplinary breach is of relatively little moment. Of more significance are the case notes attached to Ms Heffernan’s affidavit, which variously refer to there being “no issues” as to any aspect of the applicant’s incarceration. They also refer to the applicant consistently presenting in a stable mental state. Significantly, at an interview conducted with the applicant on 20 August last, it was noted that the applicant was “well behaved at all times”, that there were “nil issues” and that he had “no thoughts of self-harm”. On the whole of the evidence, the disciplinary breach appears to be something of an aberration.
	


CONCLUSION


	
	In my view, the appropriate starting point is a sentence of 4 years and 6 months imprisonment, to which a discount of 25% should be applied to reflect the utilitarian value of the applicant’s plea of guilty. That reduces the sentence to one of 3 years and 4 months imprisonment.
	
	
	I am satisfied that there should be a finding of special circumstances in the present case. In reaching that conclusion I have taken into account the evidence of the applicant, and the opinion of Dr Adams, as to the question of rehabilitation. In applying the finding of special circumstances to the sentence that I consider appropriate, I have adopted the same ratio as between the non-parole period and the head sentence as that adopted by the sentencing judge, namely 55%.
	


ORDERS


	
	For all of these reasons I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal is granted.
	
	
	The appeal is allowed.
	
	
	The sentence imposed upon the applicant in the District Court on 17 February 2015 is quashed.
	
	
	In lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 1 year and 10 months imprisonment commencing on 20 November 2014 and expiring on 19 September 2016 with a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months commencing on 20 September 2016 expiring on 19 March 2018.
	
	
	The total sentence is one of 3 years and 4 months imprisonment.

2702108,Alkhair v R [2016] NSWCCA 4,"Judgment


	
	MACFARLAN JA: Following a trial in the District Court before a judge and jury, the applicant, Mr Adnan Alkhair, was convicted of an offence, contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), of breaking and entering a dwelling- house in Alexandria, Sydney, and committing a serious indictable offence therein, namely stealing a number of items in circumstances of aggravation, being his presence in company with Mr Michael Hanna. The applicant was subsequently sentenced to 4 years imprisonment, with a 3 year non-parole period.
	
	
	He seeks to appeal against his conviction and sentence on the grounds outlined below. As none of the points he now makes in relation to his conviction were made at his trial, he requires leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW) to advance them to the extent that they raise questions of law. To the extent that they raise questions of fact, he requires leave under s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). He also requires leave under that section to appeal against his sentence.
	
	
	The subject dwelling-house is a ground floor unit with its main entrance located in an internal hallway. The unit has a small patio with a low wall and a metal fence on top that encloses the patio from the street. A sliding door and window with glass louver panels separates the inside of the unit from the patio. If removed, the louvers allow access through the window into the unit.
	
	
	On 2 October 2012 the unit’s residents left for work after locking and securing the premises. When they returned that evening they observed that the front door was slightly ajar and items appeared to have been stolen. A number of the glass louvers had been removed from the window and left in the patio. The residents phoned the police who later identified the applicant’s fingerprints on all but one of the louvers that had been removed. Mr Hanna’s fingerprints were also found on some of the louvers.
	
	
	At the trial, the Crown tendered the transcript of a police interview of the applicant (the “ERISP”). In it, the applicant said that he regularly injected heroin and that on a number of occasions he and others had entered the outside areas of premises, including in Alexandria, in order to use drugs out of public sight. He repeatedly asserted that he had never broken into a house, although he said that he had robbed banks. He also said that it was possible that he had gone to the premises to take drugs on the patio and that his fingerprints may have come to be on the glass louvers as a result of him putting his hands on them to open them and see whether anyone who might disturb them was inside. At the commencement of the interview he said that he had been employed in cement rendering work in the “inner city” of Sydney.
	
	
	In response to the applicant’s counsel’s objections, all references to drug taking and other criminality were removed from the ERISP prior to its admission into evidence. This occurred partly as a result of concessions by the Crown and partly as a result of the trial judge’s rulings.
	
	
	Although the Crown indicated to the Court, in the absence of the jury, that it would call Mr Hanna to give evidence, it did not do so. The applicant did not give evidence nor call any other evidence.
	
	
	In his address to the jury, the applicant’s counsel contended that in his ERISP the applicant had given a plausible reason, other than involvement in breaking and entering, for his fingerprints being on the window louvers. That was that the applicant might have put them there when working as a cement renderer in the “inner city”, which counsel suggested to the jury may include Alexandria. Counsel referred to evidence of renovations occurring at the unit and said that the Crown had not sought to explain who did the renovations and when. Counsel added that the photographs in evidence showed rendered brick work at the premises. On the basis of these and other matters, counsel contended that the jury could not be satisfied that the Crown had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The grounds, to which I shall refer in detail below, upon which the applicant seeks leave to have his conviction quashed include challenges to the admission of the ERISP into evidence and assertions that his rights to give evidence and to call witnesses, in particular Mr Hanna, were denied.
	
	
	For the reasons that appear below, I consider that none of the applicant’s grounds have any merit and that his appeal should be dismissed.
	
	
	In support of his application to this Court, the applicant swore to the correctness of the contents of an unwitnessed affidavit which included the following:
	


“22.   Three days before my trial I met my barrister Marcus Jahasz. He advised me there will be legal arguments before the trial. I asked him to have my ERISP thrown out as I was under the influence of heroin.

23.   My barrister told me ‘there is a part of your interview where you say you’re a Cement renderer and I need it left in.’ I could not understand why he would keep my statement just because I said I was a cement renderer.

24.   My barrister also said ‘I don’t want you on the stand as the prosecutor will tear you apart.’ I said ‘well how else will the jury hear my defence.’ He replied ‘there is too much doubt, leave the onus on them.’

25.   My solicitor Thelma Gray said ‘I’m going to bring you a paper to sign, stating you are happy with how we are running your case.’ This was never spoken of again.

26.   When the trial commenced I observed my Record of Interview being altered to delete any reference to drugs and gaol. I was disturbed that my defence, my version of events, which I was using drugs at the property had been eraced from the interview. I attempted to raise the matter with my solicitor and barrister but was ignored.

27.   My solicitor gave me a pen and paper and told me if I wanted to say something to write it down but these notes were also ignored.

28.   My barrister told [me] a police officer had told him that she and owner of the property replaced louvers into their frame prior to forensics dusting them for prints.

29.   When my barrister asked her questions she provided different answers. At one point my barrister said ‘she’s lying, Your Honour’. The jury was excused and after argument the jury returned and this line of questioning was not pursued.

30.   When the Crown said they would not be calling Michael Hanna I was shocked when my barrister said we were not calling him either. I said to him ‘why don’t you call him up?’ He replied ‘I don’t want to put Him on the spot.’ Then turned his back on me.

31.   I understand Michael Hanna has since died.

32.   I said to my barrister ‘I want to give evidence’. But this request was ignored.

33.   When the Judge began his summing up he came upon the part of my edited ERISP that says ‘I put my hands on the window to see if somebody was home.’ This had been left in with no explanation as to why. I was beside myself by then. I had had enough. I felt my trial was a nightmare. I felt that I had been gagged long enough and it was to my detriment. I had a massive panic attack as I thought, ‘if my lawyer won’t speak for me then I will speak for myself.’

34.   I jumped to my feet and spoke directly to the Judge. ‘If you’re gonna tell them (the jury) tell them the truth, enough lies!. If I was a Juror and I heard someone say what you’re saying that I said, I’d find them guilty! My interview is so edited!’ The Judge said, ‘sit down.’

I said, ‘I don’t wanna be here.’ Addressing the Corrective Services Officers behind me I said, ‘take me downstairs if I ain’t got a voice in my own trial I don’t wanna be here.’

And in protest I turned my back to the court.

The Judge ordered the jury to leave and left the bench immediately.”


	
	Later in his affidavit, he said:
	


“ …

39. I saw the 12th juror brought into the courtroom in a wheelchair. Apparently she was in hospital the night before. I could see she was immensely uncomfortable and very distressed.”


	
	In response, the Crown called the applicant’s trial solicitor and counsel to give evidence. The solicitor’s evidence was that the applicant was advised about the way in which counsel proposed to conduct the trial and accepted that advice. Counsel’s evidence was that his view at trial was that admitting the drug-related portions of the ERISP would have been severely prejudicial, and indeed fatal, to the applicant’s case whereas the admission of the reference to the applicant’s cement rendering work provided a basis for arguing that the Crown had not proved its case because it had not proved that the applicant’s fingerprints were not put on the louvers in the course of renovation of the unit. He said that he and the applicant had discussed whether the applicant should give evidence on a number of occasions and that he had told the applicant that his view was that it would be prejudicial to his case for the applicant to do so.
	


PRINCIPLES CONCERNING COUNSEL’S ALLEGED INCOMPETENCE


	
	As a number of the applicant’s grounds of appeal criticise his trial counsel’s conduct, it is necessary to refer to the principles applicable in this context.
	
	
	In R v Birks [1990] 19 NSWLR 677, the accused’s trial counsel inadvertently failed to cross-examine the principal prosecution witness on a number of relevant matters. On appeal, this Court set aside his conviction and ordered a new trial on the basis that there had been a serious miscarriage of justice. Gleeson CJ (with whom McInerney J agreed) stated the following relevant principles:
	


“2. As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence.

3. However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of ‘flagrant incompetence’ of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention” (at 685).


	
	Gleeson CJ went on to describe the situation at the trial below as “unusual and extreme”. Importantly, his Honour said that the failure to cross-examine related to the whole of the first charge against the accused and regarded the combination of circumstances resulting directly or indirectly from the inadequate cross-examination as giving rise to a miscarriage of justice (at 686).
	
	
	In TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124, the appellant criticised his trial counsel for deciding not to adduce evidence of the appellant’s good character in his trial for various sexual offences. The High Court dismissed his appeal.
	
	
	In that case, Gleeson CJ described counsel’s decision as “certainly not self-evidently unreasonable, or inexplicable” (at [8]). Rather, his Honour regarded it as “the kind of tactical decision routinely made by trial counsel, by which their clients are bound” and referred to the adversarial system proceeding “upon the assumption that parties are bound by the conduct of their legal representatives” (ibid).
	
	
	Gaudron J (with whom Gummow and Hayne JJ agreed) emphasised, as did all other members of the Court, that the critical question to be answered was whether a miscarriage of justice had occurred (at [30]-[31]). Her Honour continued:
	


“32   An accused will not ordinarily be deprived of a chance of acquittal that is fairly open if that chance is foreclosed by an informed and deliberate decision to pursue or not to pursue a particular course at trial.”


	
	McHugh J concluded that “[t]he decision not to call the good character evidence was a matter falling within the discretion of counsel as to how he would conduct the defence and did not constitute a material irregularity that led to a miscarriage of justice” (at [52]). Later, his Honour said:
	


“74   … Ordinarily, a party is held to the way in which his or her counsel has presented the party's case. That is because counsel is in effect the party's agent. Counsel is ‘ordinarily instructed on the implied understanding that he is to have complete control over the way in which the case is conducted.’ The discretion retained by counsel in the running of a case is very wide. Counsel may even settle a case without seeking the client's consent. Blackburn J noted in Strauss v Francis that ‘the apparent authority with which [counsel] is clothed when he appears to conduct the cause is to do everything which, in the exercise of his discretion, he may think best for the interests of his client in the conduct of the cause’” (citations omitted).


	
	In Ali v R [2005] HCA 8; 79 ALJR 662, the appellant contended that he had been denied a fair trial by reason of his trial counsel’s incompetence. The High Court dismissed the appeal. Hayne J (with whom McHugh J agreed) observed:
	


“25   An appellate court does not and may not know what information trial counsel had when deciding whether or not to object to evidence. That is why, in TKWJ, I concluded that the question of miscarriage does not turn on a factual inquiry into why trial counsel acted or did not act in a particular way. That kind of inquiry cannot be made. Rather, the question is whether there could be a reasonable explanation for the course that was adopted at trial. If there could be such an explanation, it follows from the fundamental nature of a criminal trial as an adversarial and accusatorial process that no miscarriage of justice is shown to have occurred” (citations omitted).


	
	In Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; 80 ALJR 614 the High Court rejected the appellant’s case that his trial counsel’s incompetence resulted in a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	In that case, Gleeson CJ observed:
	


“9   … A criminal trial is conducted as adversarial litigation. A cardinal principle of such litigation is that, subject to carefully controlled qualifications, parties are bound by the conduct of their counsel, who exercise a wide discretion in deciding what issues to contest, what witnesses to call, what evidence to lead or to seek to have excluded, and what lines of argument to pursue. The law does not pursue that principle at all costs. It recognises the possibility that justice may demand exceptions. Nevertheless, the nature of adversarial litigation, with its principles concerning the role of counsel, sets the context in which these issues arise. Considerations of fairness often turn upon the choices made by counsel at a trial. In TKWJ v The Queen, the appellant complained that evidence of his good character was not led. This, it was said, was unfair. In rejecting that argument, this Court said that the failure to call the evidence was the result of a decision by counsel, and that, viewed objectively, it was a rational decision. That, in the circumstances of the case, was conclusive. It is the fairness of the process that is in question; not the wisdom of counsel. As a general rule, counsel's decisions bind the client. If it were otherwise, the adversarial system could not function. The fairness of the process is to be judged in that light. The nature of the adversarial system, and the assumptions on which it operates, will lead to the conclusion, in most cases, that a complaint that counsel's conduct has resulted in an unfair trial will be considered by reference to an objective standard, and without an investigation of the subjective reasons for that conduct” (citations omitted).


	
	Gleeson CJ then referred to the “awkward procedure” involved in an appellate court attempting to ascertain a full explanation and understanding of the reasons that actuated trial counsel’s conduct, leading to his Honour saying:
	


“10   … There could be circumstances in which it is material to know that a course was taken contrary to instructions. The possibility of a need to know the reason for conduct cannot altogether be eliminated. In general, however, as far as justice permits, the inquiry should be objective. As a matter of principle, such objectivity is consistent with the assumptions on which the adversarial system operates. As a matter of practicality, it avoids the difficulties inherent in turning a criminal appeal into an investigation of the performance of trial counsel.”


	
	Gummow and Hayne JJ referred to the appellant’s complaints that his trial counsel had failed to give him proper advice and continued:
	


“27   … But a failure to give proper advice to the appellant would be significant only if, as a result of that failure, something was done or not done at trial that was, or occasioned, a miscarriage of justice. For the reasons given in TKWJ, the inquiry about miscarriage must be an objective inquiry, not an examination of what trial counsel for an accused did or did not know or think about. The critical question is what did or did not happen at trial, not why that came about” (citations omitted).


	
	In relation to the appellant’s complaint that his counsel did not call him to give evidence at the trial, their Honours said:
	


“31   It would have been well open to competent counsel to conclude that the very slight gains that might be obtained by putting forward a positive defence, of the kind that the appellant said he had, were well and truly outweighed by the disadvantages that would likely be suffered were the appellant to give evidence. It would, then, have been well open to competent counsel to conclude that the appellant should be advised against giving evidence in his defence. That being so, the fact that the appellant did not give evidence at his trial has brought about no miscarriage.”


	
	In Matthews v R [2013] NSWCCA 187 this Court said the following in response to a ground of appeal alleging that the appellant’s counsel had been negligent in his conduct of the trial:
	


“62   In assessing complaints about counsel's conduct it must be borne in mind that the relevant inquiry is whether what occurred or did not occur at the trial occasioned a miscarriage of justice (TKWJ v R [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124 at [79] per McHugh J, Ali v R [2005] HCA 8; 214 ALR 1 at [18] per Hayne J). None of the alleged failings of the appellant's counsel is even close to the potential category of errors by counsel adverted to by McHugh J in TKWJ at [76], namely those that are of such a nature that of themselves they might render a trial unfair (see Nudd v R [2006] HCA 9; 80 ALJR 614 at [19] per Gleeson CJ and [87] per Kirby J). Instead the nature of his complaints are such that what needs to be considered is what ultimately did or did not occur at the trial, whether there was some material irregularity in the trial and whether there is a significant possibility that the acts or omissions of which complaint is made affected the outcome of the trial (Nudd at [24] per Gummow and Hayne JJ; TKWJ at [31]-[33] per Gaudron J, at [79] and [97] per McHugh J, at [101] per Gummow J and at [103]-[108] per Hayne J).

“63   In conducting that inquiry a number of related matters should be noted. First, there is vested in counsel for an accused person control over and responsibility for the manner in which the trial will be conducted (TKWJ at [74] per McHugh J). Second, relevant unfairness will not be established simply because an ‘apparently rational decision’ by trial counsel produced adverse consequences for the accused (TKWJ at [16] per Gleeson CJ). Third, inquiries into the subjective thought processes of counsel for taking the steps they did at the trial are to be avoided. Instead the question is whether there could be a reasonable explanation for the course that was adopted at trial (Ali per Hayne J, with whom Gummow J agreed at [25]; TKWJ at [110] per Hayne J). If there could be such an explanation then no error or defect in the trial occasioning any miscarriage of justice is shown to have occurred (Ali id). Fourth, although the inquiry into whether there was an explanation for counsel's conduct is an objective one, there are some perhaps limited circumstances in which it is necessary for the appeal court to be apprised of material such as counsel's instructions (Nudd at [10] and [17] per Gleeson CJ).”


	
	In Outram v R [2013] NSWCCA 329 an applicant for an extension of time for leave to appeal criticised his trial counsel’s failure to call evidence of the applicant’s good character, to properly cross-examine the complainant, to adduce the applicant’s evidence properly and to ensure that only relevant material in the applicant’s ERISP interview transcript was admitted into evidence. Leeming JA (with whom Johnson and Hall JJ agreed) concluded that the applicant had not advanced a sufficiently cogent argument that there had been a miscarriage of justice to warrant the grant of an extension of time. In relation to the complaints concerning the adducing of evidence from the applicant and the ERISP transcript, his Honour said:
	


“53   The other matters complained of in proposed ground 2 are in essence complaints about the conduct of the defence by which the applicant is bound which fall short of something so significant that it amounts to a miscarriage of justice. It is to be recalled that although it is not necessary to characterise the conduct as ‘flagrant misconduct’ or ‘egregious error’, it is also insufficient to establish that counsel has been ‘negligent or otherwise remiss’. To the extent that the question is whether the course taken by counsel was capable of explanation (see TKWJ at [27]-[28] and Nudd at [31] and [157]), that test would be satisfied.”


	
	In Ahmu v R [2014] NSWCCA 312, this Court dismissed an appeal in which the appellant contended that he had suffered a miscarriage of justice as a result of his trial counsel’s incompetence. In reliance on Nudd (at [10]), Basten JA emphasised that the focus of attention for such a question should be the objective features of the trial process and rejected an affidavit sworn by trial counsel on the basis that it did not add anything to the inferences otherwise available from the course of the trial (at [31]). On the other hand, Adams J considered the affidavit admissible because it elucidated trial counsel’s reason for taking his chosen course and countered what would have been a misleading impression that would have arisen from the objective circumstances alone (at [55]).
	
	
	In Vella v R [2015] NSWCCA 148, evidence of the trial counsel’s conduct of the trial was led in this Court. Beech-Jones J (with whom Gleeson JA and Hidden J relevantly agreed) said in relation to [63] of Matthews:
	


“94   The interaction of the third and fourth principles leaves some scope for uncertainty as to the extent to which evidence from an appellant’s former Counsel and solicitor explaining their conduct can be received and considered in determining a complaint that a miscarriage of justice arose from it (see Ahmu at [31] per Basten JA and at [53] per Adams J). In Nudd Gleeson CJ stressed that so ‘far as justice permits, the enquiry should be objective’ (at [10]) but added ‘there may be circumstances where it is relevant to ask why some act or omission occurred’ (at [10]). One example that his Honour identified was a determination of whether ‘counsel took a certain course upon the instructions of the client’ (id).”


	
	I draw from these authorities the following principles relevant to the present case:
	



	
	To the extent possible, an appellate court should determine an appeal involving complaints about a trial counsel’s conduct of a case by examining the record of the trial to determine from the objective circumstances whether the accused has had a fair trial.
	
	
	Ordinarily, an affirmative answer to this question is required where the impugned conduct is capable of being rationally explained as a step taken, or not taken, in the interests of the accused. This is so even if the accused alleges on appeal that he or she did not authorise the conduct because the nature of the adversarial system means that the client is bound by the manner in which the trial is conducted on his or her behalf.
	
	
	Only in exceptional circumstances will an appellate court find it necessary to resort to subjective evidence concerning the appellant’s legal representatives’ reasoning at trial or to evidence as to communications between the appellant and those representatives.
	
	
	The ultimate question for an appellate court is whether the appellant has established that what occurred at the trial gave rise to a miscarriage of justice in the sense that the appellant lost a chance of acquittal that was fairly open.
	


RESOLUTION OF THE APPEAL


	
	I turn now to consider the applicant’s grounds of appeal as identified in his written submissions and filed statements of grounds.
	


“1. Inclusion of ERISP made whilst appellant under the influence of prohibited drug”;

“2. Editing of ERISP with inclusion of information leading to assumption of guilt without proof”; and

“3. Editing ERISP to leave appellant without valid reason or alibi for being at the crime scene leading to assumption of guilt”


	
	The unedited ERISP included the following:
	


“Q91   And what effect does heroin have on you?

A   It makes me feel good, it makes me forget about all my, um, sadness, my life.

Q92   Does it make you, do you remember everything you do when you’re on heroin?

A   Everything.

Q93   Everything you think.

A   I’m on heroin right now as I’m talking to you.

Q94   When was the last time you used [it]?

A   About two or three hours ago.

Q95   So you remember everything you do on heroin?

A   Yes.

…

Q103    … Just to clarify then you’re saying that you took some heroin today ---

A   Yeah.

Q103   --- three or four hours ago, are you still affected by those drugs as we speak?

A   No I’m all right, I can answer my questions I, I’m, I’m, I’m, I’m not impaired or anything like that.

Q104   How much heroin did you actually, actually take?

A   Compared to a full on heroin addict not much at all.

Q105   And how did you ---

A   Fifty dollars worth.

Q105   --- and how did you take the heroin?

A   I inject it.

Q106   And how long does that heroin normally affect you?

A   It makes me feel normal, that’s all it does to me, at the start it used to get me stoned and stuff now it just makes me feel normal.”


	
	Nothing in these answers indicates that the applicant’s trial counsel should have objected to the tender of the ERISP on the basis that the applicant’s faculties were significantly impaired by heroin at the time of the interview. Such an objection, based on the terms of the ERISP, would not have had any realistic prospect of success.
	
	
	The applicant’s trial counsel faced a difficult task in defending the applicant given that the applicant’s fingerprints were found on the glass louvers at the premises. Unless counsel could suggest to the jury a possible explanation for that, other than that the applicant was present to break, enter and steal from the unit, the applicant’s conviction would be inevitable. Theoretically, counsel could have refrained from objecting to the ERISP and instead relied on it to suggest to the jury that the applicant had been at the premises, with others, for the purpose of taking drugs whilst on the patio and had placed his fingers on the louvers in order to check whether there was anyone in the unit who was likely to disturb them. However, admission of the unedited ERISP, including its extensive references to the applicant’s drug taking, would have been highly prejudicial to his case. Unsurprisingly, as indicated in his evidence in this Court, trial counsel considered that conviction would almost inevitably ensue if that course were followed (Transcript p 26).
	
	
	As a result, counsel decided to conduct the case differently. He successfully objected to the inclusion of any references to drug-taking or other criminality in the tendered ERISP. He then used the remaining reference to the applicant having been engaged in cement rendering work in the inner city to found a suggestion to the jury that the Crown had not excluded beyond reasonable doubt the possibility that the applicant had put his fingerprints on the glass louvers in the course of renovations, a reference to renovations of the unit having been made earlier in other evidence.
	
	
	It was reasonable for counsel to take this course in attempting to secure an acquittal for his client. It could not have been taken if the ERISP had been excluded altogether as there would have been no evidence of the applicant’s work in cement rendering unless counsel called the applicant to give evidence. However, calling the applicant to give evidence also had the potential to be highly prejudicial to his defence as it would likely have revealed to the jury his extensive history of drug-taking and that his presence on the premises was in order to take drugs. It was therefore reasonable for his counsel to take the view that the applicant’s best chance of acquittal, even though slim, was to refrain from calling the applicant to give evidence and to object to the drug-taking and other criminality references in the ERISP, but otherwise not object to its tender.
	
	
	These conclusions follow from considering the objective features of the trial. Trial counsel’s evidence in this court of his subjective reasons confirms their correctness despite it being unnecessary to rely on them to reach that conclusion.
	
	
	Trial counsel’s decisions were rational and, in accordance with the principles I have stated above, bound the applicant regardless of whether they accorded with the applicant’s instructions (see for example TKWJ at [74] per McHugh J). None of the matters to which the applicant referred demonstrate that his trial counsel acted incompetently. The applicant therefore has no basis for asserting that a miscarriage of justice occurred.
	
	
	Although it is unnecessary to do so, I add that the applicant did not in any event establish that the trial was not conducted in accordance with his instructions. Certainly, the evidence called in this Court revealed that the question of the applicant giving evidence was a topic discussed repeatedly and vigorously between himself and his counsel. His counsel’s evidence was that the applicant accepted his advice, albeit that he may have done so reluctantly. As the applicant’s evidence did not clearly indicate that he did not accept his counsel’s advice, his counsel’s evidence on that topic should be accepted.
	
	
	Furthermore, the applicant’s evidence in this Court did not provide any support for his first ground of appeal as he did not provide evidence of any actual impairment of his faculties at the time of the interview. Rather, he said that such could be inferred from his making of statements that he would not ordinarily make such as that he had not broken into and stolen from dwelling-houses but had (as was accurate) robbed banks. The making of such statements, which he subsequently contended was unwise, could not reasonably be taken as indicating that he was significantly affected by heroin during the interview.
	


“4. The Crown continually referred to the appellant’s prints being found at the point of entry”


	
	The effect of the applicant’s submission in relation to this ground was that the Crown, without correction from the trial judge, misled the jury into thinking that the glass louvers with his fingerprints on them were found in their proper place, that is, acting as slats of the unit’s window. However, the evidence made it clear that the slats were in fact in their proper place when the residents left for work in the morning, that they found them lying in the patio when they returned and that the police replaced them in their slots for safety purposes. The jury could not have been under any misunderstanding in this respect.
	
	
	This ground should accordingly be rejected.
	


“5. Contamination of evidence by crime scene officer and witness”; and

“6. Lack of care in the examination of the crime scene causing evidence to be contaminated”


	
	Even if these assertions were correct which I do not suggest they are, the alleged contamination and lack of care could not detract from the fact that the applicant’s fingerprints were found on the glass louvers at the premises. These grounds should therefore also be rejected.
	


“7. No elimination prints taken and unknown prints found [were] not taken into account”


	
	Again, these matters could not detract from the force of the evidence that the applicant’s fingerprints were found on louvers in the patio. This ground should therefore also be rejected.
	


“8 No receipts/proof of purchase provided for items allegedly stolen from the property”


	
	There was no challenge at the trial to the residents’ evidence that items were stolen from the premises. In these circumstances, proof of their purchase was unnecessary.
	


“9 Officer provided incorrect evidence on the stand”


	
	This ground refers to Constable Nadine Carroll’s denial in cross-examination that during a conference outside the Court she told the applicant’s counsel that one of the unit’s residents had handed her one of the louvers on the day in question. In the absence of the jury, the applicant’s counsel asserted that Constable Carroll had told him outside Court that one of the residents “had at least touched one of the louvers” (Transcript p 34). He submitted that she then said “something totally different in evidence” (ibid). However, the trial judge pointed out that this had not been the proposition put to Constable Carroll in cross-examination, rather, it had been suggested to her that one of the residents handed one of the louvers to her. On resumption of the cross-examination before the jury, Constable Carroll accepted that at least one of the residents had touched the louvers without wearing gloves.
	
	
	The transcript, from which this description of events was taken, was relevantly verified by an unchallenged affidavit of a client services officer employed by the Reporting Services Branch of the Department of Justice (NSW). It does not support the proposition stated in this ground of appeal, which should therefore be rejected.
	


“10. Appellant was denied his right to committal”


	
	This allegation is irrelevant to the fairness of the trial at which the applicant was convicted. I nevertheless note that the applicant’s trial counsel’s evidence before this Court was that he considered that it was not in the applicant’s interest to require a committal proceeding. Given the circumstances of the case, that was a rational view that he was entitled to take, and give effect to, in the course of his retainer by the applicant.
	


“11. Appellant was denied the right to have witnesses he asked for give evidence”


	
	This ground refers to the fact that the applicant’s co-accused, Mr Michael Hanna, did not give evidence at the applicant’s trial. Prior to the trial, Mr Hanna pleaded guilty to an aggravated break, enter and steal charge in relation to the events in question. The Crown initially indicated, in the absence of the jury, that it would call Mr Hanna to give evidence but subsequently resiled from that. The applicant’s trial counsel’s evidence in this Court was that he considered calling Mr Hanna in the applicant’s case but decided not to because Mr Hanna had declined to confer with him beforehand and had indicated that he did not want to give evidence. Unsurprisingly, counsel took the view that he could not reasonably call Mr Hanna without knowing what Mr Hanna would say.
	
	
	Counsel’s decision was a rational one taken in order to advance his client’s interests and pursuant to the authority that his retainer conferred upon him. There is no basis for concluding that the decision gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.
	


“12. Appellant’s outbursts were neither noted or recorded”


	
	The applicant interrupted the trial judge’s Summing-Up a number of times with comments about the edited nature of the ERISP. These are recorded in the transcript and there is no reason to conclude that not all of what he said was recorded. In any event, an omission from the transcript would not of itself give rise to a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	In his Additional Grounds of Appeal, the applicant alleged that the jury would have been adversely influenced by the statements that the applicant alleges that he made:
	


“If you’re gonna tell them, tell them the truth, enough lies. If I was a juror and I heard someone say what you’re saying what I said, I’d find them guilty. My interview is so edited.”


	
	The statements to which this submission refers appear to be the following statements recorded in the transcript of the trial:
	


“ACCUSED: … (not transcribable) … of course it’s guilty, of course that’s guilty. Are you for real? Are you for real? Of course that’s guilty. I’ve done nothing. Tell them what I said. I want a defence … (not transcribable)” (at p 34).


	
	However, although these statements were made, they were made in the absence of the jury. Those made in the presence of the jury were:
	


“ACCUSED:   Edited interview, you know it’s a edited interview, it doesn’t make sense.

…

It’s a edited interview … (not transcribable)..

…

I’m telling the truth, stop lying, fuck.

…

Take me down, I don’t want to stay, take me down, let’s go, I don’t want to stay here.

…

I’m telling the truth .. (not transcribable) .. let’s go.

…

I don’t want to stay here. Let’s go please, I don’t want to stay here.

…

(not transcribable) … back downstairs, I don’t want to be here. I’m telling the truth. Stop lying. Can we go? Can we go? Can I go?

…

The fucking court’s shit. I told you why I was there for .. (not transcribable) .. Kangaroo court” (Transcript pp 32-34).


	
	The trial judge instructed the jury to ignore the applicant’s comments and said, in relation to the applicant’s references to the ERISP being edited, that it had been edited “to remove from it matters that were entirely irrelevant to your consideration in this trial” (Summing-Up, p 36). As the statements to which the applicant’s submission refers (or ones to similar effect) were not made in the presence of the jury, they cannot have affected the fairness of his trial. Nor did the statements that the applicant made in the presence of the jury. These were appropriately dealt with by the judge’s further instructions to the jury and did not give rise to any miscarriage of justice.
	


“Mr Dobson cleaned patio two weeks prior to offence. Applicant could have been present at premises at any time during this period” (as formulated in the Crown’s submissions)


	
	The submission implicit in this ground does not advance the applicant’s case any further than the way it was put on his behalf at the trial. As noted above, his counsel suggested there that the applicant’s fingerprints could have been placed on the glass louvers during the course of renovations and that this could have occurred at any time prior to the date of the offence. In any event, I note that in his evidence in this Court, the applicant admitted that he was present at the subject premises on the date of the offence, albeit to take drugs on the patio rather than to break and enter.
	
	
	This ground of appeal should therefore be rejected.
	


“The jury’s verdict was compromised because an injured juror was in a wheelchair in obvious discomfort and the jury felt that the haste was to avoid further discomfort to the juror”


	
	The jury retired to consider its verdict at 12.11pm on Friday 21 February 2014. It returned for two short periods to enable the trial judge to answer its questions. On Monday 24 February 2014 the Court was advised that a member of the jury had been in an accident and was in hospital and, as a result, the jury was excused for the day. It reconvened on Tuesday 25 February 2014, with the injured juror present, and returned a verdict of guilty at 11.04am.
	
	
	The applicant submits that the jury’s verdict was compromised by what he says was the injured juror’s obvious discomfort. His counsel’s evidence in this Court was that he was aware of the injury but did not observe any signs of undue discomfort nor, apparently, did the trial judge. The jury did not indicate that there was any difficulty in it proceeding to consider its verdict and the time that it had to do so, taking into account the time taken up on the previous Friday, was substantial, bearing in mind the relatively simple nature of the case.
	
	
	In these circumstances, there is no basis for concluding that the jury’s verdict was compromised and this ground of appeal should therefore be rejected.
	


THE APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE


	
	Following the applicant’s conviction, King SC DCJ sentenced him to a term of 4 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 3 years. The maximum penalty provided for the offence is 20 years imprisonment and the prescribed standard non-parole period is 5 years.
	
	
	Maiden SC DCJ had earlier sentenced the applicant’s co-offender, Michael Hanna, to 2 years and 6 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months. Mr Hanna was given a 25% discount for his early plea of guilty before the trial.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against his sentence on the ground that it is manifestly excessive, his particulars of this contention being:
	


“(a)   There should have been greater parity given with the sentence the co-offender Michael Hanna received.

(b)   The applicant received double the non-parole period that Michael Hanna received.

(c)   The offence is a less serious example of offences under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.”

The Remarks on Sentence


	
	The sentencing judge’s thorough Remarks on Sentence record, inter alia, the following:
	



	
	At the time of committing the subject offence, the applicant was on parole in respect of two other separate offences. One was an offence of robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon, for which he received a sentence of 7 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months beginning on 16 December 2005. When that sentence was imposed, four other matters were taken into account on a Form 1 and the applicant was also sentenced in respect of three further offences for which he received periods of imprisonment which had expired prior to his being released on parole in relation to the robbery offence.
	
	
	At the time of the subject offence, the applicant was also on parole in respect of an offence of enter a building or land with intent to commit an indictable offence. He was released on parole in respect of that offence on 22 July 2012. About two months later, he committed the subject offence.
	
	
	The subject offence was committed during the day time, with effectively no damage to property and at a time when it was anticipated that the unit would not be occupied. In those circumstances, his Honour regarded the offence as falling within the lower range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	The applicant was approximately 38 years of age at the time of sentence. He had a long criminal history which his Honour described as “horrendous”. Similarly, he had a long history of drug abuse which continued even whilst he was in custody.
	
	
	He had committed numerous violent offences. His Honour said that the applicant’s “criminal history is indicative of a continuing contempt for the law, as well as being indicative of an ongoing failure to address any of his problems relevant to his offending behaviour”.
	
	
	His Honour found that the applicant had “no remorse, no contrition, and it cannot be said that there is a good prospect of rehabilitation nor a low risk of re-offending”.
	
	
	There were no special circumstances that would justify any variation in the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of term.
	
	
	It appeared to the primary judge that, in light of Maiden SC DCJ’s Remarks on Sentence in respect of Mr Hanna, Mr Hanna had made a “substantial effort to address his drug problem”, leading to a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	Mr Hanna was, like the applicant, in breach of a parole order at the time of his offence but the applicant’s criminal history was, his Honour said, “certainly more significant than that of Mr Hanna”, although he said that that might be explained to some extent by the fact that Mr Hanna is some seven years younger than the applicant.
	


Parity


	
	There may be appellable error even if a sentence under appeal is not otherwise excessive “[w]here there is a marked disparity between sentences [imposed on co-offenders] giving rise to the appearance of injustice” (Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [32]). The Court will however refuse to intervene “where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise” (ibid at [31]).
	
	
	Bearing in mind the 25% discount, Maiden SC DCJ’s starting point in sentencing the co-offender (Mr Hanna) must have been a sentence of 40 months. The sentence imposed on the applicant was 48 months. Mr Hanna’s lower sentence and the difference in the statutory ratio (resulting from the finding of special circumstances) was justified by his apparent significant movements towards rehabilitation as compared to the applicant’s lack of progress in that respect. As I have noted, King SC DCJ concluded that there was “an ongoing failure [by the applicant] to address any of his problems relevant to his offending behaviour”.
	
	
	The significant difference between the applicant’s and co-offender’s criminal records (see [66(9)] above) also served to explain the differences between their sentences. Taking the different criminal histories into account did not amount to sentencing the applicant again for offences of which he had earlier been convicted (Weininger v The Queen [2003] HCA 14; 212 CLR 629 at [32]).
	
	
	In these circumstances, I do not consider that there is any disparity between the sentences imposed upon the applicant and his co-offender such as could give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the applicant.
	


Manifest excess generally


	
	The applicant’s sentence was not in my view manifestly excessive. As he was entitled to do, the sentencing judge took into account as relevant factors both the maximum penalty and the applicable standard non-parole period, as well as the fact that the applicant was on parole in respect of two separate offences when he committed the subject offence, had a “horrendous history of criminal offending” and continued to use drugs, even whilst in custody. In these circumstances, the sentence was within the range of sentences that his Honour was entitled to impose notwithstanding that his Honour took the view that the applicant’s conduct was within the lower range of objective seriousness.
	


ORDERS


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal;
	
	
	Refuse the applicant leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to rely upon his grounds of appeal against conviction insofar as that leave was necessary;
	
	
	Dismiss the appeal.
	



	
	ROTHMAN J: I agree with Macfarlan JA.
	
	
	BELLEW J: I agree with Macfarlan JA.

		05 February 2016",2016-02-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2702112,Crump v R [2016] NSWCCA 2,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

On 20 June 1974, the applicant was sentenced, along with his co-offender, Allan Baker, to two terms of life imprisonment in respect of the murder of Ian James Lamb and the conspiracy to murder Virginia Gai Morse.

In 1997, the applicant applied to the Supreme Court under s 13A of the Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW) for the determination of a minimum term and an additional term in respect of his existing life sentences. On 24 April 1997, McInerney J sentenced the applicant to a minimum term of 30 years imprisonment for the murder of Mr Lamb and an additional term for the remainder of his natural life. In relation to the conspiracy to murder, a sentence of 25 years imprisonment was determined.

The applicant now seeks leave to appeal from the decision of McInerney J in respect only of the minimum and additional terms fixed for the murder of Mr Lamb.

The application for leave to appeal was 18 years out of time. The Court considered that an extension of time should be granted to allow the arguments on the application to be made and addressed (see [76]). The application for leave to appeal was assessed by reference to the prospects of success of the proposed grounds of appeal relied on by the applicant.

The issues before the Court were:

i.   whether McInerney J erred in considering the overall criminality involved in the four offences of which the applicant was convicted (including the conspiracy to murder) when determining the applicant’s sentence for the murder of Mr Lamb;

ii.   whether the additional term of life imprisonment fixed by McInerney J for the murder of Mr Lamb was too severe having regard to the nature of the applicant’s involvement in the offence; and

iii.   whether, in the event that error was established in the original determination, the Court has power to re-determine an additional term of less than life imprisonment, notwithstanding Sch 1, cl 4(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).

The Court (per Meagher JA, Rothman and Bellew JJ agreeing) held, dismissing the application for leave to appeal:

In relation to (i)

The application of the totality principle by a sentencing judge must take account of the statutory regime under which the sentencing exercise is to occur: [42]. At the time of McInerney J’s determination, s 13A(5) provided that the minimum term of any determined sentence was to commence on the date when the original sentence commenced, or the date when the applicant was remanded in custody for the offence: [44]. In those circumstances, the re-determined, and necessarily concurrent, sentence imposed for Mr Lamb’s murder was just and appropriate, and ensured that the applicant did not go unpunished or insufficiently punished for the other three offences (the sentences for which had been or were to be served concurrently): [55], [57], [58].

Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610; Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; 78 ALJR 616 considered.

R v Purdey (1992) 65 A Crim R 441; Fenech (Supreme Court (NSW), Barr J, 4 September 1997, unrep); R v Picknell (Supreme Court (NSW), Wood CJ at CL, 10 November 1998, unrep); R v Salameh [1999] NSWCCA 300; R v Maiden [2000] NSWCCA 519 applied.

In relation to (ii)

The applicant’s submission that he has served a term of imprisonment exceeding 41 years for the murder of Mr Lamb should be rejected as the time the applicant has spent in gaol is not referable only to that offence: [59].

In relation to (iii)

It was unnecessary for the Court to express a concluded view as to this argument: [62]. The language of Sch 1, cl 4(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) suggests a legislative intention for that provision to operate prospectively in relation to applications made to the Supreme Court under cl 2(1): [70]. It should not be concluded lightly that the clause has a retrospective operation as it qualifies certain rights and is substantially detrimental to the applicant: [71].

Judgment


	
	MEAGHER JA: On 20 June 1974 the applicant was sentenced in the Supreme Court (Taylor J) after a jury returned verdicts of guilty against him and his co-offender, Allan Baker, in respect of four charges. Those charges included the murder of Ian James Lamb and the conspiracy to murder Virginia Gai Morse. In respect of those offences, Taylor J sentenced each of the applicant and Baker to two sentences of life imprisonment.
	
	
	When those sentences were passed, there was no requirement for the imposition of a minimum or non-parole term of imprisonment. At that time s 463 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) conferred upon the Governor a power to release an offender on licence. The Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW) (the 1989 Act) was introduced to restore “truth in sentencing” (s 3) and “permitted a sentencing court imposing a determinate sentence of imprisonment to fix the minimum term to be served by an offender before being eligible for release on parole and introduced a detailed system for the making of parole orders by the parole authority … in respect of prisoners who had served their minimum term”: per Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ in Crump v New South Wales [2012] HCA 20; 247 CLR 1 at [43].

	Section 13A of the 1989 Act, which was inserted by the Sentencing (Life Sentences) Amendment Act 1989 (NSW) with effect from 12 January 1990, permitted a person serving an existing life sentence to apply to the Supreme Court for the determination of a minimum term and an additional term for that sentence. As French CJ noted in Crump v New South Wales at [8], the purpose of that section was “to enable prisoners who had been sentenced to life imprisonment before 1989 to be considered for possible release on parole”.
	
	
	The applicant made two applications under s 13A. The first was dismissed by Loveday J in December 1992. An appeal from that decision was also dismissed (Crump v R, Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 30 May 1994, unrep). His second application, made to McInerney J in 1997, was upheld. In his judgment delivered on 24 April 1997, McInerney J sentenced the applicant to a minimum term of 30 years imprisonment for the murder of Mr Lamb and an additional term for the remainder of his natural life. In relation to the conspiracy to murder, his Honour determined a sentence of 25 years imprisonment. No additional term was set for the second offence and, as French CJ also noted in Crump v New South Wales at [14], the source of the power to impose that sentence without also imposing an additional term (being either for a specified period or for the remainder of the applicant’s natural life: see s 13A(4)) is not apparent. The term of imprisonment for each sentence commenced on 13 November 1973, being the date on which the applicant was first remanded in custody for the offences: s 13A(5).
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal from the decision of McInerney J, but only in respect of the minimum and additional terms fixed for the murder conviction. It is not disputed that he has a right under s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) to do so with leave. Section 10(1) of that Act requires (and required in 1997) that any notice of an application for leave to appeal be filed within 28 days. The present application was filed on 23 April 2015. As the Crown observes, that was “just under 18 years out of time”. Accordingly, the applicant also requires a significant extension of the time in which to seek leave to appeal.
	
	
	The Crown opposes the application for an extension of time and the granting of leave to appeal. It submits that no error is demonstrated in relation to McInerney J’s determination and that there is, in any event, no utility in granting an extension of time or leave to appeal because any re-exercise of the Court’s power with respect to the re-determination of the life sentence fixed for Mr Lamb’s murder could not, by reason of cl 4(3) of Sch 1 to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the 1999 Act), involve the setting of an additional term (or “specified term”) which was less than the remainder of the applicant’s natural life. In its opposition to the application for an extension of time the Crown also relies upon the length of the delay in the making of the application and the absence of any good reason for it.
	
	
	It is convenient at this point to refer to the provisions which govern the applicant’s right to appeal by leave. Before April 2000 the applicant had a right to appeal by leave against McInerney J’s determination. That right was provided in s 13A(12) of the 1989 Act. On 3 April 2000, the 1999 Act commenced and by Sch 1 repealed the 1989 Act. On the same day the right of appeal under the 1999 Act was extended to any determination made under the 1989 Act by the savings provision in cl 21(3) of Sch 2 to the later Act. That subclause provided:
	


Any determination in force immediately before the appointed day under section 13A (4) of the 1989 Act is taken to be a determination under clause 4 of Schedule 1 to this Act.


	
	Clause 4 as originally enacted described the ways in which the Supreme Court could dispose of an application for the determination of a specified term and non-parole period in relation to an existing life sentence. The methods of disposal included, by cl 4(1)(b), “declining to set a specified term for the sentence but setting a non-parole period for the sentence”. By cl 19 of Sch 2 to the 1999 Act, McInerney J’s determination for the murder of Mr Lamb was to be taken as setting a non-parole period of 30 years and, by fixing an additional term which was for the remainder of the applicant’s natural life, as declining to set a specified term for that sentence. Clause 8(1)(a) of Sch 1 as originally enacted provided a right of appeal to this Court in relation to a determination “under clause 4(1)”, the Criminal Appeal Act applying to that appeal in the same way that it applies to an appeal against a sentence. As a result of Sch 2, cl 21(3), McInerney J’s determination answered that description.
	
	
	The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Existing Life Sentences) Act 2001 (NSW) amended cl 4 with effect from 20 July 2001 by the insertion of sub-cl 4(3). That amendment removed the Supreme Court’s power, in an application made under Sch 1 to the 1999 Act, to set a specified term for an existing life sentence in relation to an offender who had been the subject of a “non-release recommendation”. It provided:
	


In the case of an offender who is the subject of a non-release recommendation, the Supreme Court may dispose of an application in relation to an existing life sentence:

(a)   by setting a non-parole period for the sentence, or

(b)   by declining to set a non-parole period for the sentence,

but does not have jurisdiction to set a specified term for the sentence.


	
	A “non-release recommendation” was defined to include an expression of opinion by the sentencing judge that the offender should never be released from imprisonment. Taylor J made such a recommendation, in the following terms, when sentencing the applicant and Baker:
	


I believe that you should spend the rest of your lives in gaol and there you should die. If ever there was a case where life imprisonment should mean what it says – imprisonment for the whole of your lives – this is it.

If in the future some application is made that you be released on the grounds of clemency or mercy, then I would venture to suggest to those who are entrusted with the task of determining whether you are entitled to it or not that the measure of your entitlement to either should be the clemency and mercy you extended to [Mrs Morse] when she begged you for her life.


	
	The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Existing Life Sentences) Act also amended cl 8(1)(a) of Sch 1 to provide for a right of appeal by leave in relation to a determination by the Supreme Court “under clause 4(1) or (3)”.
	
	
	As mentioned earlier, the Crown contends that the effect of these provisions is that even if there was error in the exercise of the power under s 13A by McInerney J, this Court could not form the view that “some other sentence … is warranted in law and should have been passed”, and proceed to pass such other sentence under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, because its power to do so is now constrained by cl 4(3) of Sch 1.
	
	
	It will be necessary to return to this contention. However, because the Crown relies upon the lack of any demonstrated error on the part of McInerney J as the primary basis for its opposition to any extension of time and grant of leave, it is appropriate to address that subject first. For reason that from the applicant’s perspective finality in this matter is desirable, and for the reasons in [74]-[76] below, I also consider it necessary in this case to address in some detail the arguments sought to be advanced by the applicant in his proposed appeal.
	


The proposed grounds of appeal


	
	The applicant was not legally represented in his application to this Court. The two grounds specified in his Notice of Appeal are “miscarriage of justice” and “severity of sentence”. In each case reference also is made to the fact of the enactment of the 1999 Act.
	
	
	As I have already observed, the effect of the 1999 Act was that the applicant’s re-determined sentence for Mr Lamb’s murder was life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 30 years.
	
	
	Until the insertion of s 154A in the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW), that sentence included a prospect of release on parole. However, the enactment of that provision in July 2001 eliminated that prospect for the applicant other than in very limited circumstances. It provided and continues to provide that the State Parole Authority, which is responsible for the release of offenders on parole, may only make an order directing the release of an offender who is the subject of a “non-release recommendation”, if it:
	


(3)   …

(a)   is satisfied (on the basis of a report prepared by the Chief Executive Officer, Justice Health) that the offender:

(i)   is in imminent danger of dying, or is incapacitated to the extent that he or she no longer has the physical ability to do harm to any person, and

(ii)   has demonstrated that he or she does not pose a risk to the community, and

(b)   is further satisfied that, because of those circumstances, the making of such an order is justified.


	
	The applicant’s challenge to the validity of that amendment was rejected by the High Court in Crump v New South Wales.
	


The applicant’s argument


	
	The applicant filed two written submissions, each of two handwritten pages. He also addressed the Court orally. His first and principal submission is that his involvement in Mr Lamb’s murder was not sufficiently serious to warrant a sentence of life imprisonment, or in the language of s 13A(4) of the 1989 Act, an additional term for the remainder of his natural life. For that reason he argues that McInerney J erred and that this Court should re-determine his sentence for that offence. He refers to the sentences imposed on three other offenders convicted of murder in support of his argument that the sentence imposed on him was too high. His second written submission concludes:
	


I believe that the sentence I am doing for the murder of Mr Lamb … would have been substantially shorter than the 41 years 8 months I have already served.


	
	In oral argument, the applicant confirmed that this was the main matter that he wished to raise by his appeal. The transcript of argument includes the following submission (tpct 04/11/15, p 2):
	


APPLICANT:   Okay. I believe that I should never have received a life sentence because the case was never put by McInerney into a serious category or worst case category of murder.

And later, again addressing the sentence for the murder of Mr Lamb (tpct 04/11/15, p 6):

ROTHMAN J: … [I]t comes back to what you said earlier, does it not, Mr Crump, that is that in your view even taken at its totality you weren't in the worst case and shouldn't have been given an additional sentence of life; that's it in a nutshell, isn't it?

APPLICANT:   Yes, your Honours. That is it completely in a nutshell.


	
	The remaining points made in the applicant’s written submissions are: that the conspiracy to murder charge of which he was also found guilty should not have been taken into account when determining the minimum and additional terms for the murder of Mr Lamb; that Taylor J’s comments made at the time he was sentenced are not relevant to be taken into account in his application to appeal against McInerney J’s determination; and finally that the enactment of the 1999 Act impacted adversely on him. The principal respect in which it is said to have done so seems to follow from the enactment of s 154A and not otherwise.
	
	
	These arguments direct attention to the criminality involved in the applicant’s offending and the reasoning of McInerney J for the determinations he made under s 13A.
	


The circumstances of the offending


	
	The applicant and Baker committed a number of very serious offences in northern New South Wales and Queensland in 1973. The following account is taken from the Crown’s written submissions to this Court which in turn summarise the Statement of Facts tendered in evidence before McInerney J. A more graphic factual account, taken from what the applicant told the police in signed records of interview, is contained in the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in Crump v R (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 30 May 1994, unrep) at 1-5.
	
	
	In October 1973, the applicant stole a car and joined Baker, who he had known for a couple of years, setting up camp to work as casual tractor drivers on a property near Boggabilla. That employment ceased on 2 November 1973 and the following day Baker, accompanied by the applicant, purchased a rifle at Goondiwindi in Queensland. That night, with the intention of stealing money and petrol, they approached Mr Lamb who was asleep in his car on the side of the road at Narrabri. When Mr Lamb awoke to tapping on the car window, Baker fatally shot him in the neck and the two offenders robbed him and fled.
	
	
	A few days later, on 7 November 1973 the applicant and Baker travelled to the Morse family property on the New South Wales/Queensland border. Baker had performed three weeks of casual work on the property in October 1972. The men watched the Morse family home through binoculars and saw Mr Morse take his children to the school bus before driving his truck away from the property. At that point, the two went in, bound and gagged Mrs Morse, ransacked the house, stealing two rifles amongst other items, carried Mrs Morse to her husband’s car and drove to where the stolen car had been hidden. They then transferred petrol from Mr Morse’s car before hiding it and driving off with Mrs Morse in the stolen car. At the first stop the offenders removed Mrs Morse from the vehicle, tied her limbs, removed her clothes and each raped her. They again raped Mrs Morse at the next stop which was across the Queensland border. Shortly afterwards the applicant shot Mrs Morse between the eyes while she was seated in front of a tree with her hands tied. Mrs Morse’s naked body was then concealed with sticks and rocks in a nearby stream.
	
	
	On 13 November 1973 the applicant and Baker committed another armed robbery in a house whose owner was also known to the applicant. Their stolen car was then sighted, that sighting was reported and a police chase involving five officers ensued. The applicant initially drove while Baker fired shots at the police but once they had alighted both shot at police intending to kill them so that they could get away. Constable Millward was shot in the head during these exchanges, but survived.
	
	
	The applicant and Baker were arrested and each was charged with the following offences:
	


Count 1:   The murder of Ian James Lamb on 3 November 1973 near Narrabri in the state of New South Wales (ss 18, 19 of the Crimes Act 1900);

Count 2:   Conspiracy to murder Virginia Gai Morse on 7 November 1973 near Collarenebri and elsewhere in the state of New South Wales (s 26 of the Crimes Act);

Count 3:   Maliciously wound Constable John William Millward with intent to prevent lawful apprehension on 13 November 1973 at East Maitland (s 33 of the Crimes Act); and

Count 4:   Maliciously shoot at Senior Constable John Kenneth Snedden and Constable Wayne Martin Hore with intent to prevent their lawful apprehension on 13 November 1973 at Woodville (s 33 of the Crimes Act).


	
	Neither was charged with the murder of Mrs Morse as that offence took place in Queensland.
	


The trial and sentence proceedings before Taylor J


	
	On 11 June 1974 the applicant and Baker pleaded not guilty to each of these counts and their trial proceeded before Taylor J and a jury. On 20 June 1974 the jury returned verdicts of guilty on all counts against both men. On the same day Taylor J imposed the following sentences on each offender: imprisonment for life on each of the first two counts and imprisonment for a period of 15 years with hard labour on the remaining two counts.
	


The application to McInerney J


	
	In April 1997, s 13A of the 1989 Act relevantly provided:
	


(2)   A person serving an existing life sentence may apply to the Supreme Court for the determination of a minimum term and an additional term for the sentence.

…

(4)   The Supreme Court may, on application duly made for the determination of a minimum term and an additional term for a sentence:

(a)   set both:

(i)   a minimum term of imprisonment that the person must serve for the offence for which the sentence was originally imposed, and

(ii)   an additional term during which the person may be released on parole (being either an additional term for a specified period or for the remainder of the person’s natural life), or

(b)   decline to determine a minimum term and an additional term.


	
	The Crown opposed the application to determine each of the life sentences. It also sought a direction in relation to the life sentence for the murder of Mr Lamb pursuant to s 13A(8), which with s 13A(8C) then provided:
	


(8)   If the Supreme Court declines to determine a minimum term and an additional term, the Court may (when making that decision) direct that the person who made the application:

(i)   never re-apply to the Court under this section, or

(ii)   not re-apply to the Court under this section for a specified period.

…

(8C)   A direction under subsection (8) that a person may never re-apply to the Court under this section or not re-apply for a period exceeding 2 years may be given only if:

(a)   the person was sentenced for the crime of murder, and

(b)   it is a most serious case of murder and it is in the public interest that the determination be made.


	
	McInerney J rejected the Crown’s application for a direction under s 13A(8): Judgment at 25-26. In support of that application the Crown submitted that when considering whether the applicant’s involvement in the murder of Mr Lamb was, within the language of s 13A(8C)(b), a “most serious case of murder”, the Court could have regard to the totality of the criminality involved in the four offences, including, in relation to the conspiracy to murder, the circumstances of the abduction, rape and killing of Mrs Morse. McInerney J rejected that argument, holding that the language of s 13A(8C) directed attention to the objective seriousness of the applicant’s involvement in the offence of murder alone: Judgment at 25.
	
	
	He accepted the submission made on behalf of the applicant that his involvement in Mr Lamb’s murder did not answer the description of “a most serious case of murder”, and concluded (Judgment at 26):
	


The question of totality, I am satisfied, is to be considered once I am of the view that a determination should be made, namely that I am not satisfied that Crump’s involvement in the murder of Mr Lamb is the most serious type of murder for the purpose of setting an appropriate determinate sentence. I have made it clear that on the authorities I am bound to follow I do not consider it to be so. In those circumstances, I am required to set a minimum and an additional term.


	
	McInerney J then proceeded to the question of the appropriate sentences to be determined for the murder and conspiracy to murder convictions. In relation to the latter, because it was “within the contemplation of Baker and Crump when they formed the conspiracy to murder that they intended to rape and then kill Mrs Morse so that she could not identify them”, he held (Judgment at 32) that it was appropriate to take those aggravating circumstances into account when determining an appropriate sentence.
	
	
	He then considered the applicant’s subjective circumstances, criminal history and conduct whilst in gaol, having earlier noted (referring to Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465) (Judgment at 27) that an offender’s criminal history could be taken into account provided that it was not given such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty which was disproportionate to the gravity of the relevant offence. With respect to the conspiracy offence he also noted that, of the various judges who had considered the applicant’s offending, “only Hunt CJ at CL [had] stated a firm view that the conspiracy to murder Mrs Morse is in the worst case category and thus deserves punishment for life” (Judgment at 54).
	
	
	McInerney J then proceeded to address the question of determining an appropriate sentence for the murder of Mr Lamb (Judgment at 60):
	


In determining an appropriate sentence, I take into account retribution, general and specific deterrence, and rehabilitation. The sentence I have determined is one that in all the circumstances l have concluded is appropriate.

It is not possible to accumulate sentences for the various crimes. Section 13A(5) of the Act requires that a minimum term set under this section is to commence on the date on which the original sentence commenced or, if the person was remanded in custody for the offence, the date on which the first such remand commenced.

An appropriate sentence has to be passed to take into account the criminality involved in all the offences. The longest sentence I impose for the murder of Mr Lamb is designed to reflect the overall criminality involved in all the offences.

Crump will need constant supervision and guidance for the rest of his life, if and when he is released from gaol.

For the murder of Mr Lamb, Crump is sentenced to a minimum term of penal servitude of 30 years commencing on 13 November 1973 and concluding on 12 November 2003. Crump will be eligible for release on parole on 13 November 2003.

I set an additional term for the remainder of Crump’s natural life.

For the conspiracy to murder Mrs Morse, Crump is sentenced to 25 years’ penal servitude commencing on 13 November 1973 and concluding on 12 November 1998.

Was there error in determining the applicant’s sentence for the murder of Mr Lamb?


	
	There are two related respects in which the applicant complains about McInerney J’s determination of the sentence for his murder conviction. First, he says that an additional term of life was too long having regard to the nature of his involvement in that murder. Secondly, he says that his Honour should not have taken into account the “overall criminality involved” in the four offences when determining that sentence. In other words, he is to be taken to argue that the sentence was not proportionate to the gravity of his involvement in that murder and was made longer to take into account the criminality involved in the other three offences.
	
	
	In response the Crown submits, citing Spinks v R (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 7 August 1997, unrep), that considerations of totality are relevant to the discretionary decision made in connection with the determination of the additional term. The parties’ arguments direct attention to the application of the proportionality and totality principles in relation to the re-determination of a life sentence under s 13A.
	
	
	The proportionality principle requires that the punishment imposed for a crime be proportional to its seriousness. In Hoare v The Queen [1989] HCA 33; 167 CLR 348 it was said (at 354) that a sentence should “never exceed that which can be justified as appropriate or proportionate to the gravity of the crime considered in the light of its objective circumstances”.
	
	
	The totality principle requires, when multiple offences are involved, that the sentencing judge ensure that the total effective sentence imposed not exceed the overall criminality involved in the offences. In Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; 166 CLR 59 (after referring to the statement of the totality principle in David Arthur Thomas, Principles of Sentencing, (2nd ed 1979, Heinemann Educational) at 56-57), Wilson, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ said (at 63) that, having calculated the appropriate sentence for each offence, the sentencing judge could proceed to give effect to that principle “either by making [the] sentences wholly or partially concurrent or by lowering the individual sentences below what would otherwise be appropriate in order to reflect the fact that a number of sentences are being imposed”.
	
	
	In Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; 78 ALJR 616 it was argued that this statement was inconsistent with the position being as summarised in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at [45] that a “judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality”. This was said to exclude the second course described in Mill of lowering each sentence and then aggregating them before determining the overall time to be served.
	
	
	In rejecting this submission, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ said at [26]:
	


The first matter to be noticed in this regard is that the joint judgment in Pearce recognises the currency of Mill by referring to the principle of totality which it reiterates [citing the passage at [45]]. The joint judgment in Mill expresses a preference for what should be regarded as the orthodox, but not necessarily immutable, practice of fixing a sentence for each offence and aggregating them before taking the next step of determining concurrency. Pearce does not decree that a sentencing judge may never lower each sentence and then aggregate them for determining the time to be served. To do that, is not to do what the joint judgment in Pearce holds to be undesirable, that is, to have regard only to the total effective sentence to be imposed on an offender. The preferable course will usually be the one which both cases commend but neither absolutely commands. Judges of first instance should be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime under which the sentencing is effected. … [emphasis in original]


	
	Of particular relevance in the present context is the Court’s emphasis on the need for the adoption of an approach that correctly and consistently applies the totality principle, necessarily after taking account of the statutory regime under which the sentencing exercise is to occur. Here that regime (s 13A) enabled the Supreme Court to vary an existing life sentence by fixing a minimum term of imprisonment and an additional term during which the prisoner might be released on parole. Applications for the exercise of that power could be made many years after the life sentence was imposed and in circumstances where other sentences also had been imposed, either before, at the same time as, or after the relevant life sentence, and in respect of conduct that may or may not have been related to the conduct for which the life sentence was imposed.
	
	
	At the time the application was before McInerney J, s 13A(9) provided that in exercising that function, the Court was “to have regard to”:
	


(a)   the knowledge of the original sentencing court that a person sentenced to imprisonment for life was eligible to be released on licence under section 463 of the Crimes Act 1900 and of the practice relating to the issue of such licences, and

(b)   any report on the person made by the Review Council and any other relevant reports prepared after sentence (including, for example, reports on the person's rehabilitation), being in either case reports made available to the Supreme Court, and

(c)   any relevant comments made by the original sentencing court when imposing the sentence, and

(d)   the age of the person (at the time the person committed the offence and also at the time the Supreme Court deals with the application),

and may have regard to any other relevant matter.


	
	Most significantly, s 13A(5) provided that the minimum term of any re-determined sentence was to commence on the date on which the original sentence commenced or, if the person had been remanded in custody for the offence, on the date on which the first such remand commenced. That provision restricted the ability of the Court when re-determining more than one life sentence, or making a re-determination in circumstances where the offender had been sentenced for other crimes, to consider questions of cumulation and concurrency, not only in order to avoid double punishment in an appropriate overall sentence, but also in order to ensure that the offender was appropriately punished for those other crimes.
	
	
	These difficulties were confronted by Hunt CJ at CL in R v Purdey (1992) 65 A Crim R 441. There the application under s 13A was made in circumstances where, before the life sentence for murder had been imposed, Purdey had been sentenced for other serious offences committed before the murder. Hunt CJ at CL said at 446-447:
	


In the ordinary course of events, a judge called upon to sentence a prisoner for murder where he has already been sentenced for nine armed robberies and an escape from lawful custody would usually make the sentence for the murder cumulative upon those sentences already imposed, except in relation to those offences which were committed as part of a connected and roughly contemporaneous series of offences. However, before accumulating the sentence for murder upon those already imposed for the other crimes, the judge would be obliged to consider whether the simple addition of two or more sentences which may individually be appropriate has nevertheless produced a total figure which is excessive having regard to the totality of the criminality involved: …

Such a cumulative sentence, however, is not permitted when imposing a fresh sentence pursuant to s 13A. …

It has always been the law that, where a judge has to impose sentences in relation to a number of offences, it does not matter very much whether he or she accumulates reduced sentences (so as to take the principle of totality into account) or makes longer sentences concurrent – provided of course that each individual sentence remains proportionate to the crime to which it relates. It has never been the law that, when the sentences are made concurrent, the longest of the sentences imposed must be determined without reference to the crimes to which the other concurrent sentences relate.

…

As the judge resentencing pursuant to s 13A is precluded from making the fresh sentence cumulative upon others which the prisoner was serving when the original life sentence was imposed – or would have been serving when sentenced for the murder in the ordinary course of events – he or she must therefore make the sentence for murder longer to take those other crimes into account, provided that the sentence imposed for the murder remains individually proportionate to the crime for which it is imposed. Again, to hold otherwise would effectively mean that the applicant would not be punished for those other crimes.


	
	On the appeal from that determination Carruthers J (Gleeson CJ and Mahoney JA relevantly agreeing) accepted the correctness of these observations as to the principles to be applied when re-sentencing under s 13A: R v Purdey (1993) 31 NSWLR 668 at 669, 670, 679-680.
	
	
	In Fenech (Supreme Court (NSW), 4 September 1997, unrep) Barr J applied the same approach in a case where the offender had been sentenced for other serious crimes after the life sentence had been imposed. He said (at 18):
	


I think in view of these authorities that the proper approach in redetermining a life sentence is to take into account subsequent offences and sentences not only for the purpose of ascertaining the applicant's stage of rehabilitation but in order to fashion a redetermined sentence which will ensure that the applicant does not go unpunished or insufficiently punished for offences for which he is sentenced after the life sentence. I think that the principle enunciated by Hunt CJ at CL in R v Purdey … applies to cases like this one just as it applies to life sentences which are imposed on prisoners already serving sentences.

And (at 20-21):

There seems to be no utility in the approach contended for [that a sentence imposed after the life sentence was imposed should not be taken into account]. No argument of principle has been put forward justifying such a construction by reference to any need, in redetermining a life sentence, to ensure that a prisoner does not go unpunished for sentences which he was serving when the life term was imposed but not for sentences imposed thereafter. It seems to me that the interests of the community in ensuring that prisoners serve proper sentences for their crimes apply as much to sentences which are imposed after a life sentence as to sentences which are current when the life sentence takes effect.

I therefore propose to take the subsequently imposed sentences into account in assessing the minimum term of the redetermined sentence. Because the applicant was already serving his life sentence, the Courts sentencing him for those two offences did not fix non-parole periods. They would otherwise have done so. I shall take that into account. I shall also take into account that the applicant would have earned remissions from those non-parole periods. I shall also take into account the principle of totality.


	
	With effect from 9 May 1997, s 13A was amended by the insertion of subs 4A (Sentencing Legislation Further Amendment Act 1997 (NSW)) which provided:
	


In considering such an application, the Supreme Court is to have regard to all the circumstances surrounding the offence for which the life sentence was imposed, and all offences, wherever committed, of which the person has been convicted at any time (so far as this information is reasonably available to the Supreme Court).


	
	In R v Picknell (Supreme Court (NSW), 10 November 1998, unrep) Wood CJ at CL also applied Purdey in circumstances where the offender had been sentenced for other crimes after the life sentence had been imposed. He observed (at 13):
	


It is proper, in that respect, to take into account any offences of which the applicant has been convicted since the murders, and the sentences imposed in respect of them, not only so far as that might assist in determining the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation, but also in order to fashion a redetermined sentence which is appropriate and takes into account the principle of totality.

As cumulative sentences are not permitted, by reason of s 13A(5), any concurrent sentence now imposed for the murders must be extended to take into account the other crimes of which the applicant has been convicted, provided that the redetermined sentences remain proportionate to the crimes for which they are imposed.

So much is clear from the amendment to s 13A in 1997 which inserted a subsection (4A) …


	
	The correctness of this approach and its consistency with the application of the totality principle in Pearce was considered by this Court in R v Salameh [1999] NSWCCA 300 and R v Maiden [2000] NSWCCA 519. In Salameh it was said that the sentencing judge (also McInerney J) had erred in taking into account sentences imposed after the life sentence. Wood CJ at CL (Newman J and Foster AJ agreeing) rejected that submission and the consequent argument that the primary judge had not correctly applied the totality principle as described in Mill and Pearce. Citing this Court’s decision in Spinks, his Honour noted that it was not in question that the totality principle applied to a determination of minimum and additional terms under s 13A.
	
	
	Wood CJ at CL continued in Salameh:
	


[32]   In accordance with the principle expressed in Mill as explained in Pearce, his Honour was required to consider what was an appropriate sentence for each of the offences and then to apply the totality principle to ensure that the criminality involved in all of them was appropriately but not doubly punished.

…

[34]   The sentencing exercise which his Honour had to take into account was, no doubt, complicated by the fact that the applicant had been sentenced to a series of sentences for offences both preceding and following the offence of murder.

[35]   By reason of section 13A(5) of the Sentencing Act 1989, it was necessary for his Honour to backdate the murder sentence to the date of the first remand. It was not possible for him to accumulate the sentence upon any of the other sentences. His Honour was, however, bound to take into account the sentences imposed [after the murder sentence], as well as the sentences he had imposed, back in 1987, for offences other than the murder, in order to undertake the exercise required by Pearce, and then to achieve a result which reflected the totality of the criminality. In so doing it was open to him to foreshorten the sentence for the offence of murder so as to achieve a total result that reflected all of the criminality involved, without any element of double punishment.


	
	In Maiden it was again submitted that the judge re-determining the sentence (Dunford J) had erred in taking into account that an otherwise appropriate murder sentence had to be backdated and that doing so would, unless that sentence was made longer, leave the offender unpunished for other offences of which he had been convicted and sentenced. Whealy J (Sully and Howie JJ agreeing) rejected that argument, referring to Salameh and emphasising the significance of s 13A(5) in the sentencing exercise under s 13A:
	


[26]   In my opinion, it is important to bear in mind that the sentencing process involved in the determination process under s 13A is one in which there are specific statutory requirements and restraints which affect, or are capable of affecting, basic sentencing principles. This extends to principles such as the one referred to at para 45 in Pearce. For example, subs (5) of 13A prevents the Court from making the re-determined minimum term cumulative on sentences already being served by the offender at the time when the original sentence was imposed. Similarly, subs (4A) requires the re-determining Court to have regard to all the circumstances regarding the offence for which the life sentence was imposed, and all offences, wherever committed, of which the person has been convicted at any time. Thirdly, the Court is to have regard to a number of matters set out in subs (9). Considerations of this kind would not normally be part of the sentencing process.


	
	The task facing McInerney J was to re-determine the life sentence fixed for the murder of Mr Lamb in circumstances where there had been concurrent sentences of 15 years imposed for each shooting offence, which by 1997 had been served, and a further concurrent (and re-determined) sentence imposed for the conspiracy to murder Mrs Morse. In considering the appropriate sentences for the murder and conspiracy offences, his Honour noted that whilst he could have regard to the applicant’s criminal history, that could not lead to the imposition of sentences that were disproportionate to the gravity of those offences (Judgment at 27).
	
	
	In determining an appropriate sentence for the conspiracy offence, McInerney J took into account the aggravating circumstances described in [33] above. He held an appropriate sentence for that offence to be 25 years imprisonment (Judgment at 61). In considering the appropriate sentence for the murder of Mr Lamb, his Honour had earlier concluded that the applicant’s involvement in that offence did not constitute the “most serious type of murder for the purpose of setting an appropriate determinate sentence” (Judgment at 26).
	
	
	His Honour then took into account the operation of s 13A(5) which prevented him from making the re-determined sentences wholly or partly cumulative with each other, or with the sentences for the other two crimes (Judgment at 60). That being the position, it was necessary that the re-determined, and necessarily concurrent, appropriate sentence to be imposed for the murder, in the language of Wood CJ at CL in Picknell, be “extended” to ensure that the applicant did not go unpunished or insufficiently punished for the other three offences, and in particular the conspiracy to murder.
	
	
	At the same time, as McInerney J also noted, it was necessary to ensure that the severity of the overall sentence was not “too much” (per Lord Parker LCJ in Reg v Faulkner (1972) 56 Cr App R 594 at 596) in the context of the applicant’s overall culpability. Finally, it was identified as relevant that the applicant would “need constant supervision and guidance for the rest of his life, if and when he [was] released from gaol” (Judgment at 60).
	
	
	His Honour’s statement that the “longest” sentence was designed “to reflect the overall criminality involved in all the offences” is to be understood as taking account of each of these considerations, so as to ensure that the applicant did not go unpunished for the other three offences (the sentences for which had been or were to be served concurrently) and that the overall sentence was just and appropriate.
	
	
	His Honour did not err in approaching the exercise of re-determination in this way and in this case the considerations to which he referred warranted the determination of a sentence with an additional term for the remainder of the applicant’s natural life. As his Honour acknowledged, the applicant’s involvement in Mr Lamb’s murder cannot be characterised as a most serious or worst case of the offence. However, if an appropriate sentence could have been imposed for the murder and at least part of it ordered to be served cumulatively, it would not have commenced until after the applicant had been appropriately punished for the conspiracy to murder Mrs Morse and the remaining two offences. The minimum term of 30 years and additional term of life imposed for Mr Lamb’s murder reflect that outcome.
	
	
	In his written submissions, the applicant refers to the sentences imposed in R v Hill [2003] NSWCCA 128; R v Valiukas [2009] NSWSC 808 and R v Cousens [2011] NSWSC 1375. None of these decisions involved the re-determination of a life sentence in circumstances where there were other concurrent sentences served, or to be served. The head sentences imposed for those murders ranged between 18 and 30 years. Each obviously depended on the objective circumstances of the relevant crime and took account of the subjective features of each offender. The applicant submits that, although in these cases head sentences in that range were imposed for murders of varying degrees of seriousness, the sentence he has served for the murder of Mr Lamb is “41 years 8 months”. That is not so. As the discussion above shows, the time that the applicant has spent in gaol has not been referable only to that offence. The true position, as I have explained and McInerney J said, is that the minimum and additional term “reflect the overall criminality involved in all the offences” (Judgment at 60).
	
	
	For these reasons, no error of principle is disclosed in McInerney J’s re-determination of the applicant’s life sentence for Mr Lamb’s murder. Nor is the outcome of that exercise manifestly or obviously excessive. The same analysis demonstrates why that is so. For completeness I note that it was not suggested by the applicant that his Honour erred in the finding of any facts that were taken into account in the re-determination exercise.
	


Remaining arguments of the applicant


	
	I will deal briefly with the remaining two matters raised by the applicant (see [20] above). As to the first, for the reasons given above, the primary judge correctly took into account the sentence imposed for the conspiracy to murder and the fact that it was to be served concurrently, when re-determining the sentence for Mr Lamb’s murder. As to the second, I accept that the comments made by Taylor J when sentencing the applicant would not be relevant to the determination of his proposed appeal. Their lasting significance to the applicant is that they constitute a “non-release recommendation”, and that remains the position because of the definition of that expression (s 13A(1)) notwithstanding that McInerney J, when re-determining his life sentence, did not make such a recommendation.
	


Whether this Court has power, in the event that there was error, to determine a specified term for the life sentence


	
	The absence of such power is raised by the Crown as a separate reason for refusing the application for an extension of the time in which to seek leave to appeal. The argument made by the Crown in support of that submission was brief and, understandably, no response was made to it by the applicant. In view of my conclusion that the proposed appeal does not have reasonable prospects of success, it is unnecessary ultimately to decide this question in order to dispose of the application for leave to appeal. However, whether the applicant’s pursuit of the opportunity to appeal is futile because this Court cannot reduce his existing head sentence of life imprisonment remains relevant to his application for an extension of time. For that reason I propose to express my view as to this Court’s power in the event that it was satisfied that there had been error on the part of McInerney J.
	
	
	By cl 21(3) of Sch 2 to the 1999 Act, McInerney J’s determination (although made under the 1989 Act) was taken to be a determination under cl 4 of Sch 1 to the later Act. Accordingly the applicant’s right of appeal was conferred by cl 8(1)(a) of Sch 1 to the 1999 Act. That right arose upon the 1999 Act’s commencement on 3 April 2000 and replaced the right of appeal arising under the 1989 Act in respect of that determination. At the time McInerney J’s determination was taken to have been made under cl 4, that clause contained no restriction on the Supreme Court’s power to determine applications made by offenders subject to a “non-release recommendation”. As is explained in [9] above, that restriction took effect from July 2001.
	
	
	By cl 8(2) of Sch 1, the Criminal Appeal Act applied to that appeal in the same way that it applied to an appeal against sentence. An appeal against sentence is governed by s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act. The power of this Court to re-sentence (or in this case to re-determine the life sentence) is conferred by s 6(3):
	


On an appeal under section 5(1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.


	
	The power to intervene and duty to re-sentence is enlivened if this Court forms the opinion referred to in that section: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 at [35]. Whether some other sentence “should have been passed” directs attention to the sentencing exercise undertaken and the statutory regime under which it was affected. In other words, the question whether there was error on the part of the sentencing judge is to be addressed by reference to sentencing law and practice at the time the sentence was imposed. In this case, that law did not include cl 4(3).
	
	
	Whether a more or less severe sentence “is warranted in law” requires reconsideration of the sentencing discretion “taking into account all relevant statutory requirements and sentencing principles” per Spigelman CJ in Baxter v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284 at [19], in a passage approved by the plurality in Kentwell at [42].
	
	
	The issue raised by the Crown’s argument is whether in this case the “relevant statutory requirements and sentencing principles” include cl 4(3), which in its terms is directed to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in disposing of an “application in relation to an existing life sentence”. In that respect it is immediately to be contrasted with Pt 3 of the 1999 Act which lays down the sentencing procedures to be applied by a “court”, which by s 3(1) includes the Supreme Court and the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	The power conferred on this Court by s 6(3) is to pass “such other sentence”, being the sentence that it is of opinion “is warranted in law” and “should have been passed”. The use of the present tense in the expression “is warranted in law” indicates that regard must be had to the current law to the extent that it is intended to operate with respect to any re-sentencing exercise undertaken by this Court in the face of error on the part of the sentencing judge. For any law to have such an operation requires a very clear indication that it is intended to do so. As Mason CJ and McHugh J observed in Radenkovic v The Queen [1990] HCA 54; 170 CLR 623 at 632:
	


In the context of an appeal against sentence, when a court of criminal appeal is called upon to resentence because it has quashed the sentence initially imposed, considerations of justice and equity ordinarily require that the convicted person be resentenced according to the law as it stood at the time when he was initially sentenced, particularly when that law was more favourable to him than the law as it existed at the hearing of the appeal. The convicted person had an entitlement when he was sentenced by the sentencing judge to a sentence imposed in conformity with the requirements of the law as it then stood. He should not be denied that entitlement simply because the sentencing judge made a mistake, whether that mistake resulted in a sentence that was too harsh or too lenient. In our view it would require a very clear indication of statutory intention to displace that entitlement.


	
	It is only where Parliament manifests an intention “that a new sentencing regime operate retrospectively, [that] the courts will give effect to that intention”: per Spigelman CJ in R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; 54 NSWLR 368 at [26].
	
	
	Clause 4(3) does not purport to apply to an exercise or re-exercise of the power to make a determination under cl 4(1) by the Court of Criminal Appeal. In its terms it applies only to the determination by the Supreme Court of an application “in relation to an existing life sentence” and must be taken to refer to such an application under cl 2(1) of Sch 1. The language reveals an intention that it operate prospectively in relation to such applications made to the Supreme Court, and not otherwise.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that cl 4 is merely procedural, and for that reason should be given a retrospective operation. That submission must be rejected. As was observed by McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ in Baker v The Queen at [32], s 13A both created new rights and conferred jurisdiction on the Supreme Court to alter or vary the order of the sentencing judge. Clause 4(3) qualifies those rights as created, limits the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to alter or vary the order of the sentencing judge in such cases and does so in a way which is substantially detrimental to the applicant.
	


Applications for extension of time and leave to appeal


	
	The applicant was required to give notice of his intention to apply for leave to appeal within 28 days of the determination of McInerney J. Section 10(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act permits the Court to extend that time. Such a power exists to ensure that the provisions fixing the time for making an appeal or seeking leave to appeal do not become “instruments of injustice” and enables the Court to extend time where that is necessary to do justice between the parties: per McHugh J in Gallo v Dawson [1990] HCA 30; 64 ALJR 458 at [2]. Ordinarily, it will be necessary to consider the nature of and reasons for any delay, the prospects of the proposed appeal and the significance to the parties of the granting or refusing of the application for an extension of time. This last matter is of particular relevance in this case.
	
	
	The application for leave to appeal was filed nearly 18 years out of time. In his affidavit in support of the application for an extension of time the applicant says (with minor corrections):
	


The reason I have taken so long to get this appeal in, [is that] I have been trying to get an appeal in since 1997 when I got my redetermination. I asked Will Hutchins [the Principal Legal Officer at Prisoner’s Legal Service at Legal Aid NSW] over and over requesting for him to put an appeal in, but he would not. Then on 9 May 2012 I received a letter from him telling [me] to try NSW Legal Aid. I could not get any help from them.

I was told about the application for Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal. So over the past two years I have been trying to put it together myself. I do understand what I was told about the paperwork needed for the court so that the prosecutor and court would know why I am trying to appeal. I have even asked Legal Aid here from Dubbo if they could help me put my paperwork together. I was told that they would not [because] no one at Dubbo could help me put it together.

So I don’t know what else I can do, but what I have with the last application I sent in on 20-4-2015. But ask that it be approved so that I can get something done about my sentence and have some justice done in my matter.


	
	The applicant’s affidavit does not indicate what advice or reasons he might have received which would explain the absence of any assistance from the Legal Aid Commission in relation to the making of his present application. In the past he has been able to bring proceedings with the benefit of legal aid or other representation. In 1994 he appealed from the decision of Loveday J and, much later, challenged the validity of s 154A in the High Court in Crump v State of New South Wales. In these circumstances it is difficult to exclude as one explanation for his undoubted delay in making the present application that he was unable to secure the assistance of legal aid because his proposed appeal was assessed as not having good prospects of success. That being the position is consistent with the view that I have formed, albeit after a detailed consideration of the merits of the proposed appeal.
	
	
	Nevertheless a successful outcome could have real significance for the applicant (if on any re-determination by this Court a specified term was set) in view of the enactment of s 154A which has effectively eliminated the prospect for him of release on parole other than in very limited circumstances (see [16] above). His challenge to that legislation was dismissed on 4 May 2012. From that time the only remaining course presenting the possibility of release during his life-time (in circumstances other than those contemplated by s 154A) was a successful appeal from the determination of McInerney J. The applicant’s pursuit of the challenge to s 154A may partly explain his delay in making the present application.
	
	
	There is undoubtedly a public interest in the avoidance of delay in the bringing of appeals against sentence and in ensuring the outcome of finality in sentencing litigation. However, the circumstances of the present case are exceptional, especially taking into account the enactment of s 154A, its effect on the sentence imposed by McInerney J and the applicant’s unsuccessful challenge to that legislation. The applicant delayed a further two years from May 2012 before making his present application for leave. He is now 66 years of age and has spent over 42 years in custody. Notwithstanding my view that his appeal does not have good prospects of success, the interests of justice required that he be given the opportunity to argue his application for leave and have this Court’s fairly extensive reasons for rejecting it.
	
	
	Nonetheless, in the light of those reasons, his application for leave to appeal should be dismissed.
	


Conclusion


	
	The orders I propose are:
	


1.   Extend the time for the applicant to apply for leave to appeal up to and including 23 April 2015.

2.   Dismiss the application for leave to appeal from the determination of McInerney J of 24 April 1997.


	
	ROTHMAN J: I agree with Meagher JA.
	
	
	BELLEW J: I agree with Meagher JA.

		05 February 2016",2016-02-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2702119,R v RC; R v JM [2016] NSWSC 98,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The trial of RC and a juvenile known as JM was due to commence on Monday 1 February 2016. It was indicated on that day that they had offered to plead guilty to lesser charges. Later that day the Director of Public Prosecutions accepted such offers. On Tuesday 2 February they were arraigned and pleaded guilty: RC to manslaughter and robbery in company and JM to robbery in company and a related summary offence of stealing a motor vehicle.
	
	
	Each of the offences is contrary to provisions of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Manslaughter is an offence contrary to s 18 and the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 25 years. Robbery in company is an offence contrary to s 97(1) and the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years. Stealing a motor vehicle is contrary to s 154F and, when dealt with summarily, the maximum penalty that may be imposed is imprisonment for 2 years.
	
	
	The offences were committed on 25 March 2014. The victim was Mr Anthony O'Grady. In short, Mr O'Grady was lured to a park in Wickham, an inner suburb of Newcastle, where he was robbed and beaten to death by a co-participant in a joint enterprise of four men: Anthony Dent, Jeffrey Schott, RC and JM. JM subsequently went to Mr O'Grady's home and stole his car.
	


Facts


	
	Separate statements of facts were tendered in relation to each offender. The essential narrative is the same although some details appear in one but not the other. I will sentence each man in accordance with the statement of facts tendered in their respective cases but there is not much difference.
	
	
	The statement of facts in JM’s case include that he was living on the streets and in that context he met Jeffrey Schott and stayed with him for at least one night. As at the date of the offences JM had known Dent for about a week.
	
	
	Sometime during the day of 25 March 2014 at a meeting of RC, Dent, Schott and JM at Dent’s home, a plan was hatched to lure the deceased to a park at Wickham in order to rob him. The plan was to have JM introduce the deceased to Dent. They were to entice him to the park by suggesting that if he brought some alcohol there would be girls who would have sex with him. RC and Schott were to hide in the park with rope. Dent was to tie Mr O’Grady up and obtain his bank account personal identification numbers (""PINs"").
	
	
	JM went to the deceased’s home and told him that he should come down to Islington Park because there was a party there. JM said that if the deceased brought the beers there were going to be plenty of girls at the party for everybody.
	
	
	Between about 6.00pm and 8.00pm, text messages were exchanged between JM, Schott and Dent, mostly between the latter two (but none involving RC), in which they relayed the progress of the luring of Mr O’Grady in the company of JM to the park. The tenor of the messages indicates that Dent was primarily involved in giving directions in response to information relayed mostly by Schott and in one instance by JM. The statements of facts include reference to a female being present at least by the time everyone got to the park, but who she was and how she came to be present is not clear. It is not evident that she was involved in the joint enterprise or played any role.
	
	
	Ultimately, at about 8.00pm when Mr O’Grady was in the park in the company of JM, the female and Dent, the latter started to hit Mr O’Grady causing him to fall to the ground. Dent struck him some more and started to take his pants off. JM and the female walked some distance away.
	
	
	RC and Schott were nearby. Dent had his foot on the deceased’s back trying to subdue him. He obtained some rope from Schott. (In his evidence in the sentence proceedings, RC said that both Dent and Schott tied Mr O'Grady up.) Dent removed the deceased’s pants and checked his pockets. He used the deceased’s underpants to gag him. He threw the deceased’s car and house keys to JM and told him to go to the deceased’s house and take his car and all his belongings. JM left the park in the company of Schott and the female.
	
	
	JM and the female went to the deceased’s home and took his car which had a trailer attached. They did not go inside the house because people were there. JM drove the car away and met Schott at a nearby park. (What happened to the female is not apparent.) After Schott had entered the car he received a call from Dent who told him that he was going back to the park to get the PINs from the deceased. (Dent had made an unsuccessful attempt at using the deceased’s bank card to withdraw money at an ATM.)
	
	
	JM and Schott drove to an isolated area along Ash Creek. Schott manoeuvred the car so as to drive it into the creek. In the statement of facts in RC’s case it is said that JM and Schott then went to Dent’s home. There, in the presence of RC, Dent told them something about the deceased’s PINs not working.
	
	
	At about 6.15am the following day (26 March 2014) the deceased’s body was found in the park. Police were called and an investigation began.
	
	
	JM was spoken to by an undercover operative on 17 April 2014. He said that if he had known that Dent was going to assault Mr O’Grady he would never have taken part in the enterprise.
	
	
	JM was arrested on 24 April 2014. On 29 September 2014 he participated in an interview with police. He said that he did not want Mr O'Grady hurt during the robbery and claimed that Dent told him that he was not going to hit him. (JM was granted and released on bail on the day of this interview but he breached the bail which was revoked on 5 November 2014.)
	
	
	RC was arrested in Queensland and extradited on 9 October 2014. In a police interview he admitted that he had known Dent from having met him in gaol and had run into him some three weeks before the incident involving the deceased. He admitted that an arrangement had been made to rob him.
	
	
	RC was again interviewed on 4 November 2014. He said that he went to the park with Schott and that he saw Dent punch the deceased. He said he (RC) took a backpack from the deceased which he left at Dent’s home. He also said that he knew he was going to the park in order to rob the deceased and that force would be used. He knew Dent had been in custody in the past for a double murder and that he was a man who was prone to violence.
	
	
	The statement of facts tendered in RC’s case concludes with a statement of his criminal liability:
	


“On the 25th March 2014 RC agreed to and participated in the robbery of the deceased at Wickham Park, Hamilton (Common purpose). The person Anthony O’Grady died as a result of the robbery which was an unlawful and dangerous act. The offender RC knew the co-accused Dent for a lengthy period of time and that he had a propensity for violence and that participating in the robbery was unlawful and dangerous.”


	
	The statement of facts tendered in JM's case concludes with a statement as to his criminal liability:
	


""On the 25th March 2014, [JM] arranged and participated in the robbery of the deceased at Wickham Park, Hamilton. Due to [JM's] limited knowledge of the co-accused Dent it was not within his contemplation that the accused Dent would inflict grievous bodily harm upon Anthony O'Grady and cause his death.""

Further material derived from RC’s interview


	
	A transcript of the police interview of RC on 4 November 2014 was tendered in his case. In that interview he provided a version of events which at the end of the interview he indicated was one he was prepared to give in evidence. In addition to what is disclosed in the statement of facts, RC told police that he had been staying at Dent's flat for about two weeks. He had met Dent in gaol a few years earlier when Dent had told him that he was ""in for double murder"". He said Dent was ""all right in gaol""; he spoke well and was never violent.
	
	
	The plan to rob Mr O'Grady was made on 25 March 2014 when the four men were at Dent's flat. They had been using drugs (ice) and wanted to get some money to acquire more drugs. JM said that he knew a man who had come into a lot of money and was in the habit of carrying $5000 around at times. Dent said he wanted to rob this man. RC understood that Dent would rob Mr O'Grady once he had been lured into the park and that the others would be present to assist in some unspecified way if required. RC expected to receive drugs acquired from the proceeds of the robbery.
	
	
	RC told police that Dent was yelling at Mr O'Grady, ""Give me your money"". Mr O'Grady said that he did not have any. Dent punched him to the face and then kicked him in the face as Mr O'Grady was falling to the ground. RC said that ""they"" were ripping Mr O'Grady's clothes off and Schott helped Dent to tie Mr O'Grady up. He heard Mr O'Grady saying, ""Please stop"" and ""Please leave me alone"". He said that Mr O'Grady had been trying to get up but he was too weak ""and then they rolled him over on his belly and got the rope and started tying him"". Schott had brought the rope from Dent's flat. (I note that in his oral evidence, RC said that he was not aware of the rope until they were at the park.) Dent also put something in Mr O'Grady's mouth, his underpants or shorts he (RC) thought. Dent gave RC the man's backpack and told him to take it back to Dent's flat. Dent took Mr O'Grady's bum bag which RC saw contained his wallet and credit cards.
	
	
	RC returned to Dent's flat and waited there. He understood that Dent went elsewhere to acquire drugs. He said that he was worried and really scared of Dent ""doin' something stupid. Like, 'cause he'd killed someone he was gunna come back after all of us so he had no witnesses"". In a telephone call he heard Dent saying that he needed to get rid of all witnesses; ""all witnesses have got to go"". RC said that he was frightened and he panicked. He fled from Dent's flat, leaving his possessions behind. He made his way to Queensland where he was ultimately arrested.
	
	
	RC was asked why he had given a different account when first spoken to by detectives. He said: ""I was just frightened. I am frightened of Tony Dent. I'm scared. Scared to death of him."" In his evidence last Friday he explained: ""I was scared he'd do what he'd done to the deceased and I still am scared"".
	


Further material derived from JM's conversations with police


	
	In the case of JM, also tendered were statements of two police officers and transcripts of his conversation with the undercover operative on 17 April 2014 and his police interview of 29 September 2014. The two police statements indicate that in a random interaction with JM on 4 April 2014 he raised the subject of the recent murder at Wickham and told the officers that Tony Dent was the person police should speak to.
	
	
	In the conversation with the undercover operative, JM gave a detailed account of what occurred on 25 March 2014. It included that he walked away when Dent commenced to assault Mr O'Grady. However, Dent called to him to get the rope and JM relayed that request to Schott. Dent then ""hog tied"" Mr O'Grady with no pants on. JM described Mr O'Grady as ""my best mate""; ""he fed me, bought me food, shouted me to my first brothel"".
	
	
	The version JM gave in the interview of 29 September 2014 was preceded by him making the usual acknowledgment that it represented the evidence he would be prepared to give in court as a witness and that it was true to the best of his knowledge and belief. He said that Dent was in debt to drug suppliers and money was needed to pay the debt and to obtain more ice for Dent, RC and Schott. The plan to rob Mr O'Grady was first suggested by Schott. JM said he was not agreeable but Dent insisted that JM point out Mr O'Grady to him, ""otherwise he was gonna hurt me"". During the events in the park, Dent made threats that if JM did not do as he was told he would be killed. JM took such threats seriously because, he said ""every few words out of that man's mouth were, 'I've already done two life sentences, I'm not afraid to go back to gaol'"". Dent had shown him old newspaper articles concerning a murder in Wickham Park.
	


Personal circumstances of RC


	
	RC was born in 1968 and so he was aged 46 at the time of the offences. He was the youngest of four children. His parents have been deceased for some time. He told a psychologist, Ms Rima Nasr, that his sisters and brother were pro-social in terms of having secure employment, stable housing and families whereas he had led a largely itinerant lifestyle and had only antisocial peers since the age of 13. He was forced to leave the family home at around that time. Although he was not the subject of any abuse or neglect, his parents found his behavioural issues difficult to control. He was expelled from school on the second day of Year 7 for having thrown a teacher down some stairs. Accordingly, his education has been extremely limited and his literacy is poor. He has not worked since the age of 21, having subsisted on government benefits, and has no desire to work in the future.
	
	
	RC was closest to his father who died 22 years ago and from that time he ceased caring about anything, engaged in increased substance use and antisocial behaviour and disregarded authority by ""not listening to anyone"". He ceased contact with his siblings from that time. He has a long history of substance abuse including heroin and then methylamphetamine (ice). There have been no significant periods of abstinence. He failed to complete a Drug Court program five years ago. When withdrawing from substances he typically experienced paranoid symptomatology. Whether there is a mental condition of any significance was found difficult by Ms Nasr to gauge, given the limited periods in which he has been abstinent, but she considered it important for him to have a mental health assessment in custody in order to determine whether he needs psychotropic medication.
	
	
	RC has had one long term relationship from the age of 17 to 41 which saw the birth of six children but said he had been repeatedly unfaithful and had five other children to different women. He does not have any relationship with any of the children.
	
	
	He has an extensive criminal history which commenced in the Children’s Court in 1985. He was first gaoled in 1989 for stealing a car when he was aged 20. There are quite a few entries for dishonesty and driving offences, the latter to the extent to which he has been gaoled on a number of occasions for driving whilst disqualified. There have been only a few instances of violent offences and they are relatively minor; they include an assault in 1988 (fined); the serious assault of a police officer in 2000 (suspended sentence); intimidating and resisting a police officer in 2001 (fined); and another assault in 2010 (fined). His longest gaol sentence (2 years 7 months) was imposed in 2006 for an offence of break, enter and commit serious indictable offence in company.
	
	
	In May 2013 at the Warwick Magistrates Court RC received a sentence of 12 months' imprisonment. A parole release date of 17 October 2013 was specified. It has been conceded that he was therefore on parole as at 25 March 2014. This represents a significant aggravating factor.
	
	
	Ms Nasr conducted a psychometric assessment. In determining his intellectual functioning RC was found to have a verbal ability in the extremely low range (better than 0.5% of the normative sample for his age). He was in the low average range (better than 21%) on a scale assessing perceptual reasoning. The latter is said to be indicative of him having difficulty understanding and weighing up the consequences of his actions, resulting in impulsivity and lack of forethought. He was found to struggle with more complex cognitive tasks such as analysing and comprehending information on the basis of him being in the borderline range on the working memory scale (above 4%). He was also in the borderline range (better than 8%) on a scale measuring processing speed.
	
	
	Overall, RC presented with intellectual capacities that fall within the borderline range. He performed better than 3% of his normative age group. This was said to be indicative of impaired overall skill level such that RC is a man of limited cognitive resources. I consider this to be a particularly significant aspect of his subjective case. To a modest degree it reduces his moral culpability in respect of the offences. General deterrence is of less significance than it otherwise would be; but the need for personal deterrence is a countervailing consideration.
	
	
	Ms Nasr recommended that RC access substance use intervention and said that he requires skills and support to address at least harm minimisation as he continues to exhibit an ambivalent attitude at working towards abstinence.
	


Other matters relevant to the assessment of RC’s sentence

Seriousness of the offence


	
	I accept that RC played a lesser role in the commission of the offences than any of the other participants. He was present during the planning and present during the commission of the offences but did not play any actual physical role. His liability is as a participant in the joint criminal enterprise with the three other men. It is not insignificant, however, that he had known the principal participant, Anthony Dent, for quite some time. He knew him to be a criminal who had served time for two murders. The Crown Prosecutor conceded that there was an element of duress involved having regard to the dominance of Dent.
	
	
	Despite his lesser role it remains that RC’s offence of manslaughter is quite serious. Mr O'Grady was tricked into going to Wickham Park where it was intended that he would be robbed of a significant sum of money. He received a brutal beating at the hands of one of the participants who the others knew had a propensity for violence. He was then gagged, bound and left for dead. Whilst the robbery was clearly the subject of planning, I accept the submission of RC’s counsel, Mr Rosser QC, that the violence went beyond anyone's expectation (aside, perhaps, from Dent).
	


Threats of retribution by Anthony Dent


	
	I have already referred to Mr Dent's threat to eliminate witnesses (i.e. his co-participants in the joint criminal enterprise) which prompted RC to immediately flee, ultimately to Queensland. I have also mentioned that when he was returned to New South Wales he lied to police in his first interview on 9 October 2014 out of fear of Dent.
	
	
	RC gave evidence (which was not challenged) that he spent some time on remand at Long Bay. At first he was in the mainstream population of inmates but Dent came to his yard one day and struck him from behind, calling him ""a dog"". The ensuing fight, in which Dent was getting the better of him, was broken up by correctional officers. Thereafter RC went into a form of protective custody but still received threats by others; he said ""they told me, like, 'You're going to cop it in the yard tomorrow when you come out and – 'cause of Tony – dogging Tony up and that'"". He remained in his cell for the next three weeks and was then transferred to another gaol.
	
	
	Mr Dent assaulted RC (and JM) when they were all in the dock on the morning of Monday 1 February 2016. Each of them had been arraigned and entered pleas of not guilty. The matter immediately proceeded to the hearing of legal argument on a point not presently relevant. It was soon interrupted by Dent delivering heavy blows towards JM. Some four or five blows made contact before JM tumbled down the steep flight of stairs leading to the cell complex. Dent then turned his attention to RC, delivering five or six heavy punches to the top of his head while saying, ""Fuck off. If I see you again you fat dog I'll kill both of you"". Order was restored and Dent was removed by custodial officers.
	
	
	I was then informed by the Crown Prosecutor that counsel for both RC and JM had made approaches to her that morning in relation to the prospect of them pleading guilty to lesser charges. I was later informed that the proposal had included that each were prepared to give evidence against Dent. (I have separately expressed my concern that the Court was given no prior warning of a potential security issue.)
	


Pleas of guilty and assistance


	
	RC’s pleas of guilty on 2 February followed his pleas of not guilty to the more serious charges the previous day. I was informed that there had been some tentative inquiries made of the Crown for some time as to the prospect of pleas being accepted to lesser charges. It is, however, the utilitarian benefit flowing from a plea of guilty that informs the level of discount that a person should receive on sentence. In my view, RC’s sentences should be reduced by 10 per cent.
	
	
	RC has undertaken to give evidence in the trial of Dent. Jeffrey Schott is presently a prosecution witness and I was told that the authorities would consider whether he should be charged after Dent's trial has concluded. RC also undertook to give evidence in any trial concerning Schott. In both cases he said he would do so in accordance with the version he gave in his interview with police of 4 November 2014 which the Crown Prosecutor described as perhaps the most truthful of any account given by the various participants in the enterprise.
	
	
	The evidence of RC will be significantly useful in the prosecution of Mr Dent and will also be if Mr Schott is to be prosecuted. Providing such assistance puts RC at risk, not only whilst he is in custody but he will likely need to take care for his safety after his release. The assault by Dent last week is indicative of that.
	
	
	RC indicated at the conclusion of his interview of 4 November 2014 that he was prepared to give that version in evidence. I do not know what happened after that; all I know is that the offer to assist was renewed last Monday morning. There has been no suggestion of RC having already gained some benefit for providing assistance. There is no suggestion of him suffering harsher custodial conditions as a result; he is in a form of protective custody but the conditions do not seem to be much, if at all, different to those experienced by the general inmate population.
	
	
	For his undertaking to assist authorities by giving evidence in future proceedings I will reduce the sentences to be imposed by 30 per cent. In making this assessment I have been mindful of the need to ensure that the ultimate sentence is not disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offences.
	
	
	Combining these, the sentences to be imposed will be reduced by about 40 per cent (there will be some rounding for practical purposes).
	


Other subjective matters


	
	I accept that RC is remorseful for his offending conduct. His willingness to tell police the truth was evident from the day after his first, concededly untruthful, interview of 9 October 2014. He told detectives the following day that he wanted to tell the truth and it was only because of logistical and operational difficulties that he could not be further interviewed until 4 November 2014. He expressed his regret for what occurred in the course of his evidence in the sentencing hearing last Friday. He might not be the most articulate of men but I get the distinct impression that he is trying to do what is right to make up for his wrongdoing, even though it entails significant risk to his wellbeing.
	
	
	Mr Rosser submitted that his client had ""some prospects"" of rehabilitation and I think that is the highest it can be put. He said in his evidence that he has been undertaking literacy courses in gaol and aspires to attain a Year 10 level of education. Hopefully he will make some gains in those respects but he really needs to give serious attention to dealing with his entrenched drug problem and the acquisition of some vocational skills; his prospects of not re-offending are significantly dependent upon him doing so. However, I think it is fair to say that his prospects of re-offending in a fashion similar to the index offences are minimal given the absence of anything so serious in his past and also that these offences were committed largely because of RC’s short-lived association with Anthony Dent.
	


Other matters relevant to sentence for RC


	
	It was common ground that the criminality involved in the robbery offence was subsumed within that in the manslaughter offence and for this reason the sentences should be ordered to be served concurrently. I accept that to be correct.
	
	
	The sentence for the offence of robbery in company will be less than the non-parole period specified for the offence of manslaughter. For this reason there is no utility in setting a non-parole period for the former.
	
	
	It was also common ground that RC has been in custody bail refused since 9 October 2014 and his sentences should be backdated accordingly.
	
	
	No submission was made that I should find special circumstances justifying enlargement of the parole period of the sentence at the expense of the non-parole period but I have considered the issue nonetheless. In the end I have concluded that RC’s prospects of rehabilitation are insufficiently promising to think that he would benefit from a longer period of parole supervision.
	


Personal circumstances of JM


	
	JM was almost 18 years of age at the time of the offence. His father lives in Mayfield and his mother in Melbourne. He is close to his father. His parents separated when he was 18 months old and he lived with his paternal grandparents until he was aged 8 or 9. He was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age five. His grandmother did not look after him well. He nearly drowned in a swimming pool at the age of 9 and, after a stay in Westmead Children's Hospital he was placed in foster care. He was a ward of the State from that time because his father was not considered suitable to care for him.
	
	
	JM's father told Dr Mary Jurek, psychiatrist, that JM's mother used illicit substances during the pregnancy and used to hit her belly against door jams, possibly to cause an abortion. Dr Jurek said that this may have caused intrauterine damage and the development of Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder.
	
	
	He experienced many hospital admissions during his teenage years as a result of hyper and hypo glycaemia, including whilst he has been in gaol. He has had seizures and fallen over but has not had any investigations or tests for brain function or acquired brain injury.
	
	
	JM told Dr Jurek that in one of his various foster home placements he was given a shot of heroin and raped by his carer. In another placement he was sexually abused by two male adults. He reported this abuse to his father, police and a foster care service provider but he was not believed.
	
	
	He started using drugs from the age of 13 and has a preference for ice because it helps him to forget. He said he was coming off ice at the time of the robbery of Mr O'Grady.
	
	
	JM told Dr Jurek that his education ceased in Year 6. He was bullied at school because he often came in dirty clothes and without any food. He had been diagnosed with ADHD and was prescribed Ritalin from the age of 6. He also had a learning disability. He ceased using Ritalin when he left school. In recent years he has had ambitions to become a motor mechanic; he attended a TAFE program for about a month. He also wanted to complete his secondary education at TAFE. Prior to going into custody he was receiving a disability support pension because of his learning disability and his diabetes.
	
	
	JM was homeless in the months preceding the offence. He had been living with his stepmother but she evicted him after an argument. He went to stay with his father who he claimed was an alcoholic and he was asked to leave the boarding house after a physical fight. It was in the context of being homeless that he was introduced to Jeffrey Schott who knew Mr O'Grady as well as Anthony Dent. He told Dr Jurek that he was bashed by the latter (but no further detail appears in the doctor's report).
	
	
	JM gave an account to Dr Jurek about the formation of the plan to rob Mr O'Grady that was consistent with what he had told police but there is the additional detail that Dent had a knife and threatened JM with it when he expressed reluctance about the plan. His account of the robbery and its aftermath was also broadly consistent with his earlier accounts.
	
	
	JM reported that he had dreams and ""flashbacks"" about the assault of Mr O'Grady who he regarded as his friend. He told Dr Jurek that he copes with the memories by using heroin and buprenorphine in gaol. He uses dirty needles and is at risk of Hepatitis C and HIV. He also said he hears voices telling him to kill himself but these stopped after he was placed on Seroquel 18 months ago.
	
	
	There have been suicide attempts on many occasions and JM has been admitted to psychiatric units as a child and young person. Dr Jurek noted scars on his left forearm and wrist from self-harming. He told her that he does not want to live any more. He swallowed six razor blades in early 2015.
	
	
	JM told Dr Jurek that he suffers from depression and mood instability. He described being chronically depressed except when he is on drugs.
	
	
	JM has an insignificant criminal history in that there have been only six driving offences for each of which no penalty was imposed.
	
	
	In the ""mental state examination"" part of her report, Dr Jurek included that JM has a facial appearance suggestive of Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. He was not deeply depressed in mood and was not actively suicidal. He impressed as being a poorly educated young man in the low average to borderline range of intelligence. No formal testing was carried out.
	
	
	Dr Jurek made the following diagnoses:
	


1   Neuro-developmental Disorders: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Learning Disability.

2   Type 1 Diabetes – poorly controlled with frequent hypo and hyper glycaemic episodes.

3   Chronic substance abuse – cannabis, heroin and methamphetamine – possible drug induced psychosis in the past.

4   Seizures – possibly due to epilepsy or secondary to diabetes or other cerebral insults. Investigations are required.

5   Personality Disorder – Cluster B – borderline / antisocial traits. Chronic self harm behaviours and suicide attempts.

6   Chronic depression / dysthymia – possibly related to complex psychosocial problems.

7   Some features of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

8   Possible Acquired Brain Injury due to near drowning, poorly controlled diabetes, seizures and chronic substance abuse.


	
	Dr Jurek considered that JM exhibited poor self-esteem, self-confidence and self-assertiveness. She said that having chronic medical problems as a young person would also contribute to his low self-esteem and put him at risk of being manipulated by others.
	


Other matters relevant to the assessment of JM's sentence

Seriousness of the offence


	
	JM played a key role in setting up the robbery. Overall, it was a serious robbery in that it was committed by four men in company, albeit with only one playing a direct active role. There was clearly planning involved with the luring of the victim to the isolated location where it was to be carried out.
	
	
	As between the various participants, Dent was obviously the dominant one. I have no doubt that JM was acting under a level of duress (as the Crown conceded) having regard to the physical size of Dent as compared to JM; what JM understood about Dent's violent past; the threats that Dent made to JM; and the assessment by Dr Jurek that JM was prone to manipulation by others. There was no challenge to his evidence that he reluctantly became involved and that he had an understanding that it would not involve Mr O'Grady being physically hurt. His moral culpability is reduced for these reasons.
	


Fear of Anthony Dent


	
	Whilst JM had not been assaulted by Anthony Dent prior to the incident in the dock last Monday (as to which see above at [40]), he gave evidence that Dent told him that day ""that if I was to testify against him he will kill me"".
	
	
	JM has been held in a form of protective custody. He said that this was ""partly because of Mr Dent and a few assaults in the main population"". No evidence was adduced as to whether this involved JM experiencing harsher custodial conditions than usual. I accept, however, that there will be concern about his personal safety both in custody and following his release.
	


Pleas of guilty and assistance


	
	Like RC, JM pleaded guilty last Tuesday following his pleas of not guilty to murder and robbery in company inflicting grievous bodily harm the day before. If sentences of imprisonment were to be imposed in JM's case, they would be reduced by 10 per cent.
	
	
	When giving his evidence last Friday he gave an undertaking to give evidence in the trial of Dent and, if necessary, in any trial of Schott. My reasoning in relation to RC on this topic applies equally in the case of JM. If sentences of imprisonment were to be imposed, they would be reduced by 30 per cent because of his undertaking to assist authorities in the future.
	
	
	Accordingly, there would have been a combined reduction of 40 per cent.
	


Other subjective matters


	
	The sentence to be imposed upon JM must be mitigated on account of his lack of a significant criminal history. In that respect he could also be regarded as a person of prior good character but this is diluted by the fact of his longstanding use of illicit drugs and the fact that he told Dr Jurek that when he was homeless he ""used to rob people to survive"".
	
	
	Although he did not say so in terms when giving evidence, I get a sense from all of the material before me that JM is remorseful for what occurred. It is clear that he regarded Mr O'Grady as his ""good friend"" and he expressed gratitude for the assistance he had received from him in the context of JM being homeless. He said he felt relieved when Dent told him later on the night of the offence that Mr O'Grady had ""gone""; JM thought that this meant he had not been seriously hurt and had managed to leave the park. He told Dr Jurek, however, that when he found out the next day from news reports that a body had been found ""he cried because he knew it was his mate"". Like RC, it seems to me that, despite the risk, JM is trying to do what is right to make up for his wrongdoing.
	
	
	The fact that JM was a juvenile at the time of the offence is significant, even if he was only a matter of weeks short of turning 18. This, considered in combination with his terrible background, his limited mental capacity and, in that context his surprisingly clear criminal record, calls for an assessment of sentence that reflects a considerable degree of leniency. That said, having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence I am satisfied that it is appropriate to deal with the matter according to law rather than in the manner provided for dealing with sentencing in the Children's Court. (It was not contended otherwise.)
	
	
	I am satisfied that, on balance, JM has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation and that there is a reasonable possibility of him not re-offending. I do not see his prospects in these respects as ""good"" only because of his entrenched drug use which has continued even since he has been in gaol. Further, there is the observation of Dr Jurek that he is prone to the manipulation of others. In these circumstances there would ordinarily be a real need for JM to receive the benefit of parole supervision for a lengthy period of time. The Crown conceded that a finding of special circumstances was open to be made.
	
	
	The car stealing charge represents additional criminality over and above the robbery but to such a modest degree that I would not order any accumulation of sentences.
	
	
	JM was in custody for some 5 months before being released on bail but returned to custody for some unknown reason. The Crown indicated that to reflect the total period of pre-sentence custody the sentence should date from 11 June 2014. I have had regard to the correct dates apparent from JusticeLink as to periods in which JM has been in custody and have determined that any sentence of imprisonment would date from 31 May 2014.
	


Conclusion as to the sentence to be imposed upon JM


	
	If there was no reduction of sentence on account of JM's plea of guilty and future assistance to authorities I would have imposed a sentence of 3 years for the robbery in company and 6 months for the stealing of the motor vehicle. However, reducing the individual sentences by 40 per cent and refraining from finding special circumstances because it would have no utility would result in a sentence that would have seen JM entitled to release on parole as at 29 September 2015 and the overall term expiring on 29 February 2016.
	
	
	I have mentioned that there is a significant interest in JM being supervised by Community Corrections following his release. The interest is not only JM's but it is likely for the benefit of the community as well. A potential period of parole supervision of 3 weeks is wholly inadequate. I have resolved to take into account the fact that he has been in custody over 1 year 8 months and to adopt a less punitive sentencing outcome by ordering that he enter into good behaviour bonds pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). It will be a condition that he accepts the supervision of Community Corrections and also that he comply with his undertaking to give evidence. (I am imposing the latter because it provides for an expeditious manner of dealing with a failure to comply than proceedings under s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) yet preserves an opportunity to appeal pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of that Act).
	


Sentence

RC

For each offence, convicted.

Robbery in company: sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 3 years commencing 9 October 2014 and concluding 8 October 2017.

Manslaughter: sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 3 years 7 months with a balance of the term of the sentence of 1 year 3 months. The sentence is to date from 9 October 2014. The non-parole period will expire on 8 May 2018 at which time RC will become eligible for release on parole. The total term will expire on 8 August 2019.

(Without the reduction of sentence for the pleas of guilty and assistance, the sentence for robbery in company would have been 5 years and the sentence for manslaughter would have been 8 years.)

JM

For each offence, convicted.

For each offence, ordered to enter into a good behaviour bond pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for a period of 6 months subject to the conditions that the offender:

(i) be of good behaviour;

(ii) appear before the court if called on to do so at any time during the term of the bond;

(iii) accept the supervision of Community Corrections and obey all reasonable directions given by its officers;

(iv) attend at the Newcastle office of Community Corrections at Level 2, 7-9 Kelton Street, Cardiff NSW 2285 within 7 days;

(v) comply with the undertakings made when giving evidence on 5 February 2016 (refer transcript pp. 25 and 30-31); and

		19 February 2016",2016-02-07 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2702120,Misra v R [2016] NSWDC 8,"Judgment


	
	Ashwani Kumar Misra has appealed from gaol sentences imposed on him by a Local Court magistrate. In late 2014 he committed a number of offences contravening apprehended violence orders in favour of his former solicitor. He was given a good behaviour bond for those crimes. Then just before Christmas 2014 he committed an offence of stalking or intimidating another solicitor. In fact that behaviour ranged over some months. Again, he was given a good behaviour bond. In stalking or intimidating the other solicitor, of course, he was breaching the good behaviour bond he had earlier received. Despite that, he still received a good behaviour bond.
	
	
	On 16 October 2015 and 4 November 2015 he committed a series of additional offences. In October he was making a nuisance of himself at a public place and the police arrived. They wanted to arrest him. He was physically resisting arrest and swung his arm at a police officer and hailed a torrent of abuse at the police. This is the first time he committed offences of actual personal violence, apart from a common assault committed in 2014. The magistrate sentenced Mr Misra to 3 months imprisonment for those offences.
	
	
	Mr Misra’s criminal record did not help at that stage, but I think that a prison sentence of 3 months was a little harsh, given that the behaviour was a relatively minor example of resisting arrest and assaulting police. They are crimes which the courts take seriously. That is why he got a gaol sentence. I myself would impose sentences of two months for those, which would have now expired.
	
	
	However, the sentence which is still keeping him in gaol is an 11 month sentence that he received for contravening an apprehended violence order. One of his former solicitors had the benefit of an apprehended violence order. What he had been doing in the past with his solicitors was sending them emails containing violent threats. The threats were obviously very frightening.
	
	
	Despite being dealt with leniently in the past for that kind of behaviour, on 5 November 2015 he left a message for his former solicitor introducing himself and “passing on a message to the whole staff."" He said that ""what we will do is we will bomb the place."" He made a reference to ""dynamite and the long corridor that leads to the front desk."" He said ""that is a good enough place to blow the whole damn place into a tomb."" He repeated that ""this this is not a joke, we are going to burn the bloody place down."" He said he would do it before Christmas. He used abusive language towards the solicitor and said that ""we will reign terror on him.""
	
	
	In making those threats Ashwani Misra committed a crime of using a carriage service to threaten serious harm. That is a Commonwealth offence against s 474.15(2) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth).
	
	
	In making the phone call he breached the apprehended violence order which the solicitor was entitled to feel protected by. This was an offence against s 14(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 (NSW). Parliament has fixed a maximum of 2 years imprisonment for that offence. The magistrate imposed a sentence of 11 months with a non-parole period of 7 months. The non-parole period will expire 3 July this year.
	
	
	For using the carriage service the magistrate fixed a sentence of 7 months. It expires at the same time.
	
	
	Mr Masri is unrepresented. He is in custody. He explained to me from the dock that he was acting out of character over that particular period of time. His mother had died. He ceased taking medication and he found himself in a vicious cycle where he would use abuse, be arrested and then return to the same offending behaviour. In addition, he has a serious drinking problem. His marriage fell apart and he found himself in a repeating pattern of behaviour.
	
	
	In the dock he explained that his solicitors had not been responsive to his complaints. I pointed out to him - which I repeat - that there is a difference between complaining about a solicitor's conduct (and I am not suggesting there is any basis for complaint, I do not know one way or the other) and committing serious crimes.
	
	
	The two crimes he committed in leaving the voice mail are regarded seriously. It causes a good deal of stress and anxiety in the lives of people who are carrying on their ordinary working days, some of them with families, to receive violent threats such as those delivered by Mr Misra. If it had been a one-off incident a court would be inclined to be more lenient. The courts, in fact, had been very lenient to Mr Misra. He regularly received good behaviour bonds. It is only when he finally assaulted the police officers and left this very violent message using a voicemail facility that the courts sent him to gaol.
	
	
	I think that the sentence was justified, although it arose from very difficult personal circumstances that Mr Misra found himself in. It does not justify the serious crimes which he committed. People are entitled to feel safe in their working and domestic environments. The fact that he has a criminal record for just that behaviour means that the courts must take it more seriously. Not only is the criminal record a factor which deprives him of any leniency, in my opinion, it is an aggravating factor in this case.
	
	
	In addition, in committing the crime he was in breach of good behaviour bonds. That is a further aggravating factor.    
	
	
	I hope that Mr Misra, when he is released, will use his balance of parole - from 3 July this year to 3 November this year - to sort out the priorities in his life. He explained to me they are reconnecting with his daughters and getting his career back on track and getting his life into a more stable condition. But in the meantime, I myself cannot see that it is appropriate to release him back into the community earlier than the date fixed by the magistrate for the reasons that I have given. However, I do propose to reduce the sentences in respect of the two matters concerning the police.
	
	
	The formal orders which I make are these. Under s 20 of the Crimes (Appeal Review) Act 2001 (NSW), I determine these appeals against sentence by dismissing all of the appeals with two exceptions. In respect of the offence of resisting an officer in the execution of his duty against s 58 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), I reduce the sentence from 3 months to 2 months commencing on 4 December 2015 and expiring 3 February 2016. In respect of the offence of assaulting the police officer in the execution of his duty against s 60 (1) of the Crimes Act, I reduce the sentence from 3 months imprisonment to 2 months imprisonment commencing on 4 December 2015 and expiring 2 February 2016.
	


HIS HONOUR:    Mr Misra, you have lost your appeal. That is the opportunity that you have got to take to get your life back into order in the way that it sounds that you want to do. For the reasons I have given, I am not prepared to release you. I have reduced the two sentences. They were serious, but I have reduced the sentence. But your overall sentence expires on 6 November, 2016 and your non-parole period on 3 July, 2016, do you understand?

APPELLANT: But I came into custody on 14 November. That was 20 days.

HIS HONOUR: That is because the magistrate commenced the 11 month sentence on 4 December and the magistrate had reasons for doing that, because they were different victims - or at least a different separate crime. The magistrate did that for a reason.

		12 February 2016",2016-02-07 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2702123,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 18) [2016] NSWSC 40,"Judgment – EX TEMPORE (REVISED)


	
	On 8 February 2016, at the request of the legal representatives of the accused McNamara, I issued a subpoena directed to the Commissioner of the New South Wales Police returnable today. The schedule to that subpoena is in the following terms:
	



	
	“A copy of all documents concerning assistance/benefit/inducement or otherwise, whether sought, offered or provided from/by New South Wales Police to Chun Lok Lam (prosecution witness).
	
	
	A copy of all documents concerning assistance/benefit/inducement or otherwise, whether sought, offered or provided from/by New South Wales Police to Chun Kit Lam (prosecution witness).
	
	
	A copy of all documents relating to information provided to the New South Wales Police by Chun Lok Lam (prosecution witness) concerning the Triads or other Asian groups.
	
	
	A copy of all documents relating to information provided to the New South Wales Police by Chun Kit Lam (prosecution witness) concerning the Triads or other Asian groups.
	
	
	A copy of the subpoena”.
	



	
	By notice of motion filed in court today, the Commissioner of Police for New South Wales seeks, amongst other things, an order excusing him from producing any document caught by the subpoena that is properly the subject of a claim for public interest immunity. In support of that notice of motion, I have received two affidavits. The first is an open affidavit of Assistant Commissioner Walton of 9 February 2016 to which Ms Shead, who appears for the accused McNamara, has had access. I have also been provided with a confidential affidavit of Assistant Commissioner Walton of the same date. That affidavit has not been provided to the parties.
	
	
	The procedure of providing a confidential affidavit to the Court but not to the parties is one which is recognised as being appropriate in cases where a claim for public interest immunity is made: see for example The Queen v Meissner (1994) 76 A Crim R 81; DPP v Smith (1996) 86 A Crim R 308; National Crime Authority v Gould (1989) 90 ALR 489. Consistent with that procedure, Ms Shead has not sought, and indeed would not be ordinarily entitled, to cross-examine Assistant Commissioner Walton on the contents of his confidential affidavit. That course may be adopted in rare or exceptional cases, but it has not been the subject of an application in this particular case.
	
	
	I have read the confidential affidavit detail. It annexes two documents which, I am informed by Ms Kumar who appears for the Commissioner, constitute the sum total of the documents and which, but for the current notice of motion, would otherwise be produced in response to the subpoena. For obvious reasons, it is inappropriate for me to detail the nature and content of those documents.
	
	
	Ms Shead has indicated to me that the underlying purpose of seeking production of the material set out in the schedule to the subpoena is to, in effect, explore any information provided by either or both of the two witnesses named as to their membership of Triad groups, or their association with the members of those groups. Without disclosing the content of the documents, Ms Kumar submitted that even if the documents in question contained information of that nature, such information was not severable from those parts of the documents which contained the material which was the subject of the claim and that accordingly, the orders sought should be made.
	
	
	In circumstances such as the present case, I am required to conduct a balancing exercise, the nature of which is set out in s. 130 of the Evidence Act 1995 (“the Act”). Those provisions reflect the common law as articulated by the High Court in Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43, especially at 38. The balancing exercise requires, amongst other things, that I take into account the importance of the information or the document in the proceeding, the nature of the offence, the likely effect of adducing the evidence and whether or not the substance of the information has already been published. Those considerations are mandatory, although they are not exhaustive.
	
	
	Having read the material over which the claim is made, I can safely state that it does not go to either of the issues articulated by Ms Shead. However and again without disclosing its content, what the material does is disclose information of a highly confidential and sensitive nature.
	
	
	Having regard to the contents of the confidential affidavit of Assistant Commissioner Walton, I am satisfied that the public interest in making the material available is outweighed, and outweighed significantly, by the public interest in preserving its secrecy and confidentiality. As I have said, it would be inappropriate for me to go any further and run a risk of providing any detail of the material over which the claim is made.
	
	
	Taking all of those matters into account, I have come to the view that the order sought by the Commissioner should be made. Accordingly, I make the following orders:
	



	
	I grant leave to the Commissioner of the New South Wales Police to file in court a notice of motion dated 9 February 2016, along with the open affidavit of Assistant Commissioner Walton of 9 February 2016, and the confidential affidavit of Assistant Commissioner Walton of the same date.
	
	
	In respect of the subpoena to produce issued to the Commissioner at the request of the accused Glen Patrick McNamara on 8 February 2016, the Commissioner is excused from producing any document that is properly the subject of a claim for public interest immunity, including annexures B and C to the confidential affidavit of Assistant Commissioner Walton.
	



	
	I note that I have returned the confidential affidavit of Assistant Commissioner Walton to counsel for the Commissioner, on the understanding that should any issue in relation to this notice of motion arise in the future it can be produced at short notice

		15 June 2016",2016-02-08 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2702125,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 17) [2016] NSWSC 38,"Judgment – EX TEMPORE (REVISED)


	
	Counsel for the accused has made application that I give a direction pursuant to s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995 (“the Act”) in relation to the evidence of the witness Chun Lok Lam (“Lam”). The issue arises in the following way:
	
	
	Lam was previously charged with supplying prohibited drugs. He has given evidence that his solicitor retained the accused McNamara to act as an investigator and obtain statements from potential witnesses to assist him at his trial. Lam subsequently pleaded guilty and on 11 April 2014 he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment which he is currently serving. His appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was dismissed on 6 May 2015.
	
	
	With the consent of Ms Shead, who appears for McNamara, the Crown has called Lam in its case to rebut the evidence of good character which will be led in McNamara’s case. Lam has given evidence of (inter alia) conversations that he allegedly had with McNamara in which McNamara is said to have expressed some interest in dealing in drugs. Lam also asserts that there was an occasion which McNamara suggested to him that he (McNamara) would shoot Lam in the leg for the purposes of securing an adjournment of Lam's trial which was then pending. These assertions are denied by McNamara. Lam has been extensively cross-examined, and his credit has been put in issue.
	
	
	Lam confirmed (commencing at T279) that when he learned about the disappearance of the deceased he contacted his solicitor, Ms Jasmine Lau who, in turn, contacted the police. In light of Lam’s evidence I am satisfied that his primary motivation for contacting his solicitor was the possibility of deriving some benefit or other from assisting the police by providing them with information which was relevant to the circumstances of the deceased's disappearance. So much is clear, in my view, from that passage of Lam's evidence which commences at T280 L17 where, when asked by Ms Shead when it was that he first learned of the possibility that a benefit could be forthcoming to him if he gave evidence, he replied:
	


“Well in fact I think I was the one who asked about it. And I'm trying to think how I came to know about it. I think when I learn about the disappearance from my lawyer then I tried to ask about it.""


	
	That passage, in my view, is a clear indication that from the outset Lam had firmly in mind the possibility of deriving some benefit, perhaps in the form of a reduction in his sentence, in the event that he was to assist the police. There is further support for that conclusion in other evidence given by Lam (at T281 L5) where it was put to him that he knew of the possibility of a benefit being forthcoming in the event that he gave assistance. He said:
	


“Well, I think I should put it this way: When I am applying for a reduction in sentence, I was aware of Jamie Gao's - well, as I understand it, your question is whether I am aware that if I help the police it would be helpful to get a reduction in my sentence. My answer to that is yes.”


	
	Statements made by the police which have been tendered in relation to this application, along with the evidence of Lam himself, establish that on 23 May 2014 police spoke with Ms Lau regarding the possibility of assistance being provided. Although, as events transpired, no issue of assistance was raised in the course of Lam’s sentence proceedings (or in the proceedings in the Court of Criminal Appeal) it is clear that following the approach made through his solicitor to the police, Lam (and his brother) spoke with the police on 20 June 2014. On that occasion, Lam made a statement relating to the disappearance of the deceased. That statement contained the evidence which he has given in the present trial. He made a second statement on 10 February 2015.
	
	
	On 3 June 2015, representations were made by the New South Wales Police to his Excellency, the Governor of New South Wales, that the royal prerogative of mercy be exercised so as to reduce Lam’s sentence. It is not necessary for me to set out the terms of the submission which was made to the Governor. It is sufficient to note that the submission made specific reference to the assistance given by Lam relating to the disappearance of the deceased. On the evidence before me, His Excellency has not yet determined the matter.
	
	
	In all of these circumstances, Ms Shead has submitted that the provisions of s 165(1)(a) and/or (e) of the Act are applicable and that a direction ought be given to the jury that the evidence of Lam may be unreliable. Even if I came to the conclusion that neither provision applied, Ms Shead submitted that the matters referred to in s 165(1) were not exhaustive and that the direction would remain appropriate. Ms Shead submitted that the evidence established that Lam was motivated to assist the police by the possibility of deriving a benefit in the form of a reduction in his sentence. She submitted that this possibility remained given that, on the evidence, His Excellency had not determined the matter.
	
	
	The Crown has submitted that the circumstances of the present case do not attract the application of s. 165. The Crown accepted that a direction under s 165 is typically given when a discount is given to a witness in respect of his sentence in recognition of assistance, or in circumstances where a witness is indemnified against prosecution as a consequence of giving assistance and giving evidence. However, the Crown submitted that the circumstances of the present case were quite different.
	
	
	The Crown further submitted that the contents of telephone conversations to which Lam was a party, which are in evidence before me and in which Lam makes assertions against McNamara in terms which are consistent with his evidence, support a conclusion that the evidence is not unreliable at all. Finally, the Crown submitted that to invoke the provisions of the section would give a ""degree of judicial imprimatur” to the proposition that the evidence was unreliable, and would support a rejection of Lam’s evidence by the jury.
	
	
	Much has been said regarding the interpretation of s 165 of the Act. There appears, in particular, to be differing approaches to the interpretation of the phrase ""evidence of a kind which may be unreliable"" as it appears in s. 165. The more recent authorities seem to favour the adoption of a narrow interpretation but it is not necessary for me to deal with that issue in the circumstances of the present case.
	
	
	In my view, the position in the present case is quite clear. When Lam initially raised with Ms Lau the possibility of assisting police he had firmly in mind the possibility of deriving some benefit, in terms of a reduction in his sentence, as a result of doing so. There remains a possibility that some benefit will, in fact, be derived. Although those circumstances do not fall within any of the categories of evidence defined in s. 165(1), they are such as to give rise to the possibility of Lam’s evidence being unreliable.
	
	
	I am unable to accept the Crown's submission regarding the suggested effect of any warning. In particular, I am not able to accept the submission that a warning would give the “judicial imprimatur” to which the Crown referred. The terms of the warning as they appear in the Criminal Trial Bench Book (which I propose, in general terms, to adopt) will make it clear to the jury that the warning is being given not because I, as the trial judge, have formed any view about the evidence, but because the law requires that such warning be given. The jury will also be told, in express terms, that the warning should not be interpreted as amounting to a statement that the evidence is unreliable.
	
	
	In the course of submissions Ms Shead provided a draft direction which she urges me to adopt. The terms of that draft are extensive. They make a number of references to matters which, in my view, have no application to the current trial. Subject to any further submissions that any party may wish to make, I propose to give the jury the direction which has been sought, on the basis that Lam’s evidence may be unreliable because of the circumstances in which he Lam approached the police and provided a statement, the possibility of a benefit being (and remaining) firmly in his mind.

2702131,Application of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police dated 9 February 2016 [2016] NSWSC 42,"Judgment


	
	This is an application by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police for orders under ss 19 and 38 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth). The application is supported by an affidavit of Jody Brian Earl sworn 3 December 2015. The Plaintiff is a proceeds of crime authority. Mr Earl deposes to the fact that he is an authorised officer within the meaning of s 338 of the Act.
	
	
	Mr Earl also deposes to the fact that he suspects the property identified in schedules 1 to 5 of the Summons have the proceeds are the proceeds of an indictable offence under s 19(1)(d)(1) of the Act and/or an instrument of a serious offence under s 19(1)(d)(2) both contrary to s 400.91 of the Criminal Code. Mr Earl bases his suspicion on the matters which he has set out in his affidavit and in the exhibits to that affidavit. I have read the affidavit and the relevant annexures to that affidavit.
	
	
	Section 19 provides that a restraining order must be made if there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is the proceeds of an indictable offence or is an instrument of a serious offence, the application for the order is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer who states that he suspects that the property is the proceeds of the offence, the affidavit includes the grounds on which he holds the suspicion, and when the Court is satisfied that the authorised officer holds the suspicion in the affidavit on reasonable grounds. I am satisfied that Mr Earl holds the suspicion on reasonable grounds.
	
	
	Two of the three interested parties affected by the order have consented to the orders sought by the plaintiff in the matter. There is no consent from the third interested person, that is Cuong Viet Bui. However, his legal representative appears today and has not actively opposed the order being made.
	
	
	I note that under s 316 of the Act, where there is consent the order may be made without a consideration of the matters required otherwise to be considered. In any event, I am satisfied on the basis of the material in Mr Earl's affidavit that the order should be made.
	
	
	I note the undertaking provided by Mr Skeels on behalf of the Commonwealth. In relation to Mr Tran and Ms To, by consent I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 5 of the consent order. I grant the leave referred to in paragraph 6. I stand the proceedings over to the Common Law Registrar for further directions on 24 May. I grant liberty to restore on three days' notice.
	
	
	In relation to the property in schedules 1 and 2 where the relevant interested person is Mr Bui, I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 9 of the draft order provided to me. I grant the leave referred to in paragraph 10. I stand the proceedings over to the Common Law Registrar on 24 May. I grant liberty to restore on three days' notice. I direct that all of the orders should be entered forthwith.

2702135,Jacob PLUM v R (No 2) [2016] NSWDC 163,"Judgment


	
	I gave a judgment in this young man’s case in Orange when I was on circuit. That was on Thursday 26 November 2015. I adjourned the case to today. I am sitting in Sydney now and have the young man whose name is Mr Jacob Plum [a pseudonym] appearing by way of AVL from Orana Juvenile Justice Centre. His legal representative Ms Pettet is appearing by telephone and the Director of Public Prosecutions is represented by Ms Hubbard who is also appearing by telephone.
	
	
	Ms Pettet asked her client Mr Plum some further questions and Ms Hubbard tendered an up to date report from Juvenile Justice. The report was positive. I need not repeat what I have set out in the earlier judgment but one thing I can say is that the plan for Mr Plum to move to Walgett with his mother has changed. He and his mother think that he would be better off staying in Orange and starting school there. The report says that he has been prescribed some medication called Concerta as well as Melatonin.
	
	
	Whilst he has been in custody the report says that Mr Plum has been involved in some sports and has “displayed good sportsmanship whilst participating in recreational activities”. The report says that there are programs in Orange available for him including one run by the PCYC and another one called Mission Australia Joint Support Program. Justice Health have been monitoring Mr Plum because of his condition of ADHD and have advised Juvenile Justice “that Mr Plum has displayed improvement at school as he can now stay on task and maintain a consistent attitude”. There can be arranged a reference to the community intervention team clinician. Mr Plum has “agreed to a head space referral upon his release for the purpose of completing anger management counselling”.
	
	
	The report concludes that Mr Plum felt that “spending time in custody has assisted him to identify the need for positive change”. He is now seeking “to change his life” as Mr Plum himself says. He wants to “cease his offending behaviour”. His time in custody “has allowed him to think about the direction his life was going”. Juvenile Justice will maintain their supervision if he is released. The report was authored by two people. One is Naomi Roberts, a Juvenile Justice caseworker who gave evidence before me in Orange and whose evidence was impressive and helpful. The other was the Assistant Manager at Orange, Shane Cunynghame.
	
	
	When Ms Pettet called her client to give evidence today he again impressed me as a witness. Often judges come across cases where reports contain promises and reported intentions to change lives around. This report is the same. Often, however, an offender is not as clear about that when answering questions. Mr Plum is an exception. He seems to me to be exceptionally articulate and insightful for a 15-year-old boy. Often adult offenders do not display the same insight that he seems to have gained in his short life. When asked questions he usually does not answer in a few words but explains why he is thinking particular thoughts or has particular intentions or ambitions. It also seems that he understands and takes on, as part of his own insight, advice that he has been receiving and hearing from others.
	
	
	As I said, the intention is that he will stay in Orange. He will go back to the [name of school]. That starts next Thursday 28 January 2016 and Year 10 will start the following day. He ultimately wants to go to TAFE. He would like to study a course which may lead him to work as a beautician or in make-up - that kind of field. He has an interest in that. He also wants to obtain his L plates in due course.
	
	
	Cross-examined by Ms Hubbard, Mr Plum elaborated on how he would deal with challenges from his mates when he is outside. He explained that he has had enough of being in custody and being away from his mother and does not want to go back. He explained how the drugs and alcohol he used to take mess with his head and he is now feeling fit and has “the power not to do this stuff”.
	
	
	I am going to order Mr Plum’s release today on parole so that he can go home to his mother in Orange and get himself ready for school next week. Judges know from their experience that being out on parole will be a challenge for any offender. Mr Plum is no exception. Being on parole will be a challenge. He will need lots of support when he is back in the community. The report refers him to various agencies that will be able to support him. He also has the medication that has been prescribed. His doctor is in Orange as well. Everything seems to be in place to give him a very good chance of making a success of his period on parole. It is now up to him of course but I am encouraged by the insight that he has shown and articulated by his words.
	
	
	So the formal order I make in this case is this. Under s 20(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 I determine this appeal against sentence by varying the sentence. The sentence is varied by fixing the non-parole period to commence on 31 October 2015 but to expire today 22 January 2016. The balance of parole will commence tomorrow 23 January 2016 and will expire on 30 May 2016. I order his release on parole today. The conditions of the parole are these-
	



	
	That he be of good behaviour.
	
	
	That he lives with his mother in [address].
	
	
	That he accepts supervision by the Juvenile Justice Service and accepts all reasonable recommendations and directions given by any officer of that service.
	


HIS HONOUR: Ms Hubbard are there any other conditions? I can go through the list of all these places of referral but really the Juvenile Justice people are going to organise that and so far as my order’s concerned he has to accept their recommendations and directions. They’ll put them into place. Ms Pettet?

PETTET: Yes I think that’s - because if they say to do something and he doesn’t do it well then he’ll be in breach of his parole. I think probably that’s enough your Honour.

HUBBARD: Nothing further from the Crown your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: So the main one is good behaviour so he’s got to stay out of trouble. He’s got to live at home so that they know where he is. And really he’s got to be supervised and accept their recommendations and they may include “look you’ve got to see your doctor and get your up to date script or you’ve got to - we want you to go to Mission Australia” or arrange something through Head Space and he’s got to do that. Look, make sure you turn up at the school and things like that. All right.


	
	Mr Plum you have won your case. You have won your appeal. Your sentence is still the same. It’s one year but instead of the non-parole period finishing in May this year it’s finishing today. Now did I get those dates right Ms Hubbard, the 12 months--
	


HUBBARD: It should expire the full sentence on the 30 October 2016.

HIS HONOUR: Yes I got that wrong, you are right.


	
	I amend the order so that the overall sentence expires on 30 October 2016.
	


HIS HONOUR: Mr Plum you’ve won your case, you’ve won your appeal. The sentence of 12 months is still the same, the control order. That started 31 October last year and will expire 30 October this year. So you’re still under sentence. You’ve got to understand that. But instead of having a six month non-parole period where you’ve got to stay in Orana for six months I’ve pulled that in to today. So you’ve got a non-parole period of about two and a half months and I’ve ordered your release today.


	
	The conditions. You don’t just say “that’s it” you walk out, because you’re on parole until 30 October this year. You’re on parole, so you’re still under sentence, you’re on parole in the community. The conditions of your parole are that you’ve got to stay out of trouble, that’s what good behaviour means. No smoking dope, no drinking underage, no getting into brawls, no breaking and entering that sort of stuff that you used to do. That’s what good behaviour means.
	
	
	The other condition is that you live with your mum where she is.
	
	
	I will make it an additional condition if you change your address then you’ve got to let the court know at Orange, the Local Court know at Orange. That is another condition.
	


OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: And the last condition’s probably in a sense the most important and that’s that Juvenile Justice will supervise you. Now they know what they’re doing. You probably know that much better than I do and they know what they’re doing with young people. I expect it helped you a lot in there and you’re helped to the extent now that you want to get out and put it into practice and that’s a very good thing. I repeat you are an impressive young man and you’ve got a good future, and you just put this behind you. And I also repeat that it’s not going to be easy, you’re going to need help. It’s not going to be easy out there and you’re going to run into trouble and find that choices are hard. Let them help you. Don’t be put off by the first setback. Let them help you. They know what they’re doing. So if they suggest you go and see a doctor or go to Head Space or go to Mission Australia then you do it. Now does that all make sense?

OFFENDER: Yes your Honour it all makes sense to me now.

HIS HONOUR: Good. Now I’ll check with your lawyer Ms Pettet how does he - no he doesn’t have to sign his parole, he doesn’t have to sign anything because it’s not a bond am I right?

PETTET: I think that’s right your Honour. Then the Juvenile Justice they will organise his transport back to Orange. Yep. They may just need a copy of it before he can be released.

HIS HONOUR: Okay my associate’s nodding she will give you something to sign and the court officer will find out or my associate will. Juvenile Justice Officer fax or email, what’s easier?

JUVENILE JUSTICE OFFICER: Email info to Orana your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: We’ll get it. We’ll contact you and we’ll email the orders so that you can then act on them.

All right Mr Plum have you got any questions that you want to ask? I’m not saying you should, I’m just checking.

OFFENDER: I just wanted to say thank you to everyone that helped me today and thank you your Honour for doing his for me, I appreciate it.

HIS HONOUR: You deserve a chance because you’ve made good progress and Ms Pettet has helped you. The prosecution’s been very even handed. And of course your mum’s your biggest help.

OFFENDER: Thank you your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Thanks very much. I’ll now disconnect from everyone. Thank you Ms Pettet and thank you Ms Hubbard.

2702147,R v MO (No 1) [2016] NSWDC 144,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Few in the community would be unconcerned by the prospect of terrorist acts taking place within Australia. The Commonwealth parliament has responded in a number of ways to the increasing threat of terrorism. One particular way of particular relevance to today’s proceedings is the introduction of provisions concerning control orders to which citizens can be subject by which means their behaviour can be controlled in an effort to protect members of the public from terrorist acts.
	
	
	In this case the offender MO was subject to an interim control order. He has breached it, he admits, in three ways. He was served with the control order on 18 December 2014 it having been made the day before. One of the terms of the control order expressly prohibited the offender from using a mobile telephone service that had not been approved by the Joint Counter-Terrorism Team. Another term of the control order expressly prohibited the offender from using a public telephone service that had not been approved by the Joint Counter-Terrorism Team.
	
	
	It is clear that the offender knew and understood the requirements of those orders because four days after being served with the order he obtained permission from the Joint Counter-Terrorism Team to use a particular telephone service, that permission was granted. So when the offender breached the control order by using a public telephone on two occasions, one very shortly after the other, and by using a mobile telephone on another occasion he was fully aware that he should not be doing so. He explains his behaviour now as by saying that he was simply naïve. Clearly he did not take the control order seriously, nor it would seem the fact that he was at liberty on bail when he committed the offences for which I must now sentence him.
	
	
	The offender called the same person on each occasion and as the Crown concedes the contents of the discussions between them were trivial. We know that because fortunately procedures were in place which allowed the recording of the telephone conversations. Mr Lange who appears for the offender impressed upon me a finding that these offences were at the lower end of the scale of objective seriousness. I do not agree. What I see is the offender deliberately thumbing his nose at the control order and the authorities who imposed it.
	
	
	The offender travelled some distance from his home in order to use the public telephone and so was prepared to take steps to breach the control order despite being fully aware of its requirements. As I said before the aim of the control order was to protect the public from terrorist acts. The fact that no terrorist act was mentioned in the telephone calls does not really help the offender. Were such conversations to have taken place he would have faced further charges.
	
	
	The offender, as I said, pleaded guilty to these matters. That was only after he was committed for trial. The lateness of the pleas was explained by suggesting that advice needed to be obtained as to whether the control orders could be challenged. If that was successful then they would have been declared void and the charges would have fallen away. There was despite the lateness of the plea however, a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. There could have been a greater willingness of course and in those circumstances the sentence I impose upon the offender will be about 15% less than it would otherwise have been.
	
	
	The offender has been kept in custody since 23 December 2014. An affidavit prepared by him describes his conditions of custody. They are certainly severe. There are considerable restrictions on his movement within gaol as well as restrictions on the opportunity for him to work and be educated. Although it is of course not their design one consequence is that opportunities for rehabilitation with the assistance of counsellors and the like is more limited than would otherwise be the case. A psychologist who interviewed the offender and prepared a report for the Court commented on the relationship between the conditions of custody and the offender’s mental wellbeing. I make no criticism of the Corrective Services authorities at all when I say that the conditions under which the offender are held would not be conducive to the wellbeing of anyone. I have taken into account the possibility, indeed the likelihood that the offender will serve his sentence of imprisonment under such conditions and reduce the sentence I would otherwise have imposed accordingly.
	
	
	The offender was born in Sydney to parents who migrated to Australia many years ago. His parents both worked, his father is a security guard and cleaner and his mother is a process worker. The offender had a happy and uneventful childhood. He regards his parents highly saying that they did the best they could to give him a good upbringing and says that they continue to do so. The offender told the psychologist about his criminal history that there is no link to his childhood it is just the environment he put himself in at different stages of his life. His education and upbringing was fractured at times, largely as a result of the offender’s own behaviour. He however has plans for his future to complete his education and to then work when he can. He spends his many hours alone in custody reading and attempting to plan for the future.
	
	
	In determining the sentence to impose upon this offender general deterrence is clearly of great importance. Control orders of this type must be obeyed. Even making trivial calls such as the offender made divert resources away from the authorities’ attempts to fight terrorism. The ability of the authorities to combat terrorism is significantly enhanced if control orders are followed by those subject to them. Anyone else the subject of a control order needs to understand that if they deliberately breach the order, as the offender has, a sentence of some significance will be imposed upon them.
	
	
	As well as general deterrence, personal deterrence is important in the present case. The offender’s behaviour and the fact that he was on bail show a clear lack of insight into his obligations both as a person on bail and a person subject to a control order. It needs to be brought home to him in the most concrete way that if he is subject to a control order in the future or if there are other forms of restrictions on his behaviour as a result of an order made by the authorities, he needs to do what is required of him. For the reasons I have given I am satisfied that nothing less than a sentence of fulltime custody is necessary.
	
	
	The sentence I impose is as follows. For all three offences I sentence the offender to imprisonment to date from 23 December 2014. I set a head sentence of two and a half years imprisonment but the offender is to be released pursuant to a reconnaissance release order after serving 18 months. Thus that means that the offender is to be released on 22 June 2016.

2702160,R v Bennett [2016] NSWDC 180,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Most armed robberies are conducted in a similar way. A person is threatened with a weapon, money is handed over and the offender leaves quickly, the offender thinking very little about the impact of the offence on the victims of it. But in truth the victims of armed robbery are often significantly affected by what occurs to them. The shock, the fear and indeed the terror will often remain with victims of such offences for some time.
	
	
	While most armed offences probably follow a similar pattern, the people who commit those offences are vastly different, some are cold, calculating criminals, who simply desire to get money to advance themselves, others are, at least at some level, even deserving of sympathy.
	
	
	Miss Isabell Bennett is to be sentenced after pleading guilty on first arraignment in the District Court for an offence of armed robbery committed when she robbed people working at a massage parlour, I should call it a therapeutic massage parlour, to avoid any possible confusion. She went into the massage parlour at about 8.45pm on Friday 21 February 2014, and discussed with the people working there prices, the availability of therapeutic massage for her and her mother and eventually said she would be returning a little while later with her mother for the purposes of a massage.
	
	
	After she left one of the staff members realised that her phone had been stolen, another staff member called the Police Assistance Line at about 9.30 to report the theft of the phone. While that phone call was in progress Ms Bennett returned to the premises, she was wearing a balaclava but was still easily identified and carrying a gun. The person on the telephone had the presence of mind to put the phone down on the counter but leave the line open, thus a recording of what was said was made. Ms Bennett pointed the gun at staff and said, “give me the money”. One of the staff members emptied the day’s takings from the daily money pouch, it was about $800. The offender grabbed it with her hand.
	
	
	Another employee was coming out of the kitchen, she saw the offender, Ms Bennett pointing a gun at her while looking at the other three staff members in the reception area. She was told to come out. She did not, she retreated to the kitchen, put her foot against the door and started shouting out the window, “help me, help me, robber, robber”. At this Ms Bennett left.
	
	
	Police came soon afterwards, fingerprints were identified which matched the offender. Eventually, the day after, police got a search warrant to attend premises where Ms Bennett was believed to be living with her boyfriend. They found her, they found clothing apparently worn during the commission of the offence and a mountain bike which was the way that the robber arrived at the premises in the first place. While Ms Bennett admitted stealing the phone to police she denied any involvement in the armed robbery, nevertheless she was of course charged with it and eventually admitted her guilt.
	
	
	Ms Bennett was brought up in the Sydney area, her relationship with her father was a difficult one. A document tendered to me today said that Isabell‘s father would severely beat her and her mother for as long as Miss Bennett could remember. Not only did this cause problems with her father, of course, but also caused problems with her mother as Ms Bennett came to realise that her mother was not protecting her as, quite rightly, she believed she should have been doing. In such circumstances the early commencement of drug use is more easily explained. Another significant circumstance, indeed perhaps the most important circumstance concerning Ms Bennett, relates to her mental health issues. These included admissions to hospitals in the past and a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Ms Bennett is a person who, at times, hallucinates and hears voices. These symptoms subside of course when she receives medication. In the witness box today she accepted that she would need to take medication and that if she did not it was quite likely that she would be back in gaol.
	
	
	It turns out, at least according to Ms Bennett, that the firearm was a replica pistol which she had bought at Paddy’s Markets for the purposes of committing offences. That may well of course be true, and there is no evidence to the contrary, but the staff members of the therapeutic massage facility were not to know that.
	
	
	Offences such as these are clearly objectively serious. Any business which receives cash, convenience stores, florists and also of course Thai massage places are easy targets for armed robbers.
	
	
	Ms Bennett committed the offence because of a drug debt, she was afraid that she or her boyfriend would be harmed. She was prepared, at that time, to terrify many people, just so that she could get that money to pay off her drug debt. To a psychiatrist, whose report was tendered today and in the witness box, she expressed her remorse. I accept it as genuine.
	
	
	On her release from custody she has plans, she wishes to complete her schooling and to complete her business studies so that she can obtain work, probably in an office. She will be living in a granny flat with her parents and as I have said recognises the need to continue taking medication. She has a criminal history which is reasonably lengthy for someone who is so young, but nothing as serious as this offence.
	
	
	Clearly a finding of special circumstances which should be made in the offender’s favour, she will need an extended period of supervision on parole in order to assist her with her problems relating to her drug use and to encourage her to comply with various mental health treatment programs which may be in place from time to time. As far as pre-sentence custody is concerned the parties are agreed that the sentence that I am about to announce should commence on 21 July 2014. To reflect the utilitarian value of the plea I will discount the sentence by 15%
	
	
	I impose sentence as follows. The offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 21 months to date from 21 July 2014, the non-parole period will expire on 20 April 2016 on which day Ms Bennett is eligible to be released to parole. Her head sentence is one of four years.
	
	
	I recommend that a copy of Dr Furst’s report be provided to Justice Health Community Corrections and the Maroubra Community Mental Health team. I recommend that consideration be given to the matters referred to in Dr Furst’s report as regards Ms Bennett’s treatment whilst in custody and conditions of her release upon parole.

		24 August 2016",2016-01-28 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2702172,NSW Police v Carrall [2016] NSWLC 4,"Judgment

Reasons for decision


	
	The defendant has been apprehended for the offence of driving with an illicit drug present in his blood (s 111 Road Transport Act 2013) on two relevant occasions - 26 May 2015 and 23 June 2015. He pleads guilty to the May offence. He pleads not guilty to the June offence on the basis of an honest and reasonable mistake of fact.
	
	
	This judgment is prepared without the benefit of a transcript.
	
	
	There was no expert evidence for either the prosecution or defence.
	
	
	The legislative provision is simple:
	


111(1) Presence of prescribed illicit drug in person’s oral fluid, blood or urineA person must not, while there is present in the person’s oral fluid, blood or urine any prescribed illicit drug:

(a)  drive a motor vehicle….


	
	The elements of the offence are not in issue – the defendant was driving a motor vehicle on a public street whilst there was present a detectable level of THC in his oral fluid.
	
	
	It is important to note that there need not be any affect proven – the mere presence of a minute or residual presence of THC is sufficient. There is a separate offence of driving under the influence of a drug for which affect must be proven.
	


Prosecution case


	
	The apprehending officer for the May and June offences was Senior Constable Chayne Foster. His evidence-in-chief relating to the June offence was by way of statement which relied on the audio recording from the highway patrol vehicle. There was some other conversation not recorded.
	
	
	First the defendant was breath tested for alcohol, and that was negative. In accordance with standing orders, the defendant was asked prior to the test:
	


Have you had any alcohol today?


	
	The defendant was then subjected to a second test, this time for illicit drugs. The officer said:
	


I am now going to subject you to a drug test. Have you taken any illicit substances in the past 48 hours?


	
	The defendant said:
	


I had a smoke over a week ago, Sunday week ago.


	
	The first indicative roadside test came back positive to cannabis, and the defendant was arrested and taken to the police station for the purpose of conducting the second test. The defendant said:
	


I thought I would be right, it was over a week ago.


	
	The second test also proved positive to cannabis, and so a sample was sent to the Forensic and Analytical Science Service. That sample was tested and a certificate was issued that the defendant's oral sample had cannabis present.
	
	
	In cross-examination it was put to Senior Constable Foster that when he apprehended the defendant on the May occasion, the defendant and he had discussed how long after a smoke before he could drive and not be detected, and the officer had said that he would be required to wait a week.
	
	
	The officer did not unequivocally deny that, but said that he would have been unlikely to say those words, as he would not want to encourage an offence. He did acknowledge a lack of specific memory of that conversation, understandable given the hundreds of tests he must have conducted before and after that occasion.
	
	
	When pressed, he stated that he believed the equipment detected cannabis three to four days after use, but that it depended on a range of factors including the amount consumed, how it was consumed, and the regularity of use leading up to the last occasion.
	
	
	He also stated, from my notes, that “a line had been drawn and that now you could be a smoker and not drive, or a driver and not smoke and that that was the effect of the new laws”.
	


The evidence of the defendant


	
	The defendant stated that when he was apprehended by the Senior Constable in May, the officer had said to him ""If you had waited a week you would have been fine to drive"". He had relied on this information and had last had a smoke of cannabis on the Sunday, almost a week and a half prior to being apprehended the second time. He had been in the same house as another person who had smoked on one occasion in the interim, but that person had been in a closed separate room. The prosecution took this no further once it was apparent that the possibility that this led to further ingestion was remote.
	
	
	Given the length of time, and the police officer’s advice, the defendant stated he was convinced that he was right to drive and would not have THC in his system. He made it clear that in his view he did not consume any cannabis from the potential passive smoking episode.
	


Burden and onus of proof


	
	There is an evidential burden to raise the defence. This has been achieved by the evidence above. The prosecution then bear the burden of disproving 'honest and reasonable mistake of fact'. The test is stated clearly in the concluding remarks of Goldring J in Appeal of Francesco Mendolicchiu [2008] NSWDC 182 at [20]:
	


I find that, once the appellant raised the defence of an honest and reasonable belief by asserting facts, that, if true, would have exonerated him from guilt of the offence, the evidentiary burden of disproving that defence shifted to the prosecution. The prosecution has not discharged its evidentiary burden.

Factual resolution


	
	Given the clear and unambiguous evidence of the defendant I am satisfied that the conversation as he recollects it is accurate. He was not shaken in cross-examination. The officer’s evidence was equivocal, and he was not in a position with any certainty to deny what was said.
	
	
	I am also satisfied that the defendant is telling the truth when he says that the last cannabis he smoked was at least nine days prior, and he believed that all the cannabis would have been gone from his system by the date of the alleged offence.
	
	
	The community may be curious as to why the issue of passive smoking was the subject of some focus in cross-examination and examination-in-chief. This court deals with about fifty of these offences each week, and the issue of passive smoking has been canvassed in numerous cases, where people plead guilty even though they are not cannabis users themselves.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the defendant honestly and reasonably believed he did not consume any smoke from the potential passive episode given the location and timing of that occurrence.
	


Does the defence apply to s 111 of the Road Transport Act?


	
	It is clear that the defence applies to High Range PCA due to the key and binding case of DPP v Bone [2005] NSWSC 1239. The context of that legislation was described as follows at [16]:
	


It can easily be accepted that the reason for the legislation in the first place and its increased severity is a reaction to the perceived need in the public interest to deal with the havoc caused when persons who have been drinking also drive.


	
	The court accepted that in the case of High Range PCA the offence is one of strict, not absolute liability, and thus the defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact does apply.
	
	
	This case has been applied in the District Court in Appeal of Francesco Mendolicchiu [2008] NSWDC 182 where the appellant took cough mixture which ‘topped him up’ to a low range reading. The defendant was acquitted.
	
	
	Bone was determined more than a year prior to the legislation creating the current offence under s 111. If parliament had wanted to make drug driving an absolute offence it could have by clear unequivocal language in the decade since.
	
	
	In Proudman v Dayman [1941] HCA 28 the court found that when dealing with ‘a new crime’ it is necessary to look at the purpose of the legislation to determine whether the defence would apply.
	
	
	Having carefully read the legislation, the second reading speech when it was introduced, and the above cases there is no reason to differentiate this offence from the drink driving offences.
	
	
	The second reading speeches are interesting for a related purpose - they illustrate the reasoning behind the legislation some ten years ago. The bill which introduced the amendment was the Road Transport Legislation Amendment (Drug Testing) Bill 2006. It was first introduced by Mr Matt Brown, Parliamentary Secretary for Transport in the Legislative Assembly. The aim in general was road safety, and he said on 19 September 2006 (my emphasis):
	


People who have active drugs present in their system should not be driving on our roads. 


	
	In the Legislative Council the Bill was introduced by The Hon. Eric Roozendaal, the Minister for Roads, who said on 18 October 2006 (my emphasis):
	


The bill allows police to randomly test drivers for the presence of three illicit drugs in oral fluid. These are speed, ecstasy and THC, the active ingredient in cannabis. These drugs are illegal, they are the most commonly used drugs in the community and they all affect the skills and sound judgment required for safe driving.


	
	Whilst not relevant to the issue at hand, but of interest given one of the submissions from Mr Bolt, I note that the Greens also supported the legislation (Ms Lee Rhiannon, Legislative Council, 18 October 2006 at 2815) on the basis that:
	


... the screening devices have been shown to only detect THC which is the intoxicating element at very high levels and the window of detection is about one hour. The tests cannot pick up the non-active component, which stays in a person’s body for a longer period. Therefore, those who smoke cannabis the day before will not test positive according to the advice I have received.


	
	It is clear that the second reading speech Ministers had in mind that it would be drugs that were 'active' and 'affect the skills' that were the mischief. References to ‘no tolerance for any drugs’ in the speeches need to be viewed in this context. Whist the police do not have to prove affect, and no bottom limit was set, the target was those who were 'drug driving' just like 'drunk driving'.
	
	
	Clearly, in 2006, the technology was not nearly as advanced as it is now. Certainly it was not the aim of the Ministers that if you consume cannabis (at all) you cannot drive (ever), or that those who had been around other smokers could be caught in the net.
	
	
	There is no indication that these offences were to be absolute liability in the wording of the legislation or in the second reading speeches.
	
	
	The prosecution point to some features of the Road Transport Act to suggest that the offence is absolute. The prosecution contend that the wording of the legislation, particularly s 111(2), precludes the defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact. In my view this is not correct; s 111(2) relates solely to the issue of multiple drugs in the saliva.
	
	
	The prosecution contends that the very nature of the offence dictates that it ought to be viewed as absolute liability in that it does not use words such as “knowingly” or “wilfully” and the maximum penalty is a fine and disqualification with no prison term.
	
	
	The Appeal of Francesco Mendilicchiu is authority for the proposition that the defence applies to Low Range PCA, which also does not carry a prison term, and has identical disqualification periods. Low Range PCA provisions also do not mention intent. A mandatory disqualification is a serious and significant punishment. This was recognised by Howie J in the guideline judgment [1]  at [116]:
	


Licence disqualification is such a significant matter and can have such a devastating effect upon a person’s ability to derive income and to function appropriately within the community that it is a matter which, in my view, must be taken into account by a court when determining what the consequences should be, both penal and otherwise, for a particular offence committed by a particular offender.


	
	The prosecution contend that the existence of a statutory defence for medicinal purposes for morphine based drugs points to the absolute nature of the s 111 offence. As pointed out in Appeal of Francesco Mendilicchiu at [12] to [14], the existence of a medical defence and the absence of a specific defence do not mean that the defence is unavailable.
	
	
	The prosecution contend that the importation of the Criminal Code strict liability provisions to the regulations does not apply to the Act. I agree with this proposition. The provisions only apply to the regulations, and thus do not affect the Act.
	
	
	The prosecution did graciously and properly alert me to a very recent unreported spiking case determined in Byron Bay Local Court by Magistrate Dakin, where he dismissed a s 111 offence relating to methamphetamine on the basis of an honest and reasonable mistake of fact. That is not binding, but is highly persuasive, and accords with my view.
	
	
	For the reasons above in my view the defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact is available for the offence charged in the present case. It is a strict liability offence.
	


Application to the present case


	
	I have accepted in this case that the last ingestion of cannabis was at least nine days prior. No-one is seriously contending that the defendant was still in any way affected by the drug. I have found that the informant Senior Constable from the highway patrol asks questions about a 48 hour period, believes the presence generally can be detected for three to four days, and told the defendant that after a week he should be clear to drive.
	
	
	Of course it can never be the law that a person can rely on mistake where they made a miscalculation as to their driving ability based upon a misconceived analysis of their own level of intoxication. Every day in every court in the land defendants say: “I thought I was sober enough to drive”. And that is because alcohol and other drugs intoxicate and dull the judgement. The defence of honest and reasonable mistake is not a drunk (or drug) driver’s charter.
	
	
	The comments of Adams J in DPP v Bone reinforce this at [36]:
	


One of the important purposes of the legislation is to warn drivers that, whatever their subjective judgment might be as to their fitness to drive, they are objectively a danger to themselves and to other members of the public if they drive with a prescribed concentration of alcohol in their blood. Accordingly, persons who drink drive at their peril as well as the peril of other road users.

Was the defendant's belief honestly held?


	
	As a question of fact, I find that it was the defendant's truly held belief that he had no detectable level of cannabis. More precisely, the prosecution have not disproved the defendant's evidence in this regard.
	


Was it a mistake of fact, or a mistake of law?


	
	The leading case on this issue is RTA v O’Reilly & Ors [2009] NSWSC 134 handed up by the prosecutor. In that case the appellant honestly and reasonably believed speed limit was 70kph not 60kph. That was found to be a mistake of law, not of fact. Whilst there are grey areas relating to the distinction between fact and law (see Ostrowski v Palmer (2004) 218 CLR 493), in this case, in my view, the belief was clearly one of fact. The defendant knew the law; he believed that he no longer had the presence of THC in his saliva.
	


Was the defendant's belief reasonably held?


	
	This is a difficult question to answer, and I have wavered in my opinion. In particular, I am aware that parliament’s intention is only relevant to the issue of whether the defence applies. Further, I was originally attracted to the contention that a mistaken honest belief about an action (driving) may never be reasonable if it originated in a crime (smoking cannabis).
	
	
	Mr Huxtable stated that to have a detectable level of THC the defendant, absent spiking or accidental consumption, must have knowingly committed the offences of possession of a prohibited drug, and self-administration of a prohibited drug. He stated that those who flout the law cannot then rely on a reasonable mistake.
	
	
	Mr Huxtable further stated that alcohol is regulated, legal and it is easy to assess the quantity consumed in almost all cases due to the standardisation of drinks and percentage labelling. It is impossible to assess the quantity or quality of cannabis in an illegal market.
	
	
	These are each valid points. However, consideration of the hypotheticals canvassed during submissions, in the authorities, and discussed below, as well as application of the onus of proof, has led me to the conclusion that prosecution have not negatived reasonable mistake.
	


Lack of Precedent


	
	I have been unable to locate a single authority on this issue – whether a belief can be reasonable where the initiating action was a separate preliminary criminal act committed many days before. The only relevant cases deal with the legality of the same act at the same time. In the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Crennan and Kiefel JJ in CTM v The Queen [2008] HCA 25 at [8] (footnotes omitted):
	


Where it is a ground of exculpation, the law in Australia requires that the honest and reasonable, but mistaken, belief be in a state of affairs such that, if the belief were correct, the conduct of the accused would be innocent. In that context, the word “innocent” means not guilty of a criminal offence. In the case of an offence, or a series of offences, defined by statute, it means that, if the belief were true, the conduct of the accused would be “outside the operation of the enactment”.


	
	In my view, ‘the enactment’ refers to the substantive offence in issue, and does not require the court to peer back looking to another enactment. Similarly, the cases of Giachin v Sandon [2013] ACTSC 77 and R v Duong [2015] QCA 170 apply Bone interstate, but do not assist where a person is otherwise innocent but the initiating act is unlawful. See also Fullagar J at [14] in Bergin v Stack [1953] HCA 53.
	
	
	In my view the focus ought not be on the original action – the smoking of the cannabis. The reasonableness of the belief ought to be focussed more sharply – at the time of or immediately before the action constituting this crime – driving with the presence of cannabis in the person’s saliva. After all, the defendant is not relying on the defence for the offence of consuming the cannabis, only for the driving offence.
	
	
	Apart from timing, the issue is also partly dependent upon the nature of the originating offence. In this case it is the possession and personal use of cannabis. This crime is so minor, that the police have a unique statutory discretion to deal with it by the cannabis cautioning scheme and such an offence would rarely attract more than a minor fine. For a first offence it may well not lead to a conviction.
	
	
	The criminal law does not as a rule require ‘clean hands’ from those who seek to rely on defences. For example, even a person who throws the first punch can in some circumstances rely on self-defence. Self-defence is also not closed off from a trespasser or a thief. A person who engages in an armed robbery to recover goods they believe to have been wrongfully detained may have a ‘claim of right’ that leads to acquittal.
	


Hypotheticals


	
	Firstly, what if the cannabis was ingested lawfully, in Colorado or Portugal or elsewhere? It cannot be that the defence is not available in the present case, but available in those circumstances. This illustrates that the focus needs to be on the mistake with respect to the act which is said to constitute this offence (driving with presence) not any other offence prior (cannabis self-administration or possession).
	
	
	Secondly, what if a 17 year old used fake identification to enter licenced premises and then drank a spiked soft-drink. The defence of honest and reasonable mistake would still be open to her despite the unlawful entry into the club sometime prior which has a direct causative link. Again, this illustrates that the focus needs to be on the legality of the act which is said to constitute the offence (driving) not any other offence (obtaining benefit by deception).
	
	
	Thirdly, what if a person was driving a stolen car (plea of guilty) and was also driving unlicensed (plea of not guilty – honest and reasonable mistake of fact). The defence would still be available on the unlicensed offence, even though the vehicle was stolen. Again, the focus is on the licence issue, not on the theft.
	
	
	Fourth, what if the technology improves even more, so that the THC can be detected after one month, or three, or even twelve? Mr Bolt chose the example of two years which I scoffed at. However, on reflection the question is valid. Surely at some point the defendant’s belief may be reasonable that there would no longer be the presence of THC in the saliva?
	
	
	Fifth, a relevant hypothetical was raised in the case of Giachin v Sandon [2013] ACTSC 77 which applied Bone in that jurisdiction. Penfold J at [70] commented:
	


A person who correctly believes that he or she has not consumed alcohol for a week but whose blood contains alcohol at the end of that week because of some previously undiagnosed metabolic disorder might well be able to make out a Proudman v Dayman “defence”.


	
	The court is clearly envisaging that the defence is available where a drink-driver believes that the alcohol would have exited his system, but is mistaken, so long as the period of time is beyond anything that the person would ordinarily and reasonably expect. That broadly corresponds to the current situation.
	
	
	In my view, each of the above hypotheticals suggest that despite the illegality of the use in this case, provided the defendant honestly believed that the cannabis was no longer present, and the passing of time was sufficient, then the prosecution may not have disproved the ‘reasonable’ defence. The time can only be sufficient where it is completely outside the period of any affect. Nine days is well outside that period.
	


Lack of Information regarding testing levels


	
	I did not allow the defence to tender a document from a member of parliament seeking to support the contention that the government/police force was not releasing information on the level of the tests. The reason for that rejection is that this was effectively conceded by the prosecution. Mr Huxtable and Mr Costin-Neilson both made the submission that should this defence succeed those who choose to use cannabis will not have to ‘run the gauntlet’ whereby they do not know if they are detectable. That gauntlet is apparently part of the mystery and uncertainty-by-design of the current testing regime. As expressed, the argument is that the floodgates may be opened and lessen the deterrent effect of this legislation on consumption of cannabis should the defence be applied.
	
	
	As for floodgates, my duty is to apply the law as I see it in a given case and not determine that application based upon what could happen in other cases.
	


Police advice


	
	The only further prosecution submission not dealt with above is the reasonableness of reliance on the police advice. The prosecution contend that it is not reasonable. The defence contend that it is reasonable, given the dearth of information as to how long the wait has to be before the presence cannot be detected.
	
	
	Given the evidence in this case and the context in which the advice was proffered, I am not satisfied that the reliance upon it was unreasonable. In Ostrowski v Palmer (2004) 218 CLR 493, the reliance on the advice given by the government agency was not found unreasonable and the situation here is similar. After all, how else is a person to determine when they are ‘right to drive’? Mr Bolt suggested that government information is unhelpful - the NSW government website that I think he is referring to is the Centre for Road Safety (part of Transport For New South Wales) [2]  where there is the surprisingly definitive, oft-quoted statement made (my emphasis):
	


Cannabis can be detected in saliva for up to 12 hours after use. Stimulants (speed, ice and pills) can be detected for one to two days.


	
	Mr Bolt’s reference to ‘unhelpful’ is aptly restrained.
	


Conclusion


	
	In my view there is no bar to raising the defence in the current circumstances. Given the length of time given following the ingestion of the cannabis, the elimination of passive ingestion as a source, and in addition the advice proffered by the police officer on the previous occasion, I am satisfied that the belief was honest and reasonable. More precisely, the prosecution have not negatived the defence.
	
	
	Accordingly, I find the defendant not guilty in respect to the June offence, and will proceed to sentence on the May offence on a date to be fixed.

2702177,"Allen v Commissioner for Fair Trading + Commissioner of Police, New South Wales Police Force [2015] NSWCATAD 273","reasons for decision


	
	The applicant Christopher Allen applied to this tribunal on 7 September 2015 for review of a decision by a delegate of the Commissioner of Fair Trading (CFT) under s 27(1)(a) of the Tattoo Parlours Act 2012 (TP Act) dated 31 August 2015 to refuse to grant the applicant at tattooist licence under the TP Act. The applicant is currently employed as a tattooist at the Golden Needle Tattoo Parlour, which is operated by his father, John Allen.
	
	
	The Commissioner of Police had on 14 August 2015 made an adverse security determination (ASD) under s 19(1) of the Act, finding that the applicant is not a “fit and proper person” to hold a licence. The Director-General of Fair Trading is required to refer any licence applications to the Commissioner of Police for an investigation and determination as to whether the applicant is a fit and proper person to be granted a licence or whether it would be contrary to the public interest for a licence to be granted, or both (s 14).
	
	
	A delegate of the Commissioner of Police reported to the CFT under s 19(1) of the Act that that the delegate had inquired into the application and determined that the applicant was not a fit and proper person to be granted a licence because of his criminal history. The delegate also advised, pursuant to s 36(1) of the Act, that the applicant is disqualified from holding a licence, permit or other authority under the Firearms Act 1996, the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 and the Security Industry Act 1997 as a result of his conviction of offences against s 61 of the Crimes Act 1900 (Common Assault) on 20 June 2011. On that occasion the applicant was fined $400. As is required by s 16(3)(c) of the Act, the Chief Executive of the Department of Fair Trading refused to grant the licence.
	
	
	Montgomery SM granted a stay on 21 September 2015.
	


Applicable legislation


	
	Section 16 of the TP Act provides as follows:
	


16   Decision of Chief Executive in relation to licence application

(1)  The Chief Executive may, after considering an application for a licence and the determination of the Commissioner under section 19 on the application, grant the licence or refuse to grant the licence.

(2)  The Chief Executive may, in such circumstances as the Chief Executive considers appropriate, treat an application for a licence as having been withdrawn.

(3)  The Chief Executive must not grant a licence if:

(a)  the Chief Executive is satisfied that the application for the licence was not duly made, or

(b)  the applicant is a controlled member of a declared organisation, or

Note. Controlled members are prohibited from applying for licences—see section 27 of the Crimes (Criminal Organisations Control) Act 2012.

(c)  an adverse security determination has been made by the Commissioner about the applicant.

(4)  Without limiting subsection (1), the Chief Executive may refuse to grant an operator licence if the Chief Executive is satisfied that:

(a)  a prohibition order under Part 3 of the Public Health Act 2010 in connection with the carrying out of skin penetration procedures is in force in respect of the proposed licensed premises, or

(b)  development consent is required under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (or approval under Part 3A or Part 5.1 of that Act is required) to use the proposed licensed premises for the purposes of carrying on the body art tattooing business and such consent or approval has been refused or has not been granted.

(5)  The regulations may also provide mandatory or discretionary grounds for refusing the granting of a licence.

(6)  A licence confers no right of property and is incapable of being transferred, assigned or mortgaged, charged or otherwise encumbered.

Note. A non-transferable licence is not personal property for the purposes of the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 of the Commonwealth. See the definitions of licence and personal property in section 10 of that Act.

(7)  (Repealed)


	
	Section 19 deals with security determinations:
	


19   Commissioner to make security determinations about applicants and licensees

(1)  If an application for a licence is referred to the Commissioner for investigation under section 14, the Commissioner is to inquire into and determine, and report to the Chief Executive on, either or both of the following:

(a)  whether the applicant is a fit and proper person to be granted the licence,

(b)  whether it would be contrary to the public interest for the licence to be granted.

(2)  The Commissioner may also investigate and determine, whether at the request of the Chief Executive or on the Commissioner’s own initiative, either or both of the following and report to the Chief Executive on them:

(a)  whether a licensee continues to be a fit and proper person to hold his or her licence,

(b)  whether it would be contrary to the public interest for the licensee to continue to hold his or her licence.

(3)  For the purpose of making a determination on a matter referred to in subsection (1) or (2), the Commissioner may have regard to any criminal intelligence report or other criminal information held in relation to the applicant or licensee (or a close associate of the applicant or licensee) that:

(a)  is relevant to the business or procedures proposed to be carried on or performed, or carried on or performed, under the licence, or

(b)  causes the Commissioner to conclude that improper conduct is likely to occur if the applicant were granted the licence or the licensee continued to hold the licence, or

(c)  causes the Commissioner not to have confidence that improper conduct will not occur if the applicant were granted the licence or the licensee continued to hold the licence.


	
	The tribunal has jurisdiction under s 27(1)(a) of the Act to review the Chief Executive’s refusal or failure to grant a licence to a person. The issue in this case is thus whether the correct and preferable decision is to affirm, vary or set aside the decision to refuse the applicant a licence and, specifically, whether the applicant is a fit and proper person to hold a tattooist licence.
	


Applicant’s evidence


	
	At the hearing the applicant adopted his statement dated 26 September 2015 (exhibit A1) in which he said inter alia that he is aged 38 and works as a tattoo artist for his father, who has been in the business since 1972. In 1999 the applicant attended a skin penetration guideline training workshop conducted by the New South Wales Health Department, and later that year began a course in basic microbiology, infection and disease, completing it 3 months later.
	
	
	After working in a variety of positions, he started in April 1999 as an unpaid apprentice for his father, and continued in that role until December 2003, when he commenced as a paid worker, receiving a share of about 60 percent of the work he did. In 2002 he was accepted as an associate artist member of the National Tattoo Association in the United States, membership in that category being limited to 1000 people worldwide. It is difficult to become a member and in Australia there are only fifteen members. In 2003 he was accepted as a member of the Professional Tattooing Association of Australia, another organization that is difficult to join.
	
	
	Early in 2005 his mother became very sick and was diagnosed with cancer, which led to her death in 2009. He became very depressed and worked only part-time in the industry from July 2006 until 2012, when “my problems started and I was convicted of a number of offences”. During that period he obtained psychiatric help and was on medication, but has since turned his life around and has been a full-time tattooist since July 2013.
	
	
	He began living with his de facto partner Kelly Cooper in 1995 and they are still together. They have six children together, including Jacob, aged 18, who suffers from mild cerebral palsy. The two eldest children have left home. Before stopping work because of the letter he received from the Department of Fair Trading, he was taking home about $500-$600 per week. Kelly is on Centrelink benefits and receives about $360 per week. He has a motorcycle but they do not possess a car. Tattooing is the only work in which he has qualifications and he believes that at his age, if he loses his tattooing licence, his prospects for obtaining work to support his family are poor.
	
	
	As regards the assault charge for which he was convicted in January 2012, he states that in February 2011, his son Jacob went to the local store with his cousin and sister to buy some goods. While they were returning home a car containing three people pulled up and one person got out. Jacob’s sister and cousin ran off, as they were frightened, but because of his palsy, Jacob was unable to do so. He told the applicant that “the guy from the corner shop got out of the car, held up a knife in my face and told me that “if you go to my shop I will cut you like a pig”. The applicant was charged by the police and engaged a local lawyer who told him to plead guilty, without listening to his story. The police were not interested and did not interview Willow (the applicant’s daughter) or Nicholas (the cousin).
	
	
	The applicant had then gone around to the shop to confront the alleged victim. He did not walk into the shop with a face covering and did not threaten to kill him. He did not hit him. Willow and Nicholas returned home very distressed about the incident. Willow said to him words to the effect of, “The man from the corner shop pulled up in a car. He pulled a knife out and went to open the door, and I ran off with Nicholas”.
	
	
	At the hearing the applicant said that the lawyer had not interviewed Jacob or Willow. The complainant/victim, Mandeep Chohan on a previous occasion had come to the applicant’s house to deliver food, but Kelly had refused to accept delivery. Mr Chohan threatened to kill her, and she complained to police about the incident. The police had not interviewed any of them about the complaint.
	
	
	In cross-examination the applicant admitted that he had a long criminal history, but did not admit the 2011 assault charge. Mr Chohan had punched him, and he had struck him with his bag. To the best of his recollection it was one motion. When his attention was drawn to his statement (exhibit A1) in which he had said he had not hit the victim, he said he did not recall saying that he had not hit him and had never denied that he had. For the past year he had been under stress and it was hard to know head or tail of what had happened. The statement did not say what he had hit the victim with. If he had said he had not hit him, it was a mistake.
	
	
	His attention was then drawn to a passage in the ERISP transcript (part exhibit R3), pp 30 – 31, in which he was quoted as saying that he had “Never had any dealings with them (the operators of the local store) whatsoever, other than buying cigarettes from there”, that he had had “nothing to do with them whatsoever”. He replied that he had pleaded guilty, and asked why he was being “prosecuted again”. He did not understand any of it. From the outset he had never denied having struck Mr Chohan and agreed that the fine he received was a fair result. He had pleaded guilty to save stress and time, but the victim had attempted to assault his son and daughter and he was trying to protect them. Referring to p 31 of the ERISP record, he said he did not recall any of it, because it was so long ago. He did not recall whether his son had told him that Mr Chohan had pulled a knife on him, but his daughter had said who it was.
	
	
	When Ms Rao pointed out to him that in his statement (exhibit A1) para 22, he had said that Jacob had told him that “the guy from the corner shop” was the assailant, he replied that it was so long ago and he was so stressed, he did not recall. He did not know if either or both versions were unreliable. He did not understand, but he did not dispute that he had hit the victim. Similarly, as regards his ERISP comment that he had “distanced” himself from all of the relevant events because they are opening another tattoo shop and he is trying to keep his business going, and that the Thai food delivery episode was the first and only time he had come face to face with the victim (p 32, Q26), he repeated that he could not recall any of it because it was so long ago. He did not explain why he had told the police that he had not retaliated and that he had not committed an offence (Q47, 48), but said he had never worn any face covering.
	
	
	The applicant was then asked about a passage in the ERISP transcript where he had said he had never assaulted anyone and would not do so for any reason, including for any reason related to his children. He replied that he had done nothing wrong and had only defended himself. Later in the interview he had repeated that he had done nothing wrong, “I did not, I, I didn’t assault him in the shop. I didn’t confront him in the shop. The only time I ever confronted him was in, on my property”, and that “I didn’t go in there [into the shop] at all” (Qs 69-71). He further replied that he did not recall, he had hit him with the bag and had pleaded guilty because he was afraid of jail. He then repeated that he had never confronted the victim in the shop. Initially he had pleaded not guilty, but he did not trust the police and had decided to “cop it”. The lawyer he had engaged was “an arse” who cared only about the money. It was all confusing and frustrating, he had thought he was helping his children by making the whole matter go away. He had paid the $400 and was pleased that he had not been sent to jail.
	
	
	The applicant also tendered a statement by John Allen, his father, who said inter alia that he had opened his own tattoo shop in 1972 in Blacktown and had been in the business ever since. He had operated in his current shop for about 23 years. He was married in 1972 to his wife Robyn and they had three children, including the applicant. Christopher had a talent for drawing but his academic skills were limited and he left school at the age of 14. He had a number of jobs over the years and also wanted to be a tattoo artist. At that stage he was not sufficiently committed to become a tattooist and was also mixing with the wrong crowd and got into trouble. In April 1999 at the age of 20 he was ready to undergo an apprenticeship in the shop and did so.
	
	
	As a tattoo artist he is “wonderful operator, always keeping up with the latest trends and very well respected in the industry. He works very well with clients and retains much of his clientele. He is a member of the National Tattoo Association, of which there are only 15 members in Australia and 1000 members worldwide. He is also a member of the Australian association. Both bodies set very high standards. His mother’s fatal cancer greatly affected Christopher. He was suffering from depression and was treated by a psychiatrist. Between 2006 and 2012 he worked only irregularly for the business but then decided to work in it and has been wonderful. His client base has been growing and he was going well until the letter from Fair Trading told him to stop working. In that period he kept away from the shops. He is a very talented artist and does everything by the book. He takes his time and never rushes a job”.
	
	
	Christopher is a large part of his business, and his not having a licence would be a great loss to both of them. To replace a man of his calibre would be difficult and the business would suffer.
	
	
	The applicant also tendered a statement dated 28 September 2015 by his daughter Willow Allen, who said that she had gone to the corner shop with her friend, her cousin and her brother. After they left they were walking back when a car pulled up next to them. It was the man who works in the shop they had been to. He began “yelling at us, saying tell all your friends to stay away from my shop”. He then pulled out a knife and said he would “gut us” if they caused any trouble for his shop. At that point she began to run home to tell her mother, who called the police. When they pulled him over they could not find a knife, so they did not charge him.
	
	
	The applicant tendered a number of character references (exhibit A3). One, dated 23 August 2015, is from Mr Brian Perry of Lalor Park who states that he is a close family friend and neighbour who has known the applicant for about 15 years and has been a neighbour for 12 years. He acknowledges that the applicant has had “a few misadventures in his life”, but says he has grown from them and has excelled in all his personal and professional ambitions. He has a caring family that he supports and cares for emotionally and financially, as well as the family-owned business where he works, the Golden Needle Tattoo Studio at Blacktown, with his father and brother. He is confident in saying that Christopher Allen is well adjusted, caring member of the local community. Ms Lucy Jorden, also of Lalor Park, in a letter dated 23 September 2015 states that she has had the pleasure of knowing the applicant for the past five years. She notes that he has experienced “hardships” over the years, but through his love for his family and his position in the family business, he has grown from those hardships and difficulties to become a wonderful family man and a hard-working, honest and very dependable person. The most important things to him are is strong family commitment and his very strong work ethic, and to be able to support and provide for his partner and his six children.
	
	
	Ms Rebecca Collier, of Blacktown, states in a letter dated 26 September that the applicant has been her tattooist for the past two years and during that time has become a good friend. He is a bright and talented artist that she highly recommends to anyone and respects and trusts him because of the comfortable, friendly, welcoming approach he takes towards his customers. He has a fantastic talent that needs to be nurtured, not wasted. Ms Sandi Smith of Lalor Park has known the applicant for about 16 years and their sons have attended the same schools and have grown up together. She has enjoyed those years with Chris and his family and they have had many birthday and Christmas celebrations together as families. During that time he had been very responsible. He has a caring nature and it is a joy to watch him with his family. As a single mother, she has appreciated his being there as a male role model for her son, providing sound and level-headed advice. He has held a steady job in his family business for the past fifteen years and takes great pride in producing high quality work for his clients.
	
	
	None of the applicant’s witnesses, apart from the applicant himself, were required for cross-examination.
	


Respondents’ evidence


	
	The respondents called no oral evidence but relied on the s 58 documents (exhibit R1), the Commissioner’s ASD file (exhibit R2) and other documentary material, including an affidavit dated 10 December 2015 by Jennifer Windsor, a solicitor with the police force (exhibit R4). Ms Windsor stated that as the applicant’s solicitor on 29 September 2015 served some submissions that objected to all the fact sheets tendered by the respondent on the ground that they came from the police and not from the court papers, she had obtained from Blacktown Local Court 21 fact sheets relating to charges referred to in the ASD, together with the court files relating to two of the above matters. In relation to 5 other matters, the court was unable to locate a record.
	
	
	The most recent fact sheet (H44728233) described how at 8:30 pm on 24 February 2011, the victim, Mandeep Chohan, was seated at the front counter of his mixed business in Johnson Avenue, Seven Hills when the applicant entered, walked up to him and the witness (the victim’s mother), and said, “Where is your son, how dare he pull a knife on my kid, call him now”. At that point the applicant could not see the victim, as he was sitting on the floor behind the front counter. After hearing what the accused had said, the victim rose to his feet, and while he was doing so the applicant swung a black sports bag that struck the victim on the left side of the head. The witness then seized the bag and the applicant struggled to take it from her. The victim recognized the accused as a former customer and as someone to whom he had delivered Thai food a few weeks previously. The applicant then left the store, followed by the victim, who had picked up a metal rod with which to protect himself and the witness. The victim and the applicant exchanged some words and the applicant then walked off in the company of a young male who had been waiting outside during the incident. The victim recognized the young male as someone who had caused him some problems recently by loitering around his shop and intimidating customers. The victim then contacted police. The fact sheet then describes how the applicant was identified, arrested and charged and notes that the applicant told police that his son had told him that the victim had pulled a knife on him at some point.
	
	
	As the main area of dispute in the present matter appeared to be that the applicant believed he should not have pleaded guilty to that charge and had only done so at a result of being told by his lawyer (whose name he could not recall) to do so, the police made enquiries that enabled them to locate the lawyer, Mr Joseph Nashed, of Parramatta. At the hearing the respondents tendered an affidavit by Mr Nashed dated 10 December 2015 (exhibit R3) in which the deponent stated inter alia that he had been shown a statement by Mr Allen alleging that he had instructed him to plead guilty, did not listen to his story and failed to conduct a defence of self-defence, which was available because he had in fact been acting in self-defence. Mr Nashed rejected all those allegations. He related how Mr Allen had contacted him on 9 January 2012 in relation to the charge which was listed for final hearing before Blacktown Local Court on 13 January 2012. At the time, the applicant informed him that he had already entered a plea of not guilty in answer to it.
	
	
	At a conference with the applicant 10 January, Mr Allen confirmed that his instructions were to plead not guilty and that his defence was as stated in his ERISP recording, namely that the incident alleged by the complainant did not happen and that he was not at the shop at the time the alleged offence was committed. In the interval before the hearing, Mr Nashed spent considerable time preparing for it, including taking detailed case notes, copies of which were annexed to his affidavit. He was of the view at that time that Mr Allen’s defence case presented some questions of identification and credibility. While in the ERISP he had denied ever being present at the scene, there was on the other hand the evidence of two prosecution witnesses who provided statements to the contrary. He prepared the case in advance to the best of his ability, consistently with the case theory that the applicant had not been at the scene of the alleged offence.
	
	
	On the morning of the hearing, the prosecution in accordance with usual practice raised the question of possible negotiations and a guilty plea. After taking into account the prosecution case as well as Mr Allen’s defence, Mr Nashed gave Mr Alan further advice in conference about his prospects of successfully defending the assault charge. Mr Allen had agreed with his assessment by acknowledging that the prosecution case was strong and that he would probably be found guilty. He then provided Mr Nashed with written instructions to enter a guilty plea. A copy of those instructions was annexed to the affidavit.
	
	
	In accordance with his client’s instructions, he negotiated with the police prosecutor concerning facts that would be admitted on sentencing. He obtained police agreement to the omission of various matters from the police facts that would have aggravated the offence. Following the guilty plea, Mr Allen was convicted and fined $400. He told Mr Nashed that he was very pleased with the outcome of the case and thanked him. Subsequently he even referred people to Mr Nashed for legal representation. He did not instruct the applicant to plead guilty but spent considerable time preparing to run his defence case and was ready and willing on the morning of the hearing to do so. Rather, he gave Mr Allen legal advice in light of the police offer to accept a plea with some amendments to the police facts. He then instructed Mr Nashed to enter a guilty plea, not vice versa. He did listen to Mr Allen’s story, and at the conference on 10 January was instructed that he was not at the shop at the time of the offence. He rejects the allegation that he had failed to run an available defence of self-defence. On the basis of the instructions he had received and the contents of the ERISP, a defence of self-defence was impossible, as it was inconsistent with the applicant’s instructions that he was not at the shop, and self-defence was never raised by him during the ERISP. In light of those instructions it was not ethically or legally open to maintain a defence of self-defence.
	
	
	The respondent also relied on some confidential parts of exhibit R2 that will be referred to below.
	


Applicant’s submissions


	
	The applicant’s solicitor served some written submissions dated 28 September 2015 in which he pointed out inter alia that the applicant is now aged 38, and his first criminal conviction was in December 1991 when he was aged 14. His first conviction as an adult occurred in 1996 when he was 18. From 1996 until 2005, he committed no offences, and explains the later offences as having been caused by his mother’s ill-health and her eventual death in 2009.
	
	
	The last offence occurred in 2011, following a gap of 6 years, and he was convicted in 2012. He was badly represented by his then lawyer, who should have entered a plea of not guilty. There were 3 witnesses to what occurred, Jacob, Willow and her friend Nicholas. If those witnesses had given evidence, the charges probably would not have succeeded. But for that offence, the applicant has had no charges since 2008.
	
	
	He is in a stable relationship with his partner and has 6 children. He works full-time for his father as a tattoo artist and there is no evidence of any complaints from either the police or the local council. His father speaks highly of him, as do the people who have offered references. He is a member of two professional associations, the joining of which is a difficult task. One needs to be a high performer to keep one’s membership of those bodies. He poses no danger to the public and is a fit and proper person to conduct himself as a tattoo artist.
	
	
	His only work qualification is as a tattoo artist. He earns a reasonable living and is able to support his family, but given his age and limited education, he would have little prospect of finding reasonably paid employment. Not allowing him to work at his profession would be harsh and unjust. His family would suffer financial hardship without his contribution. He has few assets other than an old motorcycle, and rents the house they live in. Licences are renewed every 3 years, and if in the meantime he were to be convicted of an offence, his future licence would be at risk. For that reason the chances of his re-offending are slight.
	
	
	At the hearing Mr Maspero submitted that the concept of fitness and propriety was widely defined. To be a tattoo artist was not like applying for admission as a lawyer. The legislation’s aim was simply to free the industry of the biker criminal element.
	
	
	The applicant admits his criminal record, apart from the 2011 common assault charge, and has given reasons for his conduct. He might not have pleaded guilty to the 2011 charge if he had been better represented. His lawyer at the time failed to investigate the facts and circumstances of the case.
	
	
	He has a partner who is unable to work and 6 children, 4 of whom are living at home. He has lived within the law for several years and has an incentive to remain within the law, because any new conviction could cause loss of his licence. The ERISP interview with the police was conducted under high pressure and in circumstances in which the applicant could say the wrong thing. There is a tendency for people to trust their lawyers, but in this case the applicant’s solicitor could have done better. Mr Allen has tendered a number of supportive character references.
	


Consideration


	
	Under s 63 of the Administrative Decisions Review Act 1997 (ADR Act), the tribunal’s role is to determine whether, having regard to the underlying facts in the matter and the applicable law, the respondent’s decision is the correct and preferable one. The tribunal is to review the merits of the original decision and is required to consider the evidence available at that time, together with any other or later material, so as to affirm the original decision, vary it or set it aside: Drake v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1979) 2 ALD 60, 77. The tribunal has jurisdiction under s 27(1) of the TP Act, which empowers it to form its own view of the fitness and propriety of an applicant, although that does not require reviewing the ASD itself.
	
	
	Under s 9 of the Act, two kinds of licence may be granted: an operator licence and a tattooist licence. The person may apply to the Director-General for a tattooist licence pursuant to s 11 of the Act. The applicant is required to submit a written statement in respect of close associates and applicants must be fingerprinted and palm printed: ss 12, 13. On receiving an application for a licence, the Director-General is to refer the application to the Commissioner for an investigation and determination as to whether the applicant is a fit and proper person to be granted a licence, and whether it would be contrary to the public interest for the licence to be granted.
	
	
	By virtue of s 19, the Commissioner is to inquire into, determine and report to the Director-General on those matters. For the purposes of making his determination, the Commissioner may have regard to criminal intelligence reports or other criminal information held in relation to an applicant, namely that which:
	



	
	is relevant to the business or procedures proposed to be carried on or performed, or carried on or performed, under the licence, or
	
	
	causes the Commissioner not to have confidence that improper conduct will not occur if the applicant were granted the licence or the licensee continued to hold the licence, or
	
	
	causes the Commissioner to conclude that improper conduct is likely to occur if the applicant were granted the licence or the licensee continued to hold a licence.
	



	
	Neither the Commissioner nor the Director-General is required to give any reasons for the determination or for not granting a licence, if such reasons would disclose any criminal intelligence report or other criminal information: s 20.
	
	
	While the Director-General in some circumstances has a discretion as to whether to grant a licence, a licence must not be granted if the Commissioner makes an adverse security determination in relation to the applicant: s 16(3)(c). A licence once granted remains in force for three years and may not be renewed: s 17.
	
	
	As was noted above, under s 27(1)(a) the tribunal may review the Director-General’s refusal or failure to grant a licence, but the tribunal is not expressly granted jurisdiction to review any report or determination made by the Commissioner. It is not, however, prevented from determining whether the Director-General made the correct and preferable decision merely because of the Commissioner’s determination. Unlike the Director-General, therefore, the tribunal has a discretion to grant a licence notwithstanding an adverse security determination made by the Commissioner. Although the Commissioner’s report or security determination is not under review, the tribunal may nevertheless decide to grant a licence despite the ASD.
	
	
	The assessment of whether an applicant is a fit and proper person rests with the Commissioner, but the Act makes it clear that it is the Director-General’s decision that is under review, and not the Commissioner’s determination. Under s 8(2) of the ADR Act, the person or body whose decisions are administratively reviewable is taken to be the only administrator in relation to the making of an administratively reviewable decision, even if some other person or body also had a role in the making of the decision.
	
	
	The provisions of the TP Act and the power that it confers must be construed and applied in such a way as to be consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the Act: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28, (1998) 194 CLR 355, [69]. The Act contains no objects clause, but the tribunal may have regard to the Minister’s second reading speech to ascertain the purpose of the legislation, the mischief that it was designed to cure. The second reading speech of the TP Act noted that the Act was introduced in response to gang crime in New South Wales. It aims to break the stranglehold that outlaw motorcycle gangs had over the tattoo industry. It was expected that removing bikers from the tattoo industry would reduce the reasons for rival gangs to engage in turf wars, because those businesses would no longer be symbols of a gang’s territory. The Act’s purpose is not, however, limited to eradicating the influence of outlaw motorcycle gangs (OMCGs) in the industry. The “fit and proper” criterion applied in the Act is of much broader application, as was explained in a comprehensive review of the authorities by Moloney SM in Smith v Commissioner of Police & Anor [2014] NSWCATAD 211 at [38] to [41].
	
	
	The assessment of fitness and propriety is a question of fact to be decided objectively in relation to the activities in which the applicant, if licensed, would be engaged (ibid). It has been held to involve three things, honesty, knowledge and ability (Hughes and Vale Pty Ltd v New South Wales (No. 2) (1955) 93 CLR 127, 156 – 7. In Sobey v Commercial and Private Agents Board, Walters J had this to say:
	


In my opinion what is meant by that expression is that the Applicant must show not only that he is possessed of the requisite knowledge of the duties and responsibilities evolving upon him as the holder of a particular licence… but also that he is possessed of sufficient moral integrity and rectitude of character as to permit him to be safely accredited to the public… as a person to be entrusted with the sort of work which the licence entails.


	
	In the context of the TP Act, unfitness can be indicated by criminal associations, habitual recidivism, formal or informal links with OMCGs, failure to implement proper tattooing practices and general disregard for the law. Relevant in this case are Hennessy DP’s comments in Saadieh v Director-General, Department of Transport [1999] NSWADT 68, [17]. In the context of a taxi licence, the tribunal identified factors relevant to fitness and propriety as including:
	



	
	the nature, seriousness and frequency of any criminal offences for which the applicant has been arrested or convicted;
	
	
	the applicant’s reputation in the community; and
	
	
	the likelihood that the applicant will reoffend, be the subject of further complaints or commit further offences.
	



	
	The applicant does not deny that he has a lengthy criminal record. It is set out in the open portions of the ASD at para 7.1 and includes 16 offences as an adult between 1996 and the 2012 case involving the assault against the shopkeeper. The offences include driving while never having held a licence (second offence), common assault, three counts of destroying or damaging property, contravening an apprehended domestic violence order, failure to appear in accordance with a bail undertaking, goods in custody, using an unregistered vehicle and supplying false information to a pawnbroker. There are also five convictions in Children’s Court, including assault and stealing, between 1991 and 1993.
	
	
	In his ERISP interview he explained to police when they queried him about his contradictory accounts of the events that he was taking a great deal of medication, and “I’m bipolar and I’m, and right now I take, I take Valium and stuff every, every day mate. So I can’t remember, remember everything to the exact fact, exact facts and details…” (Exhibit R3, Q72). The respondent did not challenge the proposition that he was being treated for a psychiatric disorder, but there is no expert evidence before the tribunal about his precise diagnosis, the treatment he is receiving, and the effect, if any, that the condition or the medication, or both, might have on his behaviour or his mental state, including his memory.
	
	
	The applicant’s approach in this case is to challenge the correctness of his most recent conviction, the assault charge relating to the shopkeeper. He maintains that he was wrongly convicted because he pleaded guilty on the advice of his lawyer, and that if he had been properly represented, the charges would have been dismissed. In that event he would have had a period of approximately 8 years free of any convictions that would show he was rehabilitated and consequently a fit and proper person to hold a tattooist licence.
	
	
	The general rule is that where the exercise of jurisdiction by a tribunal depends on conviction for an offence (as in the case of criminal deportation), the conviction cannot be challenged before the tribunal, other than in exceptional circumstances: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Ali (2000) 106 FCR 313, [42]; Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Gungor (1982) 4 ALD 575; (1982) 42 ALR 209. On the other hand, “where the exercise of power is not founded on a criminal conviction, then even if the conviction be relevant, a challenge may be made to the essential facts on which it was based”: Saffron v FCT (No. 2) (1991) 102 ALR 19, 22.
	
	
	In this case the exercise of jurisdiction is not based on the conviction itself, but on an application for review of a decision by the respondent. Nevertheless, in such a case conviction and sentence are “strong prima facie evidence of the facts upon which they are necessarily based so as to throw a heavy onus on a person who seeks to challenge such facts to show why they should not be accepted” (Ali, [43]). The Court of Appeal in Sudath v Health Care Complaints Commission explained that “The leading of evidence which challenges the facts underlying the conviction does not, without more, involve the re-litigation of the question whether the appellant was guilty of the offences so as to engage the public policy against collateral attack on a conviction” (at [103]).
	
	
	The applicant’s line of argument encounters a number of difficulties, the first being the inconsistencies and flat contradictions between the various accounts he has given of the relevant events:
	



	
	In his written statement (exhibit A1), the applicant said, “I went around to the shop to confront the alleged victim…. I did not walk into the shop with a face cover and I did not threaten to kill him. I did not hit him” (at [21] – [24]).
	
	
	During the stay hearing in this tribunal on 21 September 2015, he said that “when I walked into the shop to confront the man he sort of stood up and threw a punch at me and I hit him with my bag”. He had been “pretty much” acting in self-defence (exhibit R7, p 6).
	
	
	In his police ERISP interview, he twice said that he had not at any time entered the shop, that he did not retaliate in any way, that he had never assaulted anybody and added that he would not do so for any reason, including anything to do with his children (transcript, part exhibit R3, pp 7 to 10) (emphasis added in each case).
	



	
	In addition, at the hearing he said that he could not recall going into the shop, then shortly afterwards said he had never confronted the victim in the shop, but several times admitted hitting him, and indeed claimed that he had never denied doing so.
	
	
	He endeavoured to explain these inconsistencies by pleading loss of memory. On nine separate occasions, in response to nine questions, he replied that he did not recall, adding several times that it was so long ago and that he was stressed at the time. He also said that he did not “understand any of it”. Yet 2011 is not such a long time ago, and his being stressed would not normally affect his recollection of an incident that was an important event in his life. As to not understanding any of it, the applicant’s record shows that he is no stranger to forensic proceedings.
	
	
	The applicant maintains that the lawyer who represented him on the 2011 charge told him to plead guilty without listening to his story (exhibit A1, para 23). The affidavit (exhibit R3),by the lawyer, Mr Nashed, states that he received the prosecution brief of evidence on 9 January 2012, and after studying it had a conference with the applicant on 10 January in relation to the hearing. During that conference, Mr Allen instructed his solicitor that, consistently with his statement to police on the ERISP recording, he had not been at the shop at the relevant time. Consequently, it was logically impossible to defend the prosecution on the basis of self-defence.
	
	
	Mr Nashed states that despite the short period of time between Mr Allen retaining his services and the hearing on 13 January, he spent considerable time preparing for the hearing, including compiling detailed case notes. The notes, which are annexed to the affidavit, comprise 14 pages of double-spaced handwritten notes dealing inter alia with what appears to be an opening, cross-examination of Mr Chohan and a final address. From the factual detail embodied in the notes, it is obvious that Mr Nashed had previously taken detailed instructions from the applicant in relation to his version of events, as well as his background and circumstances. Mr Nashed was not called for cross-examination and his evidence completely refutes the proposition that he had not listened to the applicant’s story or that he failed to present an available case of self-defence.
	
	
	On the morning of the trial, given that the prosecution had two witnesses and an obviously strong case, Mr Nashed entered into negotiations with the police prosecutor for a plea of guilty on the basis that certain aggravating features of the charge would be deleted from the fact sheet. The applicant agreed that he was likely to be convicted if the matter proceeded and agreed to the arrangement. He instructed his solicitor in writing to enter a plea of guilty and initialled the amended fact sheet, which is also annexed to the affidavit. On the basis of all the evidence I find that the allegation against Mr Nashed is without substance. Making it was a discreditable act that reflects adversely on the applicant’s fitness and propriety.
	
	
	When giving his oral evidence, the applicant was an erratic witness who frequently became agitated when questioned about the issues in the case. He repeatedly claimed to be unable to recall matters that he should normally have been able to remember and was quite unable to explain the inconsistencies and contradictions in his earlier versions of his story. The somewhat unusual result is that his handling of the 2011 assault charge reflects adversely on him at least as much as the assault itself which, the evidence indicates, was seriously provoked by Mr Chohan.
	
	
	It is now necessary to consider the confidential material in the ASD (exhibit R2).

	Relying on Assi v Roads and Maritime Services [2013] NSWADT 159, [31], Ms Rao submitted that the five references tendered by the applicant (exhibit A3) merited no weight as they made no reference to his criminal history. Three of them to allude to it, however, in euphemistic terms such as that the applicant had had “a few misadventures in his life”, or that he had experienced “hardships and difficulties”. Mr Eldridge, state representative of the Professional Tattooing Association of Australia Inc., stated that he was aware of Mr Allen’s licence refusal and appeal and considered the decision “to be unjust and not relevant to his ability to perform his duties in his trade and profession”. Experience shows that many people who provide references feel that a certain delicacy is involved in referring specifically to a person’s misdeeds and prefer to make only oblique references to them. Provided that the testimonial expresses some awareness of the legal trouble in which the subject finds himself or herself, it can be taken into account, but the weight that can be attributed to it cannot be substantial. In this case the references, some of them from people who have known the applicant for many years, are very supportive and speak highly of his competence and behaviour as a tattoo artist.
	
	
	Also in the applicant’s favour is the fact that none of his transgressions relate to his activities or behaviour as a tattooist. He has no known links with OMCGs or other criminal elements. He is regarded as having a high level of expertise, good relations with customers and enjoys favourable standing in the industry. He appears to be a reasonably responsible family man in a chaotic way, and no doubt there is a public benefit in a person, not least a man with a large family, being able to engage in gainful employment rather than being kept by the taxpayer.
	
	
	The applicant showed signs of long-term rehabilitation after the 2008 offence until the 2011 assault on the shopkeeper. That could be regarded as a sign of relapse into his earlier habits of disregard for law, or it could be viewed as an isolated incident resulting from real provocation, in the form of the dire threats made to his disabled son. Further, the authorities make it clear that fitness and propriety are to be judged in the context of the activities intended to be engaged in. Being a fit and proper person to perform tattooing does not necessarily require an applicant to have led a life of unblemished rectitude.
	
	
	On the other hand, his long criminal history is most unimpressive, especially with the addition of the significant 2011 assault, which is relatively recent. His contradictory accounts of the incident, his inability to explain the substantial conflicts between them, his baseless attack on his former lawyer and his erratic performance when giving evidence seriously undermine his case. The confidential material is also of real concern. There is in addition no expert psychiatric or psychological evidence that might cast light on the applicant’s current mental state and his likely future conduct.
	
	
	On the basis of all the evidence, I find that the applicant is not at present a fit and proper person to hold a tattooist licence. If he is ever to reapply for a licence, one may suggest, without seeking to predict the outcome of any future security determination or Director-General’s decision, that he would need at the very least to be able to point to a substantial period of rehabilitation with no offences and without coming under adverse notice of the authorities.
	
	
	The decision under review is affirmed.

2702213,Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Heng [2015] NSWCCA 333,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: On 18 December 2015 the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) made a detention application pursuant to s 50 of the Bail Act 2013 (NSW) concerning Mr Chan Heng. Mr Heng had been granted bail by Hidden J on 17 December 2015. At the conclusion of the hearing of the Director’s application to this Court on 23 December 2015 the Court revoked the orders made by Hidden J and refused bail for the following reasons.
	


Primary proceedings


	
	Mr Heng was arrested on 9 July 2013 and charged with serious drug offences. He was refused bail. He made a release application on 27 June 2014 but bail was again refused.
	
	
	On 3 September 2014, whilst represented by senior counsel, he entered pleas of guilty in the Local Court to offences against s 307.1(1) and ss 305.3(1) and 11.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug and conspiracy to manufacture a commercial quantity of a controlled drug for a commercial purpose). The matter was adjourned for the purpose of the parties negotiating an agreed statement of facts. On 22 October 2014 the pleas of guilty were confirmed and Mr Heng was committed to the District Court for sentence.
	
	
	Mr Heng engaged new legal representatives in about April – May 2015. On 29 May 2015, his new solicitor, Mr S Joyner, informed the District Court that Mr Heng desired to change his pleas to not guilty. On 5 June 2015 the matter was fixed for trial on 15 February 2016. The estimated duration of the trial is 4 weeks.
	
	
	The indictment that has been filed in the District Court alleges the following offences:
	



	
	Between about 24 April 2013 and 17 June 2013 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did import a substance being a border controlled drug, namely methamphetamine, and the quantity imported being a commercial quantity (Criminal Code s 307.1(1)).
	
	
	Between about 4 June 2013 and 17 June 2013 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did aid, abet, counsel, procure, solicit or incite the commission of an offence by Yuk Ho Kwok and Wai Man Wan, namely the manufacture of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity for that drug (Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) ss 24(2) and 27(1)).
	



	
	On 21 July 2015 Mr Heng filed a release application in the Supreme Court. That application came before Hidden J on 8 October 2015. It became part-heard before his Honour and was before him again on four occasions culminating in bail being granted on 17 December 2015. The Director filed his detention application the next day.
	


Reasons bail was granted


	
	The release application before his Honour was based primarily upon the need for Mr Heng to prepare for his trial. The prosecution brief of evidence is substantial and it comprises a considerable amount of electronic material by way of surveillance videos and conversations recorded by telephone intercepts and listening devices.
	
	
	A substantive hearing of the bail application took place on 19 November 2015. Affidavits were read and oral evidence was taken, particularly concerning the extent of Mr Heng’s requirement for access to a computer upon which to review evidence served by the Crown in electronic form. The evidence and submissions before Hidden J on 19 November 2015 canvassed the limitations upon Mr Heng’s access to computers whilst in custody.
	
	
	In a preliminary judgment of 24 November 2015, Hidden J said that he considered the prosecution case to be ""a strong one"". He considered that ""there are real concerns as to [Mr Heng's] appearance at court and as to the risk of further serious offences if he were released on bail"".
	
	
	Hidden J’s primary reason for granting bail on 15 December 2015 was that Mr Heng was unable to have sufficient access to computers in the custodial environment to review the electronic material in the prosecution brief. Following the hearing on 19 November 2015 and his Honour handing down his preliminary judgment of 24 November 2015, some arrangements were made for improved access for Mr Heng to computers. Hidden J stood the matter over to 17 December to see what might transpire. When the matter came back before him on that date there was evidence that Mr Heng had had ""substantial access to computer facilities"" in the preceding 3 weeks or so. However, his Honour accepted the concern of Mr Heng's solicitor that this access remained deficient and that this put in jeopardy the proper preparation of his defence for his trial due to commence in February 2016.
	


Bail conditions imposed by Hidden J


	
	The conditions of bail imposed by Hidden J were very strict. They required Mr Heng to live at a certain address and not to leave it except in the company of a nominated person or for the purpose of attending his solicitor's office. Other conditions included that Mr Heng was to report to police twice daily and to only use one mobile phone the number of which was to be provided to police.
	
	
	Four nominated acceptable persons were to deposit security for the payment of a total of $380,000 and to forfeit it if Mr Heng failed to appear in court.
	
	
	The rationale for granting bail and imposing these conditions was that Mr Heng would attend his solicitor's office Monday to Friday each week from 9.00am to 6.00pm where he would devote himself to a consideration of the material in the prosecution brief and then provide instructions to his solicitor and counsel.
	


Relevant provisions of the Bail Act


	
	The Director's detention application required this Court to consider the question of bail afresh: Bail Act s 75. It was not a matter of reviewing the decision of Hidden J.
	
	
	Mr Heng is required to show cause (on the balance of probabilities: s 32) why his detention is not justified: Bail Act 2013 s 16A. One reason for this is that the offences alleged are punishable by imprisonment for life (s 16B(1)(a)). The first offence is under Part 9.1 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 that involves the importation of a commercial quantity of a serious drug within the meaning of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (s 16B(1)(g)). The second offence is under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 and involves the manufacture of a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (s 16B(1)(f)) and is one of aiding and abetting an offence mentioned elsewhere in s 16B (s 16B(1)(k)). Another reason why cause must be shown is that both offences are serious indictable offences alleged to have been committed whilst Mr Heng was on parole (s 16B(1)(h(ii)).
	
	
	In relation to the last of those provisions that invoke the show cause requirement, Mr Heng was sentenced in the District Court on 5 December 2008 for the supply of a prohibited drug and received a sentence of imprisonment of 7 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months. The sentence dated from 10 May 2007. The non-parole period expired on 9 February 2011 and the total term expired on 9 November 2014. Mr Heng's parole was revoked after his arrest for the present matter on 9 July 2013. He had been at liberty on parole for two years and five months by that date. He served the balance of his earlier sentence in custody from 1 August 2013 until 3 December 2014. Only his custody from 3 December 2014 to the present (now approximately 14 months) has been attributable solely to his remand to face the current changes.
	
	
	If Mr Heng were successful in this Court in showing cause, it would remain to consider whether there were any ""bail concerns"" by a consideration of (and only) the various matters listed in s 18(1) of the Bail Act 2013. In doing so, if the Court were to come to the conclusion that there were any ""unacceptable risks"", it would be required to refuse bail. Of course, one of the mandatory matters listed in s 18(1) for consideration is whether bail conditions that could reasonably be imposed could address any bail concerns (s 18(1)(p)).
	


The competing contentions of the parties


	
	In brief, the Director contended in this Court that the relevant bail concerns in this case were the risks that Mr Heng will fail to appear in court and will commit a further serious offence. He contended that after an assessment of the s 18(1) factors, including s 18(1)(p), the Court would conclude that these presented unacceptable risks. But the Director's primary contention was that Mr Heng had not shown cause. Although the application of that test is a distinct preliminary step in determining an application such as this it has been recognised by this Court that the considerations defined as “bail concerns” in s 17 Bail Act 2013 (that is, risk of flight, risk of commission of further offences, danger to victims, individuals and the community and risk of interference with witnesses or evidence) may bear upon whether detention is justified: Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Tikomaimaleya [2015] NSWCA 83 at [24].
	
	
	Counsel for Mr Heng contended that in the unusual circumstances of this case (namely the need for his client to be at liberty in order to prepare for his trial), cause had been shown and, with stringent conditions of the nature of those imposed by Hidden J, the risk of commission of a serious offence was ""fanciful"" and the concern of failing to appear in court was sufficiently ameliorated to the point of not being an ""unacceptable risk"".
	


The evidence


	
	The case against Mr Heng concerns the alleged importation into Australia in late May 2013 of about 144 kg of impure methylamphetamine secreted in a container of furniture. (The pure weight is calculated as being in the order of half that.)
	
	
	The prosecution alleges that Mr Heng was involved in leasing a warehouse in anticipation of the arrival of the container. After the container arrived he oversaw, but did not directly involve himself in, its transfer to the warehouse, the isolation of the boxes within it that contained the drug and the transfer of those boxes to other premises where a laboratory was set up. At the laboratory wax blocks concealed in the furniture were removed. methamphetamine within the wax was extracted and further refined.
	
	
	In a condensed statement of facts which was tendered to Hidden J and which was before us the Crown set out a summary of telephone conversations in which Mr Heng was a participant. These were intercepted on telecommunications services used by him and subscribed in false names. The conversations include discussions with the sub lessor of the warehouse. These discussions concerned securing the sub lease, informing the sub lessor of Mr Heng’s expectation of the arrival of a container, informing the sub lessor that the container would hold flat boxes of furniture pieces and giving to the sub lessor a false name. Intercepted phone conversations in early June recorded Mr Heng procuring an associate, Choy, to dress up on the pretense of being a manual workman for the purpose of visiting the warehouse with Mr Heng.
	
	
	The condensed statement of facts refers to evidence the Crown will call of surveillance showing that Mr Heng and his associate, dressed in high visibility workwear, attended to inspect the warehouse on 13 May 2013. On 21 May 2013 Choy alone inspected the warehouse and the Crown will lead evidence of his intercepted phone report to Mr Heng about its condition.
	
	
	When Choy arranged for the container to be transported to the warehouse on 3 June 2013 (presumably from premises of a freight-forwarding firm to which it had been consigned from overseas), Mr Heng was observed to follow the route of the transport truck during its journey and to wait in his car near to the warehouse for the container to arrive. He was observed to wait nearby in his own vehicle whilst Choy and others unloaded the contents of the container into the warehouse.
	
	
	The condensed statement of facts asserts that further telephone intercepts of conversations will be tendered in which Choy reported to Mr Heng on 4 June 2013 after having moved boxes around within the warehouse and having selected 21 of them. Those 21 boxes were moved by Choy and a man named Wan to the laboratory and unloaded there. Choy phoned Mr Heng to say that “something looks missing”, then drove to Mr Heng’s premises in Homebush and met with him in person. On this occasion he told Mr Heng that he had been checking numbers against “the list” and that a lot seemed missing.
	
	
	On 5 June 2013 Cheng and Wan selected another 31 boxes from the warehouse and took them to the laboratory. During that day intercepted phone calls between Mr Heng and Choy showed that the latter was reporting to Mr Heng on the progress of selecting boxes from those which had been unloaded out of the container into the warehouse. He was reporting to Mr Heng on the moving of these boxes to the laboratory. Choy sought instructions from Mr Heng about obtaining assistance with the task as it had proved to be a substantial one.
	
	
	The condensed statement of facts continues with summaries of numerous further intercepted telephone conversations during the first half of June 2013, in which Mr Heng was a participant and in which there was discussion of aspects of the transfer of the boxes to the laboratory and the obtaining of equipment (plastic tubs and a fridge) related to the extraction and refinement of the methamphetamine. Surveillance during this period revealed Choy and Wan actively extracting wax from the furniture and methamphetamine from the wax. Mr Heng’s intercepted telephone conversations in about mid-June 2013 also concerned arrangements he was making for supply of something to a third party and for testing of that which was to be supplied. Having regard to what was in fact later found by police to have been extracted from the furniture consignment, there will be available to the jury a strong inference that Mr Heng was in these telephone calls arranging the testing and sale of the methamphetamine.
	
	
	This is undoubtedly a strong Crown case. The Court may infer that counsel who advised Mr Heng at the time he entered pleas of guilty to the charges (see [3]) made the same judgment. Having regard to the quantity of drugs involved and the fact that Mr Heng was on parole under a sentence for a previous similar offence when these events occurred, if he is convicted he will face a very long sentence of imprisonment. He is under an enormous incentive to flee if he is released on bail. Considering his demonstrated connections with persons overseas and the amounts of money which it may be inferred were outlaid on this enterprise, he likely has the means to flee.
	


Preparation of Mr Heng’s defence


	
	In response to the Crown’s detention application in this Court, Mr Heng’s case on “cause why his … detention is not justified” is solely that his requirement for extended access to a computer for the review of electronically recorded material served by the Crown, in preparation for the trial, cannot be met under the conditions of his custody. He tendered evidence to establish limited periods of access to computers for this purpose. This contention on the part of Mr Heng requires, first, careful consideration of how much electronically stored material realistically needs to be reviewed by Mr Heng himself.
	
	
	Affidavits of Detective Sergeant Hendry of the New South Wales Police Force and of Federal Agent Willey relied upon by the Crown establish that the Crown brief as served includes the following electronically stored material which directly depicts or records Mr Heng:
	



	
	One CD on which are recorded 234 intercepted telephone calls wherein Mr Heng was a participant, totalling 4 hours and 46 minutes.
	
	
	One CD on which are recorded 17 audio files from listening devices which capture Mr Heng participating in conversations over a total of 2 hours and 51 minutes.
	
	
	Five DVDs of surveillance which record movements of Mr Heng and/or movements of Choy (in the case of the latter, movements which correlate with telephone conversations in which Mr Heng spoke on matters which concerned Choy’s activities). The playing of these DVDs would occupy less than 2 hours.
	
	
	Two DVDs of a police search of Mr Heng’s home address and one CD of intercepted telephone calls from Mr Heng’s custody locations (for voice comparison purposes). The total listening and/or viewing time of the DVDs and the CD in this category is 5 hours and 16 minutes.
	



	
	The total listening and viewing time of all of the material in categories (1), (2) and (3) is approximately 9.5 hours. The Crown analysis is that really only the 4 hours and 46 minutes in category (1) is significant for Mr Heng to listen to. Because Mr Heng does not speak or understand Cantonese his conversations with Choy were in English. In preparation of his defence there could be utility in him listening to or viewing the material in categories (1), (2) and (3), which likely would not be a particularly demanding task as the recordings purport to be of his own words and conduct and would, presumably, be familiar to him. It is significant that Mr Heng has had paper transcript of all of these material conversations since early 2015. Before Hidden J Mr Heng’s solicitor gave evidence that he had “gone through… with Mr Heng”, already, half of the 234 calls referred to in category (1).
	
	
	The Crown has also served DVDs and some CDs (a total of 49 discs) recording audio and video surveillance material capturing Mr Heng’s alleged co-conspirators. There would be little utility in Mr Heng reviewing these recordings on a computer because of his lack of knowledge of the language in which the conversations took place. Transcripts in English translation have been prepared by the Crown and served. Mr Heng’s review of conversations of this nature will necessarily be limited to examining the transcripts, which can be done on paper and for which computer access is not necessary. He has had these transcripts, also, for an adequate time to enable him to review them before the detention application came on for hearing before this Court.
	
	
	Some of these DVDs concerning the actions of co-conspirators record activities over long periods involving persons other than Mr Heng. The evidence on this detention application shows that although many of the recordings are of long duration they can be played forward at eight times the speed of recording without losing the meaning or understanding of what is depicted. Federal Agent Willey’s evidence is that the very brief periods in which any activity of Mr Heng himself is shown on any of these DVDs can be identified and the replaying of the images can be fast-forwarded to those points. Some of these DVDs, of considerable length, captured the execution of search executed at various premises other than premises ever occupied or controlled by Mr Heng.
	
	
	We are comfortably satisfied that adequate preparation by Mr Heng and his advisors for his trial does not require that he should review on a computer the additional 49 discs recording the conversations and actions of his co-conspirators. With respect to any of this material which is in due course tendered Mr Heng’s solicitors and counsel may well wish to obtain his instructions about some of the things shown. With respect to the conversations in Cantonese they may well need to seek comment from Mr Heng on the basis of the transcripts in English translation. But we are quite satisfied that adequate preparation does not require that Mr Heng should play back the entirety of the 49 discs in this category (which would require many hours) nor even that he play back any significant part of this material.
	
	
	According to Mr Heng’s affidavit of 15 December 2015, by that date he had been given access to computers within the prison where he is held for a total of 32 hours since 25 November 2015. Affidavits of a Correctional Officer establish that ongoing from 15 December 2015 and continuing up to the commencement of his trial, computer access would continue to be made available to Mr Heng for a certain 10 hours per week and a probable, but less reliable, further 10 hours per week. It is not possible for the Court to determine precisely how many additional hours this may give him as it is clear from the evidence that whatever arrangements may be made and best endeavours undertaken there will be operational considerations in the running of the Correctional Facility where he is housed which may make it impractical for access to be given from time to time although planned and promised. Such interruptions may arise from the requirements of Mr Heng’s work assignments in the laundry where he has been engaged, lockdowns for security reasons, interruptions for staff training, availability of computers, availability of supervision staff and so on.
	
	
	Nevertheless with 32 hours access allowed between 25 November and 15 December 2015 we are of the view that there is a reasonable expectation that at least that amount of time again may be granted to Mr Heng on a computer between the date of hearing this application, 23 December 2015, and the date of commencement of his trial, 15 February 2016. Notably the evidence showed that a full 15 hours of computer access was granted in a single week (30 November 2015 to 6 December 2015) and there appears on the evidence no reason why this sort of duration could not be achieved regularly. The Court is satisfied that upon a realistic assessment of Mr Heng’s requirement for computer access, measured against the amount of access he has already had and the probable duration of additional access available to him up to the commencement of the trial, his continued custody has not been shown to be unjustified on grounds of exigencies of defence preparations or otherwise.

		04 March 2016",2015-12-22 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2702219,Turner v R [2015] NSWCCA 322,"Judgment


	
	MEAGHER JA: On 27 March 2009 the applicant was found guilty, following a trial in the District Court before his Honour Judge Frearson SC and a jury, of wounding Troy Clough with intent to do grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). That offence occurred on 29 May 2008 in a boarding house at Kirrawee. The applicant was sentenced on 24 June 2009 to imprisonment for 7 years and 3 months, with a non-parole period of 5 years. That non-parole period expired on 26 March 2014 and the applicant was released on parole on 26 March 2015.
	
	
	On 17 July 2009, the applicant filed a notice of intention to appeal against his conviction and sentence. The time for which that notice had effect was extended until 26 February 2010. There have been no further applications for an extension of that time. Since late 2009, the applicant has been self represented and has filed a large volume of material in support of his appeal. On 12 June 2014, he filed a notice of application for an extension of time in which to file a notice of appeal or notice of application for leave to appeal. On the same day, he filed a notice of appeal and notice of application for leave to appeal. By that time the grounds of appeal referred to in the various documents filed exceeded 50 in number and the applicant’s submissions extended to about 4500 handwritten pages.
	
	
	On 13 March 2015 the proceedings were mentioned before R A Hulme J who directed that the applicant file and serve the following documents by 10 July 2015:
	


(1)   Reformulated grounds of appeal that clearly set out in a single document, without repetition, the asserted errors giving rise to an appeal pursuant to s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW);

(2)   A document not exceeding 20 typed pages, or 40 handwritten pages, containing submissions in support of the grounds that are set out in a succinct summary fashion.


	
	On 22 July 2015 the applicant filed a 20 page typed document headed “Summary of Grounds – In Sucinct [sic] with Submissions”. That document contains 15 numbered grounds of appeal, each expressed in very general terms. For example, grounds 1 and 2 are:
	


1.   The crown had intentionally (maliciously) pursued an illegal course of action against an accused person, without probable cause, when knowing the accused person to be innocent of the offence alleged.

   ….

2.   The conviction were unsafe due to expert evidence considered to be reliable at the time of the trial is subsequently shown to be unreliable. It remains unsafe irrespective of the force of other “circumstantial evidence” pointing to the guilty of the accused. The principal applies to any evidence critical to the prosecution case that is subsequently shown to be unreliable [sic].


	
	The applicant subsequently filed a further document containing an additional seven grounds of appeal numbered 16 to 22. He has also filed with those grounds and submissions copies of documents, only a limited number of which were exhibits in the trial.
	
	
	Each ground of appeal is followed by a series of paragraphs, most of which in turn refer to documents. Not all of those documents are attached to the submissions. The submissions themselves do not always bear a recognisable relationship to the ground they purport to address and some subject matter is often dealt with in relation to more than one ground.
	
	
	In general terms the applicant makes complaints about the conduct of the investigating police, the Crown, his legal representative, the witnesses called in the prosecution case and the trial judge. He alleges fabrication of evidence and of police records, corruption on the part of the investigating police, failures of the prosecution to disclose evidence, breaches of duty on the part of his counsel, perjury by witnesses called for the prosecution and errors of the trial judge.
	
	
	The most efficient way of dealing with the applicant’s arguments is to address them by reference to the 22 grounds of appeal which he relied on. An understanding of some of those arguments is assisted by a short summary of the principal issues at the trial, and of the investigation and events which preceded it.
	


The issues at trial


	
	The applicant was charged with wounding Mr Clough with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, contrary to s 33(1) of the Crimes Act. Sub-section 33(3) provided for the entry of an alternative verdict of reckless wounding contrary to s 35, meaning that if the jury was not satisfied that the offence against s 33 had been committed, but were satisfied that he was guilty of an offence against s 35, a verdict of guilty could be entered in respect of the latter offence.
	
	
	The victim, Mr Clough, and the applicant resided at the Dameeli Lodge at Kirrawee. The lodge provided single room accommodation for men and consisted of 12 rooms. Each room had a small bathroom and an external and internal entrance. The internal entrance was via a tiled hallway. There were six rooms on each side of the hallway. Mr Clough lived in unit 5 and the applicant lived in unit 6. The internal entrances to units 5 and 6 were directly opposite each other, across the hallway.
	
	
	On 29 May 2008, following a verbal argument between them which occurred on a lawn outside the Lodge, there was a further confrontation inside the Lodge in which the applicant glassed Mr Clough in the face, causing a large laceration to his forehead and a small laceration below his nose. The wounding was not in issue at the trial as the applicant had signed an admission pursuant to s 184 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) stating that Mr Clough was wounded as a result of a glass held by him impacting with Mr Clough’s forehead.
	
	
	There was an issue as to which of Mr Clough and the applicant was the principal aggressor in the incident outside the Lodge and, more significantly, as to the circumstances of the glassing incident. It was the Crown case that after the first confrontation Mr Clough re-entered the Lodge via a common entrance and walked along the short hallway to the entrance to his room, which was on the left as he approached from the laundry. In his evidence in chief (tcpt 23/03/09, p 8) Mr Clough described what happened next:
	


As I went to open my door Donovan come out again and started yelling abuse saying that I was working in the railways and I was working against him and I was in a political organisation. I told him to go away. He just kept on going on and as I went to turn, put the key in the door, I turned the key and I looked left, I looked right, I looked left again and then before I know it I got smashed in the face with a glass. Then I reacted, after five seconds after that. And then I punched him on the side of the face out of self-defence because he was going for something. I don’t know what else he was going for. So he fell on the ground. I picked him up and I punched him twice again in the head and then John [Zafiris, the owner of the Lodge] come down and stopped it and said, “You go to your room, Donovan, and Troy you go to your room” and that’s what happened there.


	
	The applicant disputed that version of events. On his account, he returned to his room from outside and made himself a drink of bourbon with ice in a clear glass. His evidence continued (tcpt 24/03/09, p 55-56):
	


A.   … I’m a little [bit] vague because I’m unsure if there was a knock at the door or if I just happened to be near the part of the room at the time but I’m almost certain there was a knock at the door and I remember very clearly being near the door and the door burst open and I don’t even remember really getting hit but I do remember being grabbed and falling backwards into my room and the door banging as he did that on the TV and the drawers that were - the TV was sitting on.

…

A.   We just went backwards, went straight backwards. He landed on top of me and I remember, once we hit the ground, he just looked at me and didn’t - you know like for a split second and I just whacked him straight in the face.

…

A.   I just whacked him straight away because I just feared him.


	
	The door providing access from the hallway into the applicant’s unit was hinged on its left side (viewed from the hallway) and opened inwards. The floor of the bedroom was covered with carpet except for three rows of tiles which ran along the wall on the left side of the bedroom as it was entered through the door. That tiled area extended to a little less than half of the width of the door when closed. A small chest of drawers (with a television set on top of it) was positioned on that tiled area just beyond the swing of the door when opened inwards.
	
	
	Mr Zafiris drove Mr Clough to Sutherland Hospital and asked him not to call the police, saying that “Donovan will be thrown out” and would be “gone by tomorrow” (tcpt 23/03/09, p 12). At the hospital five stitches were used to close the laceration on the right side of Mr Clough’s forehead above his eyebrow and a small laceration below his right nostril was cleaned. Mr Clough told the doctor that he had “tripped and fell and hit a glass” (tcpt 23/03/09, p 13).
	
	
	When he returned to the Lodge that evening, Mr Clough observed blood near the lock mechanism on the side or edge of his door; little bits of blood on the floor inside his room and in the hallway; and some blood on the applicant’s door frame (tcpt 23/03/09, pp 14-15). He had earlier seen Mr Zafiris cleaning up the floor of the hallway “where the glass was” immediately after the incident.
	
	
	Early on the following morning, Mr Clough saw the applicant leaving the Lodge to go to work. He asked Mr Zafiris when the applicant was going to be evicted and was told that that might not happen straight away because he had nowhere to go. Mr Clough then decided to report the matter and did so at Sutherland Police Station that same morning.
	


The police investigation


	
	The officer in charge of the police investigation was Senior Constable Janet Wilkinson (SC Wilkinson). On the morning of 30 May 2008, when Mr Clough presented at the station, she interviewed him with Constables Parish and Reyes. Photographs of clothing said to have been worn by Mr Clough at the time of the assault were taken by Constable Ward. In the afternoon of the same day, Constable McSwan took a statement from Mr Zafiris, who heard the glassing incident, did not see any fighting but did see Mr Clough and the applicant standing in the hallway, the former with “blood all over him” and blood on the floor (tcpt 24/03/09, pp 6-7). At about 4.35pm on 30 May, Sergeant Webb (Sgt Webb), SC Wilkinson and Constables Parish and Reyes attended the Lodge. Sgt Webb and SC Wilkinson inspected the applicant’s room. He identified the clothes that he was wearing the day before as having been washed and “hanging over the shower”. Photographs were taken and three items of clothing (a blue t-shirt, a pair of shorts and a singlet) were secured. Photographs also were taken of the accused’s room, Mr Clough’s room and the hallway. Mr Bates, the occupant of unit 4, was identified as a potential witness, and later gave a statement.
	
	
	The applicant was then taken to Sutherland Police Station. He participated in a video recorded interview with Detective Black and SC Wilkinson. That interview concluded before 8pm. The applicant completed a form headed “Occupier’s Consent to Crime Scene Examination”, which recorded that the following examinations, written by hand, may result in damage to the premises: “swabs, photographs, section of carpet removal”. Detective Black then proceeded to the Lodge and met Crime Scene Officers, Philip Austin and Michael Power. Officer Austin took a series of photographs and collected swabs of material for examination. Four items were collected and described as follows:
	


Item 1 – Swab of apparent blood from the Unit 5 door.

Item 2 – Swab of apparent blood from the Unit 6 door frame.

Item 3 – Swab of apparent blood from the tiles inside Unit 6 behind the main door.

Item 4 – Two trace swabs from the carpet in the middle of the main room in Unit 6.


	
	On 18 June 2008 a buccal sample was taken from Mr Clough. The Forensic Examination Request Form P377 in relation to the four items collected by Officer Austin is dated 1 July 2008. The heading of that form wrongly describes the offence date as 30 May 2008. However, the correct date (29 May 2008) is stated in the narrative of the relevant events, which follows. On 1 July 2008 a Person DNA Sample Examination Form was also completed in respect of the buccal sample taken from Mr Clough.
	
	
	The analysis of these items was undertaken by Mr Walton, a qualified biologist employed at the Division of Analytical Laboratories, NSW Health. He issued a Certificate of Analysis dated 19 March 2009. That Certificate reported that Mr Clough had the same DNA profile as the DNA recovered from the swab described as item 1 and that he had the same DNA profile as the partial DNA profile recovered from item 2. No DNA was detected in the remaining swabs from items 3 and 4.
	


The events preceding the trial


	
	On the evening of 30 May 2008 committal proceedings were commenced against the applicant in respect of two offences. Those proceedings were commenced by the issue and filing of a Court Attendance Notice returnable before Parramatta Local Court on the following day. The two offences charged were:
	


001   On 29 May 2008, maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on Troy Clough with intent to do so contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act.

002   On 29 May 2008, recklessly wounding Troy Clough contrary to s 35(4) of the Crimes Act.


	
	The relevant charge numbers were H34968816/1 and H34968816/2. On 31 May the applicant was granted bail. The proceedings were then before the Court for mention on 11 June, 7 August, 4 September, 25 September and 23 October 2008.
	
	
	In July 2008 the New South Wales Police brief of evidence was delivered. That brief identified as outstanding items the statements of Constable Reyes and Officer Austin. By this time the applicant was legally represented by a solicitor of the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales. Before the hearing on 23 October 2008 the applicant consented, under s 68 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), to waive his right to a committal hearing in respect of the two offences with which he was charged. On 23 October 2008 an order was made in the Local Court that the applicant be committed for trial in the District Court and to appear before that Court on 31 October 2008.
	
	
	In November 2008, counsel was briefed to appear for the applicant at his trial. At that time, the Legal Aid Commission had not been served with a copy of the indictment. Later in November 2008 the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions identified the Crown witnesses to be called at the trial which was originally scheduled for 12 December 2008. The trial eventually commenced on 23 March 2009. The indictment charging an offence under s 33(1) of the Crimes Act was presented to the Court and read, and a plea of not guilty was entered (tcpt 23/03/09, p 2).
	


The application to lead fresh evidence


	
	The circumstances in which this Court will allow further evidence to be led on appeal are limited. However, in the present case, so as to allow the hearing of the appeal to proceed with expedition and to assist an understanding of the arguments which the applicant seeks to make, six folders of documents tendered by him were marked as exhibits.
	
	
	Those folders contained material produced by Corrective Services NSW in response to an application made by the applicant under the Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009 (NSW) (GIPA) (Ex A); copies of the exhibits at the trial (Ex B1); a copy of the brief to counsel to appear for the applicant at the trial (Ex B2); a copy of the District Court file made available to the Legal Aid Commission following the bringing of the appeal (Ex B3); documents produced by the New South Wales Police Force in response to an application by the applicant under GIPA (principally being two copies of the original brief of evidence prepared in July 2008) (Ex B4); and copies of the transcript and of some exhibits in the trial, in each case containing the applicant’s original notations (Ex B5). In addition, the applicant tendered a copy of his consent to the crime scene examination (Ex D) and a copy of what was described as “a blackened out photograph” (Ex C).
	
	
	All of these documents, with the exception of Ex A, were admitted subject to a general objection by the Crown as to their relevance. It was accepted that Ex A might become relevant in the event that this Court was to re-sentence the applicant.
	


The conviction appeal: grounds of appeal

Ground 1


	
	The applicant says that the original brief of evidence prepared by the New South Wales Police in July 2008 related to different offences for which he was not tried. As a result he says that there was no brief of evidence served in relation to the indictable offence with which he was charged. That complaint misunderstands the nature of the committal proceedings in the Local Court.
	
	
	The first offence described in the Court Attendance Notice (Charge H34968816/1) is the same as the offence of which he was found guilty. The second offence in the Court Attendance Notice (Charge H34968816/2) is the offence under s 35 in relation to which the jury was entitled to find an alternative verdict (see [9] above). More significantly this ground does not describe anything that was done or not done at the trial, which was capable of demonstrating any miscarriage of justice in relation to the applicant’s conviction.
	


Grounds 2 and 4


	
	These grounds contain several complaints about aspects of the evidence at the trial. None of those complaints suggest that any miscarriage of justice occurred. First, it is said that the photographic evidence was unreliable and that the Crown did not disclose photographic evidence which was “exculpatory in nature”. The photos of the scene; of the complainant’s injuries and blood-stained t-shirt; and of the applicant’s clothing were admitted without objection. The Crown had previously served the statements of the police officers and investigators who took those photographs. At the trial it was made clear that evidence as to the outcome of those investigations and the items gathered (including the photographs), would be led from SC Wilkinson. The jury was told (tcpt 23/03/09, p 7):
	


There were a number of police who went to the premises and did various things but there is no issue about their evidence so it is not necessary for you to have them all come along and tell you what they individually did. Senior Constable Wilkinson will tell you more what the police officers did.

No further direction was requested or required. The exhibits were clearly relevant and admissible.


	
	Secondly, it is said that the investigating police “illegally replaced the track pants worn by [the] accused at the time of the incident with the beige shorts”. That is not correct. The fact that the applicant was wearing long tracksuit pants at the time of the glassing and that those pants had not been subjected to any forensic analysis was made clear in the evidence. Mr Clough described the applicant as wearing a black tracksuit with zips down the side and a blue short sleeve top (tcpt 23/03/09, p 27). The applicant also said that he was wearing tracksuit pants, that the police did not collect them and that sometime later he took the pants in a plastic bag to Sutherland Police Station so that they could be forensically examined (tcpt 24/03/09, p 59). SC Wilkinson agreed in cross examination that the police did not take possession of any tracksuit pants on 30 May 2008 and that the applicant had attempted to deliver them to the police “several months” later. That subject was not taken any further by the applicant’s counsel in cross-examination (tcpt 24/03/09, p 50). The suggestion that the police “illegally replaced the track pants” with a pair of beige shorts finds no support in any of the evidence either admitted at the trial or tendered on this appeal.
	
	
	Thirdly, it is complained that the Crown did not call five police witnesses (Sgt Webb, Constables Parish and Reyes, Officer Austin and Detective Black) at the trial. This is correct. However it was not necessary that those witnesses be called in view of there being no issue about their evidence and no request on behalf of the applicant that they be made available for cross-examination.
	
	
	Fourthly, it is suggested that the prosecution failed to disclose the “blackened out photo”, which was said to show a “large red blood stain inside the accused’s unit 6, on carpet, near doorway entry”. Ex C was said to be a copy of that photo. When it was tendered the applicant made clear that no copy of that document was in evidence at the trial or contained within any of the six folders which were tendered in the appeal. The evidence led on the appeal and at trial provides no support for the assertion that there was any such blood-stain inside unit 6. The evidence of SC Wilkinson was that the only blood-stain found in unit 6 was on the tiled area immediately behind the closed door, where a small piece of glass was also found (tcpt 23/03/09, p 15). None of the photographs taken of the interior of unit 6 showed any other blood-stains. SC Wilkinson also gave evidence that Officer Austin examined the carpet inside unit 6, including by white light and UV light testing. He reported that there was no staining of that area of the carpet and no sign that the carpet had been cleaned (tcpt 24/03/09, pp 40-41). Officer Austin also took a swab from the carpet in the middle of unit 6 which did not test positive to the presence of blood or DNA.
	
	
	Fifthly, the applicant says that his legal representative did not object to SC Wilkinson’s evidence concerning the crime scene examination, forensic analysis and results. That is correct but does not mean that there was any miscarriage of justice. What was done was consistent with the applicant’s counsel acting in accordance with his instructions. The evidence of SC Wilkinson was consistent with that which would have been given by the relevant police officers and investigators, had they been called, and that which was contained in their statements. There is nothing either in the transcript of the trial or in the evidence to suggest, even remotely, that there was any disobedience of instructions or incompetence on the part of the applicant’s counsel. That any error was made which led to a miscarriage of justice that would warrant appellant intervention, has not been established: see R v Ignjatic (1993) 68 A Crim R 333 at 336.
	
	
	Sixthly, it is said that the trial judge erred in summing up by stating that the blood-stains on the hallway wall shown in photos 7 and 8 of trial Ex C had been tested and that the result was a partial DNA profile that was consistent with Mr Clough’s blood (tcpt 25/03/09, p 23). It is correct that those blood-stains were not tested. However, the swab taken from the nearby doorframe of unit 6 did test positive in the relevant respect. Accordingly, although the trial judge misstated the evidence, he did so in a very minor respect which was of no significance given the evidence that DNA matching that of Mr Clough was found on the doorframe of unit 6.
	
	
	Finally, the applicant asserts that the trial judge erred in failing to disallow any cross-examination of him concerning the evidence arising from the crime scene analysis. Once that evidence was admitted, cross-examination of the applicant in respect of what it showed was justified and not unfair. The cross-examination was not objected to and did not result in any miscarriage of justice.
	


Ground 3


	
	The applicant says that the video recording of his police interview, which became trial Ex E, was “illegally edited”. When that evidence was tendered, the following exchange occurred between SC Wilkinson and the trial advocate (tcpt 24/03/09, p 43):
	


Q.   But there was some things discussed between you and Mr Turner, which are not relevant to this case before the court?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And you understand that some of that material has been removed from the DVD by my instructing solicitor?

A.   Yes.


	
	It is apparent, as the Crown submits was the case, that an agreement was reached with the applicant’s legal representatives that those answers should be removed as they were irrelevant to the central issues in the trial, prejudicial to the applicant or inadmissible. On the hearing of the appeal, this Court was provided with the edited and unedited transcript of that interview. Reference to the matters which were edited confirms that they have one or other of those characteristics. Their editing or removal from the DVD recording that was tendered was in no sense illegal and did not result in any miscarriage of justice.
	


Ground 5


	
	The applicant asserts that SC Wilkinson perverted the course of justice. In particular, reference is made to the evidence concerning the applicant’s clothing (principally, the black tracksuit pants), the “blackened out photo” and the absence of any forensic analysis of the “section of carpet removed”. The first two of these matters have already been addressed (see [32] and [34] above). The reference to the removal of carpet is based upon the applicant’s consent form completed on 30 May 2008 (see [19] above). Although that consent form refers to “section of carpet removal”, it does so in the expectation that such an examination might be undertaken. The evidence does not show that any such examination was in fact undertaken, either by Detective Black or anyone else.
	
	
	As the Crown submits, there was no suggestion during the trial that the police committed any corrupt acts in the gathering of evidence. Nor was there any challenge to the way in which the police dealt with the witnesses, the exhibits or the applicant. This ground is without substance.
	


Grounds 6 and 7


	
	These grounds raise three matters. First, the applicant says that SC Wilkinson gave false evidence when she said (tcpt 23/03/09, p 12) that Mr Turner attended the Lodge at 9pm on 30 May 2008. That involves a misunderstanding of the evidence. The reference to “Mr Turner” (as distinct from Officer Austin) is in the question and not in the witness’s affirmative answer. The questioner was plainly to be understood as referring to Officer Austin. At the relevant time, the applicant was in custody.
	
	
	Secondly, it is said that the date of the alleged offence was “manufactured” because the Forensic Examination Request Form refers to an offence occurring on 30 May 2008 (see [20] above). That date also is plainly an error, as the following narrative in that document shows.
	
	
	Separately, the applicant says that the police records indicate that a swab was taken from the hallway of the Lodge and was not subsequently received or analysed. That assertion is made on the basis of the narrative in the Forensic Examination Request Form, which refers to a swab “taken by crime scene from the hallway” and to SC Wilkinson’s reference in para 22 of her statement dated 23 June 2008 to the obtaining of “swabs from the hallway and carpet”. Neither of those documents was written by Officer Austin who took the four swabs on the evening of 30 May 2008. Swab items 1 and 2 were taken from the door to unit 5 and the doorframe of unit 6, in each case reasonably answering the description of being from the hallway. The four swabs which Officer Austin took were received and analysed.
	


Ground 8


	
	The applicant claims that the trial was “unconstitutional” because it involved “falsified court file numbers”. It is said that there was more than one court process but only one “brief of evidence” delivered by the prosecutor. This complaint is dealt with in relation to ground 1 above. The applicant appears to misunderstand the relationship between the committal proceedings commenced in the Local Court and his trial in the District Court on the offence which was the subject of the one indictment presented at the beginning of the hearing (see tcpt 23/03/09, p 2).
	


Ground 9


	
	Similar arguments are made in relation to this ground. The applicant also claims that his trial “miscarried” because his counsel did not seek to quash the allegedly defective indictment. For the reasons already given there was no basis on which such an application could or should have been made.
	


Grounds 10 and 11


	
	In a related argument, the applicant asserts that the police and the prosecution failed in their disclosure obligations. The misguided basis of this claim appears to be an assertion that there were at least two separate charges brought against him, each of which attracted a disclosure obligation.
	
	
	It is asserted also that there was an abuse of process and a perversion of the course of justice occasioned by the Crown having improperly obtained evidence and by the trial judge failing to provide an “adequate warning” to the jury in respect of that impropriety. The statement made by Detective Black dated “23 June 2007” is relied on as an example of the Crown manufacturing evidence. This suggestion appears to fix upon the incorrect year appearing at the top of that statement, which is recorded correctly as 23 June 2008 at the foot of each page, where it has been signed. Even assuming that any impropriety or irregularity was established, the directions that ought to have been given to the jury by the trial judge are not explained or apparent. These grounds were not established.
	


Ground 12


	
	The applicant repeats his claim that the trial “miscarried” because several police witnesses were not called. This submission has been dealt with above at [33]. Unsurprisingly, given what was in issue in this trial, his counsel did not require any of the witnesses to be called and none of their evidence could have assisted the applicant’s case. Dr Brownlea treated Mr Clough’s injuries at Sutherland Hospital. The fact of those injuries was not in issue. Detective Black attended the Lodge on the evening of 30 May 2008. Constable McSwan obtained the witness statements of Messrs Zafiris and Bates. Each of those witnesses was called to give evidence. Constable Ward took custody of Mr Clough’s blood soaked t-shirt and took photographs of him. None of that was controversial. Officer Power attended the scene with Officer Austin. He did not make a statement, although he witnessed the statement of Officer Austin. Constable Harrington also attended the crime scene on the evening of 30 May and transported the four exhibit bags, containing the forensic swabs, to Sutherland Police Station. Finally, Senior Constable Bridge obtained the buccal DNA sample from Mr Clough.
	


Ground 13


	
	In a related submission, the applicant says that SC Wilkinson was “NOT qualified to give expert evidence upon the Certificate of Analysis”. That is likely to be correct, but not to the point. At the trial SC Wilkinson summarised the crime scene and forensic evidence in circumstances where the applicant’s counsel had been served with the underlying evidence and did not require any of the witnesses for cross-examination. It also is not suggested that any of those witnesses could have given evidence which would have assisted the applicant’s defence. There was no miscarriage of justice in what occurred.
	


Ground 14


	
	It is said that the trial judge misdirected the jury in observing (tcpt 25/03/09, p 23) that “Photograph 29 shows the door handle to room 5 and not unexpectedly the DNA matched Mr Clough”. That summary was consistent with SC Wilkinson’s evidence (tcpt 24/03/09, p 42). That evidence was that a swab taken from “before the door handle on room number 5” had a DNA profile which matched that of Mr Clough. That evidence, in turn, was consistent with the statement of Officer Austin that the swab referred to was of “blood stains on the adjacent door frame” to the lock of unit 5. Given that Mr Clough was the only person who was bleeding during the incident and the narrow issues at trial, any minor mis-description of the precise place from which the swab was taken was not material and did not result in any miscarriage of justice.
	


Ground 15


	
	The applicant makes at least four arguments. First, it is said that the failure to call the forensic biologist, Mr Walton, resulted in a miscarriage of justice because there were “numerous inconsistencies” in the results recorded in the Certificate of Analysis that required explanation. Exactly what those inconsistencies are is not explained, and for that reason the argument falls away.
	
	
	Secondly, it is said that there was a “non disclosure” of fingerprint evidence. Neither the transcript of the trial nor the evidence tendered in the appeal suggests that any relevant fingerprint examination was undertaken.
	
	
	Thirdly, the applicant repeats his argument that a section of blood-stained carpet removed from his unit was not submitted for analysis. That submission has been dealt with above at [40].
	
	
	Finally, the applicant submits that the trial judge erred in allowing the Crown to question him about the glass pieces found inside and outside his room, as well as about the other crime scene evidence. This has also been dealt with above at [37]. There was nothing irregular about that cross-examination. It was based upon matters that were in evidence and uncontroversial. Considerations of fairness required that the applicant have the opportunity to respond to evidence which was adverse to his version of events. Furthermore, there was no objection to any of that cross-examination by the applicant’s counsel.
	


Ground 16


	
	The applicant complains that his trial “miscarried” because of the different records associated with the four swabs taken by Officer Austin on 30 May 2008. This argument appears to fix upon the different descriptions of the relevant COPS entry for the incident in the police Exhibit Book records. Whereas the record for the four swabs refers to COPS event No E34294543, the entry for the three items of clothing taken by Sgt Webb from the applicant’s bathroom refers to COPS event No 34292543. This argument is without any merit whatsoever.
	


Ground 17


	
	The applicant describes this as a “fresh evidence” ground. He asserts that the trial miscarried because Mr Clough suffered from a diagnosed mental health condition at the time the offence was committed. Reference is made to medical records from Sutherland Hospital Emergency Department, dated 18 December 2002, which are said to disclose that Mr Clough was suffering from a “drug psychosis mental illness”. It is unclear what precise records the applicant is referring to.
	
	
	However, it is not necessary to take this matter further because even assuming that those records indicate that Mr Clough was diagnosed with some form of mental illness in 2002, they do not establish that any such condition continued in 2008 or that it related to the likelihood that he might have behaved in any particular way in the circumstances that confronted him on 29 May 2008. The evidence referred to provides no support for a conclusion that the applicant was innocent or that his guilt was not established beyond reasonable doubt, such that the verdict could not be allowed to stand: cf Ratten v The Queen [1974] HCA 35; 131 CLR 510 at 520.
	


Grounds 18 and 19


	
	Neither of these grounds has any substance. The first is that the trial was “unconstitutional and unlawful” because some documents wrongly referred to the trial as having being held on 24 June 2009 (the date of sentence) and not on 23-25 March 2009. The second claims that there was an abuse of process because of a mistaken reference during a preliminary mention before the District Court to the matter being “governed by Practice Note 6”. That mistake was corrected at the time by the applicant’s solicitor. Neither of these matters have any effect on the conduct of the trial.
	


Grounds 20 and 21


	
	Neither of these grounds is directed to material in evidence at the trial or to anything that happened during the trial. Each fixes upon mistakes in the description of an exhibit, or in the transcript, or is based on a misunderstanding of the relationship between the Court Attendance Notice issued on 29 May 2008 and the subsequent indictment presented to the District Court at the commencement of the trial. None of these matters had any effect on the trial.
	


Ground 22


	
	This ground is completely unfounded. The applicant claims that there was an abuse of process because the prosecution failed to disclose “illegally installed listening devices and telephone intercepts”. Neither the transcript of the trial nor any of the material tendered by the applicant suggests that any listening device and telephone intercept material existed or was relied on with respect to the prosecution of the applicant.
	


Unreasonable verdict


	
	Although there is no ground of appeal which squarely raises this ground, the Crown has addressed it in its written submissions and I propose to do so for completeness.
	
	
	When determining whether a verdict was unreasonable this Court must make its own assessment of the sufficiency and quality of the evidence. The question for this Court was described by Hayne J (with whom Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreed) in Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at [113]:
	


But the question for an appellate court is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which is to say whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt. It is not sufficient to show that there was material which might have been taken by the jury to be sufficient to preclude satisfaction of guilt to the requisite standard. [emphasis in original]


	
	In addressing that question the Court should not disregard or discount either the fact that “the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses”: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493.
	
	
	The issues for the jury were whether the Crown had established that the applicant intended to cause grievous bodily harm to Mr Clough and whether the Crown had excluded self-defence as a reasonable possibility. In the end those questions depended upon whether the jury accepted Mr Clough’s account of what happened. On that version of events the applicant was the aggressor and “smashed [him] in the face” without warning.
	
	
	Mr Clough’s version of events was strongly supported by the evidence of what was observed at the scene and the forensic evidence. His version accounted for the absence of any evidence of blood on the applicant’s carpet inside unit 6. In addition the evidence of Mr Bates was that when he first looked up the hallway, he saw Mr Zafiris in the middle of the corridor keeping Mr Clough and the applicant apart. He also saw pieces of glass on the hallway floor between the two doors. Those pieces included the base of a glass (tcpt 24/03/09, pp 24-25).
	
	
	In the light of this evidence and the absence of evidence which raised the reasonable possibility that the incident had happened inside the applicant’s room, and after Mr Clough had “landed on top of the applicant”, the jury was well able to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the glassing incident had occurred in the manner described by Mr Clough. This is not a case in which the jury must have entertained a doubt about the applicant’s guilt. Accordingly this ground, if it arises, is not established.
	


The sentence appeal


	
	The applicant has made no written submissions in relation to his foreshadowed sentencing appeal. However, in oral argument he said that the sentencing judge had made an error of the kind identified in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120. In Muldrock, the High Court held that, in relation to an offence for which a standard non-parole period was specified, a sentencing judge should not commence the exercise of sentencing by asking whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period or proceed to an assessment of whether the offence is within the mid-range of objective seriousness: at [25].
	
	
	The Crown contended that the offence in this case was within the mid-range of objective seriousness. However, the sentencing judge did not accept that submission. He addressed various matters personal to the applicant. Having referred to the purposes of sentencing outlined in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), he continued (tcpt 24/06/09, p 6):
	


There is a standard non-parole period and I am required to record reasons for departing from it if I intend to and I record the reasons as my finding, particularly that it is below the mid range of objective gravity, and I also propose to find special circumstances.

I acknowledge the non-parole period remains as a guide together with the maximum sentence and I do not oscillate or vacillate about it. I do take it into account as a guide. I have been referred to some comparative cases and whilst they are of some general assistance at the end of the day each case has to be determined on its own facts and that is what I propose to do.


	
	In my view that stated approach of the sentencing judge did not involve what is referred to as Muldrock error. His Honour correctly identified the maximum sentence and standard non-parole period as “guides” and took them into account in that way: see Muldrock at [27]. He did not then undertake an exercise which proceeded simply to identify matters which justified a departure from the standard non-parole period. Indeed, his Honour expressly disavowed “oscillating” about it, which I take to mean seeking to impose a sentence which is to be justified by reference to an assessment of a relationship between the applicant’s offence and an offence said to be within the mid-range of objective gravity.
	
	
	Taking into account the seriousness of the offence and the aspects of the applicant’s subjective circumstances identified by the sentencing judge, the sentence imposed of a non-parole period of 5 years with an additional term of 2 years and 3 months, whilst at the upper end of the range of sentences which might reasonably have been justified, was not so unreasonable or plainly unjust as to warrant this Court’s intervention.
	


Conclusion


	
	In the circumstances, the time for the applicant to file his notice of appeal against conviction and his notice of application for leave to appeal against sentence should be extended to 12 June 2014. The applicant has sought to conduct his own appeal since 2009. An apparent reason for his delay is his extensive attempt to gather information and documents, which he believed to be integral to his prospects of success on appeal. In this case the interests of justice are served by allowing the applicant the opportunity to put his arguments and finally disposing of them. The applicant’s appeal against his conviction should be dismissed and his application for leave to appeal against his sentence refused.
	
	
	The orders I propose are:
	



	
	Extend time to file notices of appeal against conviction and leave to appeal against sentence to 12 June 2014.
	
	
	Dismiss the appeal against conviction.
	
	
	Refuse leave to appeal against sentence.
	



	
	HALL J: I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgment of Meagher JA. I agree with his Honour’s reasons and the orders proposed by him. I briefly record my own reasons in respect of the question of unreasonable verdict. As Meagher JA has observed at [62], although there is no ground of appeal which squarely raises that question, it has been addressed by the Crown in its written submissions.
	
	
	In determining whether a verdict was unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence, the Court is required to apply the test set down in M v R [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493, re-stated in MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606. The Court is required to make an independent assessment of the evidence, both of its sufficiency and quality. The central question is whether this Court is satisfied that the appellant is guilty of the offence charged: SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 [11]-[14], [20]-[22].
	
	
	The two central issues at trial, as noted by the Crown, were self-defence and the applicant’s level of intoxication. A pivotal factual dispute was the location of the incident – namely, whether it occurred in the hallway or inside room 6.
	
	
	The Crown case principally relied upon the evidence of Mr Clough. It is apparent that the jury accepted his evidence which found strong support in forensic and other evidence. Such evidence included the piece of glass found in the hallway, the stains on the door to room 6 and apparent stains on the brick hallway next to the door to room 6 from which a partial DNA profile was recovered. That profile was consistent with Mr Clough’s DNA profile. An apparent blood stain was found on the door frame adjacent to the lock of the door to room 5. Forensic analysis produced a DNA profile that was the same as Mr Clough’s DNA profile.
	
	
	There was other evidence which confirmed Mr Clough’s account. This included the evidence of Mr Grahame Bates, a resident in room 4 who found Mr Zafiris separating the applicant and Mr Clough in the hallway.
	
	
	As the trial judge correctly told the jury in his summing up, if Mr Clough’s account of the attack as having occurred in the hallway was accepted, there would be no basis for a defence of self-defence: Summing Up at p 15.
	
	
	The evidence, in my assessment, was sufficient for the jury to conclude, beyond reasonable doubt, that the applicant was guilty of the offence charged under s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900 (wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm). Upon consideration of that evidence I am satisfied that he was guilty of that offence.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: I, too, agree with the reasons given by Meagher JA and the orders which his Honour proposes. I also agree with the additional observations of Hall J. Like their Honours I am also satisfied on the evidence that the applicant was guilty of the offence of which he was convicted.

2702223,Mason v R (No. 1) [2015] NSWCCA 324,"Judgment

 


	
	JOHNSON AND FAGAN JJ: By Notice of Motion filed on 20 November 2015, the Applicant, Wayne Paul Mason, sought to vacate the hearing of his appeal against conviction listed for 24 November 2015.
	
	
	The Notice of Motion was returnable on 24 November 2015. Following argument that day, the Court (by majority) refused the application to vacate the hearing and dismissed the Applicant’s Notice of Motion. The Court indicated that reasons for this decision would be given at a later time.
	
	
	What follows constitutes our reasons for having concluded on 24 November 2015 that the Applicant’s Notice of Motion to vacate should be dismissed.
	


Trial and Sentence


	
	Between 6 August 2012 and 19 September 2012, the Applicant stood trial before his Honour Judge Frearson SC and a jury at the Sydney District Court on an indictment containing 52 counts. The charges related to sexual acts alleged to have been committed against four girls (including RS) when they were each under 16 years of age, as well as charges of using a child for a pornographic purpose, disseminating child pornography and one count of perverting the course of justice. The Applicant was found guilty in respect of 44 counts. The jury could not agree on one count and he was acquitted in respect of seven counts.
	
	
	On 1 February 2013, the Applicant was sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of seven years and five months commencing on 24 July 2012 and expiring on 23 December 2019, with a balance of term of three years and six months commencing on 24 December 2019 and expiring on 23 June 2023.
	
	
	It is sufficient to note, for present purposes, that the Applicant was charged with 23 offences with respect to RS (Counts 8-30). Of these counts, the jury returned four verdicts of not guilty (Counts 8, 18, 22 and 24). The jury was unable to agree in relation to one other count (Count 25). The jury found the Applicant guilty upon the remaining 18 counts.
	
	
	For present purposes, two counts are of particular significance:
	



	
	Count 16 alleged that the Applicant, on 30 November 2001, at Chullora, did have sexual intercourse with RS, without her consent and knowing she was not consenting, in circumstances of aggravation, namely, she then being under the age of 16 years, namely 15 years contrary to s.61J(1) Crimes Act 1900;
	
	
	Count 27 alleged that the Applicant, between 30 November 2002 and 31 January 2003, at Sydney, did induce RS to withdraw her complaint to the New South Wales Police Service of sexual conduct between herself and the Applicant, intending thereby to pervert the course of justice contrary to s.319 Crimes Act 1900.
	


Proceedings in the Court of Criminal Appeal

Notice of Intention to Appeal is Lodged


	
	Later in February 2013, the Applicant filed a Notice of Intention to Appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal: s.10(1)(a) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The Notice of Intention to Appeal had effect for six months from the date of lodgement: Rule 3A(1) Criminal Appeal Rules; paragraph 9, Practice Note No. SC CCA 1 (Court of Criminal Appeal - General). The Court may extend the period for which a Notice of Intention to Appeal has effect: s.10(1)(b) Criminal Appeal Act 1912; Rule 3A(2) Criminal Appeal Rules. 
	
	
	Thereafter, from time to time, the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal granted extensions of the life of the Notice of Intention to Appeal, at the request of the Applicant. The evidence before the Court on the Notice of Motion indicated (in general terms) that from about May 2014 the legal representatives for the Applicant considered a number of features of the trial, with a view to advising the Applicant on the merits of an appeal against conviction.
	
	
	The Applicant has been represented throughout by the same solicitor at trial and for the purpose of an appeal to this Court. Different counsel represented the Applicant at trial to those who appear for him in this Court.
	


An Issue Concerning Count 27


	
	An aspect under consideration in this respect concerned the Applicant’s conviction on Count 27. It was the Crown case that the Applicant, then a serving police officer, played a part in the preparation of two letters sent to New South Wales Police, in late 2002 and early 2003, which indicated that RS retracted allegations of sexual impropriety made against the Applicant.
	
	
	The Applicant did not give evidence at his trial. It was put to RS in cross-examination by the Applicant’s counsel, that the Applicant had nothing to do with either letter.
	
	
	The Applicant’s mother, Lynette Patricia Mason, gave evidence in the Applicant’s case at trial before the jury on 3 September 2012 (T1169-1204; AB2128-2163). It was her evidence that RS had attended her home on an occasion indicating that she wished to withdraw the allegations against the Applicant. The Applicant’s mother said she had made a telephone call in this respect to the office of the Commissioner of Police to obtain information concerning the person or persons to whom such a letter should be sent. She did not say that she had played any part in the preparation of the letter itself.
	
	
	It is fair to observe that the evidence of the Applicant’s mother came under strong challenge in cross-examination by the Crown, where her credibility was put in issue. A reading of the evidence of the Applicant’s mother suggests that she was somewhat argumentative and, from time to time, needed to be confined by the trial Judge to the giving of responsive answers under cross-examination by the Crown. Aspects of her evidence had the flavour of advocacy for the Applicant rather than careful and objective evidence.
	
	
	It is noteworthy that, at one point, the Applicant’s mother said in evidence concerning RS and the proposed retraction letter - “That incident is just so bright in my mind” (T1192; AB2151).
	
	
	After the Applicant was convicted by the jury on a number of counts, including Count 27, the Applicant’s mother told the solicitor for the Applicant that she now remembered that she (the Applicant’s mother) had typed a letter for RS directed to the Commissioner of Police. The Applicant’s mother had not referred to this in evidence before the jury. She informed the Applicant’s solicitor of this recollection on 21 September 2012. She wrote a letter to the solicitor mentioning this on 27 September 2012.
	
	
	Accordingly, this information from the Applicant’s mother was known to the Applicant’s solicitor on 21 September 2012. The sentencing proceedings took place and the Applicant was sentenced on 1 February 2013. It appears that no mention was made of this further account from the Applicant’s mother in this context.
	
	
	It may be inferred that counsel for the Applicant briefed on the appeal advised that this additional account provided by the Applicant’s mother was, on its own, not sufficient to give rise to an arguable ground of appeal. Understandable concerns about the credibility and reliability of her account existed.
	
	
	Between February 2013 and June 2015, a number of extensions of time were granted to the Applicant by the Registrar, whilst potential grounds of appeal were being explored by the Applicant’s legal representatives.
	
	
	The evidence reveals that the claim by the Applicant’s mother that she had typed the retraction letter was the subject of a conference with the Applicant’s legal representatives in October 2014 at which a statement was taken from the mother.
	
	
	The Applicant’s solicitor was attempting to obtain an expert opinion from a forensic linguist which may have, in some way, served to support the account of the Applicant’s mother. Steps were taken in this regard over a lengthy period of time from about February 2015.
	
	
	By letter dated 24 June 2015, the Applicant’s solicitor sought a further extension of the Notice of Intention to Appeal, then to expire on 30 June 2015. The solicitor advised that she was “still waiting on a comprehensive expert report” which would not be available until mid-July 2015.
	
	
	On 25 June 2015, the Registrar extended (once again) the life of the Notice of Intention to Appeal, this time to 30 July 2015. The Registrar noted:
	


“This is the third time you have submitted the exact same explanation for delay. No further extensions without (a) good reason and (b) detailed history of what has been done to progress matter.”

 

 

Court Informed that Appeal Ready to Proceed


	
	On 31 July 2015, the Applicant’s solicitor wrote to the Registrar seeking a further two-week extension until mid-August 2015. The solicitor stated that she had been instructed by the Applicant “to not continue with the investigations that were delaying the appeal”. The Registrar extended the life of the Notice of Intention to Appeal to 15 August 2015.
	
	
	On 14 August 2015, a Notice of Appeal was filed, accompanied by written submissions prepared by the Applicant’s counsel. The Notice of Appeal contained one ground of appeal:
	


“Ground 1: The appellant contends that the verdict of the jury regarding count 16 is inconsistent and cannot be supported by the evidence.”

 


	
	On 27 August 2015, the Registrar listed the Applicant’s matter for hearing on 24 November 2015.
	
	
	According to the evidence, the Applicant’s solicitor received instructions on 24 September 2015 to seek an opinion from Dr John Olsson, a forensic linguist.
	
	
	On 19 October 2015, Dr Olsson provided a report to the Applicant’s solicitor. The report of Dr Olsson purports to express an opinion concerning the authorship of the typed retraction letter of 29 December 2002, signed by RS, together with an opinion concerning the second handwritten letter of 2 January 2003. It is, at least, an open question whether Dr Olsson can express an admissible opinion which, in truth, bears upon the role of the Applicant’s mother in the creation of the typed letter, or with respect to the second letter. To the extent that it is necessary to comment upon this aspect in this judgment, it does not seem to us that the report has any particular evidentiary value.
	


Applicant Seeks to Vacate Hearing


	
	Thereafter, the Applicant’s solicitor made application to vacate the hearing listed for 24 November 2015. On 5 November 2015, the Registrar refused that application.
	
	
	No further application was made to a Judge of the Court after 5 November 2015 seeking to vacate the hearing date.
	
	
	As mentioned, a Notice of Motion was filed on Friday 20 November 2015, supported by an affidavit of the Applicant’s solicitor affirmed that day. The affidavit annexed an affidavit of the Applicant’s mother sworn 19 November 2015.
	
	
	It was this material which formed the foundation for the application made to the Court on the hearing day to vacate the hearing of the appeal.
	


The Adjournment Application on 24 November 2015


	
	In the course of the adjournment application, the Court enquired of senior counsel for the Applicant whether a ground of appeal had been formulated as a foundation for the application to adjourn the hearing. Mr Game SC responded that the issue was still to be “properly investigated” (T6.44, 24 November 2015).
	
	
	In the course of further submissions, Mr Game SC said (T7.48, 24 November 2015):
	


“… but what the ground would be that the trial miscarried by reason of the absence of the evidence of Mrs Mason in relation to this subject, and now that would have to be explained whether as fresh or new evidence or inadvertence or whatever reason, it would have to be explained.”

 


	
	The adjournment application was advanced upon the basis that this issue required further investigation. It was not being put to the Court that there would necessarily be an application to add a further ground of appeal, nor had a possible ground of appeal been formulated beyond what was said as quoted at [34] above.
	
	
	The Crown neither consented to nor opposed the adjournment application.
	


Decision on Adjournment Application


	
	If the hearing was vacated on 24 November 2015, the matter would have been placed in the Registrar’s call-over list in December 2015, with the prospect of a hearing date in April or May 2016.
	
	
	The Court was confronted with a hearing which had been fixed following a very substantial length of time in which the Applicant’s legal representatives had explored potential grounds of appeal, with the appeal as then formulated ready to be argued and heard by the Court on the scheduled hearing day. The members of the Court had prepared for that hearing and had read the materials relevant to the hearing of the appeal.
	
	
	What the Applicant sought was to vacate that hearing to allow further consideration to be given as to whether another ground of appeal might be included at a later time. The application did not rise above that.
	
	
	If leave to add a further ground should not, after all, be sought then the hearing of the appeal on the single ground of appeal (which was ready to proceed on 24 November 2015) would be listed in 2016, almost certainly before a different Bench. The members of that Court would be required to prepare fully for that hearing.
	
	
	It is appropriate to consider the application to vacate the hearing date against the background of the protracted history of the Applicant’s matter before this Court. He was granted substantial and repeated indulgences, by way of extensions of the life of his Notice of Intention to Appeal. In July 2015, the Applicant’s solicitor informed the Registrar that the issue under investigation (concerning Count 27) was not to be pursued, and the appeal was fixed upon the basis of the single ground of appeal notified on 14 August 2015.
	
	
	Thereafter, in the circumstances described above, the Applicant’s solicitor obtained the report of Dr Olsson leading to an application to vacate the hearing date to permit yet further investigations to be undertaken. It should be kept in mind, that the primary factual issue which was being explored (and to which Dr John Olsson’s report was apparently directed) was the altered account of the Applicant’s mother about preparation of the 29 December 2002 typed letter, which had been known to the Applicant and his solicitor since about 21 September 2012.
	
	
	The Court has an undoubted discretion to vacate a hearing in an appropriate case. The discretion should be exercised keeping in mind, amongst other things, the clear public interest in the avoidance of delay in bringing appeals to this Court against conviction. The Applicant had been given very substantial latitude before he indicated, through his solicitor, that his appeal was ready to proceed.
	
	
	By 14 August 2015, the Applicant had utilised the Notice of Intention to Appeal process and had determined, after some two-and-a-half years, to proceed on one ground only. Paragraph 15 of Practice Note No. SC CCA 1 is pertinent:
	


“The overall effect of the giving of a Notice of Intention to Appeal is to facilitate the obtaining of necessary transcripts, exhibits and other documents so that a decision may be taken as to whether an Appeal or Application for Leave to Appeal should be instituted, and to ensure that, when instituted, all material is available to enable the expeditious listing and determination of the appeal or application.”


	
	The wide discretion conferred on the Court of Criminal Appeal, by way of extension of time or adjournment of a hearing, is to be exercised upon consideration of what the interests of justice require in the particular case: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 at 607-608 [11]-[13]; 613 [30]; 614 [32].
	
	
	As the plurality observed in Kentwell v The Queen at 614 [32], the “interests of justice will often pull in different directions”. The interests of the Applicant are relevant, as are the interests of the community, witnesses and victims and the administration of justice, including criminal appeals in this State: Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [38]-[39]; Kentwell v The Queen at 614 [32].
	
	
	The Court raised with senior counsel for the Applicant the availability of an application under Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 if, after further investigation, the Applicant wished to advance a ground concerning Count 27. Any impediment under s.79(3) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 would seem to be reduced if his application to vacate the hearing of the appeal had been refused. That said, it would remain a matter for any Judge, to whom a Part 7 application might be referred, to consider it upon the merits.
	
	
	Where it is open to the Applicant to bring a Part 7 application, the refusal of an adjournment does not shut the Applicant out completely. The availability of the Part 7 procedure is relevant, as well, to the exercise of discretion: Darwiche v R at [536].
	
	
	We are well satisfied, in the exercise of discretion, that the appropriate course to take was to refuse the application to vacate the scheduled hearing before this Court and to proceed with the hearing of the appeal.
	
	
	Nothing in this judgment should be taken as indicating any merit in the issue which the Applicant seeks to investigate further. A perusal of the transcript of the trial evidence of the Applicant’s mother raises very considerable concerns about her credibility. In circumstances where she asserted a good memory on the topic, it is difficult to see how she could have overlooked the fact (if it be true) that she had typed the retraction letter of 29 December 2002, only to recall it a few days later, after the jury had convicted the Applicant of many serious offences to which the retraction letter purported to be an answer.
	
	
	It is understandable that the Applicant’s legal representatives approached the inclusion of an appeal ground concerning this subject with considerable circumspection given the context in which the Applicant’s mother made this claim. We do not consider that Dr Olsson’s report advances the position materially. To the extent that it is relevant to this judgment, we regard the material advanced in this respect as tenuous.
	
	
	Nevertheless, if a Part 7 application is made, it will be a matter for a Judge to consider the material presented in the exercise of that administrative function.
	


Conclusion


	
	It was for these reasons we determined on 24 November 2015 that the application to vacate the hearing date should be refused and that the Applicant’s Notice of Motion filed 20 November 2015 should be dismissed.
	
	
	BUTTON J: I would have granted the application to vacate the hearing of the appeal on 24 November 2015. Because my views about that interlocutory question were in the minority and not determinative, I shall be brief.
	
	
	I gratefully adopt the chronological background of the matter contained in the judgment of the majority.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the application, I respectfully considered that, in all of the circumstances outlined in the affidavits read on the application, as expanded upon in writing and orally by senior counsel for the applicant, and in light of the position of the Crown with regard to the application, the hearing of the appeal should have been adjourned. Four matters were of particular significance in me coming to that conclusion.
	
	
	First, I accepted the proposition that there had been some sort of “crossed wire” between senior counsel, junior counsel and the solicitor for the applicant, whereby his solicitor was continuing to explore the availability of expert evidence that might have supported a further ground of appeal, despite the fact that a hearing date had been taken, and a single ground of appeal settled and notified.
	
	
	Secondly, on the very limited material available at the time of the application, I did not feel confident in making a firm adverse assessment of the merits of any possible further ground.
	
	
	Thirdly, I considered that the making of an application pursuant to Pt 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), although an alternative way for the applicant to agitate the matters underpinning the putative ground that in turn founded the application to vacate the hearing date, could nevertheless ultimately be an exercise more inconvenient, disruptive and time-consuming to the criminal justice system than the postponement of the hearing of the appeal for a period of six months or so.
	
	
	Fourthly, I bore in mind that the prospect of an application pursuant to Pt 7 foreshadowed by senior counsel for the applicant meant that refusal of the application to vacate would not provide any finality to the young victims of the applicant in any event.

2702224,Mason v R (No. 2) [2015] NSWCCA 325,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Wayne Paul Mason, seeks leave to appeal against conviction with respect to one count of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s.61J(1) Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	Between 6 August 2012 and 19 September 2012, the Applicant stood trial at the Sydney District Court before his Honour Judge Frearson SC and a jury on an indictment that contained 52 counts. The charges related to sexual offences alleged to have been committed against four different female complainants when they were each under 16 years of age, as well as charges of using a child for a pornographic purpose, disseminating child pornography and one count of perverting the course of justice. The Applicant was found guilty in respect of 44 of those counts. He was acquitted on seven counts and the jury could not agree on one count.
	
	
	On 1 February 2013, the Applicant was sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of seven years and five months commencing on 24 July 2012 and expiring on 23 December 2019, with a balance of term of three years and six months commencing on 24 December 2019 and expiring on 23 June 2023.
	


The Ground of Appeal


	
	The Applicant relies upon a single ground of appeal against conviction which contends that the verdict of the jury regarding Count 16 is inconsistent and cannot be supported by the evidence.
	
	
	This ground does not involve a question of law alone and therefore the Applicant requires leave to appeal: s.5(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912; Rasic v R [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [12].
	
	
	The offence to which this conviction appeal relates (Count 16) attracted an indicative sentence of imprisonment for three years and six months.
	
	
	In the event that the conviction appeal succeeded and a verdict of acquittal was entered upon Count 16, counsel for the Applicant submitted that the appropriate course for this Court to take was to utilise ss.52 and 59 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to consider whether it was appropriate to vary the aggregate sentence imposed by the sentencing Judge.
	
	
	Apart from this consequential aspect if the conviction appeal succeeded, there is no challenge made to sentence.
	


Factual Background


	
	Given the single ground of appeal relating to one count only, the factual background to this count may be expressed relatively briefly.
	
	
	The Crown case at trial included the evidence of four complainants, each of whom alleged that the Applicant had committed sexual offences when each girl was under 16 years of age. The Crown case included a number of photographs of the girls, with some depicting the Applicant as well.
	
	
	The complainant in Count 16, RS, met the Applicant through her church in 2001 when she was 14 years old. The Applicant was the leader of the Sunday School and also organised group activities for the children. In 2001, the Applicant was aged 31 years and he was also a serving police officer.
	
	
	Counts 8 to 30 involved 23 alleged offences involving RS. Of these counts, the Applicant was convicted of 18 offences. The Applicant was acquitted on four counts (Counts 8, 18, 22 and 24) and the jury could not reach a verdict on a further count (Count 25).
	
	
	The Applicant was convicted by the jury of the following offences involving RS:
	



	
	in 2001, aggravated indecent assault (when RS was 15 years old) contrary to s.61M(1) Crimes Act 1900 (Count 9);
	
	
	in 2001, sexual intercourse with a person aged between 10 and 16 years (RS was 15 years old) in circumstances of aggravation, RS being under the authority of the Applicant, contrary to s.66C(2) Crimes Act 1900 (Counts 10, 11, 12 and 13);
	
	
	on 30 November 2001, sexual intercourse with a person aged between 10 and 16 years (RS was 15 years old) in circumstances of aggravation, RS being under the authority of the Applicant, contrary to s.66C(2) Crimes Act 1900 (Counts 14 and 15);
	
	
	on 30 November 2001, sexual intercourse without consent with a person aged between 10 and 16 years (RS was 15 years old) contrary to s.61J(1) Crimes Act 1900 (Count 16);
	
	
	in 2001 and 2002, sexual intercourse with a person aged between 10 and 16 years (RS was 15 years old) in circumstances of aggravation, RS being under the authority of the Applicant, contrary to s.66C(2) Crimes Act 1900 (Counts 17, 19, 20, 21, 23 and 26);
	
	
	between 30 November 2002 and 31 January 2003, inducing RS to withdraw her complaint to the New South Wales Police Service of sexual contact between herself and the Applicant, intending thereby to pervert the course of justice, contrary to s.319 Crimes Act 1900 (Count 27);
	
	
	between 2001 and 2003, using RS, a child aged between 14 years and 18 years (RS was 15 or 16 years old), for pornographic purposes, contrary to s.91G(1) Crimes Act 1900 (Counts 28, 29 and 30).
	



	
	Apart from offences involving RS, the Applicant was convicted by the jury of the following offences:
	



	
	sexual offences against CD committed in 1996 and 1997, when CD was 14 or 15 years old (Counts 1 and 2);
	
	
	sexual offences against KS committed between dates in 2000 and 2002, when KS was aged 13, 14 or 15 years old (Counts 4 and 5);
	
	
	disseminating child pornography in 2010 (Counts 6 and 7);
	
	
	sexual offences against AF committed in 2002, when AF was 14 or 15 years old (Counts 31-36, 38-42);
	
	
	using AF for pornographic purposes on dates between 2002 and 2005, when AF was aged 15, 16 or 17 years (Counts 44-48);
	
	
	disseminating child pornography in 2009 and 2010 (Counts 49-52).
	



	
	The Applicant did not give evidence at the trial. It was the defence case that the Applicant did not have sexual relations with any of the complainants when they were under 16 years of age, and that it could not be proved beyond reasonable doubt that the complainants were under 16 years of age in some of the relevant photographs.
	
	
	In his remarks on sentence dated 1 February 2013, the sentencing Judge referred to the verdicts on counts involving RS in the following way (ROS10-11; AB233-234):
	


“Turning to [RS]. [RS] is the subject of the counts 9 to 17, 19 to 21, 23 and 26 to 30. She was born on [XX] September 1986 and the verdicts again, as I have already indicated, do demonstrate overwhelming acceptance of her as a witness of truth. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she gave an honest account in her evidence and was reliable and accurate with regards to the matters that resulted in the guilty verdicts. There was considerable support for the complainant, that included the photograph in exhibit 1, the photographs in exhibit 1, the sexually explicit photographs. It also includes photograph 196, the one that is captioned, ‘These 2 girls tasted my cum at 15’. There is also a diary entry referred to at transcript 913 which refers to the offender pining over a fifteen year old girl called [RS].

The jury did acquit on a number of counts, 8, 18, 22, 24 and they could not agree on 25. Re 8, it is not immediately obvious how they arrived at that result, perhaps the consensual passionate kissing in private may not have, in their view, offended the community's standards of decency, who knows. Regarding count 18, the jury might have been concerned about allegedly oral sex taking place in a park so close to her home. They had been instructed that they had to be satisfied of particular incidents to found particular counts. Re 22, the complainant said she was interrupted by her mother, but the mother did not refer to the incident in her statement to police or in evidence in chief, although she did in cross-examination. Re count 24, [MC’s] evidence about being present at Stanwell Tops when the complainant was wearing particular swimwear may have created some concerns. In the interview with police the offender denied any sexual activity with this complainant at all. He told his psychiatrist that she fabricated allegations against him.”


	
	Relevant to the present appeal, the sentencing Judge made findings with respect to Counts 14, 15 and 16, all of which occurred on the same day (30 November 2001) (ROS14-15; AB237-238):
	


“In relation to counts 14, 15 and 16, counts 14 and 15 are sexual intercourse with a child ten to sixteen under authority contrary to s 66C(2) with a ten year maximum. Count 16 is sexual intercourse without consent with a person under sixteen, knowing the person was not consenting. That is an offence contrary to 61J(1) with a maximum sentence of twenty years imprisonment. This was the occasion of the Greenacre Baptist presentation, it was in November 2001. The offender attended, he picked her up from her house, it was at the Bankstown Town Hall. He was to drive her home, they drove to a vacant block near Fairfax at Chullora, he folded down the back seat, he got a blanket and pillows and climbed over the back seat. What happened was that fellatio and cunnilingus were performed and she was fifteen. She said he had his penis on top of my vagina rubbing it against me, not inside but using the saliva he had created down there as lubrication. He said, ‘Okay, I'm just swimming, I won't go any further’. Then he put his penis inside her and began to penetrate. He said to her, ‘Now we are one.’ They had previously spoken about her not wanting to have sex, which was part of her beliefs she said.

She had informed him in the past, ‘I don't want to have sex, you know, penile vaginal with anyone until I'm married.’ The next day he sent her a letter apologising and said, ‘it will not happen again.’ The penile/vaginal was count 16 and the other counts are 14 and 15. The conduct in relation to count 16 presents as being moderate, it is certainly not at the upper end, it is towards the lower end of the type of conduct that could constitute this offence, non-consensual conduct. I appreciate the age is an actual element of the offence; nevertheless, it is an extremely serious offence. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt he well knew at that point she was not consenting and this was an escalation of a systematic seduction of an underage complainant.”


	
	Some further detail is required concerning the evidence of RS, in particular with respect to Counts 14, 15 and 16
	


Events Leading Up to Count 16


	
	As mentioned earlier, RS gave evidence that she had met the Applicant through her church in 2001, when she was 14 years old and the Applicant was 31 years old. RS was aware that the Applicant was a serving police officer. What follows is based largely upon the evidence of RS at the trial and is drawn mainly from the Crown summary.
	
	
	RS explained that, from very early on, the Applicant had bestowed attention on her and made her feel special. She explained that she had not had that sort of attention from anyone before.
	
	
	The Applicant initiated email contact with RS. Initially, the emails were innocuous but they became more flirtatious. The Applicant and RS also commenced to communicate by text message. The Applicant did drawings of RS which he gave to her, as well as a ring. He wrote to her about having feelings for her, even though she was so much younger than him.
	
	
	Soon after RS’s 15th birthday (in September 2001) during a group sleep over at the church hall, the Applicant slept on a lounge with RS. When she woke, he was over the top of her and kissed her. He told her she would get into trouble if she told anyone about it. Later she told a friend. The Applicant told her to say it was a dream and she did so.
	
	
	In October-November 2001, the Applicant suggested driving RS to Stanwell Tops which they did. He put a blanket on the grass and passionately kissed her and then he drove her home. She was 15 at the time (Count 9).
	
	
	According to RS, the Applicant made it quite clear to her from the beginning that she was not to tell anyone about them. He told her that she would get into trouble. Later, he explained this in terms of their relationship being just “too early for its time” and that people would not understand because of his job as a police officer and their age difference. RS explained that she liked the way the Applicant made her feel so she was happy to go along with it.
	
	
	Soon after the Stanwell Tops offence (Count 9), they made arrangements to see each other at RS’s home after the Applicant had finished a late shift at work. He was in his police uniform. He came through the back gate and the back door which RS had left open. He laid down with RS on her bed and starting kissing her. He told her that he wanted her to suck his penis and she did so. Then he said he wanted to lick her vagina which he did afterwards saying “I’ve been waiting so long to taste you” (Counts 10 and 11). The Applicant tried to persuade RS to have penile vaginal intercourse, however she said that she was not ready to do so.
	
	
	The Applicant took her shopping and brought her new clothes which made her feel very special. RS wore these clothes on a school excursion to the Sydney Tower and afterwards she stayed in the city and met with the Applicant. She was able to do this because the Applicant forged a permission note from her mother saying that she could. She stayed that night at the Applicant’s house and the next day she did not go to school. She described them “playing” with each other, by which she meant she sucked his penis and he licked her vagina. The complainant was still 15 years old at this time (Counts 12 and 13).
	
	
	RS said that around the time they started having oral sex, she discussed with the Applicant that due to their shared religious beliefs, she did not want to have penile vaginal sex with anyone until she was married (T83; AB1042).
	


Counts 14, 15 and 16


	
	In late November 2001, about six weeks after her 15th birthday, RS described the Applicant picking her up after a school presentation night. He was to drive her home, but suggested first that they go and “play” for a bit. He drove to a vacant lot in Chullora and he folded down the back seat and got out a blanket and a pillow. They laid down in the back and, after kissing and removing their clothes, she put his penis in her mouth and then he performed oral sex on her (Counts 14 and 15).
	
	
	After that, he was lying over the top of her and had his penis on top of her vagina, rubbing it against her (but not inside her). He was “just using the saliva he had created down there as lubrication” and the Applicant said to her “It’s OK, I’m just swimming, I won’t go any further” (T83; AB1042). But then the Applicant put his penis inside her vagina and began to penetrate her. The Applicant said to her “Now we are one” (T83; AB1042). It was this first act of penile vaginal intercourse that constituted Count 16, the conviction which gives rise to the present ground of appeal.
	
	
	On the way home afterwards, RS was very quiet and did not say anything to the Applicant.
	


The Applicant Apologises


	
	The next day, the Applicant sent RS a letter apologising and saying that it would not happen again (T84; AB1043).
	


Events After Count 16


	
	Soon after that, RS said that the Applicant took her shopping in the city and he bought her a wallet and t-shirt. She described things as being “back to being more friends” (T84; AB1043).
	
	
	The Applicant then started to explain to her that “If you’re in a relationship with someone you need to make the other person happy” and that “If you don’t have sex with someone then the relationship goes nowhere” (T85; AB1044). RS said that, at that time, she did not want the Applicant to leave her, but that she believed they were “boyfriend and girlfriend” and that she wanted this to continue. She felt that if she “didn’t do as he wished that he would leave and like break up with me” (T85; AB1044).
	
	
	RS said that, as a result of this conversation, their sexual relationship started to include penile vaginal intercourse in addition to fellatio and cunnilingus. These types of sexual acts continued to occur for about another nine or 10 months, before she finally broke up with the Applicant in about October 2002, because she had suspicions that the Applicant was having a relationship with another young girl, AF (see Counts 31 to 48). The Applicant was convicted of sexual offences with AF (then 14 years old) which were committed in the first half of 2002 (Counts 31-36, 38-42).
	
	
	RS referred to an item described as the “Book of Shadows” which was a “letter book we had together”, containing letters and drawings which were communications between the Applicant and her (T100; AB1059). After she and the Applicant broke up, he asked for the “Book of Shadows” to be given back to him, as he “said it was too dangerous for me [RS] to have in my possession” and she gave it back to him (T124; AB1083). The Applicant asked for the letter of apology (see [31] above) back from RS after they broke up, and she gave it back to him at the same time as the “Book of Shadows” (T170-171; AB1129-1130).
	


Complaints by RS


	
	About a month after breaking up with the Applicant, in November or early December 2002, RS told a friend, VZ, that the Applicant had “raped her and sexually abused her” (T886; AB1845).
	
	
	Steven Chard was senior pastor at the church attended by the Applicant and RS. He was called as a witness in the defence case at trial. He gave evidence of having a conversation with RS in December 2002, in which she said that she wished to make a complaint about the Applicant. In response to a question from Mr Chard as to whether the Applicant had had sex with her, RS said “Twice, when I was 14 and when I was 15”. Mr Chard asked “Was it with your permission?” and RS replied “One of them wasn’t” (T1105; AB2064).
	
	
	It is not necessary to recount the circumstances surrounding the offences after Count 16 for the purpose of determining the ground of appeal.
	


Submissions of the Applicant


	
	Mr Game SC, for the Applicant, pointed to the fact that Count 16 required the Crown to prove an absence of consent by RS, and that the Applicant knew that RS was not consenting to the act of penile vaginal intercourse. He noted that this was an important point of distinction between Count 16 and other counts of which the Applicant had been found guilty.
	
	
	Mr Game SC submitted orally that the ground of appeal should be approached as an unreasonable verdict ground and not an inconsistent verdict ground (T20, 24 November 2015). He submitted, however, that the Court could have regard to the acquittals on counts involving RS in determining the unreasonable verdict ground.
	
	
	The written submissions for the Applicant pointed to the counts concerning RS which had resulted in acquittals, and noted the sentencing Judge’s comments with respect to these counts (see [16] above). It was submitted that the evidence available to sustain Count 16 appeared to be no different to the evidence available regarding Counts 22, 24 and 25, with acquittals resulting on Counts 22 and 24 and the jury unable to agree on a verdict on Count 25.
	
	
	The following submissions were made for the Applicant by reference to the evidence adduced in support of Count 16:
	



	
	it stood alone as the one instance of alleged non-consensual intercourse between the Applicant and RS;
	
	
	it can be contrasted with the abundance of evidence that supported the Crown case that the Applicant had engaged in consensual activity with RS, and the three other complainants who gave evidence in the trial;
	
	
	consensual activity was ongoing between the Applicant and RS, on the Crown case, for a considerable period after the alleged offence;
	
	
	there was no complaint for more than 12 months;
	
	
	there was an almost immediate retraction made by RS - the retraction was repeated a number of times, and included a formal interview and retraction statement with police on 7 January 2003;
	
	
	RS subsequently had consensual intercourse with the Applicant in 2005 when she was 18 years old;
	
	
	there was no further complaint until police approached her in 2010.
	



	
	It was submitted for the Applicant that the verdict of guilty on Count 16 was unreasonable and that it could not be supported by the evidence, with the acquittals on other counts concerning RS fortifying this conclusion.
	


Submissions for the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that the verdict of guilty on Count 16 was reasonably open to the jury so that the Court should reject the Applicant’s ground of appeal.
	
	
	The Crown responded to each of the specific submissions made for the Applicant with respect to Count 16 (see [42] above):
	



	
	the Crown submitted that whilst it is true that Count 16 stood as the one instance of alleged non-consensual intercourse between the Applicant and RS, she had explained clearly why this was the case and how this one non-consensual occasion came about - it was because the relevant act happened at a time when she had made it clear to the Applicant that she did not want to engage in penile vaginal intercourse until she was married - despite the Applicant’s assurance that he would not go further, he did so, apologising for it the next day - the Crown submitted (as noted by the sentencing Judge at [17] above) that the presence of this one non-consensual act could readily be viewed as consistent with a deliberate “escalation of a systematic seduction of an underage complainant”;
	
	
	the Crown submitted that the absence of supporting evidence did not render the evidence in respect of Count 16 unreliable, nor did it necessitate a conclusion that the jury should have entertained a reasonable doubt - given the isolated nature of the act, it was submitted that the absence of supporting evidence was not remarkable;
	
	
	the Crown submitted that any question as to how and why consensual sexual activity (including penile vaginal intercourse) continued after the non-consensual event in Count 16 was clearly explained by RS - when considered from the point of view of a 15-year old girl in her circumstances, it was submitted that the explanation is credible and compelling - she was besotted with this older man, who was connected with the church and who was also a police officer - she enjoyed all the attention he bestowed upon her - she explained that she did not want the relationship to end - as a result, she accepted the explanation the Applicant gave her (that “If you’re in a relationship with someone you need to make the other person happy”, and that “If you don’t have sex with someone then the relationship goes nowhere” – see [33] above) in order not to lose him;
	
	
	the Crown submitted that delayed complaint is not an unusual feature in these kinds of matters, given that RS continued having a relationship with the Applicant - she explained her reasons for not disclosing the offending during the course of the relationship - this included the Applicant telling her that she would get into trouble, and later developed into how their relationship was just “too early for its time” and people would not understand because of his job as a police officer and because of their age difference - RS explained that she liked the way the Applicant made her feel so she went along with this - the Crown submitted that it was significant that, when RS did finally make a disclosure, it was reasonably proximate to the relationship having ended in October 2002, with the disclosure occurring in November 2002 or early December 2002;
	
	
	the Crown submitted that the Applicant’s reliance upon the purported retraction had to be seen in the context of the jury’s verdict on Count 27, which related to the Applicant inducing RS to withdraw her complaint with the intention of perverting the course of justice - the guilty verdict involved acceptance by the jury that the Applicant had applied pressure to RS to effect a retraction of her allegations - this was a precursor to RS’s formal interview and retraction statement with police;
	
	
	the Crown submitted that RS had explained why the later incident of intercourse in 2005 had occurred - she said “I just kind of wanted a bit of payback to show him that I’m like doing better without him now, and just to kind of hurt him, in a way to use him as I felt that he had used me for a period of time when I was younger” (T160; AB1119) - the existence of this much later consensual intercourse did not render the evidence of the first act of non-consensual intercourse unreliable;
	
	
	the Crown submitted that the absence of further complaint, until police approached RS in 2010, was a feature which existed in respect of all of the counts involving her, including those for which the jury returned guilty verdicts, which are not subject to any challenge on appeal.
	



	
	To the extent that the Applicant sought to rely upon acquittals on a number of the counts, the Crown submitted that it had not been argued that the acquittals necessitated a conclusion that the credibility of RS had been undermined, in respect of all of the counts on the indictment where there were guilty verdicts. Rather, it was only the conviction on Count 16 which is under challenge, with acquittals upon several counts being relied upon by the Applicant in an indirect way. The Crown submitted that, to the extent that inconsistent verdicts were part of the Applicant’s submission, the verdict of guilty on Count 16 was both logical and reasonable.
	
	
	The Crown noted that there was either an absence of evidence or some evidence in the defence case, which bore upon the acquittals on Counts 22 and 24. The sentencing Judge referred to these differentiating aspects in the remarks on sentence (see [16] above).
	
	
	Further, there were some features affecting Count 25 (where the jury could not agree) which did not affect the evidence in support of Count 16.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the ground of appeal should be rejected.
	


Decision


	
	The well-known principles to be applied, when determining a ground of appeal which asserts that a verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence, were summarised by Bathurst CJ (Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J agreeing) in W v R [2014] NSWCCA 110 at [150]-[152]:
	


“150   The principles on which this ground is to be determined were reaffirmed by the majority of the High Court in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400 in the following terms:

‘[11]    It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:

'Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.'

[12]    This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to 'unsafe or unsatisfactory' in M is to be taken as 'equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as ‘unreasonable’ or such as ‘cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence’.'

[13]    The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:

'In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.'

Save as to the issue whether the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in not viewing a videotape of the complainant's police interview, to which reference will be made later in these reasons, this qualification is not relevant to the present matter.’

(Citations omitted).

151   It is not enough for the verdict to be unreasonable that a review of the evidence shows only that it was possible for the jury (or in this case the trial judge) to reach a different conclusion. That was made clear by Hayne J in Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; (2007) 230 CLR 559. In a passage with which Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreed, his Honour made the following remarks:

‘[113]    It is clear that the evidence that was adduced at the trial did not all point to the appellant's guilt on this first count. But the question for an appellate court is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which is to say whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt. It is not sufficient to show that there was material which might have been taken by the jury to be sufficient to preclude satisfaction of guilt to the requisite standard. In the present case, the critical question for the jury was what assessment they made of the whole of the evidence that the complainant and the appellant gave that was relevant to the issue of consent to the digital penetration that had occurred in the park. That evidence did not require the conclusion that the jury should necessarily have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt.’

(Emphasis in the original, citations omitted). 

152   However, it is not sufficient that there was evidence on which a jury could convict. So much is made clear in the passage from M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487, cited in SKA v The Queen supra at [13]. If, after giving full weight to the primacy of the jury, the court is left in reasonable doubts as to the verdicts, it is only where the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt, the court can conclude there was no miscarriage of justice (see also MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 at [26] and [55]-[56])”.


	
	It is important in this case, that the jury had an opportunity to see and hear the witnesses, including RS, give evidence at trial.
	
	
	To the extent that the Applicant relies, in support of the challenge to conviction on Count 16, upon acquittals on some counts involving RS, it should be kept in mind that the test is one of logic and reasonableness: MacKenzie v The Queen [1996] HCA 35; 190 CLR 348 at 366.
	
	
	The principles to be applied, where an unreasonable ground is sought to be supported by a claim of inconsistent verdicts, were mentioned by Hoeben CJ at CL (Davies J and myself agreeing) in ML v R [2015] NSWCCA 27 at [46]-[48]:
	


“46   The principles applicable when considering ‘apparent’ inconsistent jury verdicts were comprehensively analysed in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606. Those principles have not been qualified in later cases. The plurality (Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ) recognised the advantage of a jury over an appellate court in relation to certain evidence:

‘23   The case was one in which the jury's assessment of the three principal witnesses, the complainant, MA, and the appellant was vital. The alleged offences arose out of sexual activities between the appellant and boys of a much younger age. The activities were not brought to notice as a result of any complaint by the boys. When first approached by the police, they denied the activities. In court, they sought to explain this by fear and shame. Furthermore, in evaluating the effect of the evidence of MA, the jury were entitled to take account of his age at the time of the alleged events, and the possibility of some confusion on his part. None of this relieved the Court of Criminal Appeal of its responsibility in scrutinising the evidence, and making its own assessment of the reasonableness of the guilty verdicts. However, in making that assessment, the Court would properly have been conscious of the fact that there were aspects of the case that would not be reflected adequately in the written record.’

47   The plurality also stressed the importance to be accorded to a jury verdict:

‘34   Since the ultimate question concerns the reasonableness of the jury's decision, the significance of verdicts of not guilty on some counts in an indictment must necessarily be considered in the light of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Furthermore, it must be considered in the context of the system within which juries function, and of their role in that system. A number of features of that context were emphasised in MacKenzie. They include the following. First, as in the present case, where an indictment contains multiple counts, the jury will ordinarily be directed to give separate consideration to each count. This will often be accompanied by a specific instruction that the evidence of a witness may be accepted in whole or in part. Secondly, emphasis will invariably be placed upon the onus of proof borne by the prosecution. In jurisdictions where unanimity is required, such as New South Wales, every juror must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of every element in the offence. In the case of sexual offences, of which there may be no objective evidence, some, or all, of the members of a jury may require some supporting evidence before they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the word of a complainant. This may not be unreasonable. It does not necessarily involve a rejection of the complainant's evidence. A juror might consider it more probable than not that a complainant is telling the truth but require something additional before reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. The criminal trial procedure is designed to reinforce, in jurors, a sense of the seriousness of their task, and of the heavy burden of proof undertaken by the prosecution. A verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that a complainant has been disbelieved, or a want of confidence in the complainant. It may simply reflect a cautious approach to the discharge of a heavy responsibility. In addition to want of supporting evidence, other factors that might cause a jury to draw back from reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt in relation to some aspects of a complainant's evidence might be that the complainant has shown some uncertainty as to matters of detail, or has been shown to have a faulty recollection of some matters, or has been shown otherwise to be more reliable about some parts of his or her evidence than about others. Thirdly, there is the consideration stated by King CJ in R v Kirkman, and referred to in later cases: it may appear to a jury, that, although a number of offences have been alleged, justice is met by convicting an accused of some only. …’

‘48   More recently, observations to similar effect were made by Simpson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Latham J agreed) in R v TK [2009] NSWCCA 151; 74 NSWLR 299 at [135]:

‘135     … But it seems to me that, where the circumstance said to create unreasonableness is inconsistency, then a new dimension is added to the conventional M test. The issue is not only whether the verdict was open ‘upon the whole of the evidence’. It is whether the verdict was open on the whole of the evidence, and having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, including the circumstance that the jury acquitted on one or some counts, whatever (if anything) can be discerned as the explanation for the acquittals, and whatever insight can be gained into the jury’s thinking and reasoning. It is only where the only reasonable explanation for the acquittals is doubt about the complainant’s veracity that an appellate court would be obliged to take the approach taken in Jones (and in Norris).

136       In my view an appellate court ought to exercise caution before concluding that the explanation for differential verdicts is compromise. Inherent in that conclusion is the further conclusion that the jury has acted contrary to its duty, and contrary to the instruction it has been given. The criminal justice system depends upon its faith in juries adhering to their obligations, as explained to them, and acting in conformity with those obligations …’.”


	
	To my mind, the Crown responses (at [45] above) to the particular submissions advanced for the Applicant, are highly persuasive. There were features of the evidence, surrounding Count 16, which provided a solid foundation for a conclusion that RS was not consenting to penile vaginal intercourse and that the Applicant knew that she was not consenting at the time of the act.
	
	
	RS gave evidence of a conversation with the Applicant concerning her wish that sexual activity not proceed to penile vaginal intercourse. Her position had been made clear to the Applicant and he understood it at the time of the events giving rise to Count 16. The Applicant told RS that he was just “swimming” externally on top of her genital area, and that he would not “go any further”. Despite this assurance, he inserted his penis in her vagina and engaged in penile vaginal intercourse, with the Applicant saying to RS “Now we are one”. The Applicant apologised to RS for this, including a written apology the next day. It was her evidence that this letter had been returned to the Applicant, at his request, at the end of their relationship.
	
	
	Other features of the evidence supported a conclusion that the act involved in Count 16 was non-consensual. There was complaint by RS to VZ of rape and sexual abuse (see [36] above). Further, there was complaint by RS to Mr Chard in December 2002 that she had had sex twice with the Applicant and “one of them” was not with her permission (see [37] above).
	
	
	This Court is entitled (as was the jury) to have regard to the Applicant’s course of manipulative conduct towards RS over an extended period of time. The Crown’s response to the Applicant’s submissions referred to aspects of this. It included the Applicant’s justification for the continuation of penile vaginal intercourse after the initial non-consensual act, a course of manipulation of RS which succeeded. All of this occurred at a time when the Applicant was twice the age of the teenager, RS.
	
	
	The Applicant’s submissions by reference to the retraction by RS of the allegations is also to be viewed in light of the manipulation of RS by the Applicant. Other features of this manipulation included the Applicant’s use of his status as a police officer and as a church worker, presenting as a person whom RS held in high regard.
	
	
	The acquittal of the Applicant on some counts concerning RS is explicable. The verdicts suggest that the jury worked their way through the various counts, reaching verdicts which accorded with the evidence and the directions of the trial Judge.
	
	
	I am satisfied that a sound and clear foundation exists for the verdict of guilty on Count 16. The verdict on Count 16 is both logical and reasonable.
	
	
	Applying the relevant principles where a claim is made of an unreasonable verdict, I am well satisfied that the verdict of guilty on Count 16 was reasonably open to the jury in this case. I am left with no reasonable doubt of the Applicant’s guilt on Count 16.
	
	
	I would reject this ground of appeal.
	


Conclusion


	
	For the above reasons, I propose that leave to appeal be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed.
	
	
	BUTTON J: I agree with Johnson J.
	
	
	FAGAN J: I agree with Johnson J.

	GLEESON JA: I agree with Hall J.
	
	
	HALL J: The applicants, Zoltan Mato and Marius Rusu, both seek leave to appeal in respect of sentences imposed by the District Court (his Honour, Frearson SC DCJ) on 3 September 2010.
	
	
	Each of the applicants was charged on indictment with the following offences:
	


Count 1: s 233B(1)(a)(iii) Customs Act 1901 (Cth) – conspiracy to import prohibited import, namely a commercial quantity of cocaine.

Count 2: s 400.3(1) Criminal Code Act 2005 (Cth) – deal with money or other property (> $1 million) that was and which he respectively believed to be proceeds of crime.


	
	In respect of the conspiracy offence, both applicants were charged with conspiring with each other and others to import not less than a commercial quantity of cocaine. The other persons included Luke Sparos, Alen Moradien, Matthew Stockwell and Adam Ballard.
	
	
	Each of the applicants entered not guilty pleas to the charges.
	
	
	The trial commenced on 8 February 2010. On 29 March 2010, the jury returned verdicts of guilty on Counts 1 and 2.
	
	
	The conspiracy charge under s 233B(1)(a)(iii) of the Customs Act 1901 carried a prescribed maximum penalty of life imprisonment. I note that s 233B has since been repealed with serious drug offences now found in Pt 9.1 of the Criminal Code.
	
	
	The proceeds offence charged under s 400.3(1) of the Criminal Code carried a maximum prescribed penalty of 25 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The applicants were sentenced on 3 September 2010 as follows:
	


“(1)   Mato - 12 years and 6 months imprisonment for the proceeds of crime offence, to date from 9 April 2008; and 26 years and 9 months imprisonment for the conspiracy [offence] to date from 9 October 2011. The effective sentence is 30 years and 3 months imprisonment. His Honour specified a non-parole period of 19 years to date from 9 April 2008 with the Applicant eligible for release on parole on 8 April 2027.

(2)   Rusu - 10 years imprisonment for the proceeds of crime offence, to date from 9 April 2008; and 27 years imprisonment for the conspiracy offence to date from 9 January 2011. The effective sentence is 29 years and 9 months. A non-parole period of 18 years and 10 months was imposed to date from 9 April 2008 with the Applicant eligible for release on parole on 8 February 2027.” (Crown Submissions at [3]).

Grounds of Appeal


	
	The applicants seek leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on them.
	
	
	In his Grounds of Appeal dated 3 June 2011, the applicant, Zoltan Mato, relied upon the following grounds:
	


3.1   The sentences were manifestly excessive and were not “just and appropriate” to the totality of the offending behaviour.

3.2   The trial judge erred in not fully cumulating the sentences for the conspiracy and money laundering offences.


	
	Leave was sought and granted at the hearing of the application on 6 October 2015 for the applicant Mato to rely upon an additional ground of appeal in the following terms:
	


3.3   The applicant has [a] justified sense of grievance given the sentence imposed upon the co-applicant and the principle of parity: Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462.


	
	In his Grounds of Appeal filed 21 March 2014 the applicant, Marius Rusu, relied upon the following grounds:
	


1   The sentencing judge erred in the assessment of the seriousness of the offences committed by the applicant.

2   A miscarriage of justice resulted from disparity of sentence.

3   The sentencing judge erred in applying the totality principle.

Facts


	
	The factual circumstances constituting and surrounding the offences were summarised in some detail in the Crown’s written submissions as follows:
	


“4.   The Applicants conspired together and with others, including Mathew Stockwell (“Stockwell”) to import a commercial quantity of cocaine into Australia. Between January 2005 and August 2006 inclusive there were six successful importations. While the cocaine was never recovered, the evidence established that the Applicants imported at least 209 kilograms of the drug.

5.   The Applicants recruited Stockwell, who was the Director of International Freight Forwarding and Sales at Stockwell International Pty Limited, an international logistics company owned by his father, to participate in the conspiracy. Stockwell was introduced to the Applicants by Adam Ballard (“Ballard”) who Stockwell knew through his local football club. Ballard had on occasions supplied marijuana to Stockwell which Stockwell and his wife sold to others. The Applicants were introduced to Stockwell as “Daniel;” (Zoltan Daniel Mato) and “Mark” (Marius Rusu). Thereafter he called them “Dan” and “Mars”.

6.   Stockwell was in a position to contribute to the conspiracy because of his position in the company. His role was to provide the paper work (and other services) necessary to enable the drugs to be imported into Australia undetected. The Applicants paid Stockwell approximately $1.4 million in total for his involvement.

7.   Stockwell participated and assisted the Applicants in six successful importations of cocaine from Los Angeles, United Stated of America. These occurred as follows:

(1)   February 2005 (the “first importation”);

(2)   July / August 2005 (the “second importation”);

(3)   August / September 2005 (the “third importation”);

(4)   February / March 2006 (the “fourth importation”);

(5)   April / May 2006 (the “fifth importation”); and

(6)   July / August 2006 (the “sixth importation”).

8.   In addition, in 2004 Stockwell was also involved with the Applicants in preparations which were undertaken in respect of an initial importation from Chicago. However this importation did not ultimately occur because of a concern that Mato had about the quality of the cocaine.

9.   In essence, the modus operandi of each of the importations was as follows:

(1)   The Applicants provided Stockwell with what was referred to as a “hot phone”.

(2)   The Applicants, usually Rusu, made contact with Stockwell on this “hot phone” to arrange a meeting which was attended by all three.

(3)   At the meeting, there was discussion as to the quantity of cocaine that was to be imported. With the exception of the fourth importation (102 kg), the quantities involved were between 20 and 50 kg on each occasion.

(4)   As a result of the information that was provided to him at the meeting, Stockwell would prepare false freight documentation. This documentation was based on previous shipments of legitimate goods handled by Stockwell International for legitimate businesses. Stockwell then provided this false freight documentation to the Applicants. The Applicants provided Stockwell with the funds to cover airfreight and clearance charges.

(5)   One or both of the Applicants, together with other members of the conspiracy, travelled to Los Angeles with the false freight documentation.

(6)   While in Los Angeles, either Mato or Rusu sent a coded text message to Stockwell’s “hot phone” advising him that the cocaine had been delivered to the Universal Air Cargo (“UAC”) depot in Los Angeles. UAC is an international freight forwarding company that facilitates the transport of international freight by air and sea globally and with whom Stockwell International had dealings.

(7)   Stockwell then tracked the progress of the shipment until it arrived at UAC’s depot at Botany in Sydney. In particular, Stockwell looked out for pre-alerts, which are documents that are faxed to Stockwell International by UAC so that Stockwell International can start the customs clearance process. Upon receipt of the relevant pre-alert, Stockwell arranged for the customs clearance process to be commenced.

(8)   Once the shipment was available for collection from UAC’s Botany depot, Stockwell collected it (or arranged for it to be collected by another Stockwell International employee) and advised the Applicants of that fact by telephone. In the case of the first two importations, Stockwell took the shipment to an address at Birkenhead Point that was associated with the co-conspirator Moradien. Stockwell took each of the subsequent shipments to his own residence at Appin.

(9)   Although Stockwell was not present at the unpacking of the cocaine the subject of the first two importations, he was present and assisted the Applicants with the unpacking of each of the subsequent shipments. Those occurred at his residence in Appin near Campbelltown, with the Applicants taking all of the cocaine away with them.

(10)   In the days after the Applicants had taken possession of the cocaine, they contacted Stockwell to arrange a further meeting at which they paid him for his role in the particular shipment. Stockwell did not receive the agreed payment in respect of the fourth importation because a person known to the Applicants convinced Stockwell to reinvest in the importations in order to retrieve their money. He did so.

(11)   Stockwell was paid approximately $1.4 million by the Applicants during the course of the conspiracy for his involvement in the importations.

10.   After the sixth importation Stockwell withdrew from the arrangement with the Applicants but later continued to import cocaine with Moradien and Sparos.

11.   The evidence of the unexplained wealth which is relevant to the proceeds of crime offences, is also circumstantial evidence which supports the conclusion that the Applicants were involved in a conspiracy to import cocaine.

12.   Mato and Rusu laundered $870,000 through the business accounts of Terry Hogan Prestige Cars with the assistance of Anthony Hogan, $615,000 of which was ultimately paid into accounts in the name of Mato, his wife or his limousine business.

13.   Despite the Applicants and associated entities only having modest legitimate sources of income, they spent large sums of money (often in cash) on motor vehicles and on luxury goods ….

14.   In relation to Mato this includes:

(1)   Between July 2004 and October 2007, Mato and his wife purchased 15 motor vehicles from Terry Hogan Prestige Cars for a total amount of $1,568,740. That amount included cash payments totalling $1,066,240 …;

(2)   Between April 2006 and February 2007, Mato spent an additional $336,776 in respect of the purchase and modification of two Chrysler motor vehicles and a further $361,843 on the purchase and modification of a Hummer motor vehicle in relation to his limousine business …; and

(3)   Between January 2004 and September 2007, Mato and his wife spent $179,691 on furniture, jewellery and designer goods, cosmetic services, the deposit on the purchase of commercial premises and building and landscaping services predominantly paid for in cash ….

15.   In relation to Rusu this includes:

(1)   The purchase of various motor vehicles from Terry Hogan Prestige Cars in the amount of $731,000 of which $545,500 was paid in cash …;

(2)   Purchase of a Hummer motor vehicle and the subsequent expenditure on the vehicle of $339,971 between 5 April 2006 and 15 February 2007 …;

(3)   Personal expenditure of $82,074, excluding day to day living expenses …’

(4)   The demolition and partial construction of a house at Matraville in the amount of $69,611 …

16.   In addition, although unquantified at trial, the Applicants necessarily incurred considerable travel and other associated expenses relating to their regular travels to and from Los Angeles over the period of the conspiracy. They paid Stockwell $1.4 million for his involvement.”


	
	In relation to the defence case, apart from the first importation, neither of the applicants disputed at trial that one Mathew Stockwell was involved in the importation into Sydney of cocaine from Los Angeles. Stockwell was a director of International Freight Forwarding and Sales at Stockwell International Pty Ltd, an international logistical company. The applicants’ defence was that Stockwell had falsely implicated them as being part of the conspiracy and importation.
	
	
	The applicant Mato gave evidence at trial.
	
	
	Mato’s case was that he was not involved in the conspiracy with Stockwell or any other persons in any conspiracy to import cocaine. His evidence was that he had not met or entered a relationship with Stockwell until April 2006 at which time the relationship was solely related to his limousine business, during which business he exported vehicles through Stockwell International to the United States to be “stretched” and then returned to Australia.
	
	
	The applicant Rusu did not give evidence at trial.
	


Remarks on Sentence


	
	The sentencing judge set out in a detailed summary the facts relating to the six importations. The summary included, in particular, his Honour’s determination as to the particular quantities of cocaine the subject of each importation. At page 3 of the Remarks on Sentence his Honour stated:
	


“It has been submitted on behalf of the offenders that the verdict of itself does not establish the quantity alleged by the Crown; that is technically so. I am required to make findings of fact, as I said, consistent with the verdict of the jury, and when I look at the totality of the evidence I, too, accept the essence of Stockwell’s account beyond reasonable doubt. That does lead to my conclusion – and I will elaborate later – that the quantity imported pursuant to the conspiracy was in the order of at least 209 kilograms, and I make that conclusion notwithstanding the submissions to the contrary.”


	
	The sentencing judge noted at p 4 that, prior to February 2003, the applicants had enlisted Adam Ballard to speak with Stockwell with a view to securing Stockwell’s cooperation in regard to the importation of cocaine from the United States, and at that point the offender Mato had a long-standing friendship with Alan Moradien (p 4). Stockwell was in a position to contribute to the conspiracy because of his position in Stockwell International Pty Ltd. He participated and assisted the applicants in the six importations from Los Angeles.
	
	
	In relation to the dealing charges (Count 2), the sentencing judge also set out his factual findings including a finding at p 16 in these terms:
	


“That the applicants made payments to Stockwell in the order of $1.4 million for purposes connected with the conspiracy, that is, to facilitate Stockwell’s assistance in the importation of cocaine, pursuant to the conspiracy.”


	
	His Honour found that the applicant Rusu dealt with the proceeds of cocaine sales well in excess of $1 million, namely, in the order of at least $2.5 million, including the money that he paid to Stockwell (p 17).
	
	
	The applicant Mato was sentenced on the basis that he had dealt with the proceeds of crime in the order of $4 million, including the money paid to Stockwell (p 17).
	
	
	His Honour noted at p 17 that there were no common elements regarding the conspiracy offence and the dealing charges of the type referred to in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610, but stated at pp 17-18:
	


“… Nevertheless I accept there is some commonality in the sense that the offenders dealt with the proceeds of the cocaine that was distributed as a consequence of the importations, which was the object of the conspiracy. Indeed the $1.4 million paid to Stockwell as a reward for Stockwell’s efforts that was paid directly in relation to the conspiracy itself.”


	
	His Honour additionally observed at pp 18-19:
	


“The offenders were also clearly motivated by financial gain and it is obvious that they were motivated by greed, pure greed. The dealing illustrated the financial gain that was the yield of the conspiracy, and I accept that financial gain itself is inherent in the conspiracy offence. One would expect this type of conspiracy to involve financial gain.

While I accept nevertheless that there is a separate and distinct criminality involved, it does seem to me that the areas of commonality that I have identified should partly inform my discretion as to the degree of accumulation that is appropriate.

I am also mindful that in one sense there is a stronger nexus between the $1.4 million paid to Stockwell in the conspiracy than with the other monies dealt with by the offenders, which has a more tenuous connection with the conspiracy. Additionally, the offender Mato, on the evidence, dealt with substantially more money than the offender Rusu, but I do acknowledge that all the monies, on the evidence, have derived directly or indirectly from the conspiracy.

I mention those matters to indicate there are some subtleties involved here.

The moneys dealt with were the proceeds of the cocaine sales and sales made as a direct consequence of the conspiracy. The fact is that both offenders well knew the source of the money. I have regard, when looking at the objective gravity of the dealing charges, to the duration of the transactions, the timeframe in which the transactions occurred, and particularly to the amount of money and property involved in the transactions. I appreciate that the amount is not decisive as to criminality but it remains a very significant feature of criminality.”


	
	The sentencing judge had regard to the matters required to be taken into consideration under Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), including, in particular, those specified in s 16A of the Criminal Code. His Honour noted that the maximum sentence for the conspiracy offence was life imprisonment and the maximum for the dealing charges was 25 years imprisonment.
	
	
	His Honour proceeded at pp 19-20:
	


“I am content to deal with the conspiracy matter on the basis that Moradian and Sparos were some of the architects of the conspiracy and operated at a slightly higher level than the offenders. Certainly the monies were made available to Stockwell after Stockwell disengaged from the offenders supports that type of hierarchy. I am unable to accept, however, that the offenders can be fairly described, as they were in submissions at one point, as ‘workers’ in the conspiracy. They played, on any view, an extremely important and active role in directly facilitating the importation of a very substantial amount of cocaine, using Stockwell.

They were in fact principals in a sophisticated conspiracy. As I said, they were clearly motivated by greed. They must be sentenced for what they did and for what they did in combination with others. They must be sentenced having regard to the object of the conspiracy. I find that the offenders in fact played a crucial role as principals in the organisation, and I accept the Crown’s written submissions as to the role they played and their role included the recruitment of others, particularly Stockwell, the provision of explicit instructions and the setting of timetables. They had clear knowledge of the role of others involved in the network. Their role involved frequent travel to the United States of America. Their role involved the control of the cocaine that was imported. It involved the payments of $1.4 million to Stockwell, and I have regard to the obvious financial benefits they received. I have regard to the duration and scope and high level of sophistication of the conspiracy.”


	
	In addition, his Honour took into account other relevant matters which included the fact that a number of persons were involved in the combination apart from the two offenders, the extremely high level of organisation involved in the criminal conspiracy and the totality of the acts performed by the offenders and other conspirators. His Honour, as earlier noted, also had regard to the quantity of cocaine imported. Although not decisive of the objective gravity of the offending, his Honour noted that the quantities involved were nonetheless an important feature to be taken into account. By reason of their respective roles, the applicants were said to have had direct knowledge of not only what was agreed to be imported but what was actually imported pursuant to the conspiracy (p 20).
	
	
	On the issue of the objective gravity of the offending, his Honour observed at p 23:
	


“In relation to the objective gravity I cannot, on the evidence differentiate between the two offenders. I consider the objective gravity of each to be equal to the other. It is a fact that Mr Mato has slightly more entitlement to leniency because of his slightly more favourable criminal antecedents. In relation to the dealing charges, the principal difference in criminality relates to the amount involved in each case.”


	
	His Honour determined that the criminality of the offending was at a very high level but declined to find that the conspiracy offence was a “worst case”, stating at p 23:
	


“… I do accept that the criminality is at a very high level, approaching worst case but not worst case.”


	
	His Honour also identified and considered relevant subjective factors. The applicant Mato’s criminal antecedents were taken into account, they involving, his Honour noted, very minor matters of assault and malicious damage. The applicant Rusu had convictions of supplying a prohibited drug and possession of prohibited drug. His Honour took into account the fact that the convictions in respect of those offences had occurred a long time before, namely, in 1997 and 1998, and that they were not “particularly significant matters”. He noted that the applicant Mato should be dealt with more favourably in those terms than the applicant Rusu: Remarks on Sentence at p 22.
	


Application for Leave to Appeal: Zoltan Mato

Ground 3.1: The sentences were manifestly excessive and were not ""just and appropriate"" to the totality of the offending behaviour


	
	The applicant, Zoltan Mato, relied upon written submissions dated 3 June 2011 and further written submissions dated 30 September 2015. Mr David Dalton SC appeared on his behalf in this application and made oral submissions.
	
	
	At the hearing of the application leave was sought and granted to file in court the affidavit of Lionel Peter Kramer sworn 1 October 2015. There was no objection to the affidavit being read in the event that this Court intervened and was required to re-sentence the applicant Mato.
	
	
	It was submitted on Mato’s behalf that the sentences imposed on him were manifestly excessive and were not ""just and appropriate"" in respect of the totality of the offending conduct, with reference made to Johnson v R (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at [18].
	
	
	The net effect of the sentences imposed on the two applicants was set out in a table included in the written submissions as follows:

	It was contended that the head sentence imposed with respect to the conspiracy count was excessive.
	
	
	It was initially submitted that in addition to the sentences being excessive, they were well outside of the range for offences of the same kind, and that his Honour failed to consider comparative sentences, though these submissions were withdrawn in the further written submissions.
	


Ground 3.2: The trial judge erred in not fully cumulating the sentences for the conspiracy and money laundering offences


	
	It was submitted that the sentencing judge erred in ordering:
	


“... the significantly larger conspiracy offences to commence at the end of the accumulation periods in the case of each appellant:

(a)   3 years and six months in the case of Mato; and,

(b)   2 years and nine months in the case of Rusu.”


	
	The period of accumulation was said to be erroneous having regard to the fact that the criminality associated with the conspiracy was one and the same as that involved in the money laundering offences in respect of monies dealt with during the period of the conspiracy. In that regard it was argued that there had existed “an overt act of conspiracy” pursuant to which the appellants received and dealt with the proceeds of their offending: Written Submissions for Mato at [364] – [365].
	
	
	In his oral submissions in relation to Grounds 3.1 and 3.2, Mr Dalton emphasised the importance of the question of accumulation: T 2-3. After citing well-established principles, it was submitted that the sentencing judge had made an error of the House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 kind and that as a consequence he adopted “… a far too high level of accumulation …: T 3:12. The submission continued:
	


“… indeed, the principal submission is that the criminality in relation to the conspiracy to import in fact subsumed the dealing offence in the manner in which this trial was run, in the particular circumstances of this trial.” (T 3:12-15)


	
	The money the subject of the “dealing” charges was said to have been “… an intrinsic part of the Crown case against the applicant in respect of the conspiracy to import”: T 3:35-37.
	
	
	In these circumstances it was argued the total accumulation of the sentences would not have involved the applicants receiving a discount in what was a case of multiple offending, with reference made to R v Knight (2005) 155 A Crim 252 at [112].
	
	
	It was further submitted that by failing to pay proper attention to the principle of totality, the overall sentence was ultimately a crushing one: R v MAK [2006] NSWCCA 381 at [17]; R v Rossi (1988) 142 LSJS 451 at 453.
	
	
	For those reasons, it was contended that even if the sentencing judge was not in error in respect of the head sentences imposed for the conspiracy count, the sentences for those counts should have been accumulated with the money laundering sentence such as to yield a non-parole period of two-thirds of the total sentence in each case: Written Submissions for Mato at [370].
	
	
	In the further submissions of 30 September 2015 the applicant Mato adopted the submissions made on behalf of the applicant Rusu in relation to grounds 3.1 and 3.2 as set out in paragraph 13 of the written submissions for Rusu dated 21 March 2014. Paragraph 13 of those submissions alleged a breach of the parity principle citing the High Court’s decisions in Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 and Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295, 339. The submission was that the applicant Mato had a “justified sense of grievance given the sentence imposed upon the co‑applicant and the principle of parity”. 
	
	
	The submission did not seek to advance a conventional ground based upon parity principles in relation to the sentencing of co-offenders, but to raise a very narrow point which was limited to an alleged failure to have “balanced out” the co‑offender Rusu’s prior criminal record involving drug offences. Given this somewhat unusual and limited point it is as well to set out in full the submissions made in relation to Ground 3.3 as follows:
	


“9.   … Whilst it is accepted it was appropriate to give the applicant a longer sentence for the dealing offence than Rusu given the applicant was found to have dealt with a greater sum of money, it is submitted any discrepancy in that regard should have been balanced out by Rusu’s prior criminal record involving drug offences.

10.   It is submitted in this regard that his Honour erred (at Remarks on Sentence … p 22.2) in finding that the offender Rusu’s convictions for supplying prohibited drug and possess prohibited drug were not particularly significant matters because they were a long time in the past, albeit being relevant in denying him [Rusu] leniency.

11.   It is submitted that the fact that an offender has prior drug offences when sentencing for significant drug offence (and dealing in the proceeds of same) is a significant matter in the sentencing process. Perhaps his Honour was distracted by the time lapse between those prior offences and the date of the sentencing proceedings when they were in fact only five and six years respectively prior in time to the actual commencement of the subject criminal activity the subject of the charges at the beginning of 2003.

12.   It is noted that his Honour did say at Remarks on Sentence … p 22.3 that these prior offences would mean that the applicant should be dealt with more favourably in those terms than Mr Rusu, but it is submitted that this is not borne out by the actual sentences imposed upon the dealing offence, even given the differing amounts of money involved with respect to the two offenders.

13.   Further, this was particularly apparent regarding the sentences imposed upon the conspiracy offence with respect to which his Honour found (at …23.3) that their objective criminality was equal to each other.

14.   His Honour therefore says that the applicant has ‘slightly more favourable antecedents’. It is submitted that it was an error and led to only a slight variation in the sentences accordingly as represented by a difference of only three (3) months, the applicant receiving a sentence of 26 years (9) months on the conspiracy count as opposed to 27 years for the co-applicant.”

Principles


	
	I set out below relevant principles concerning the exercise of this Court’s supervisory jurisdiction in appeals against sentence which may be summarised as follows:
	



	
	In sentencing appeals, this Court is reviewing the exercise of a discretionary judgment. It is not a re-hearing of the plea in mitigation: Romero v R [2011] VSCA 45; 206 A Crim R 519 at [11]; Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [81] per Johnson J.
	
	
	Sentence appeals are not the occasion for the revision and reformulation of the case presented below: Romero, supra, at [11].
	
	
	By reason of its supervisory role, this Court will not lightly entertain arguments that could have been, but were not, advanced on the plea: Romero at [11]; Zreika at [81].
	
	
	There is a need for exceptional circumstances before this Court will entertain arguments that could have been put but were not advanced on the plea: Zreika at [81]. Exceptional circumstances include those where it can be shown there was most compelling material available on the plea that was not used or understood and which demonstrates that there has been a miscarriage of justice arising from the plea and sentence: Romero at [11]. In this latter respect, Johnson J in Zreika, supra, at [82] further observed:
	


“In rare circumstances, a factor which may operate in mitigation of penalty (and which appears clearly from the material before the sentencing judge) may have been overlooked by defence counsel and the sentencing judge. In such a case, this Court may be invited to have regard to it, often in circumstances where the Crown will accept that the relevant material raised a factor which should unequivocally operate in the offender’s favour on sentence. As Warren CJ said in Bayram v The Queen ([2012] VSCA 6) at [29], it may ‘render a serious injustice’ if an offender was not able to correct the error in such a case. This approach reflects the primacy of the rule that appeal grounds should relate to arguments put, and decisions made, at first instance. At the same time, criminal appellate courts should be able to correct a miscarriage of justice, or serious injustice, in the clear and rare cases where the relevant matter has not been relied upon at first instance.”

Consideration of Ground 3.1: Manifest Excess


	
	The criminality of the conspiracy offence associated with the six importations referred to above at [14] was, as the sentencing judge stated, at a very high level approaching that of the worst case category.
	
	
	No challenge was made in the written or oral submissions for the applicant Mato to the relevant factual findings made by the sentencing judge and no submission was made that his Honour erred in the application of relevant sentencing principles.
	
	
	The submissions on sentence for the applicant Mato emphasised that Moradien and Sparos were “far bigger players”. No attempt was made before the sentencing judge to suggest that there was any relevant distinction to be made between Mato and Rusu.
	
	
	Whilst it was contended that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive, the contention was unsupported by reference to sentences imposed in comparable cases.
	
	
	The Crown prepared a schedule of comparative cases for the sentence hearing which was relied upon by it before the sentencing judge. The schedule of cases was not challenged. The Crown submitted that the schedule of cases established the contrary position to that argued for the applicant: Crown Submissions at [169].
	
	
	Mr Dalton in his oral submissions concentrated largely upon the issue of accumulation as the “principal ground” for the application.
	
	
	I do not consider that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. Each of the six importations was part of a carefully planned criminal enterprise involving very significant quantities of cocaine (at least 209 kilograms of the drug in total) imported into Australia from the United States. The six importations were undertaken between February 2005 and July/August 2006. As previously mentioned, the material facts concerning each importation were detailed in the Remarks on Sentence at pp 5-8.
	
	
	Although the applicant Mato had a modest legitimate source of income, he spent large sums of money (often in cash).
	
	
	He, as earlier noted at [14], dealt with proceeds of crime from the sale of cocaine in the order of $4 million. As previously stated, the sentencing judge determined:
	


“The offenders were also clearly motivated by financial gain and it is obvious that they were motived by greed, pure greed.” (ROS at p 18)


	
	His Honour also observed:
	


“the monies dealt with were the proceeds of the cocaine sales and sales made as a direct consequence of the conspiracy. The fact is that both offenders well knew the source of the money. I have regard, when looking at the objective gravity of the dealing offences, to the duration of the transactions, the timeframe in which the transactions occurred and particularly to the amount of money and property involved in the transactions. I appreciate that the amount in itself is not decisive as to criminality but it remains a very significant feature of the criminality.” (ROS at pp 18-19)


	
	His Honour also determined that both applicants were principals “in a sophisticated conspiracy”:
	


“… I find that the offenders in fact played a crucial role as principals in the organisation, and I accept the Crown written submissions as to the role they played and their role included the recruitment of others, particularly Stockwell, the provision of explicit instructions and the setting of timetables. They had clear knowledge of the role of others involved in the network. Their role involved frequent travel to the United States of America. Their role involved the control of the cocaine that was imported. It involved the payments of $1.4 million to Stockwell, and I have regard to the obvious financial benefits they received. I have regard to the duration and scope and high level of sophistication of the conspiracy.” (ROS pp 19-20)


	
	In addition, his Honour had regard to the number of persons involved in the combination, the extremely high level of organisation and the totality of the acts performed by the applicants and the other conspirators. In addition, his Honour had regard to the quantity of drugs involved and their direct knowledge of not only what was agreed to be imported but what was actually imported pursuant to “unrestrained greed” (ROS pp 20-21).
	
	
	His Honour further noted that there was no evidence of contrition by the applicants, nor was there any evidence of any acceptance by them of responsibility. He found that it was unlikely that either offender would re-offend by reason of his Honour’s proposal to impose a “deterrent sentence” (ROS p 21). He found that the prospects of rehabilitation of the applicants to be good (ROS p 21).
	
	
	His Honour then turned to consider the criminal antecedents of each of the applicants (ROS pp 21-22).
	
	
	On the basis of the matters set out above, in my opinion, the ground contending that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive is without merit. Ground 3.1 should be dismissed.
	


Consideration of Ground 3.2: The trial judge erred in not fully cumulating the sentences for the conspiracy and money laundering offences


	
	This ground (presumably intended as a submission that the sentences ought to have been made wholly concurrent), was based upon the contention that the criminality associated with the conspiracy “was one and the same as that which applied to the money laundering offences and was dealt with during the period of the conspiracy …”: Written Submissions for Mato at [365].
	
	
	As noted above, a similar ground was relied upon by the applicant Rusu. There is, in my opinion, no merit to this ground. Mr Dalton’s oral submission that the money involved in the money laundering offences was “an intrinsic part of the Crown case in respect to the conspiracy to import” does not, with respect, bring into account both the fact and the significance of the extensive activities of the applicants involved in the commission of the money laundering offences.
	
	
	The nature and scale of the activities undertaken in laundering the money generated by the importations of cocaine were significant. They were undertaken by each of the applicants. Though related to the monies generated by the conspiracy offence separately, there were a series of transactions and associated acts that constituted means by which the money laundering offences were committed.
	
	
	In that respect, both applicants paid large amounts of cash to Anthony Hogan. Those monies were then laundered through the business accounts of Terry Hogan Prestige Cars and paid to accounts nominated by the two applicants.
	
	
	As the Crown’s written submissions state at [117]:
	


“Between 13 July 2006 and 29 June 2007, the two applicants funnelled a total of $870,000 through the business of Terry Hogan Prestige Cars, $615,000 of which was ultimately paid into accounts nominated by the Applicant Mato.”


	
	Mato was party to a large number of transactions involving the purchase of motor vehicles from Terry Hogan Prestige Cars. These involved payments in cash. Eight cars were sold back to Terry Hogan Prestige Cars within a relatively short period of time. In relation to three of those vehicles, at the time of sale back, the applicant Mato received a greater amount of money than the amount originally paid for them. The inference the Crown relied upon was that some of these transactions were undertaken in order to launder money. The total amount of purchases was $1,568,740: Crown Submissions at [119].
	
	
	These matters, the Crown submitted, distinguished the applicants’ cases from Dela Cruz v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 333; Thorn v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 294 and Nahlous v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 58; 77 NSWLR 463, each of which is discussed below at [115]-[122]. As the Crown correctly observed in her oral submissions, the laundering of the money was effected by the applicants “hiding it, changing the source etc”: T 21:10-12.
	
	
	The conduct of the applicants in relation to the money laundering accordingly involved added criminality over and above the conspiracy offence. The Crown properly acknowledged that there was overlap between the conspiracy offence and the money laundering offences a fact recognised by the substantial concurrency of the sentences: T 21:15-20.
	
	
	The extent of concurrency, as the Crown observed, was a matter for evaluation by the sentencing judge. His Honour was alert to that fact and allowed for the “overlap”. I accept the Crown’s submissions that additional criminality attached to the money laundering offences over and above that involved in the conspiracy offence. The extent of concurrency and accumulation were matters for assessment and evaluation by the sentencing judge. No error, latent or patent, was established as to the level of concurrency and accumulation determined in respect of the sentences imposed.
	
	
	In my opinion there is no merit to Ground 3.2 and it should be dismissed.
	


Consideration of Ground 3.3: Parity


	
	As noted above, the parity argument was based on a claimed need for the sentencing judge to have offset Rusu’s criminal record as against the fact of the applicant Mato having dealt with a greater sum of laundered money than the applicant Rusu. The failure to have done so is said to have constituted an error.
	
	
	It has been observed in a number of cases that this Court will be cautious before determining that one co-offender has a justifiable sense of grievance where the same judge has sentenced each. The various authorities are gathered in Loader v R; Dunn v R [2013] NSWCCA 215 at [91]-[96]. The present case differs from many parity cases by reason of the fact that the “grievance” arises in respect of one aspect of the sentencing exercise, namely, the extent of the significance attached by the sentencing judge to Rusu’s past offending, in a case in which there was no dispute but that their roles in the criminal conspiracy offence were indistinguishable.
	
	
	Criticism was directed at the “finding” made by the sentencing judge in relation to the convictions of the applicant Rusu for prior offences, being one offence of supplying a prohibited drug and another offence of possess prohibited drug. The criticism was that the “finding” of the sentencing judge in respect of these two offences was that they were not particularly significant matters because they were a long time in the past, although they were held to be relevant in denying him leniency. Such offences were said to have in fact been “significant” in the sentencing process: Further Written Submissions for Mato at [11]. For reasons discussed below, I disagree with that submission.
	
	
	The sentencing judge had evidence as to Rusu’s prior convictions for the two drug offences. The question is whether, as contended for the applicant Mato, though Mato dealt with a greater amount of money than Rusu, that fact should have been counter‑balanced taking into account Rusu’s prior offences.
	
	
	The Crown responded to the applicant’s submissions on parity by observing that it was not suggested at the sentence hearing that the role of the applicant in relation to the conspiracy offence was in any way distinguishable.
	
	
	The significance to be attached to the past offending by Rusu was a matter of evaluation and the weight to be attached to it was an issue that was encompassed in the sentencing discretion. No error of fact or of principle was identified in the submissions for the applicant Mato in terms of his Honour’s conclusion as to the significance of Rusu’s past drug offences.
	
	
	It is to be noted that Rusu’s prior drug offences were at the very low end of offences involving the supply and possession of a prohibited drug. His criminal history included the following particulars of offence and sentence:
	



	
		
			
			5/12/1997
			
			
			Supply Prohibited Drug
			
			
			Community Service Order without Cond: 100 hours (DTBD)
			
		
		
			
			5/12/1997
			
			
			Possess Prohibited Drug
			
			
			Fine: $400 costs – court: $51 (DTBD)
			
		
	



	
	The Remarks on Sentence establish that the sentencing judge gave specific attention to Rusu’s criminal history and undertook an assessment as to the significance, if any, to be attached to it. Although his Honour concluded that his prior offences did not entitle him to leniency, it was not thereby incumbent upon the judge to have concluded that the prior offences called for or required some counter‑balancing as contended for in this application.
	
	
	It is to be noted that the submissions in relation to what was styled a “parity” point failed to identify any error or misapplication of principle based on parity or other grounds. As earlier discussed, his Honour carefully evaluated the role and activities of each of the applicants. Whilst the applicant Rusu’s prior convictions were noted by the sentencing judge to have occurred “a long time ago”, his Honour’s observation that “they are not particularly significant matters” has not, in my opinion, been established as erroneous in any material respect. The Remarks on Sentence at p 22 also indicate that his Honour was mindful of the fact that the applicant Mato had a more favourable prior history and took that into account as but one of a number of matters to be considered before determining the sentences to be imposed.
	
	
	I do not consider there is any substance in this ground. Ground 3.2 should accordingly be dismissed.
	


Application for Leave to Appeal: Marius Rusu

Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in the assessment of the seriousness of the offences committed by the applicant

Ground 2: A miscarriage of justice resulted from disparity of sentence

Applicant’s Submissions


	
	Grounds 1 and 2 for the applicant Rusu, it was stated, could be considered together. I proceed upon that basis.
	
	
	The applicant’s submissions asserted error insofar as the sentencing judge equated the seriousness of the offence committed by the applicant as at the same level as the offending conduct of the applicant Mato. This argument rested upon a contention that Mato was at a higher level in the hierarchy than the applicant, that is to say, that Mato was the “boss” whereas the applicant Rusu was said to be “Mato’s lieutenant”.
	
	
	This submission brought forward particular issues and contentions concerning the role that each had in the commission of the conspiracy offence.
	
	
	The differences between the applicant Rusu and the applicant Mato were said to be such that the objective seriousness of their respective criminality was not at the same level.
	
	
	I note that notwithstanding the absence of any submission or contention at the sentence hearing to that effect, it is clear from the Remarks on Sentence that his Honour nonetheless was conscious of the fact that he was required to assess the objective seriousness of the offence vis-à-vis each applicant. Having done so, his Honour in that respect concluded:
	


“In relation to the objective gravity I cannot, on the evidence, differentiate between the two offenders. I consider the objective gravity of each to be equal to the other ….” (Remarks on Sentence at p 23)


	
	Plainly his Honour assessed the objective gravity of the conspiracy offence of each offender before determining that the gravity of their offending was equal. As indicated above, no submission was made for the applicant Rusu to the sentencing judge either to the effect that Rusu’s particular role in the conspiracy was at a different level (that is, at a lower level) than that of the applicant Mato, or that, on the evidence, the objective gravity of the applicant’s offence should be found to have been less than that of his co-offender, Mato.
	
	
	In oral submissions Mr Odgers SC, for Mr Rusu, acknowledged that in this application he was required to confront the difficulty that the submissions for his client at the sentencing hearing did not raise or contend for such a “difference” in the respective positions of the two applicants.
	
	
	Mr Odgers addressed Grounds 1 and 2 together. He noted that if the applicant failed on Ground 1 (assessment of the seriousness of the offences), then Ground 2 (the parity ground) would also fail.
	
	
	Mr Odgers accepted that it was open to conclude that his client had been actively involved in the conspiracy and had obtained large amounts of money from it. However, it was argued that the applicant Rusu was the one who generally performed tasks such as maintaining phone contact with Stockwell, making money payments and giving Stockwell amounts of cocaine. The applicant Mato on the other hand, it was contended, was “plainly” higher in the hierarchy than the applicant: Written Submissions for Rusu at [9]. There was said to be evidence of Stockwell that pointed to Mato being the “boss” and that Rusu was his “lieutenant”. The only matters relied upon to support this contention were the following matters set out in the written submissions with references to evidence given at the applicants’ trial by Matthew Stockwell:
	


“-   Stockwell ‘always thought Dan was the boss’ (T 199.15) although there was one occasion where he saw Mato and the applicant arguing and the applicant [Rusu] appeared to ‘lay down the law to’ Mato – a subsequent conversation indicated that the applicant had concerns about Sparos and Moradien (T 199.30).

Stockwell told Sparos and Moradien that Mato had told him that ‘he was the boss’ (T 254.32). Sparos told Stockwell that it was Mato who worked for them (T 254.32, see also 250.17).

In conversations between Stockwell, Mato and Rusu, it was contended that it was usually Mato who did the talking about the importation of drugs (see T 152.50-153.25, 167.45, 168.15, 190, 197.45-198.20, 199-200).

Significant decisions were made by Mato and not the applicant (see, for example, T 156.30, 238.28).

When Stockwell spoke to the applicant alone, the applicant Rusu would not make decisions and indicated that Stockwell should speak to Mato (see, for example, 238.35).

Mato would give instructions to the applicant (see, for example, T 187.50-188.1, 199.28).”


	
	It was submitted that these differences between the applicant Rusu and Mato “required the judge to find the objective seriousness of their criminality was not at the same level”: Written Submissions for Rusu at [11].
	
	
	In his oral submissions, Mr Odgers frankly conceded that, in the absence of any submissions having been made to the sentencing judge which sought to differentiate the objective criminality of the applicant Rusu from that of the applicant Mato, there was difficulty in now pursuing such a line of argument. In that respect he observed:
	


“Of course the argument against me will be well [the sentencing judge] wasn’t taken to that material and it may well be that makes it hard for me to show error if it’s not something that’s pushed hard, pushed before him, to say well you should take it into account and if it wasn’t done then it’s difficult for me perhaps to persuade this Court he should have taken that material into account.

But I will make the submission on the basis he heard the trial and he heard all the evidence and in my submission there was considerable evidence pointing to the conclusion that the applicant was under the instructions of Mato, that Mato was from his point of view the boss.” (T 11:19-30)


	
	Mr Odgers submitted:
	


“My submission is that this Court would not apply a sort of quasi Rule 4 type proposition that the applicant is cut out from a submission that he was inappropriately dealt with as effectively a general, as distinct from somebody lower down the hierarchy.” (T 10)


	
	Mr Odgers formulated the following four points in the course of his oral submissions:
	



	
	The sentencing judge sought to look for reasons to treat the applicants separately and in the absence of any material in that regard, he treated them both as principals. It was submitted that this involved an erroneous approach as the onus was on the Crown in relation to what was asserted to be “an aggravating factor” – that the Crown had the onus of proving beyond reasonable doubt that Rusu was a principal.
	
	
	If the applicant was unsuccessful in establishing error in terms of point (1) above, then it was argued that the sentencing judge failed to take into account relevant factors, namely, the type of matters referred to in para [9] of the applicant’s written submissions (being the matters extracted in para [87] above).
	
	
	That in light of the material summarised in [9] of his client’s written submissions, the conclusion that he was a principal at the same level as Mato was unreasonable in the sense of House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499.
	
	
	In relation to an offence involving a conspiracy to import drugs, whilst it is relevant to look at what was done by the parties to it, at the end of the day it is well-established that the offender’s position in the hierarchy is certainly a relevant, and indeed an important consideration in determining the objective seriousness of the offence, the culpability of the offender, and the appropriate penalty: T 11.
	



	
	It was submitted that the sentencing judge focussed exclusively on what the two applicants did in terms of their conduct. That was said to have run the risk of falling into error in failing to make an assessment of whether or not there is evidence raising a doubt on the question, “Was one of them effectively giving instructions to the other?”: T 11-12.
	


Crown Submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that Ground 1 is to be considered in light of the matters established in evidence as to the modus operandi of each of the importations and the defence case at trial, reproduced above at [14].
	
	
	The Crown noted that at the sentence hearing (T 30 July 2010 at p 11) counsel for Rusu submitted that the importations (apart from the third importation) were undertaken:
	


“… at the behest of others that seemed to have other more responsible jobs certainly in finance and the like, the spectre of that is apparent but what’s really troubling for your Honour when your Honour determines as your Honour’s focus should be, what did these two men actually do. It is still relevant to consider whether it was doing it [sic] at their own behest as generals or doing it still with some relevant connection to the real generals and acting merely as lieutenants.”


	
	In this Court it was noted by Ms Abraham QC for the Crown that there was no submission made to the sentencing judge on behalf of the applicant Rusu as to the existence of any basis upon which “… to legitimately distinguish between the two”: T 22:8-12.
	
	
	The Crown’s written submissions identified the facts and circumstances referred to in the Statement of Facts and Circumstances dated 1 June 2010 which was relied upon by the Crown before the sentencing judge and which was said to be relevant to the sentencing of both applicants. In this Court the Crown submitted that the activities detailed in the Statement of Facts and Circumstances were activities carried out in partnership between the applicants. In that respect the Crown submitted:
	


“What is clear, when one is reading the evidence is that they are both involved. They are invariably together, although not always. Sometimes Mr Stockwell would give evidence that if it was one or other of them did something, can’t remember if it was Rusu or Mato. It’s because they were ordinarily there and one or other of them would do it because they were working together, in my respectful submission, in partnership.

In our submission, the application of legal principles by his Honour in making the findings he did, are unimpeachable as are the findings themselves. What has now been put is argument on appeal for the first time relying on a few page references for which it [is] said one is higher than the other, a point not taken by the counsel who had argued it below.” (T 23:4-150).


	
	The Crown submitted that the particular matters relied upon at the page references set out in [9] of the submissions for the applicant Rusu in relation to the present application, do not support the proposition that Mato was clearly the boss, or somehow more senior and that Rusu was the lieutenant: T 23. The Crown submitted:
	


“… In fact, as my friend properly concedes, nowhere in the evidence does Mr Stockwell say, ‘I was told by Mr Mato that he was the boss’ which you’d expect if it was that sort of relationship. It wasn’t that sort of relationship. My friend says there’s instances of instructions being given, top of p 4. He gives two examples. One assumes with respect, these are the high points because this is what he is bringing to the Court’s attention …” (T 23:19-25)


	
	In relation to the first two references contained in [9] of the submissions for Rusu, Ms Abraham submitted that the particular instances referred to in that paragraph are good examples of the care required to be taken, in hindsight, after the trial has happened, in making an argument based on an interpretation of facts that was not relied upon below: T 23:35-40
	
	
	It was submitted for the Crown that the references relied upon in [9] of the written submissions for Rusu must be considered in their proper context.
	


Consideration: Grounds 1 and 2


	
	The only evidence, Mr Odgers conceded, which was relied upon for the proposition that Mato was “the boss” were the references to the evidence extracted in paragraph [87] above. These included what Stockwell is alleged to have said to others as to who he, Stockwell, thought was “the boss” and what Stockwell allegedly told Sparos and Moradien on that aspect. That, however, was not evidence that proved the fact of whether Mato was in fact the “boss”. The other matters relied upon in paragraph [87] were at best equivocal and not determinative of whether Mato was at a higher level in the criminal enterprise. The failure of counsel for the applicant Rusu to pursue such a proposition at the sentence hearing is readily understandable. The evidence was not directed at establishing a relevant distinction as to the “role” played by each offender.
	
	
	This is entirely consistent with the assessment formed by the sentencing judge, namely, that there was no basis to make a distinction in their roles or more particularly as to the respective gravity of their offending conduct. They were both highly active participants in a significant criminal conspiracy performing a range of functions consistent with them acting as joint participants or partners in the criminal importation. In my opinion, no error has been established in the findings made by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	The evidence does not, in my assessment, establish that the applicant Mato was at a higher level in the “hierarchy” than the applicant. In particular, the evidence does not support the submission that there were relevant differences between the applicants Rusu and Mato which required the sentencing judge to find that the objective seriousness of their criminality was not at the same level. I accept, as submitted by the Crown, that, in essence, the two applicants acted together in the conspiracy to import a border controlled drug, cocaine, as equal partners.
	
	
	On this basis leave to appeal in relation to Ground 1 should be refused. As earlier noted, it was accepted by Mr Odgers that the outcome in relation to Ground 2 was dependent upon the outcome of Ground 1. Leave to appeal in respect of Ground 2 should be refused.
	


Ground 3: The sentencing judge erred in applying the totality principle

Applicant’s Submissions


	
	Mr Odgers in his written submissions noted that the proceeds of crime offence added 2 years 9 months to the overall non-parole period and sentence imposed on his client: Written Submissions for Rusu at [12].
	
	
	He submitted that it was unreasonable (in the House v The King, supra sense) to impose that level of partial accumulation in the circumstances of this case. This submission was based upon the contention that the criminality involved in the conspiracy offence very largely comprehended the criminality of the proceeds of crime offence. It was observed in this respect that the sentencing judge accepted that all the proceeds came from the conspiracy to which the applicant and Mato were party: Written Submissions for Rusu at [13]. It was further submitted that a lesser degree of partial accumulation should have been adopted: Written Submissions for Rusu at [13].
	
	
	Mr Odgers submitted, in essence, that if the applicants had simply been dealing with money, that is, moving money made from the importation of cocaine, then there was a real issue of principle as to avoiding “double counting”: T 17:40-45. He submitted that it was inherent in the commission of the “importation offence” that it “necessarily reflected the large amount of drugs, the large amount of money that flowed from the drugs and the bribery involved in respect of services provided by Stockwell”: T 18:1-5.
	
	
	On this basis it was submitted that the degree of partial accumulation was “grossly excessive”. The submission in this respect was sought to be supported by reference to the decisions of this Court in Thorn v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 294; Nahlous v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 58; 77 NSWLR 463 and Dela Cruz v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 333.
	


Crown Submissions


	
	The Crown responded in its written submissions at [181] that the applicant’s submissions appeared to accept that it was open for there to be some degree of accumulation of the sentences and accordingly Ground 3 involved a question as to the degree of accumulation. In other words, the Crown observed that it was not suggested that the criminality of the proceeds offence was wholly subsumed by the conspiracy offence.
	
	
	The Crown also observed that the applicant did not contend that the sentencing judge, in determining the extent of accumulation of the sentences, had incorrectly applied relevant legal principles. Rather, the complaint was with the result: Crown Submissions at [182].
	
	
	The Crown additionally relied upon its written submissions at [171]-[174] made in respect of the applicant Mato in relation to the applicant Rusu.
	
	
	The principle of totality was the subject of consideration by Howie J in Cahyadi v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 at [27]. His Honour there observed:
	


“… there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common features, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.”


	
	There was, no doubt, a degree of commonality in the circumstances of the offending as the sentencing judge himself recognised and stated. The sentencing exercise required the imposition of sentences that reflected the criminality involved in each offence and for a determination then to be made as to the extent of accumulation that was just and appropriate. This is what his Honour expressly did in the passage extracted above at [24].
	
	
	His Honour noted at p 23:
	


“… I have heard differing submissions as to what I do in terms of the discrete sentences, concurrent sentences and accumulation. It seems to me that on any view there is a serious and separate criminality involved and there must be a degree of [partial] accumulation. I have been provided with numerous comparative cases, and I accept that those matters are of general assistance and may be taken into account in a general way. The fact remains that each case must be dealt with on its own merits having regard to the peculiar subjective and objective features and that is what I am not [sic] required to do, although I have some general regard to the comparative cases that I have been provided with.”

Consideration: Ground 3


	
	At the outset, I do not, with respect, consider that the judgments in the cases mentioned above at [65] and [107] (Thorn, Nahlous and Dela Cruz) provide guidance in the circumstances surrounding and constituting the money laundering activities of the applicants.
	
	
	In Nahlous, the applicant was sentenced in respect of a number of offences. These included six offences contrary to ss 135ASB(1) and 135ASC(1) of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) (the “decoder offences”) concerning the sale of, or offer to sell, unauthorised decoders. A decoder is a device that enables the owner to obtain paid television services without paying a subscription fee to a service provider.
	
	
	The applicant was also charged and pleaded guilty to an offence contrary to s 400.6(1) of the Criminal Code 1995. In that respect he sold to an undercover police officer fifty decoders and received payment of $15,000 in cash.
	
	
	In the course of the decision of the Court (McClellan CJ at CL, Howie and Rothman JJ) it was stated:
	


“16.   In the present case we can see no justification whatever for the applicant being charged with the code offence. In relation to the fifty decoders the criminality was in the sale as a result of which the owners of the services were deprived of their financial entitlement to rental charges for their use. The concept of a ‘sale’ necessarily involves the seller obtaining some financial gain from the transaction. The receipt of the money was merely an element of the offence under s 135ASB(1).”


	
	In Dela Cruz, the applicant was sentenced in respect of two separate charges of obtaining a financial advantage by deception on specified dates contrary to s 178BA(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. She had also been charged with an offence of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime contrary to s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	In Dela Cruz, the applicant had devised a scheme whereby monies of her employer were transferred to her own bank account.
	
	
	In that case no question was raised that the prosecution of the relevant activities as separate offences was oppressive. The issue was whether or not there should have been any accumulation of the sentence for the offence.
	
	
	Reference was made in that case to the decision in Thorn v R, supra, where the Court was dealing with a case where the accused had been charged with fraud offences under the Commonwealth Criminal Code and also with a count of dealing with the proceeds of crime contrary to s 400.4(1) of the Code. The Court in Thorn (Howie J) had observed at [27]:
	


“This was an unusual use of a money laundering offence. To the extent that there was an overlap with the fraud offences the charge represented the use of the funds that had been dishonestly obtained under those offences. The criminality was very much in the obtaining of the funds not in their use.”


	
	In Dela Cruz the criminality involved in the charges was, significantly, the fraudulent obtaining of significant amounts of money, a large part of which had not been recovered. The activity had involved a considerable level of planning and sophistication in obtaining the money. It was held that an additional penalty was not appropriate in respect of the charge of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime in that case. The applicant had simply gained access to the funds the subject of the fraud: see Dela Cruz at [19].
	
	
	In the present case, as I have stated, the facts are very different from the abovementioned cases.
	
	
	The Crown’s written submissions provide a detailed summary of the modus operandi employed in the money laundering activities at [116]-[144].
	
	
	As has been mentioned in relation to the applicant Mato’s grounds of appeal, that summary indicates that the applicants paid large amounts of cash to Anthony Hogan which was then laundered through the business accounts of Terry Hogan Prestige Cars and then paid to bank accounts nominated by the applicants. Between 13 July 2006 and 29 June 2007, the applicants funnelled a total of $870,000 through the business account of Terry Hogan Prestige Cars, $615,000 of which was ultimately paid into the accounts nominated by Mato.
	
	
	In addition, there was the purchase of a large number of motor vehicles from Terry Hogan Prestige Cars, paid for wholly in cash or at least in substantial cash amounts, a number of which were subsequently sold back to Terry Hogan Prestige Cars within a relatively short period.
	
	
	The detailed facts and circumstances concerning the money laundering activities accordingly revealed a sophisticated plan involving a number of activities carried out in order to “launder” cash monies received from the sale of cocaine.
	
	
	The applicants’ cases are plainly distinguishable on substantive grounds from the cases (referred to above) relied upon by the applicant, Rusu. Whilst, as the sentencing judge observed, there was some commonality between the conspiracy offence and the dealing charges, there was a sound basis for the sentencing judge’s determination as to the accumulation of sentences in this case. No factual error or error of principle has been identified in the applicant’s submissions in that respect.
	
	
	Ground 3 should accordingly be dismissed.
	
	
	The orders I propose are:
	


Application by Zoltan Mato:


	
	Leave to appeal be granted.
	
	
	The appeal be dismissed.
	


Application by Marius Rusu:

(1)   Leave to appeal against sentence on Grounds 1 and 2 be refused.

(2)   Leave to appeal against sentence on Ground 3 be granted.

(3)   Appeal dismissed.


	
	CAMPBELL J: I agree with the orders proposed by Hall J for disposition of each of these applications. I also agree with his Honour’s reasons for the orders proposed.
	
	
	Mr Odgers SC argued on behalf of Mr Rusu that it was for the Crown to prove his client’s actual role in the conspiracy beyond reasonable doubt because characterisation of his part as that of a principal is “a matter that aggravates, because it tends to point to a higher sentence” (15.45T).
	
	
	The only rule is that established in The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 adopting the principle expressed in R v Storey [1998] 1 VR 359; 89 A Crim R 519 at 531:
	


[a sentencing judge] may not take facts into account in a way that is adverse to the interests of the accused unless those facts have been established beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, if there are circumstances which the judge proposes to take into account in favour of the accused, it is enough if those circumstances are proved on the balance of probabilities. [original emphasis]


	
	However, as the majority judgment in Olbrich demonstrates there is no general rule that “identification of the precise nature of [an] accused’s involvement” in drug importation “is an essential aspect of the sentencing process” (Olbrich at 277 [13]). This is not to say that when sentencing co‑offenders differentiation of roles, where the evidence permits such differentiation is not permissible or useful: Olbrich at 278 [14].
	
	
	Where this is possible on the evidence the onus may vary from case to case. It may possibly shift. Where the prosecution wish to persuade the judge that an offender is worthy of a heavier sentence because he had a more senior role in a criminal hierarchy than a co-accused, it will carry the onus of proving those facts beyond reasonable doubt. Where an offender wishes to persuade the judge that his role was more junior to others entitling him to a lesser sentence, he will carry the onus on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	In the circumstances of the present case where the offender Rusu wishes to establish (for the first time on appeal) that he had a more junior role to his co-offender, Mato, he carried the onus of establishing that. For the reasons given by Hall J, he failed in that endeavour.
	
	
	The important point in the circumstances of the present case is it was not necessary for the Crown to prove facts that put Rusu into a particular category. It was enough for the Crown to prove what he did.

2702245,R v FAHMY [2015] NSWDC 382,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: I propose to sentence you to 18 months imprisonment. That sentence will date on my calculation from 8 August 2015 and in relation to that sentence I propose to fix a non parole period of 6 months which will date from 8 August 2015 and expire on 7 February 2016.
	
	
	Amin Fahmy appears today for sentence in relation to an offence of ongoing supply of a prohibited drug to whit methylamphetamine, a crime committed by him between 22 May 2013 and 30 May 2013 at Bankstown for financial reward. This is a charge brought contrary to s 21A(1) Drugs, Misuse and Trafficking Act 1995 and carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. There is no standard non parole period. There is provision for a fine of up to 3,500 penalty units.
	
	
	The prisoner was convicted of that charge after trial. The Crown had charged him with the principal charge, as I will call it, and alternative counts of supplying the individual supplies that constitute the three supplies that give rise to the charge under s 25A. The jury’s verdict of guilty on the principal account thus required no consideration of the alternative counts.
	
	
	The three supplies, the subject of the indictment, occurred on 23, 27 and 29 May at Bankstown. The individual supplies relate to very small quantities almost, but not quite, the smallest quantities that could be individually supplied, in my experience. The quantities in question, taking the information from the analyst’s certificate, were 0.16 grams, 0.14 grams and 0.12 grams. In drug parlance a point is point one of a gram, and although there Is a degree of inexactitude in supplying prohibited drugs, and no doubt a deal of “cheating” by suppliers in the provision of drugs to their customers, generally speaking one would find in most instances the minimum quantity that would be provided of a particular prohibited drug such as methylamphetamine in an individual supply would be around about what is described as a “point”, occasionally half a point.
	
	
	The purity of each particular quantity was respectively 78.5%, 76.5% and 75%, and comment is made in the submissions, both written and oral, about the significance of the percentage purity. I will come back to that shortly.
	
	
	At the time of the commission of the offence the prisoner was quite young, he was 18 years and between eight and nine months.
	
	
	In relation to the issue of the high percentage of purity clearly in drug supply matters, as we see them in this Court, ranging from matters of grams, or points of a gram, up to many hundreds of kilograms, the issue of percentage has varying significance. When the quantities of the prohibited drugs, or border controlled drugs, are to be measured in multiple grams, ounces and/or kilograms the high percentage speaks of quantities of drug that would be cut eventually for further on-going supply in larger and larger quantities.
	
	
	In relation to this, quantities are so small there would be little opportunity for cutting, and it is clear on the basis of the transcripts of the conversations between the prisoner and the undercover officer, that the quantities that the prisoner was supplying - accepting as I do that he himself did not know the purity of the drugs, and certainly did not know the precise percentage purity of the drugs - were intended in the course of supply for the use of the person posing as a legitimate purchaser. Of course the purchaser was an undercover operative, but he held out that he was going to use the drugs for himself and in fact made comments about the quality of the drugs that he had previously been provided.
	
	
	Thus, in the context of considering this category of offence by reference solely to the issue of quantity which is not the only measure of objective seriousness, one would have great difficulty finding an objectively less serious offence. I have had some isolated cases of smaller quantities but rarely is it so. Normally one is dealing with multiple grams, or, in the case of MDMA and MDA, many dozens or hundreds of tablets and pills being provided on each occasion. The facts of the cases that have been decided in the supposedly “comparative” cases, and other cases to which I can refer, both at first instance and on appeal, reflect this to be so.
	
	
	In relation to the issue of purity, coming back to that issue again, I do note of course that we are seeing in this Court consistently, particularly over the last four or five years, massively increased levels of purity, not only in relation to methylamphetamine, but in relation to amphetamine-type drugs in tablet form. It is quite shocking nowadays to see MDMA in tablet form consistently with percentages of purity above 60%.
	
	
	Ten years ago I conducted a trial involving the importation into this country of a million MDMA tablets from Holland, at the time I understand it was the largest seizure of MDMA tablets manufactured overseas. The average percentage purity of the tablets imported from Holland was somewhere between 24% and 26%. It is little wonder - although this is not an MDMA case - that we are seeing distressingly cases of people becoming seriously ill and in fact dying at particular venues having ingested what they believe to be MDMA, or MDA, when the percentage of purity is so high.
	
	
	In any event there is no doubt, of course, that this prisoner is not responsible either for the manufacture of the drug with which I am concerned, or the importation of the drug with which I am concerned. Making the assumption that these high levels of purity arise because of the quality of the prohibited drug primarily coming out of China in methylamphetamine form, or better methods of manufacture in Australia as is evidenced from time to time.
	
	
	There are some other features of the facts that need to be noted, and are reflected in part in some of the written submissions that have been put to me, particularly in the Crown’s written submission. The prisoner, in committing the offence, the particular supplies with which I am concerned, was using a motor vehicle and a mobile phone service which was involved in other drug supplies involving other people.
	
	
	The background to the arrest of this prisoner, although this information is somewhat general because I have not been given the full details of the effectiveness of this operation, was that this prisoner’s arrest occurred when police were conducting an extensive operation in what I understand to be the Bankstown area and nearby, which ran for a number of months. Apparently a large number of people, although I have not been given the precise details of this, were detected supplying prohibited drugs usually, as I would understand the matter, to undercover officers such as the undercover officer in this case. As I understand the matter the particular motor vehicle driven by the prisoner had been used in other supplies by other suppliers.
	
	
	The supplies by the prisoner occurred generally in a car park of a shopping centre in the Bankstown area, after the prisoner had been contacted using the mobile phone service to which I have referred, a number that was obviously made available to the undercover officer from previous investigations. It is clear from the character of the trial, and specifics of the charge brought against this particular prisoner, that whatever number of supplies were detected by police, this prisoner was implicated in three of them in the period of time over approximately eight or nine days covered in the facts to which I have referred.
	
	
	I am quite satisfied that the prisoner was a runner for others. Such profit as would have been made for the prisoner - although there is no clear evidence as to what he received - would have been limited. The undercover officer paid in total $300 for the three quantities of methylamphetamine, although on occasions he was given up to $120 in what is sometimes called ‘buy money’. There is a recording available, presented at trial, in relation to each of the transactions during which there was the usual buy and sell banter between drug supplier and purchaser. Some of the comments made by the prisoner reflected a knowledge of the character of the drug and its use.
	
	
	It should be said the Crown case against the prisoner was completely overwhelming. Of course the prisoner was fully entitled to defend the charge. He cannot be penalised for defending the charge. But, of course, there is no evidence on his part of any contrition that can be safely acted upon. As I understand the matter the basis upon which he defended the charge was that he could not remember at least one of the three transactions that were proven by the prosecution.
	
	
	This seems to me, with the greatest of respect to the prisoner, a very specious basis for defending the charge when one considers both the circumstantial and direct evidence is overwhelming that the undercover operator on the three separate occasions was clearly dealing with the same person. So whether the prisoner could remember a particular transaction or not to my mind was neither here nor there. People every day in courts across this State and across the Commonwealth of Australia plead guilty to crimes that they claim that they have no “memory” of, for good reason.
	
	
	In any event I bear in mind that the drugs were intercepted by police and did not make their way into the general community, although that was not the prisoner’s intention. I do not accept, for what it is worth, that the prisoner was incompetently represented at his trial. In my view his learned counsel at trial did her very best in very difficult circumstances.
	
	
	It is conceded in the submissions of learned counsel for the prisoner - if I could deal with that - that there is no suggestion of “entrapment”. The prisoner was approached and was willing to provide the drugs that were ultimately supplied. He was clearly a willing participant in the specific supplies with which I am concerned.
	
	
	As I pointed out, as at May 2013 the prisoner was between 18 years and eight or nine months. He was born, as I understand it, on 1 September 1994. He was born in Egypt. His family are members of the Coptic Christian community in New South Wales. He came to Australia as a young boy and there are details about his family life, both in Egypt and Australia, in the history that he gave to the psychologist which I have taken into account.
	
	
	His criminal history shows that at the age of 15, particularly in the years 2010 through to 2011, that is between the ages of 15 and 17, there was an intense period of offending, and serious offending it was too. I am mindful of the fact that the matters were ultimately disposed of in the Children’s Court but they are not entirely irrelevant of course in sentencing.
	
	
	On 10 January 2010 he committed the offences of robbery in company, receiving stolen or unlawfully obtained property, and on 7 January 2010 he apparently committed the offence of dealing with property suspected to be the proceeds of crime, and he received various probations in relation to that matter. Those orders were made in July 2011 in the Children’s Court. But in December 2011 he was called up in the Children’s Court in relation to at least one of those probations when apparently it was revoked or altered.
	
	
	On 25 March 2010 he committed the offences of resisting a police officer on two occasion in the execution of his or her duty, and the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In respect of those offences he received probations in the Children’s Court.
	
	
	He was charged again in relation to offences committed only days later on 30 March 2010 of resisting a police officer in the execution of his duty and received a short period of probation.
	
	
	On 22 August 2010 he committed the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He also failed to comply with a bail order at a later time and in July 2011 was sentenced to a one month control order. He was back before the Children’s Court on the same date in respect of offences committed at a later time, that is on 10 November 2010, including resisting a police officer in the execution of his duty, intimidating a police officer in the execution of his or her duty, and using offensive language near a school or public place.
	
	
	In relation to those offences he was apparently granted what appeared to be either good behaviour bonds, or short periods of control order. His appeals against the severity of those sentences were dismissed.
	
	
	On 11 December 2010 he apparently committed the offences of contravening an apprehended domestic violence order, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and was sentenced to periods of detention, that is by way of a control order, under the auspices of the Juvenile Justice Department. He again appealed against those orders and those appeals were dismissed in the District Court.
	
	
	I must say, although I have pointed out the dates of those matters as they are particularised in the criminal history, many of those matters were dealt with on 4 July 2011.
	
	
	On 19 October 2011 he was charged in relation to an offence apparently committed on 26 September 2011 of breaking and entering, and stealing from a dwelling house. For that offence he was sentenced to a nine month control order with a minimum period of three months, when he appeared at the Parramatta Children’s Court on 21 December 2011.
	
	
	There was another offence dealt with at the same time of breaking, entering and stealing, an offence committed on 5 October 2011, for which he received a 12 month control order with a minimum term of three months.
	
	
	On 10 December 2012 he was convicted in the Local Court of driving whilst suspended and placed on a s 10 bond for a period of two years in respect of that particular offence.
	
	
	The Crown’s cover sheet indicates that in respect of two separate occurrences, at the time of the commission of the offence with which I am concerned, he was subject to two s 10 bonds. Thus, the offence with which I am concerned was committed in part whilst on conditional liberty. That is obviously an aggravating factor in sentencing in this matter that arises for consideration pursuant to s 21A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, hereinafter I shall refer to as the Act.
	
	
	In relation to his record since the commission of the offence with which I am concerned apparently on 26 June 2013 he was required to appear at court in relation to contravening an apprehended domestic violence order, which was dismissed pursuant to s 10. I am assuming that was a relatively minor matter. He was again before the Courts on 24 August 2013 in relation to driving whilst suspended and given a s 9 bond for a period of 12 months.
	
	
	The most “relevant” offence in a particular respect is the offence committed by him on 25 August 2013 of supplying a prohibited drug contrary to s 25 Drug (Misuse and Trafficking) Act. For this matter he was sentenced by her Honour Judge Flannery on 2 October 2014, I have read her remarks on sentence. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 15 months, but that was suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Act.
	
	
	I have been informed by his counsel this morning that her Honour, in her wisdom, determined that there be no action taken in relation to any alleged breach of that bond. I accept of course that the offence with which I am concerned is not a breach of that bond. It was committed before the offence of supplying cocaine, although the prisoner was charged with this offence with which I am concerned after he was charged in relation to the cocaine offence. But of course that crime, admittedly now over two years old, is relevant to the assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	Mr Fahmy, I wish you would stop sighing in the dock. This is all concerning you. If you are disinterested that is your problem. But you will just sit there and be quiet please and stop interrupting me thanks very much.
	
	
	According to the facts in her Honour Judge Flannery’s remarks on sentence he claimed that he committed that offence to pay off a debt and he was under a lot of pressure to commit that offence. The offence involved, as I understand it, slightly over 5.3 grams of cocaine, which was of a purity of 28.5%.
	
	
	Subsequent to committing that offence he has appeared at court in relation to driving whilst unlicensed for an offence, as I understand it, committed on 23 May 2014. He has been given the benefit of another bond under s 10 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	I have a pre-sentence report in relation to the prisoner. There was a previous report provided to me at the time of consideration of the bail application, but the primary report I am concerned with is that of 23 November 2015. It gives some details of his personal circumstance. At the time of coming back into custody the prisoner was living with his uncle in the Belmore area, and his uncle is said to have a positive influence upon him.
	
	
	The Community Corrections Service confirmed that prior to coming back into custody the prisoner had been employed at least for three days a week in the construction industry and when interviewed on 12 November 2014 the prisoner outlined his goals of remaining “abstinent from illicit substances” in completing certificate at TAFE in Building in construction. He has, as his evidence revealed, a desire in the future to develop his own construction company and become involved in property development.
	
	
	He gave, in various histories, both in his evidence in his history to the psychologist and to the Community Corrections Officer, somewhat differing histories in relation to his use of prohibited drugs. He told the Community Corrections Officer that he had not used crystal methylamphetamine since he was 18 years of age and it should be noted the Community Corrections Officer noted his reluctance to disclose details about his drug use. He made some comments about the circumstances of committing the offences to the Community Corrections Officer effectively blaming his involvement with other people of “negative influence” and stated at the time of the commission of the offences he was “impulsive and immature”.
	
	
	I am prepared to accept if only by reason of his age that he had a level of immaturity but of course one could not regard in total the offending with which I am concerned as “impulsive” given that it involved three separate acts on three separate days.
	
	
	He seems to now take a view in relation to prohibited drugs that they are in effect “evil” and is against them. If that is a mindset that will prevent him using drugs in the future well then that will be a good thing. It should be pointed out that his early supervision in relation to the s 12 bond was considered to be unsatisfactory. He failed to report. He showed to me a reluctance to comply with court orders when he completely failed a basic test of the bail that I gave him of attending upon a police station to report which would have required only 15 or 20 minutes of his time.
	
	
	With regard to the Community Corrections’ report it notes that he failed not only to report but to engage in psychological intervention that was directed at the time and a breach of that bond was submitted apparently, I assume to her Honour back in December 2014, which is not that long after the bond was granted.
	
	
	However, it is to be fairly said the Community Corrections report also notes some improvement in his supervision, once that matter was referred to her Honour. Up until the time he came back into custody in October of this year he reflected not only improvement in his relationship with Community Corrections but the evidence before me shows that he was endeavouring to seek some professional assistance particularly in relation to what is a self-evident problem for him, although it is scarcely relevant to the offending with which I am concerned. That is his problem with anger management which he continually shows in this court.
	
	
	During the interview with the Community Corrections Service he stated that he changed his lifestyle since the commission of this offence and that was the tenor of the evidence that he gave before the court.
	
	
	The Community Corrections Service said that he was unlikely to benefit from a period of supervision. He would seem to be according to Community Corrections better served by seeking assistance in the outside community from other sources.
	
	
	So far as his evidence in court was concerned he said that he knew nothing of the purity of the drug, a matter about which I have commented. He told me in his evidence that in 2013 he had been a user of different drugs at different times but he gave an account in relation to the circumstances of this offending which to my mind I could not accept. He shed frankly, little light on the manner in which he was recruited in relation to the current offending.
	
	
	In respect of his account of his involvement I cannot accept if it be seriously suggested that he was under continuing pressure to involve himself in the offending with which I am concerned, bearing in mind as I have pointed out the supplies being committed over a period of time on three separate occasions.
	
	
	He gave evidence to me that he would seek to better himself on his return to the community. I believe that he is genuine in seeking to better himself and I have taken that into account. Although the objective evidence that he has produced through his counsel of his performance at TAFE does not really fit very squarely with his statements about what steps he had taken for example during 2015 in relation to his education.
	
	
	In relation to the change of lifestyle he said that he was anxious to complete the TAFE course but it would appear from the evidence of his mother and other material there might be some unsettled domestic circumstance that impact upon him. The record from TAFE seems to suggest on the part of the prisoner at this point not complete application to the task at hand. I have taken into account of course his aspirations for the future.
	
	
	His mother gave some short evidence. She spoke as did her character reference in writing of his better qualities. She described in her oral evidence he was a person with a “soft heart” and that he the prisoner helped her on occasions. She believed that he committed the offence because of what was described as “bad friends”. She gave evidence I hasten to say through an interpreter. She was questioned by the learned Crown Prosecutor about ongoing problems within the family home. There is some background of domestic dysfunction and the prisoner has given a history to the psychologist of an overbearing, if I may use that expression, attitude of his father. His father may well be a very traditional man and it would be difficult for a young man living in the Australian community to deal with that. The psychologist makes the comment that the prisoner, whilst he does not complain about his upbringing and looks favourably upon it, may well be referring more to the attention given to him by his mother than his father. With regard to the circumstances at his home, it would appear that there have been a number of clashes between the prisoner and his father that led to him living with his uncle.
	
	
	I have a very detailed psychological report and I have taken that into account. The history of the prisoner as provided by him and some of the conclusions reached by the psychologist. As the Crown correctly pointed out there is no evidence of any cognitive disability. There is no evidence of any mental illness. There is no evidence of any mental condition that can be said to have a causal connection with the commission of the offence with which I am concerned for the purposes of sentencing. The prisoner himself, whilst he reflected upon some depressive symptoms in the past, claimed that he was of good health.
	
	
	I have taken into account particularly the observations of psychologist at para 31 of her report, concerning general theories and analyses in the literature about the development of maturity. I have taken into account the psychometric testing. The prisoner has on psychometric testing on ‘intelligence’ which is described as low average. But he reported no problems with executive functioning and he was within the average range in relation to his cognitive abilities.
	
	
	The formulation of the psychologist was that the prisoner had been exposed to some hardship in his childhood, particularly in his relationship with his father and that he had developed through his teenage years, reflected largely in his criminal history and attitude that required him to be perceived by others as “the big guy”. That had as such encouraged him to engage in antisocial behaviours. He was also susceptible to negative peer influence.
	
	
	The psychologist made some comments about some of these matters relevant to the offending. But her comments are entirely dependent upon the history given by the prisoner. She opines that at the relevant time the prisoner had a poorly developed maturity of judgment and this was a contributing factor to his offending. She made some observations about recent behaviour which to my mind are not fully supported by relevant events, particularly concerning his compliance with bail conditions. She saw his offending in terms of him responding to negative influences. The detail of that of course is not exposed by the prisoner’s evidence in this court and particularly his plea at the trial.
	
	
	I accept her recommendations, however, that the prisoner does require some professional intervention and support to develop both his impulse control, to improve problem solving abilities and to promote his maturity of judgment. If he is to continue with an antisocial lifestyle once he is released from custody there was need for him to develop his employment skills thus he would be encouraged to complete his TAFE course and to seek out the aspirations about which he has spoken.
	
	
	I mentioned the fact that as the Community Corrections Service reported, he has undertaken a degree of psychological counselling throughout 2015 that is before he came to trial in this court and I have read the report from the psychologists. He is encouraged to continue with psychological counselling. There is opinion expressed about the risk to him of further incarceration which I have taken into account but ultimately it is self-evident the reality of the situation is with him being in custody bail refused at this point and with the period of time previously spent in custody to my mind all matters considered, making an order other than fulltime custody is not practicable or reasonable in all the circumstances.
	
	
	The report from Western Sydney TAFE reflects the lack of application in his studies to which I have referred, although I do have a reference from the Head Teacher at TAFE that speaks of his skills and the ability of the prisoner to address himself to the task at hand. The teacher in fact speaks well of the prisoner’s attendance and punctuality and the teacher felt at the time of the preparation of the reference in September 2014 that the prisoner was in a position to apply himself to the course and do well.
	
	
	I have taken into account the reference from an employer who speaks highly of his skills and his application to the task and I have mentioned the reference of the mother, the father has also provided a reference which I have taken into account.
	
	
	I note also it I have reports from religious organisations or religious based organisations with which the prisoner has been in contact concerning his conduct in the past and counselling provided to him.
	
	
	The ‘Exodus Youth Worx’ speaks of the endeavours to assist him since he started offending back in 2009, 2010. I have also noted the association the prisoner has had with his church particularly throughout 2015. The reference refers to expressions of remorse which seem to be not consistent with the plea that he entered at the trial. But the reference from the Youth Worker or Director of that organisation is positive about his future. The association with that organisation obviously is a good thing for him but it has not necessarily had a positive outcome. I have also taken into account a reference from his priest which speaks highly of his family and also refers to the remorse expressed by the prisoner.
	
	
	The learned counsel for the prisoner prepared detailed submissions in writing and there was some supplement of those written submissions. Primarily the submission put in the context of what are observed to be the objective facts was that I should not impose a period of fulltime custody, that the penalty should be either suspended or I should consider assessment for an Intensive Correction Order, assuming of course the threshold for determining that a sentence of imprisonment be imposed, set down by s 5 of the Act had been reached. Counsel has referred to the quantity of the drugs, the limited scope of the dealing the amount of money involved, the youth and immaturity of the prisoner and the objective seriousness of the offending. I have taken those matters into account. I accept other observations made by counsel that the prisoner did not offer to supply larger quantities, did not particularly advertise or particularise what he could supply. The supply to an undercover officer reflected some minor diminution in moral culpability in the sense that no harm was done to the public. He responded to requests rather than instigated supplies, that the level of profit would have been limited.
	
	
	In relation to the scope of the operation I must say, although I do not necessarily regard this as ‘evidence’ but no comment was made by the Crown specifically about it, the submissions of the prisoner noted that there were 7,000 telephone calls intercepted in the relevant operation and the prisoner’s involvement was limited to three such calls. With regard to the quality of the drugs as I said I am prepared to accept that he had no specific knowledge of that and in any event it is quite clear as each case comes before this court over the last few years that the purity of drugs being sold at street level is considerably higher than it used to be. There was a time 12, 15 years ago when it was regularly the case that methylamphetamine sold at street level was usually below 10% in purity but as I have said earlier we have seen much higher levels of purity now.
	
	
	Insofar as his prior criminal history is concerned his counsel referred to that, but says that he had no prior drug supply matters which I have taken into account. With regard to his youth and immaturity reference is made to two decisions.
	
	
	Mr Fahmy are we boring you? Mr Fahmy do you want to wait downstairs, I will complete the sentencing in your absence if you continue to sigh and carry on the way you are carrying on?
	
	
	OFFENDER: ..(not transcribable)..
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I beg your pardon?
	
	
	OFFENDER: It’s nothing don’t worry.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I haven’t made the final orders yet Mr Fahmy.
	
	
	I have taken into account the submissions made by his counsel in relation to the relevance of maturity in sentencing. There is a range of authority I need not cite with particularity dealing with the approach of courts to the sentencing of young offenders, particularly in the case of poorly developed or ill developed maturity. His counsel cites the well-known decision of Hearne [2001] NSW CCA 37. Of particular pertinence are the observations of Justice Hodgson then of the Court of Appeal in the decision of BP [2010] NSWCCA, at [4]-[5].
	
	
	And I have taken the general principles outlined by his Honour in those paragraphs into account.
	
	
	So far as s 21A matters are concerned, clearly the breach of conditional liberty is an aggravating factor. It is not specifically referred to in counsel for the prisoner’s submissions, but I accept his submissions in relation to other matters identified. The issue of planning and organisation is not a matter for which this prisoner is personally responsible and it seems to me with respect that the issue of financial reward to which, or gain to which the Crown referred is an element of the offence.
	
	
	So far as the aggravating factor of breach of conditional liberty, that matter is one that has to be seen as a matter of degree. The conditional liberty here arises under bonds ordered pursuant to s 10 in the Local Court of course it remains an aggravating factor but is not as serious an aggravating factor as for example an offender committing offences on parole, the parole relating to like offending.
	
	
	With regard to mitigating factors a number of matters are put.
	
	
	Some of course arising not directly under s 21A(3) of the Act. One matter particularly identified is the issue of delay. There is substantial delay in this matter. The reasons for that are not fully explained and primarily one would have thought the delay in dealing with this matter has arisen out of the failure of the prisoner to recognise the overwhelming character of the Crown case against him, despite his protestations or explanations for pleading not guilty. This is not a case as might be seen in decisions such as Todd from the early 1980’s where there has been an extensive delay and a progress in rehabilitation during that period of delay.
	
	
	This prisoner, as the Crown pointed out, committed an offence of supplying prohibited drugs after the commission of this offence and although his criminal history in the intervening period of time is nowhere near as bad as it was leading up to the commission of this offence, there has been continued sporadic offending. There was, as was pointed out by Community Corrections, a lack of application to the supervision provided to the prisoner. The prisoner should understand when he is released to parole if he does not want to co operate with Community Corrections that can be fixed up very quickly by the Parole Authority issuing a warrant for his arrest and taking him back into custody for such time as is left in his sentence.
	
	
	With regard to the issue that is raised by the decision of EF v R [2015] NSWCCA 36, I am mindful of that decision. The learned Chief Judge no doubt in a busy list determined that a term of imprisonment ought be imposed of two years or less without turning his mind, as was dictated by cases such as Zamagias, to the issue of whether he should consider an alternative to full time custody. I have turned my mind to that particular matter but in my view in this particular case, having regard to the objective facts and the subjective circumstances and the myriad of other matters that arise for consideration at this point of time, particularly the fact that the prisoner has been in custody for over four months, that the suspension of the term of imprisonment or consideration of the assessment of the prisoner for an Intensive Correction Order would not be appropriate. I have accepted submissions made by learned counsel for the prisoner that there is a basis for determining that there are special circumstances under s 44 of the Act.
	
	
	Counsel for the prisoner and the Crown, in the spirit of helpfulness I hasten to say, brought to my attention a large number of what was said to be “comparative” cases. I have sentenced far more people for offences under s 25A than the range of comparative cases referred to by the parties, but having said that I am not drawing any line through anything that I have done and I am prepared to rely upon the comparative cases identified by the counsel as providing the court with some assistance. It would be pointless me going through and naming all the cases, many of them I am familiar with.
	
	
	The defence in fact refers to a case that the Crown thought was ‘a bit too old’, a decision from 2000 of Smiroldo which was a judgment of Justice RS Hulme ([2000] NSWCCA 120). An older case it may be, but it should be fairly said that it is a case where Justice Hulme laid down some important and still relevant principles in relation to sentencing in respect to this offending. Of significance Smiroldo does not assist us much in relation to comparative sentencing because of the quantities of the drug in question being significantly higher both either supplied or agreed to be supplied by Mr Smiroldo than I have here. Mr Smiroldo was running his own commercial operation out of his home. But having said that the principles that his Honour outlined about the offence itself are of some pertinence. I am not prepared to get into any debate or even consider the issue of whether methylamphetamine is to be seen as less dangerous as heroin or cocaine.
	
	
	In this particular case it is entirely irrelevant matter to the ultimate outcome of the offence and I am not sure that the views expressed by Justice Hulme are shared by other judges of the Court of Criminal Appeal from time to time. That having been said, of course, the learned Crown in his written submissions, if I may just turn to them for a moment, quite accurately summarised the position about the use of comparative cases. His submissions refer to a recent decision of Justice Bellew in Ragendra v R [2014] NSWCCA 113.
	
	
	There, his Honour discussed not only the limited use of statistics which is acknowledged by the Crown and can be seen in judgments such in the decision of Ragendra which I commented upon the limitations of statistics. In fact the learned Chief Justice then of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Spigelman, in a decision he delivered shortly after his appointment of Bloomfield extensively identified the limitations of statistics particularly on appeal ((1998) 44 NSWLR 734).
	
	
	Admittedly when you read his comments he is concerned with the limitations of statistics in relation to matters on appeal where the issue of the appropriate sentence and the like involves somewhat different considerations than determining an appropriate sentence in first instance. But many of the comments he made have pertinence to the task that judges such as myself and others are required to undertake on a daily basis. Interestingly enough on the issue of statistics the Crown pointed out that in respect of offences of ongoing supply involving a sample of 312 where all people pleaded guilty the range of sentencing without being told what other percentages apply to non-custodial orders indicated that 79% of offenders received full-time custodial sentences. Obviously it follows from that that 21% of offenders received non-custodial sentences or terms of imprisonment other than full-time custody. But I have not taken the opportunity of doing further research into what the statistics say in greater detail.
	
	
	Perhaps more pertinence to the exercise with which I am concerned in the context of the great array of information that the parties helpfully provided to the court are the observations of Justice Bellew in the same case at [89] concerning the use of comparative sentencing as a yardstick or indication of what the appropriate sentence should be in an instant case. ‘Individualised justice’ is still the character of our sentencing task and his Honour pointed out that:
	


“Every offence and every offender is different and the essential aim of all sentencing is to render individual justice”.


	
	In fact the very heart of the guideline judgment rubric is to be found in the decision of Henry at [10] where the learned Chief Justice adopted what Acting Chief Justice Mahoney had said in the decision of Lattouf, to the effect that “if justice is not individual it is nothing”. But the comparative sentences provide a useful guide to the range of penalties imposed in some cases given varying circumstances in those particular decisions.
	
	
	There is one authority perhaps to refer to in this regard and it is the decision of RCW v R (No 2) ([2014] NSWCCA 190) where the Court of Criminal Appeal cautioned judges becoming fixated on a particular case as a comparative case. It is in the same tenor as the observations of Justice Bellew. In any event I have taken into account all the written and oral submissions of counsel for the prisoner in the determination of this matter.
	
	
	Coming back to the learned Crown Prosecutor’s helpful submissions he notes the seriousness of the offence with which I am concerned in the context of its maximum penalty. The maximum penalty of any offence provides a guide to the seriousness with which the legislature and the community regard particular offending. But each case has to be seen on the facts that fit within the liability of the offender for sentence. I particularly note the observations cited by the Crown by Justice Wood in the decision of Kairouz [2005] NSWCCA 247, particularly at [86], adopting observations made in an earlier decision.
	
	
	No better person could observe relevant matters to sentencing in this area when one considers that it is because of Justice Wood and the work he did in the Royal Commission into the Police Service that we have s 25A. The provision was specifically legislated to overcome the situation where people like ‘Bill’ Bayeh in Kings Cross could, over a lengthy period of time, supply over hundreds of occasions very small quantities of drugs by runners for example taking the drugs to purchasers and avoid the implications of greater maximum penalties attaching to particular quantities by individual supplies being in small amounts. However, when taken together over a period of time, multiple supplies ultimately providing purchasers with considerable quantities of drug. It could be, I have not sufficient information, that the people that directed the organisation of the matter with which this prisoner is concerned were dealing in a similar way to Mr Bayeh and his colleagues in Kings Cross and elsewhere. But this prisoner is to be held liable for what he did and not for what others clearly were responsible for.
	
	
	The Crown made various observations about the objective seriousness of the offending in this particular matter but obviously concedes the small quantity involved, the limited number of supplies, it is the bare minimum number of supplies to invoke the legislation. Section 25A could, as I recently determined in a sentencing matter involve a number of supplies in the dozens over a thirty day period.
	
	
	With regard to one aspect of the Crown’s submission there is one comment that should be made. I accept that the transactions in which the prisoner was concerned involved a degree of planning and organisation but there are two aspects of that. It is quite clear that on the basis of the material available to me the planning and organisation of the system of supply was not within the thrall of the prisoner. Secondly, Justice Howie has pointed out in a number of judgments that the very character of the particular offending in the supply of drugs has an inherent quality of planning and organisation, ongoing supply would be such an offence hence the increased maximum penalty.
	
	
	With regard to the criminal history I accept that his criminal history does not entitle him to any particular leniency although I bear in mind much of his more serious offending occurred when he was younger than he was on this occasion and when he was clearly less mature than he was when he committed the subject offence. His criminal history however is not an aggravating factor under s 21A(2). I point out in relation to his history that most of his serious offending before May 2013 occurred when he was extremely young, dealt with in the Children’s Court and was concerned with offending of a different character.
	
	
	The conclusion the Crown reached in its helpful submissions was that no other penalty other than a term of imprisonment was appropriate. Although as I said the prisoner is not penalised for pleading not guilty, this is not a case where one could factor into the considerations genuine remorse, a discount for example for the plea of guilty if it had been entered at the appropriate time, and it is an offence of its character where some element of personal and general deterrence arises. The significance of the subsequent offending for which the prisoner cannot be penalised as such goes to the assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation and of course the weight to be given to personal deterrence.
	
	
	I was referred to that line of authority reflected in decisions such as Carrion from 2000, Gip and Gu, two separate decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal from 2006 and the decision of Fayd’herbe from 2007 where there was reflection upon the observation of Justice Hunt about the need for full time custodial penalties unless there were exceptional circumstances where a person was substantially involved in trafficking and drugs. Fayd’herbe did involve, amongst other offences, one offence of ongoing supply and it is not to be forgotten in Fayd’herbe that the offender was in fact sentenced to a term of imprisonment in excess of two years although the quantities involved were greater than those with which I am concerned here. The issue here is not one of having to determine whether there are exceptional circumstances that might otherwise warrant consideration of a penalty other than full time custody.
	
	
	It seems to me, although in a minor way, the offending of the prisoner does amount to substantial involvement in trafficking in drugs in the character that I have already identified. But this is a case not determined ultimately solely on the objective facts. This is not a case for example of objective facts that might otherwise point towards a custodial sentence where the subjective case is so powerfully favourable to the prisoner that consideration other than full time custody might fairly arise or it is not a case where it could be said that there are “exceptional” circumstances. It is to be borne in mind even if this prisoner came forward in far more favourable circumstances subjectively, with the benefit of a plea of guilty and remorse and the like, that, as Justice Priestley said in Cacciola in 1998:
	


“A combination of subjective circumstances each strong in itself does not add up to exceptional circumstances unless the aggregate of all the circumstances point to the case being one of real difference from the general run of cases”.


	
	In any event when I have regard to the purposes of sentencing pursuant to s 3A and I have regard to s 5 having determined that I cannot conclude that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.
	
	
	When I have regard to the mitigating factors which are few, particularly bearing in mind that I could not conclude that the prisoner was a person of good character, the prisoner is unlikely to re-offend, that the prisoner does not have good prospects of rehabilitation and that the prisoner cannot be said to have no record or not any record that is significant, it seems to me that the determination of the matter by the penalty I have foreshadowed is the appropriate way to dispose of it notwithstanding the urgings of his counsel.
	
	
	Mr Fahmy, you can stand up thanks very much. In relation to the offence for which you have been found guilty by the jury you are convicted, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole of six months, that will commence on 8 August 2015, that will expire on 7 February 2016. Excuse me what are you talking about, I do not understand you?
	
	
	OFFENDER: I thought you said six month parole.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Fahmy would you just keep quiet for a moment and listen. I gave some thought actually to considering whether I should make the order that I foreshadowed in light of your conduct in the dock but I thought it would be unfair to penalise you any further for your conduct.
	
	
	The balance of the sentence will be 12 months, that will mean that the sentence that I impose will expire on 7 February 2017.
	
	
	Just take a seat thanks very much. Thus, the sentence is for abundant clarity not six years non-parole but a non-parole period of six months to date from 8 August 2015 to expire on 7 February 2016. I direct that the offender be released to parole on that date. It will be a matter for the Parole Authority as to the conditions of his parole.
	
	
	Yes Mr Turner?
	
	
	TURNER: No further matters your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Anything from you Mr Crown?
	
	
	PATRICK: No your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I will consider those matters that you put in a motion Mr Crown, I will make an order in chambers next week.

Introduction


	
	On 9 June 2015 the applicant (who was born on 21 July 1982) was arraigned on an indictment containing 20 counts of sexual assaults of various kinds involving four complainants. In respect of complainant A, counts 1 to 3 alleged offences between 3 July 1994 and 4 July 1996 (he then being 5 years old and the applicant between 11 and 13 years old), and counts 8 to 16 alleged offences between 3 July 1999 and 31 December 2000 (when he was 10 to 11 years old and the applicant was 16 to 18). In respect of complainant B, counts 4 to 7 alleged offences between 14 September 1997 and 15 September 1998 (when she was 3 to 5 years old and the applicant 15 to 16) and count 18 (when she was 10 years old and the applicant 21 to 23). In respect of complainant C, count 17 alleged an offence occurring between 11 April 2002 and 12 April 2003 (when she was 5 years old and the applicant was 20). The remaining counts, 19 and 20, allege sexual assaults on complainant D, who had a cognitive impairment, between 31 December 2008 and 1 February 2011 (when he was 4 and 5 years old and the applicant was 25 to 28). Following arraignment, the applicant pleaded not guilty and sought a separate trial for counts 1 to 3, and counts 8 to 16 and also separate trials for the counts relating to each of complainants B, C and D, thus five trials covering all the charges in the indictment. (The age variations reflect the uncertainty about the dates on which the offences occurred, so that in relation, say, to counts 1 to 3, which occurred on the one occasion, the applicant was 11 or 12 or 13 years of age.)
	
	
	The Crown opposed this application upon the ground, essentially, that the evidence in respect of each of the charges is admissible in respect of the others by application of the tendency rule. In a pretrial hearing, the learned primary judge read the statements of each of the complainants and one further witness (in respect of an uncharged offence involving E, detailed below) and two complainants gave evidence. Her Honour concluded that the evidence relied on as tendency was admissible and that none of the counts should be severed. On 10 June 2015 the applicant sought to adjourn the trial to permit an appeal to this Court under s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). That application was refused and the trial proceeded for a further four days, on the last of which it was aborted. The trial is currently listed for hearing on 14 March 2016. Somewhat unusually in an appeal of this kind, as it happened all of the complainants have given their evidence at trial and have been cross-examined. Pursuant to s 306B of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) the prosecution will be entitled to rely on the recorded evidence already given when the trial or trials are ultimately conducted.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal from the refusal of the primary judge to order separate trials upon the following grounds –
	


(i) the issue of doli incapax was not taken into account;

(ii) the correct test for the admission of tendency evidence was not applied;

(iii) her Honour incorrectly found there was (in effect) no danger of unfair prejudice;

(iv) her Honour was in error in finding that the allegations in relation to the various complainants were similar; and

(v) her Honour erred in determining whether or not there was a reasonable possibility of concoction.

The Evidence Act 1995 (NSW)


	
	It is accepted that the provisions of this Act which deal with tendency and coincidence evidence determine the issues in this appeal. The relevant provisions are –
	


55 Relevant evidence

(1) The evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.

(2) …

97 The tendency rule

(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:

(a) …

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

(2) …

101 Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution

(1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.

(2) Tendency evidence about a defendant … that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.

(3) …

(4) …

135 General discretion to exclude evidence

The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might:

(a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party …

(b) …

(c) …

The Crown case


	
	The prosecution accepts for present purposes the accuracy of the summary of facts set out in the applicant’s written submissions. (I have anonymised the complainants’ details and omitted indicating editorial changes for ease of reading.) This is as follows –
	


“3. The applicant was born on 21 July 1982.

The charges relating to A

4. A was the son of a friend of and occasional sexual partner of the applicant's father. He was born on 4 July 1989.

Counts 1 to 3

5. Counts 1 to 3 are all particularised as taking place between 3 July 1994 and 4 July 1996, when the complainant was 5 years old and the applicant was 11 to 13 years old.

6. Count one is an allegation that the applicant fondled the complainant's penis. Count two is an allegation that the applicant fellated the complainant. Count three is a count that the complainant fellated the applicant.

7. These three counts are alleged to be part of the same incident, where the applicant was attending the complainant's mother's party. According to the complainant, he had been given some beer and a cigarette by the applicant. He felt sick so he went to his bedroom and lay down. The applicant entered the bedroom. The applicant said ‘How are you feeling?’ The complainant replied that he was feeling bad. The applicant said, ‘I know what will make you feel better but you can't tell anyone’. The applicant began fondling the complainant's penis and said, ‘How does that feel?’ He then began sucking on the complainant's penis. The applicant said, ‘I’m feeling a bit sick as well, can you do this back for me?’ The complainant then sucked the applicant's penis. The complainant heard someone walking around the house. The applicant said, ‘Quick, stop, stop, get back in bed’. The applicant said, ‘Be quiet, remember you can't tell anyone’. The applicant left the room.

Counts 8 to 11

8. Counts 8 to 11 are all particularised as taking place between 3 July 1999 to 31 December 2000 when the complainant was 10 to 11 years old and the applicant was 16 to 18 years old.

9. According to the complainant, the applicant and the complainant were at the complainant's home alone, playing on the gaming console. The applicant said, ‘Do you remember what we used to do when we were playing games?’ The applicant is alleged to have put his hand down the complainant's pants and masturbated the complainant (count 8). The applicant asked the complainant to do the same to him. The complainant masturbated the applicant (count 9). The applicant then lowered the complainant’s pants and fellated the complainant's penis (count 10). The applicant said, ‘It’s your turn to do it to me while I play the game’. The complainant then fellated the applicant (count 11). A car pulled up and the applicant said, ‘Remember, you can't tell anyone, you'll get in trouble’.

Counts 12 to 15

10. Counts 12 to 15 are all counts when the offences are alleged to have been committed between 3 July 1999 and 31 December 2000. As with the last group of offences, the offences are alleged to have been committed when the complainant was 10 to 11 years old and the applicant was 16 to 18 years old.

11. The applicant was living in a caravan in the backyard of the house where the complainant's family lived. The applicant put his hands down the complainant's pants. The complainant said, ‘I don't like it; I don't want you to do it.’ The applicant said, ‘It's fine, it's all right, you should be happy, you should be happy you have a big penis, it’s bigger than mine, all the women are going to want ya’. The applicant began to fondle the complainant’s penis and masturbated him (count 12). The applicant then said, ‘It’s your turn’. The complainant then moved his hand and masturbated the applicant's penis (count 13). The applicant pulled down the complainant's pants and fellated him (count 14). The complainant then fellated the applicant (count 15). The applicant and the complainant fellated each other about six times.

Count 16

12. Count 16 was allegedly committed between 3 January 2001 and 4 January 2003, when A was about 12 years old, and the applicant was about 19 years old.

13. It is alleged that the applicant suggested to the complainant that they take their dogs for a walk in the bush. During the walk the applicant said, ‘Can you suck my dick?’ The complainant said, ‘No, I don't want to, I don't want to do it again.’ The applicant said, ‘I haven't had a cone today, I’m stressed out.’ The applicant pulled his pants down. The complainant performed fellatio on him. The complainant then said, ‘I'm not doing it any more, I'm not going to do it again”. The applicant said, ‘Why?’ The complainant said, ‘I don't like it. If you ask me to do it again, or come near me again I’ll bite your dick off and tell everyone you made me do it’. The applicant said, ‘OK, OK, it doesn't have to happen again, just don't tell anyone. Keep it to yourself’.

The charges relating to B and C

14. B was born on 15 September 1993 and C was born on 12 April 1997. They were daughters of a friend of the applicant's father.

Charges 4 to 7: B

15. Charges 4 to 7 are all alleged to have been committed between 14 September 1997 and 15 September 1998. During that period, B was 3 to 5 years old, and the applicant was 15 to 16 years old.

16. It is alleged that at B’s home, while her parents were out, the applicant asked the complainant to come into his room for a second. The complainant sat on the applicant's bed. The applicant touched B’s vagina outside her clothing (count 4). He asked her if he could touch her and she said yes. He removed her tights and underwear and licked her vagina (count 5). He masturbated himself and asked B to squeeze his penis, which she did (count 6). The applicant then inserted his penis into her vagina (count 7). There was a knock on the front door. The applicant told the complainant, This will be our special secret, don't tell anybody, it's just between me and you”.

Count 17: C

17. This is the only count involving C. The allegation is that between 11 April 2002 and 12 April 2003 the applicant had committed an act of indecency upon her. At the time C was 5 years old and the applicant was 20 years old.

18. It is alleged that the offence took place when the applicant was living at the applicant's family home. The applicant’s mother had gone out. The complainant went to the applicant's bedroom during the night to ask when her mother was coming home. The applicant said, ‘Come here’. The applicant manoeuvred the complainant so that she was lying with her back on his stomach. The applicant placed his hand on the complainant's vagina under her pyjama pants and moved it around (count 17). The applicant asked if it was OK if he put his hands there and the complainant said, ‘No’. The applicant said, ‘Please’ and the complainant said, ‘No’. The applicant said, ‘How about this’ and the complainant said, ‘No’. The complainant heard the noise of a car and ran out to the front door where she saw her mother.

Count 18: B

19. This count is alleged to have been committed between 14 September 2003 and 15 September 2004. At the time the complainant was 10 years old. The applicant was 21 to 23 years old.

20. The complainant had moved into the house of B's family. The allegation is that whilst babysitting C, the applicant asked the complainant to come into his bedroom. The complainant sat on the applicant's bed. The applicant hugged her and told her that he had missed her. The applicant then placed his hand on the complainant's vagina on top of her boxer shorts. The applicant said, ‘Can I touch there?’ The complainant said, ‘No’. The complainant then walked away. The applicant then said, ‘Just go back to bed then. Remember that this is our secret, don't tell anybody’.

Offences against D: Counts 19 and 20

21. D was born on 3 May 2004. He allegedly suffers from Asperger's disorder, attention deficit disorder, anxiety disorder and has learning difficulties.

22. The offences are alleged to have been committed between 31 December 2008 and 1 February 2011. At that time the complainant was 4 and 5 years old, and the applicant was 25 to 28 years old.

23. It was alleged that the applicant asked the complainant to perform fellatio on him on two occasions. On the first occasion, the applicant placed jam on his penis, and told the complainant that he could not watch television until he sucked the applicant's penis. The next day the applicant again made him perform fellatio on him but with no jam. C said that the applicant told him not to tell his mother.

Uncharged act: E

24. The Crown also seeks to lead evidence of an uncharged act. It is alleged that in 1992 a family, including a boy aged 4 or 5 (“E”), were staying with the applicant's father. E’s mother alleges that she returned home one day and the applicant was in bed with her son and they were both naked. The applicant had his hand on the boy’s penis and appeared to be masturbating him. [The applicant was then about ten years old].

Submissions


	
	In her reasons, the primary judge referred to what she perceived as a difficulty that counsel for the applicant had in articulating the unfair prejudice that might arise and cited as an example of this difficulty the suggestion “that they would misuse the evidence by incorrectly reasoning that, if there were so many complainants, then the allegations must be true”. With respect, this was somewhat to understate counsel’s contentions. In written submissions, he submitted (relying on the judgment of Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) in R v PWD [2010] NSWCCA 209; (2010) 205 A Crim R 75 at [67]) that evidence of general tendencies might not be sufficiently significant to satisfy the test. This argument was taken up in oral submissions in greater detail, counsel submitting that the evidence did not show a pattern of conduct that sufficed to demonstrate significant probative value and going on to say –
	


“It is my submission that the primary … unfair prejudice is that a jury, despite any direction that the Court could give, may well reason, ‘Well they couldn’t all be lying, they couldn’t all be making it up’. And that’s impermissible reasoning in relation to one complainant, but lay people could well reason that way.

And if your Honour would say, ‘You shouldn’t reason that way’, it’s exactly as Hoeben [CJ at CL] said in … Sokolowskyj [v R [2014] NSWCCA 55] … [that] one of the dangers of unfair prejudice was that the jury would use the evidence in the way they were directed not to use it, to show [in that case] that the appellant was a sexual deviant who, as a result, was the sort of person who was likely to have committed the offence alleged against him.

The second danger was that the jury would be so emotionally affected by the evidence that they would disregard the appellant’s account in the police interview and disregard the directions to assess the evidence in an unemotional manner. The third danger was that the jury might be disinclined to give the appellant the benefit of any reasonable doubt.”

After a lengthy exchange with the judge, counsel relied on Sokolowskyj v R [2014] NSWCCA 55 to emphasise the need to assess the prejudicial effect of the tendency evidence and to balance that against its probative value. He submitted that the primary danger was, notwithstanding any directions that might be given, the jury might reason no more rationally than that, if the accused molested other persons, he did the same to the complainant and that emotion, not rationality would govern their judgment. He pointed to authorities that emphasised the possibility that directions might not sufficiently minimise the risk of unfair prejudice and quoted the passage from the judgment of the Chief Judge in Sokolowskyj to the effect that failing to weigh the prejudicial effect and balance it against the probative value of the evidence, on the assumption that judicial directions will be completely effective to minimise the risk of unfair prejudice would, in effect, remove the safeguard provided by s 101(2). He referred to the subconscious effect that tendency evidence might have. There was a real risk that, notwithstanding directions, the jury would see the accused as a sexual deviant with no credibility in denying the allegations against him, not deserving of the benefit of a reasonable doubt and was the sort of person who was likely to have committed the offences alleged.


	
	As to probative value, counsel submitted the evidence was so general that it merely showed a tendency to commit the offences and had no probative significance. He submitted there were “disparate ages” (as I understand it, a reference to the varying age of the applicant at the times of each alleged set of offences as well as the ages of the complainants), places, the offences involved boys and girls and different sexual acts and there was “no common thread other than the allegation of [opportunistic] sexual activity with, as it turns out, persons between the ages of four and fourteen”. Counsel then moved to the issue of concoction submitting that, as B and C were sisters who remained in touch, there was the possible risk of concoction. He also submitted, in effect, that the applicant was placed in the embarrassing position of having to defend the earliest charges (1, 2 and 3), where one issue was doli incapax, which raised the question whether they could be used as tendency evidence in relation to the other offences since (as I understand the argument), even if the alleged acts were committed and the Crown had not overcome the presumption, the jury would be invited to regard those acts as establishing the alleged tendency, despite his acquittal. This would also unduly complicate the trial.
	


The judgment under appeal


	
	After noting that it was agreed that, if the tendency argument succeeded, the severance application would not and vice versa, the primary judge summarised the various allegations upon which the Crown relied and then said –
	


“Therefore, similarities are that the complainants were young or very young when contact first occurred, about 5 years; on most occasions B’s, A’s and C’s consent was sought; for D a request was made which was complied with. The contact was opportunistic, it does not appear to have been planned; there was no threat or violence in any alleged event; the offences commenced with touching and then progressed to oral sex for 3 of the complainants; for D, the allegation is oral sex; there was what is referred to as a wider definition of a position of trust, that is, the accused was in the complainant's home with the consent of the parents; and the type of touching is very similar, that is touching the child under the clothes and/ or having the child touch him. And where the touching continued, the acts progressing to oral sexual activity; in relation to the E matter, the child was about 5 years old, and masturbation appears to have been included, the accused was in the home with consent when the opportunistic act was interrupted.”


	
	Dealing with other relevant considerations, the primary judge first considered whether the evidence had “the capacity to affect the probability of the existence of a fact in issue”, a reference to s 55 (all statutory references are to the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW)). In this respect, her Honour stated that, so far as counts 1, 2 and 3 were concerned, to which the principle of doli incapax applied, this was “a matter that does not bother me at this stage of the proceedings. It may bother me at the end of the Crown case”. Referring implicitly to s 97(1)(b), her Honour moved to the probative value of the evidence, stating the evidence “is certainly capable of being ascribed [a probative value]” and, later –
	


“… Now, in assessing the probative value of the evidence, I am not required … to guess what weight a jury might place on it, but it is certainly the case that I can predict this evidence does have significant probative value with respect to a consideration of the tendency argument that the Crown wishes to run.

The capacity that this evidence has to affect a jury’s deliberation will be the subject of directions by me to the jury. I am of the view that this evidence, either alone, or in conjunction with the other evidence to be put before the Court, will have a significant value in the jury’s deliberations.”


	
	The judge then said –
	


“I also have to consider whether the evidence would have the potential to have an unfair prejudice. There must be, for that to be considered, a danger that the jury will use the evidence on a basis logically unconnected with the issues in the case.

It was submitted that the jury would misuse the evidence, but counsel had some difficulty in actually elucidating how a jury would misuse this evidence. For example it was suggested that they would misuse the evidence by incorrectly reasoning that, if there were so many complaints, then the allegations must be true.

Where there is a tendency argument, such a consideration would always be something that a judge would give strong directions against and it is, indeed, part of the standard directions that a judge gives in relation to tendency evidence.

The jury are clearly told that they have to be satisfied, firstly beyond reasonable doubt these particular events occurred, and then must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in relation to each of the particular events as to whether it does, or the corollary, does not, show that the accused has a tendency as the Crown will submit. It is a two stage process that the jury are given to understand they must undertake.

It was suggested to me that judicial directions cannot cure everything. Well, that is certainly the case and that is why the Court would have to be satisfied that there is no unfair prejudice, nor a danger that a tribunal of fact will use the evidence on a basis logically unconnected with the issues in the case … [which] relate to the sexual assaults or sexual touching of young children, with a particular pattern. The pattern is important, and the pattern, as I have already outlined at the beginning of this case [sic; semble, judgment], is an important issue that the jury should be entitled to take into account.”


	
	The judge then moved to the issue of concoction, stating that if it were reasonably possible that the evidence had been contaminated or concocted then it should be withheld. This risk was submitted to arise in relation to B and C “because they are sisters and their statements were taken at the same place, same time but … in different rooms … [and] there was a phone call between … [them] beforehand”. Both had given evidence in the (aborted) trial to the effect that they had not discussed the applicant’s conduct towards them. Her Honour concluded that, whilst there had been an opportunity for concoction, there was no motive for it, and there was no evidence of concoction; rather, the evidence was to the contrary. At all events this was, her Honour noted, a matter for the jury to consider when considering the reliability of the tendency evidence.
	


Discussion


	
	It is concede d here that the proposed tendency evidence was relevant and no complaint is made about the next step in her Honour’s decision, namely that the proposed evidence had significant probative value within the meaning of s 97(1)(b). The crucial question in this case for determination by the primary judge was whether the probative value of the proposed evidence – namely, the extent to which that evidence “could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue” (vide the Dictionary) – was so “significant” as to “substantially … [outweigh] the prejudicial effect it might have on” the applicant. It is clear that in this context the “prejudicial effect” is not a reference to the rational and appropriate use of the evidence, adduced for the purpose of proving the Crown case and adversely to the interests of the accused. The prejudice here is prejudice that is unfair in the sense that the jury might, because it shows the accused as guilty of disgusting, criminal or morally reprehensible conduct, give the prosecution case greater or the defence case less weight than it rationally deserves or distract them from the true issues in the case, in short to put a thumb on the scales. There can be little doubt that sexual assaults generally are very likely to engender strong feelings of disgust and indignation, and those upon children especially so. On the face of it, therefore, where the tendency evidence is of this character, its probative value must be correspondingly much more significant than would be necessary where the evidence is less likely to induce strong feelings of antipathy for the accused. This is very far from the case where the tendency evidence is morally or socially inconsequential.
	
	
	In almost every case it will only be possible to identify the potential prejudice by reference to the risks of misuse in a general way by pointing to the offensive character of the impugned evidence and the feelings it might engender against the accused which might influence the reasoning of a jury about his guilt. By and large, the significance of this influence, and thus the risk of unfair prejudice, is more likely to be all the greater where the case is otherwise in substance word against word. The risk is essentially incommensurable but it cannot be doubted that evidence likely to engender strong feelings of disapprobation may well be given undue weight, especially in those cases where judgment of comparative credibility is called for. It is not always disapprobation which is the only concern. In Harris v Director of Public Prosecutions [1952] AC 694 at 707 (cited with approval in Markby v R (1978) 140 CLR 108 by Gibbs ACJ at 116) the question is whether the probable effect of the proposed evidence “would be out of proportion to its true evidential value” (see also, Festa v R [2001] HCA 72; 208 CLR 593; 185 ALR 394 per Gleeson CJ at [22]). The evidence might simply be thought to prove more than it really does. Directions to disregard disapprobation are easy to craft; directions as to how much may be made of the tendency evidence are necessarily far less precise and can be difficult to apply.
	
	
	The risks of misuse should not be underestimated. These matters are not, in the nature of the case, determined by pure reason or logical analysis. Indeed, in an oft-quoted passage, Gibbs ACJ said (in Markby at 117) –
	


“It is often difficult to decide whether a particular piece of evidence is or is not admissible within these principles. However when in doubt a judge should remember that the admission of similar fact evidence is the exception rather than the rule. To be admissible the evidence must have “a strong degree of probative force” (per Lord Wilberforce in R v Boardman [1975] AC 421 at 444), or “a really material bearing on the issues to be decided” (per Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest [ibid at 439], citing Harris v Director of Public Prosecutions [1952] AC 694 at 710); it may not be going too far to say that it will be admissible only if it is “so very relevant that to exclude it would be an affront to common sense” (see per Lord Cross in R v Boardman at 456; and see per Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone ibid at 452–3). The question is thus one of degree, and in answering it the judge must apply… [the judge’s] experience and common sense.”

Where the evidence sought to be admitted is criminal or reprehensible the additional danger is that the jury may regard the character of the accused so adversely that they will not fairly weigh the evidence which he might give.


	
	In R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319; 58 NSWLR 700; 144 A Crim R 1 the question was whether, in light of the enactment of s 101(2) of the Act, the requirement stipulated by Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ in Pfennig v R (1995) 182 CLR 461 at 482-3; 77 A Crim R 149 at 165 still applied –
	


“Because propensity evidence is a special class of circumstantial evidence, its probative force is to be gauged in the light of its character as such. But because it has a prejudicial capacity of a high order, the trial judge must apply the same test as a jury must apply in dealing with circumstantial evidence and ask whether there is a rational view of the evidence that is consistent with the innocence of the accused … Here ‘rational’ must be taken to mean ‘reasonable’ and the trial judge must ask himself or herself the question in the context of the prosecution case; that is to say, he or she must regard the evidence as a step in the proof of that case. Only if there is no such view can one safely conclude that the probative force of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect. And, unless the tension between probative force and prejudicial effect is governed by such a principle, striking the balance will continue to resemble the exercise of a discretion rather than the application of a principle.”


	
	Spigelman CJ (with whom Sully, O’Keefe, Hidden and Buddin JJ agreed) considered that the language of s 101(2) substitutes a new and different test, so that the “no rational view” test no longer applied (Ellis at [88]). The statutory test is whether “probative value substantially outweighs prejudicial effect” (ibid at [89]). The Chief Justice pointed out (at [85]) that “the joint judgment in Pfennig identified the ‘no rational view test’ as the means of determining how it is that probative force and prejudicial effect should be balanced against each other” and concluded (at [89]) that this was inconsistent with the statutory test, requiring only that the probative value of the impugned evidence “substantially outweighs” its prejudicial effect. His Honour observed (at [88], [90]) –
	


“[The] statutory test … expressly requires a balancing process and tilts that process in the same direction as that which the joint judgment in Pfennig suggested, but by the use of different terminology, ie ‘substantially’ .

The Parliament has sought to achieve the same general objective as that which Australian common law had developed by the time of Pfennig, but it did so by the use of precise and different terminology.”

The “‘no rational explanation test’ may result in a trial judge failing to give adequate consideration to the actual prejudice in the specific case which the probative value of the evidence must substantially outweigh” (at [94]). This was not to suggest, however, that “the stringency of the approach, culminating in the Pfennig test, is never appropriate … [as there] may well be cases where, on the facts, it would not be open to conclude that the probative value of particular evidence substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect, unless the ‘no rational explanation’ test were satisfied” (ibid at [96]). Hidden and Buddin JJ agreed with the other members of the Court both as to the order proposed by the Chief Justice and his Honour’s reasons, but commented –

“[104] … Underlying the various formulations of the test for admission of similar fact or propensity evidence in the common law authorities is the recognition that evidence of that kind is likely to be highly prejudicial, and of the need to ensure that it is admitted only when the interests of justice require it. Its admission at common law is exceptional for reasons of policy, not of logic. These considerations should guide the balancing exercise required by the statutory provision, so that the test for admissibility under that provision remains one of very considerable stringency.

[105] In practical terms, that will have the consequence that in many, if not most, cases the application of the common law and the statutory tests will produce the same result.”


	
	Spigelman CJ (Sully and O’Keefe JJ agreeing) responded –
	


“[99] … I do not agree with their Honours. In my opinion, the statutory formulation should operate in accordance with its terms. There is no need for an assumption that all such evidence is ‘likely to be highly prejudicial’, nor for guidance that the test for admissibility is ‘one of very considerable stringency’.”


	
	With respect, the assumption suggested to be inappropriate was merely general observation about the general character of propensity evidence, one which, in my experience, is entirely justified. It is very rare that such evidence is relatively innocuous. Where its admissibility is contested, it will usually involve the commission of crimes or morally reprehensible acts. Such conduct is indeed likely to be highly prejudicial. To suggest this is so is not to limit or qualify the application of the Act in any way. Moreover, the test is certainly one of considerable stringency: unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect, it must be excluded. With respect, I do not think that Hidden and Buddin JJ should be taken as suggesting an approach to the statutory test that did not actually evaluate the prejudicial character of the proposed evidence against its true probative worth. To my mind, their Honours’ remark was implicitly an admonition to take seriously the risk of prejudice where such evidence is sought to be led and not underestimate the potentially powerful undue influence that propensity or coincidence evidence might have. In the result, the significance of Ellis is merely negative, in the sense that, by reason of the statutory test, the “no rational view” test does not answer all cases: as the prejudicial effect of the impugned evidence varies, so too will its probative value in order to satisfy the test. There is nothing in the judgment that suggests that, under the Act, the potential for prejudice should be given any lesser measure than it had under the common law.
	
	
	Although the process for determining admissibility of tendency evidence is now prescribed by the Act and not the common law, the requirement to weigh the risk of unfair prejudice against probative value is scarcely new. Accepting the Pfennig test is not that of the Act, its underlying rationale, that the potential for unfair prejudice is to be taken seriously and the character of its posited probative worth carefully analysed still applies. In Sokolowskyj, Hoeben CJ at CL said of this requirement –
	


“[56] … In the present case there was a real risk that, notwithstanding directions to the jury, the jury would see the appellant as a sexual deviant who had no credibility in denying the allegation against him, was not deserving of the benefit of any reasonable doubt and was the sort of person who was likely to have committed the offence alleged against him.

[57] Members of the jury might have so proceeded subconsciously, even accepting that they would have tried to follow the directions given to them. Had …[the trial judge] carried out the weighing exercise required by s 101, he should have concluded that the probative value of the evidence was not high and that it was substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice. In that regard, the observations of McHugh J in Pfennig v R [1995] HCA 7; 182 CLR 461 at 528-529 are pertinent:

‘39 ... the proposition that the probative value of the evidence must outweigh its prejudicial effect is one that can be easily misunderstood. The use of the term ‘outweigh’ suggests an almost arithmetical computation. But prejudicial effect and probative value are incommensurables. They have no standard of comparison. The probative value of the evidence goes to proof of an issue, the prejudicial effect to the fairness of the trial... If there is a real risk that the admission of such evidence may prejudice the fair trial of the criminal charge before the court, the interests of justice require the trial judge to make a value judgment, not a mathematical calculation. The judge must compare the probative strength of the evidence with the degree of risk of an unfair trial if the evidence is admitted. Admitting the evidence will serve the interests of justice only if the judge concludes that the probative force of the evidence compared to the degree of risk of an unfair trial is such that fair minded people would think that the public interest in adducing all relevant evidence of guilt must have priority over the risk of an unfair trial.’”


	
	It is worthwhile, as it seems to me, to set out McHugh J’s succinct and still relevant explanation of the applicable principle, which immediately precedes the above passage (references omitted) –
	


“38. But upon what basis should propensity reasoning be admitted?

Plainly, it cannot be admitted merely because it has probative or even

strong probative value. The risk of an unfair trial through the use

of propensity reasoning is too great to allow such a low threshold of

admissibility. Consequently, this Court has insisted that as a matter

of law and not discretion the probative value of the evidence must

outweigh or transcend its prejudicial effect …”

This makes it clear that the test propounded by his Honour in the last sentence of the succeeding, explanatory paragraph, was intended to set a substantial barrier to admission. At the same time it is inconsistent with the terms of s 101(2).


	
	I acknowledge that I agreed in the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL, but further reflection has led me to a different opinion about McHugh J’s “fair minded people” test (though not otherwise about the Chief Judge’s reasoning). There is no “fair minded people test” in s 101; nor does it mention the possibility of an unfair trial: the trial will be fair (in relation to tendency evidence) if its prejudicial effect is substantially outweighed by its probative value. If all that is meant by “the risk of an unfair trial” is one in which evidence was admitted whose probative value did not substantially outweigh its prejudicial effect, then plainly enough it is not inconsistent with the Act. But any different kind of risk is immaterial. It follows that I would respectfully disagree with what fell from Sully J (with whom Grove and Howie JJ agreed) in R v RN [2005] NSWCCA 413 (at [11]) that, “the essence of… [the] task” in considering whether the prejudicial effect of the impugned evidence was substantially outweighed by its probative value, was that described by McHugh J in the passage quoted above. (Although his Honour referred to Ellis, it was simply to support the proposition that each case must be decided on its own facts.) Similarly, with respect, the adoption of the “fair minded people” test by Beazley JA (Buddin and Barr JJ agreeing) in PWD at [71] is inconsistent with s 101.
	
	
	The language of McHugh J seems to echo the reference to affronting common sense in the well known passage from the judgment of Gibbs ACJ in Markby at 116 in which his Honour deals with the various attempts to elucidate the relevant standard, which is still informative (citations omitted) –
	


“… The first principle, which is fundamental, is that the evidence of similar facts is not admissible if it shows only that the accused had a propensity or disposition to commit crime, or crime of a particular kind, or that he was the sort of person likely to commit the crime charged. The second principle, which is a corollary of the first, is that the evidence is admissible if it is relevant in some other way, that is, if it tends to show that he is guilty of the crime charged for some reason other than that he has committed crimes in the past or has a criminal disposition … It is often difficult to decide whether a particular piece of evidence is or is not admissible within these principles. However when in doubt a judge should remember that the admission of similar fact evidence is the exception rather than the rule. To be admissible the evidence must have ‘a strong degree of probative force’ … or ‘a really material bearing on the issues to be decided’ …; it may not be going too far to say that it will be admissible only if it is ‘so very relevant that to exclude it would be an affront to common sense’ … The question is thus one of degree, and in answering it the judge must apply his experience and common sense. Although the judgment which the judge is required to make is to some extent discretionary, the rule of exclusion is a rule of law and not of discretion, and the principle allowing the admission of the evidence remains subject to the discretionary power to exclude it, even if legally admissible, where its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value. In applying the test of admissibility to which I have just referred, practical assistance, in many cases, will be obtained by considering whether there is a ‘striking similarity’ between the similar facts and the facts in issue.”

Even though the “striking similarity” test was not considered to apply universally to propensity evidence, substantial similarity was always important. That it would afford “practical assistance in many cases” points implicitly to the likely serious prejudice to which propensity evidence will often give rise; nor is the suggestion inconsistent with s 101.


	
	Ellis has decided only that s 101(2) is to be applied according to its own terms without reference to other tests, in particular in respect of the evaluation of probative weight. It does not suggest that the notion that propensity evidence “has a prejudicial capacity of a high order” (Pfennig at 165) is mistaken. It is to this consideration, which is not a gloss upon, let alone inconsistent with, s 101, that Hidden and Buddin JJ were referring in their comments.
	
	
	The language of the Act and the character of the test for inadmissibility under s 101 have obvious, longstanding roots in the common law. An example to be added to the excerpts referred to above is the following passage from the judgment of Dawson and Gaudron JJ in B v R [1992] HCA 68; 175 CLR 599 at 617-8; 63 A Crim R 225 at 239 (cited as a “convenient starting point” by Toohey J in Pfennig at 178-9) –
	


“Evidence that an accused has committed offences other than those with which he is charged ought not be admitted if it tends to show only that the accused has a propensity or disposition to commit criminal offences of a particular type or generally. If a propensity or disposition of that kind is all that the evidence tends to show, then its prejudicial nature must be greater than any relevance which it might have. To admit such evidence would be to invite the jury to proceed upon prejudice or suspicion rather than proof. But if the evidence of other offences goes beyond showing a mere propensity or disposition to commit crime or a particular type of crime and points in some other way to the commission of the offences in question, then it will be admissible if its probative value for that purpose outweighs its prejudicial effect. That is not to say that it may not still be evidence of propensity or disposition, but it will then be evidence of propensity or disposition of a particular kind which in the circumstances has a degree of relevance justifying its admission …” [Citations omitted.]


	
	For all that the “no rational explanation” test no longer applies, it was a response to the need to protect a trial from the distorting effects of unfair prejudice in light of a perception – no less reasonable now – that a jury might well have difficulty in dispassionately considering their verdict without prejudice towards the accused and thus convert suspicion into certainty when the evidence, considered appropriately, did not justify that conclusion. That, too, is the essential function of s 101(2). There is nothing in it which suggests that the risk to which it refers is any less than has always been recognised by the common law, nor is the need that the risk be substantially outweighed by probative value anything new. Its effect is simply that the issue of admissibility is to be decided without applying a predetermined standard of probative value but, rather, one that varies with the degree of potential prejudice.
	
	
	It is trite that the risk of unfair prejudice might be overcome by appropriate directions. However, it cannot be assumed that they will be effective to obviate it. In Sokolowskyj, Hoeben CJ at CL said, concerning the sufficiency of directions in the particular circumstances –
	


“[56] A further consideration is this. An assumption that a judicial direction to the jury designed to minimise the risk of unfair prejudice will be completely effective would effectively prevent s101(2) operating as a safeguard against the potential risk of miscarriages of justice arising from the admission of tendency evidence. In the present case there was a real risk that, notwithstanding directions to the jury, the jury would see the appellant as a sexual deviant who had no credibility in denying the allegation against him, was not deserving of the benefit of any reasonable doubt and was the sort of person who was likely to have committed the offence alleged against him.

[57] Members of the jury might have so proceeded subconsciously, even accepting that they would have tried to follow the directions given to them. Had his Honour carried out the weighing exercise required by s101, he should have concluded that the probative value of the evidence was not high and that it was substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice…”


	
	It is also worth noting the essay by Mirko Bagaric “The community interest in bringing suspects to trial trumps the right to an impartial decision maker – at least in Victoria” (2010) 34(1) Criminal Law Journal 5 at 8 about the issues raised by pretrial publicity and the disinclination of Courts to stay prosecutions for that reason. Mr Bargaric characterised the judicial belief that jury directions can cure negative impressions formed about an accused as “near heroic” and points out that there “is no evidence to suggest that this is anything other than judicial wishful thinking”. He notes that “human memory and cognition is a complex science” and refers to “a body of work [cited in footnote 4] that suggests that once people form an adverse view they cannot simply discard their preconceptions upon command”. An additional aspect of this problem is shown by the recent jury study, Jurors’ Notions of Justice, An Empirical Study of Motivations to Investigate & Obedience to Judicial Directions (September 2013) undertaken by Professor Jill Hunter of the UNSW Law School. Although it focusses on the attitudes of jurors towards obtaining their own information contrary to directions not to do so, it exposes some of the real difficulties that jurors have with understanding the accusatorial nature of criminal trials and their frustrations with what is seen as limiting the discovery of truth.
	
	
	The conscientiousness with which juries approach their responsibilities is not doubted and, at all events, must be taken for granted. But even conscientious attempts to follow corrective directions may well not be effective. Part of the power of feelings of indignation, disgust or disapprobation is the tendency to overestimate one’s ability to put them to one side and to remain unaware of their subconscious influence. Furthermore, the evidence is given by the victim in the presence of the jury, an emotional context likely to excite sympathy. The particular attitudes that a juror might have to the prejudicial evidence cannot be known and the judge necessarily is driven to rely on his or her experience of ordinary human reactions. Judges, if I may respectfully say so, should be cautious about relying too much on their own experience of detachment, bearing in mind that their judicial duties expose them relatively often to disgraceful, wicked conduct or tragic circumstances, which they must deal with dispassionately. It is worth reflecting that years of doing so might lead to an underestimation both of the emotional impact that the material could have on lay people and the real difficulty of achieving objectivity. Nor, despite conscious attempts (assisted by the need to write a judgment and the often substantial ensuing delay) will even a judge always succeed in achieving objectivity. The canard of the common law Bar that bringing the quadriplegic plaintiff into court is as effective, or almost as much, with a judge as with a jury in putting a thumb on the scales, is the product of long experience and hard-headed realism. In short, it is necessary to be realistic about the actual ability of jurors to put aside indignation, disgust or disapprobation, even when given strongly worded directions. This is not to account for the problem – highlighted in Professor Hunter’s jury study – that the prejudicial material might lead a juror to minimise the importance of the directions or even to disregard them altogether in order to do what is believed to be justice.
	
	
	This emphasises the importance of carefully assessing both the character and likely effect of the tendency evidence in light of proposed directions and its evidential value.
	


Consideration


	
	The reasons of the primary judge were ex tempore and, therefore, it is necessary to focus on the substance of the reasoning, which might not altogether be clearly articulated by the language. Her Honour does not explicitly set out the prejudicial effect the proposed evidence might have, nor the extent of its probative weight. Essentially, her Honour moved straight to the conclusion that directions would adequately deal with the possible misuse of the evidence by the jury reasoning that, because of the number of complainants, the allegations must be true, or otherwise using it “on a basis logically unconnected with the issues in the case”, this being a reference, as I understand it, to the submission by counsel that the jury might draw adverse conclusions, including disbelieving the applicant’s denials, because of disgust of or disapprobation towards him.
	
	
	The real question in this case, as pointed out by Hoeben CJ at CL in Sokolowskyj at [48], is the danger that the “jury would use the evidence in the way they were directed not to use it”. A child sexual assault trial is inevitably emotionally charged and evidence of the applicant’s promiscuous interest in young children of both sexes would be very likely to inflame the jury with feelings of indignation, disgust and condemnation. As I have said, there was no discussion by her Honour of the prejudicial nature of the evidence itself or its capacity to influence the jury against the applicant; nor as to the risk that directions might not suffice (though her Honour accepted that judicial directions do not cure everything). With respect, the nature of the particular prejudice and the capacity of directions to deal with it required explicit consideration as an essential part of the balancing process required by s 101. So far as D was concerned, the applicant was aged 25 to 28 years and the complainant was 4 and 5 years old. Any allowance that might have been made for the applicant’s relatively young age at the time of the earlier offences was no longer available; the offence was premeditated (on the first occasion the applicant put jam on his penis and told the complainant he could not watch television until he fellated him); D was also male; and he suffered from some mental problems. These offences (counts 19 and 20) were particularly obnoxious and very likely to engender extremely strong feelings of antipathy for the applicant and sympathy for the complainant. This particular example illustrates the necessity for characterising the particular prejudice that might be excited in respect of each charge or set of charges as part of the weighing process and whether it was reasonable to consider that directions would overcome the prejudice or whether, despite strong directions, the prejudice was so great that there could remain a real risk that the jury would continue to be influenced by it. Also likely to be particularly troubling were the offences committed when the applicant was 20 or so (counts 17 and 18). At the other end of the (nevertheless prejudicial) scale might be thought to be the offences contained in counts 1 to 3 when, although the complainant was 5 years old, the applicant was (on the view most favourable to him) aged only 11. (The uncharged offence was also in this class.) The extent to which the feelings engendered by the offences in counts 17,18,19 and 20 would affect not only the jury’s consideration of those offences but also the others for which the applicant was on trial was a difficult question. However, the primary judge did not discuss it and the reasons were little more than a recitation of the requirements of ss 97(1)(b) and 101(2) without analysis of the issues thrown up by the proposed evidence. Simply to state the risk is not to assess it.
	
	
	An additional difficulty with the reasons of the primary judge, with respect, is they do not contain any balancing of the probative value of the evidence against its prejudicial effect. A finding, as here, that the evidence is “important” does not, with respect, answer the question in s 101(2) whether its probative value “substantially outweighs” its prejudicial effect, though I would readily accept that it answers the question of significance for the purpose of s 97(1). The prejudicial effect of each set of charges is very substantial, increasing as the applicant grew older. That of the evidence supporting charges 19 and 20 is difficult to overestimate: the applicant was about 25 (perhaps 28) years old whilst the complainant, also male, was merely 4 or 5 and suffers from various personality disorders. Its probative value, with that of the other evidence, would need to be very high indeed, if it were to outweigh its appalling prejudicial effect. The Crown case focuses not so much on the applicant’s conduct at particular ages but on the overall pattern, but this avoids the question whether, to take the extremes, the sexual activity of a child does at the age of 11 tell one anything significant about what he or she might do at the age of 24. Or, if one started at the other end, what the sexual conduct of a 24 year old would say about his or likely conduct at the age of 11. The focus on pattern obscures the essential task of identifying the probative weight of the particular tendency demonstrated in each charge or in relation to each of the other charges to which it is said to be relevant. So far as counts 1 to 3 are concerned, accordingly, the issue of doli incapax is an additional complication not, as it appears the primary judge thought, the only question. Difficulties of a similar character, though to a somewhat lesser degree, are presented by the probative value of any tendency shown by the applicant’s alleged sexual conduct when he was 16 (though he might have been 18), in respect of counts 4 to 7, 8 to 11 and 12 to 15, so far as counts 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 are concerned. Tendency is usually concerned with the acts of an adult demonstrating that adult’s propensity to do certain things. However, it is highly speculative, to my mind, to attempt to deduce the likely conduct of an adult from his or her conduct as a 16 year old, let alone from his conduct as an 11 year old or even that of a 16 year old from his conduct as an 11 year old. This was the problem engaged by counsel for the applicant’s reference to disparate ages; and, to my mind, it is one of significant difficulty requiring explicit consideration. With respect, it appears to me that the primary judge’s failure to consider this aspect of the case and, instead, focus on the contended for pattern was to omit highly relevant factors in weighing the probative value of the evidence. It may be that the emphasis placed by both prosecution and defence on the problem of doli incapax had the effect of deflecting her Honour from considering the more important issue raised by the applicant’s age at the commencement of the series of offences.
	
	
	Although I have posed the question of weight as one of significance, the real question is posed by s 101, namely whether the probative worth of the evidence substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect. Whether it did so required an analysis of the nature and extent of the likely prejudice and the evidentiary weight of each class of evidence. It is only when this task had been undertaken that the question whether and, if so, what directions would have been adequate to avoid the risk of unfair prejudice could be answered by the primary judge. With respect, the primary judge did not either in terms or in substance undertake the duty reposed in her by s 101(2). It follows that the discretion as to whether there should have been separate trials miscarried, leave to appeal should be granted and ground 2 upheld.
	
	
	It is not necessary to consider the other grounds of appeal since, in the event that error was demonstrated, the Court was invited by the parties to consider the question of separate trials itself, rather than remit the issue to the District Court, a course with which I agree.
	


Conclusion


	
	It is as well to set out explicitly the fundamental reason why the evidence of other sexual activity may be regarded as relevant to a particular charge under consideration. I found the following passage from the judgment of Leonard v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 267; 164 A Crim R 374 a helpful explanation –
	


“[49] … It seems to me that, where a man is charged with particular sexual assaults against a complainant, evidence that he committed similar assaults against the complainant on other occasions could be relevant in at least three different ways, only one of which would be as tendency evidence:

(1) It may be relevant to the extent of removing implausibility that might otherwise be attributed to the complainant’s account of the assaults charged if these assaults were thought to be isolated incidents, in particular implausibility associated with the way each party is said to have behaved on these particular occasions.

(2) It may be relevant in supporting an inference that the accused was sexually attracted to the complainant, so that he had a motive to act in a sexual manner towards the complainant.

(3) It may be relevant in supporting an inference that the accused not only had the motivation of sexual attraction, but also was a person who was prepared to act on that motivation to the extent of committing sexual assaults.

[50] Categories (1) and (2) depend entirely on the other sexual assaults being committed against the same person. Category (3) does not depend entirely on that, although generally evidence used for this purpose can have strong probative value only if the other assaults are against the same person.

…

[68] … I would accept that, even if there are theoretical distinctions between purposes (2) and (3), they may be considered of little practical significance where the complainant is a young child: sexual feelings of adult males towards young children are considered abnormal, and the ordinary motivational force of sexual feelings referred to in (2) cannot easily be kept distinct from a perception that a person having such feelings towards a young child is a particular kind of person who is likely to act on these feelings (engaging purpose (3)). Thus, evidence in such cases is not like evidence that a person charged with stealing (say) a rare stamp has a keen interest in such stamps, which would not be considered tendency evidence: it is unrealistic to liken evidence linking the ordinary human motivation of sexual feelings to a particular child, to evidence linking the ordinary human motivation of avarice to a particular kind of object such as a rare stamp, because as soon as one suggests that an adult male has sexual feelings towards a young child, one almost inevitably suggests that the person in question is the kind of person who is likely to assault the child.”


	
	It will be recalled that the Crown relied on and the primary judge accepted that the applicant’s conduct depicted what was submitted to be a pattern of conduct. Essentially, the tendency relied on as probative was the fact, if true, that the applicant had “consensual” sexual contact of various kinds, mostly involving fondling and fellatio and, on one occasion, penile intercourse, with very young children with whom he came in contact when, for some reason or other, he was an invitee in their homes. It is obvious that, although the primary judge did not explicitly refer to it in this context, by far the most significant feature of the course of conduct is that the applicant was significantly older than the complainants. Indeed, were it not for this factor, the evidence of his conduct could not be considered to have any probative worth: if the applicant were the same age, more or less, as the complainants, his conduct would be evidence of no more than unremarkable sexual activity; a mere interest in or, even, obsession with sex would not have any probative worth. The focus of the analysis of probative value must encompass, therefore, not only the ages of the complainants but also the age of the applicant.
	
	
	I would be prepared to accept, for the purposes of s 97, that the evidence of sexual conduct as an adult (as alleged in counts 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20) will have significant probative value, enlivening the question posed by s 101(2). However, so far as counts 1, 2 and 3 (and the evidence in respect of E) are concerned, I am not satisfied that it would have significant probative value in proof of any of the other counts, given the applicant’s young age at the time of the former conduct. Aside from the difficulty of predicting with any sufficient degree of likelihood from what the applicant did when he was a child of 11 or 13 years what propensities he might have as an adult, I do not think it to be sufficiently understood – and common sense is not an adequate guide – whether the alleged sexual conduct of the applicant at that age is “abnormal” in the relevant sense. Moreover, conduct committed at a time when a perpetrator may be too young to appreciate that what he or she is doing is seriously wrong is fundamentally different from what is otherwise the same conduct committed when its character is fully understood. This is not to give weight to the fact that, as it happens, the doctrine of doli incapax might apply to the earlier acts, since that is material only in the technical sense that it involves an additional element which the Crown must prove should the perpetrator be charged.
	
	
	I have already mentioned the very great prejudicial effect that evidence of sexual interference by an adult or even a teenager of a young child is likely to produce, particularly where the child is of the same sex. It is scarcely possible to overstate the emotional power of the label “paedophile”. It is inevitable that such evidence is very likely to engender the strongest feelings of disgust and disapprobation towards an accused and, on the other side, strong feelings of sympathy for the complainant. Obviously, this will make the task of dispassionately weighing the evidence of the complainant and of the accused (were he to give evidence) very much more difficult than if these strong emotions were not in play. One must accept that appropriate directions might ameliorate the prejudice to a degree but whether they would be likely to be sufficient to obviate real or substantial risk that the tendency evidence would be unfairly used against the accused, so that the probative value of the evidence will substantially outweigh its prejudicial effect, is a difficult question. The directions, in substance, will instruct the jury that they must not reason from the fact that the accused has a tendency, if they so find, to have sexual contact with young children where, by happenstance, he is able to do so, to his guilt of any particular charge and that the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, not only the charges said to be evidence of the tendency, but that he gave in to that tendency and committed the other alleged sexual acts. They must put aside any feelings of emotion, either towards the complainant or against the accused, and consider the evidence objectively and dispassionately. The tendency, if proved, is a relevant fact to be taken into account but the jury must carefully weigh up the evidence of the particular charge.
	
	
	Counts 4 to 7 (involving B) and 8 to 11 and 12 to 15 (involving A) were allegedly committed when the applicant was 15, 16, 17 or 18 years of age. It is appropriate, for present purposes to assess its probative weight as tendency evidence for relevance to the other alleged charges on the basis he was 16 years old. Even accepting (which I doubt) that this conduct would be significantly probative (vide s 97) of the charges allegedly committed when he was aged 19 (count 16), 20 (count 17), between 21 and 23 (count 18) and between 25 and 28 (counts 19 and 20), its probative weight, to my mind, is relatively slight when weighed against its prejudicial effect or, to use the language of s 101, does not substantially outweigh its prejudicial effect, even assuming that strong directions against misuse are given.
	
	
	Taking counts 1 to 3, 8 to 11 and 12 to 15 as a distinct category in light of the applicant’s age at the time they were allegedly committed, if a joint trial of all offences were to be conducted, it would be necessary to instruct the jury that the evidence on counts 1 to 3 could not be used to establish a tendency in proof of the other counts, although it could be used as relationship evidence. As to counts 8 to 11 and 12 to 15, the probative weight of one offence could be used, in my view, as establishing a tendency relevant to the other counts since, to my mind, its probative weight would substantially outweigh its prejudicial effect. The complicating feature is that it would be vital for the jury to understand that the evidence of counts 1 to 3, if accepted by them, could not be used as tendency in considering the other counts. Count 16 is in a separate class, since the applicant was about 19 years old at the time it was allegedly committed. In accordance with the view expressed above as to the significance of the applicant’s age at the time of the earlier offences, the evidence of those offences cannot be used as tendency evidence in support of this last offence since their prejudicial effect is not outweighed by their probative value. However (together with that of counts 1 to 3), that evidence would be admissible as relationship evidence in relation to count 16. Leaving aside difficulties that the jury might have in understanding and applying directions to this effect, the prejudicial effect of the evidence is very great and there is a substantial or, at least, real risk that, despite the directions, the jury will consciously or unconsciously use their conclusions as to counts 8 to 11 and 12 to 15 as tendency rather than relationship evidence or, assuming they find count 16 proved, wrongly use that finding in considering the earlier counts. It cannot be assumed that the jury will consider the counts in numerical or chronological order. It follows, as it seems to me, that there must be a separate trial of counts 1 to 3, counts 8 to 11 and counts 12 to 15 on the one hand and count 16 on the other. Alternatively, there could be a trial of all the counts involving offences against A on the basis that the evidence of the sexual conduct was relationship or context evidence and not tendency evidence.
	
	
	So far as the counts involving B are concerned (4 to 7 and 18), the evidence of the offences should not be used as tendency evidence given the disparity in the ages of the applicant on each occasion giving rise to the counts. Although the evidence of counts 4 to 7 is relevant as relationship evidence in respect of count 18, for the same reasons as concern the charges involving A, the evidence proving count 18 is extremely prejudicial; it has slight probative weight in respect of the other counts and therefore cannot be used as tendency evidence in proof of them. The risk of prejudice, to my mind, is so great that despite appropriate directions, counts 4 to 7 must be tried separately to count 18. Otherwise, again, the charges could be tried together if the evidence were to be available only as relationship or context evidence.
	
	
	The question which then arises is whether there should be a joint trial of counts 4 to 7 with counts 8 to 11 and 12 to 15, which are alleged to have occurred when the applicant was about 16 years of age. In this event, the tendency alleged would be to the effect that, as a 16 year old, the applicant had a propensity to engage in “consensual” sexual activity with prepubescent children of either sex. If counts 1 to 3 were to be tried with these counts (as I have already said, I would permit a joint trial of those counts with counts 8 to 11 and 12 to 15), the complicating feature would be that the evidence of the earlier counts would be inadmissible either as relationship or tendency evidence in respect of counts 4 to 7. It is highly prejudicial and I do not think that directions would be sufficient to ensure it would not be unfairly used. Accordingly, I would separate the trials of counts 1 to 3 on the one hand and 4 to 7, 8 to 11 and 12 to 15 on the other.
	
	
	That leaves counts 17 to 20, all of which were allegedly committed when the applicant was an adult but involving three complainants, of whom two are female and one male. C and D were about 5 years old at the time, whilst B was 10. In respect of the offences involving C and D, it seems to me that the probative worth of the evidence concerning them does substantially outweigh its prejudicial effect. This is not so clear so far as the offence against B is concerned but, on balance, I think the fact that she was prepubescent and the applicant was 21, 22, or 23 are sufficient, with the surrounding circumstances, to give the evidence of this offence sufficient probative value in respect of the other alleged offences as to substantially outweigh its prejudicial effect. I would not order separate trials of these offences, subject to resolving the issue of concoction or contamination, which arises because counts 17 and 18 concern C and B, who are sisters.
	


Concoction and contamination


	
	In AE v R [2008] NSWCCA 52 the Court (Bell JA, R S Hulme, Latham JJ) said –
	


“[44] The happening of the assaults against PNE and CNE was in issue at trial. This was a matter that was significant to the assessment of the probative value of the evidence demonstrating the relevant tendency evidence as well as by way of coincidence reasoning. The Judge approached the matter by considering whether the Crown had excluded the possibility of joint concoction. He found that it had. If two or more persons make similar allegations about another in circumstances in which no possibility of joint concoction exists the allegations may possess significant probative value for the reasons that are explained in Hoch v The Queen (1988) 165 CLR 292 at 296 per Mason CJ, Wilson J and Gaudron J at 296. If the possibility of joint concoction cannot be excluded the evidence does not possess the same probative value since there exists another explanation for the circumstance that each complainant has made like allegations. Hoch was concerned with the admission of similar fact evidence under the common law and propounded the “no other rational view” test that was adopted in Pfennig v The Queen (1995) 182 CLR 461 at 482-483 per Mason CJ, Deane J and Dawson J. This is not the test for the admission of tendency or coincidence evidence under the Act: R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319. However, it was not an error to consider the possibility of joint concoction in assessing the probative value of the evidence. To the extent that his Honour did so, it was an error to find that there was no possibility of joint concoction: the complainants were sisters and were in contact with one another at the time each made her complaint. Insofar as the Judge assessed the probative value of PNE’s allegations as being substantial in proof of the allegation that the appellant assaulted CNE his Honour erred.

[45] The evidence of the assaults on PNE was not admissible on the trial of the counts involving CNE unless its probative value substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect that it may have had on the appellant. The prejudicial effect is likely to have been great. This is so notwithstanding that the jury acquitted the appellant on 12 of the counts which depended on PNE’s evidence. The jury may have accepted PNE as truthful but considered that her recall of the offences was not sufficiently reliable to establish beyond reasonable doubt the happening of the events as they were particularised in the indictment. The risk that the jury would be overwhelmed by the evidence of the long course of sexual misconduct against PNE in considering whether the Crown had proved the counts charging offences against CNE was real. We consider that the Judge erred in concluding that the probative value of PNE’s allegations as evidencing a tendency to sexually molest young female members of the appellant’s household substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect the evidence might have on the appellant’s case.”

It is clear from the test applied in [45] that their Honours were considering the significance of the issue of concoction for the purposes of applying s 101, accepting that it was relevant to weighing the probative value of the evidence for tendency purposes. The possibility of concoction, by this reasoning, reduces the value of the evidence and may lead to its exclusion as (with the other evidence) not substantially outweighing the prejudice it engenders. However, as distinct from the position before the Act, the possibility of concoction does not ipso facto so reduce its probative value as to mandate its exclusion.


	
	In BP v R; R v BP [2010] NSWCCA 303 Hodgson JA (Price and Fullerton JJ agreeing) said –
	


“[110] One matter that powerfully affects both the probative value of tendency evidence and the possibility of prejudicial effect is the risk of concoction or contamination of evidence. If the evidence of tendency from different witnesses is reasonably capable of explanation on the basis of concoction, then it will not have the necessary probative value: Hoch v The Queen (1988) 165 CLR 292. However, this will be so only if there is a real chance rather than a merely speculative chance of concoction: R v Colby [1999] NSWCCA 261 at [111], R v OGD (No 2) [2000] NSWCCA 404; (2000) 50 NSWLR 433 at [74], [112]. The onus is on the Crown to negate the “real chance” of concoction: OGD at [74], R v F [2002] NSWCCA 125; (2002) 129 A Crim R 126 at [48].

[111] Relevant to consideration of concoction are the factors mentioned in Hoch at 297, namely relationship, opportunity and motive. One of these on its own is not sufficient to base a finding of a real possibility of concoction: R v RN [2005] NSWCCA 413 at [15], OGD at [111] – [112].

[112] In my opinion, subject to the question of concoction, to which I will return, features of the appellant’s conduct described by each complainant were sufficiently similar and sufficiently unusual for the evidence of each of them to have significant probative value in showing the specified tendencies …

[115] Turning to the question of concoction, in my opinion no error is shown in the trial judge’s finding that there was no real possibility of concoction.

…

[123] [In relation] to the submission that there was a risk of contamination] … it is not a risk of any contamination whatsoever that would necessarily require the exclusion of evidence: it must be a risk of contamination that goes to the substance of the evidence, and not merely to incidental details of no materiality. I accept that, unless the Crown negates a real chance of contamination going to the substance of the evidence, then the evidence of other witnesses should not be admitted as tendency evidence. However, the risk of unconscious influence as to incidental details would not in my view necessarily require the evidence to be excluded.

[124] Whether or not this view is correct, in my opinion, having regard to the circumstances I have referred to, no error is shown in the trial judge’s finding that there was no real possibility of contamination in this case.”

No reference was made to ­­­­AE and, although Ellis was cited (at [109]), this was not a propos either Pfennig or Hoch v The Queen [1988] HCA 50; 165 CLR 292. However, BP (as with AE) appears to be authority at least for the proposition that evidence suggesting the [real] possibility of contamination or concoction is relevant to the assessment of probative weight: see also FB v R; R v FB [2011] NSWCCA 217; cf BJS v R (No 1) [2011] NSWCCA 239, BJS v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 123 and Jones v R [2014] NSWCCA 280 preferring the approach of AE to the significance of Hoch. Neither Court in BP or AE considered the possible application of R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228 (perhaps because it was concerned with s 137 of the Act and not s 101 although, as Spigelman CJ pointed out (at [57]), the approach to both sections was “similar”), which held that, except in “limited circumstances”, issues of credibility or reliability are not relevant in the question of admissibility; rather, the evidence must be taken at its highest: [51]-[57]. This followed from the meaning of “probative value” in the Dictionary, defined by reference to the extent to which the proposed evidence “could” rationally affect the relevant assessment.


	
	In DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9; 84 NSWLR 758; 215 A Crim R 349 a five judge Bench (Bathurst CJ, Allsop P, Whealy JA, McClellan CJ at CL and McCallum J) was convened to consider the application of s 98, which deals with coincidence evidence and, like s 97 concerning tendency evidence, requires the court to consider whether the evidence has “significant probative value”. The facts in contention comprised, in substance, the Crown case and were contended to provide, taken together, circumstantial proof of the appellants’ guilt.
	
	
	Whealy J said –
	


“[55] In my opinion, it is plain that s 98, in its terms, poses this simple question: whether the evidence being considered is capable, to a significant degree, of rationally affecting the assessment (ultimately by a jury) of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. Again, in its terms, it requires the trial judge to assess whether the evidence has capacity to that extent and for that purpose. In R v Shamouil Spigelman CJ, in examining s 137 of the Evidence Act, pointed out that, by reason of the terminology of the Dictionary definition of ‘probative value’, the focus is on the capacity of the evidence to have the effect mentioned. As the Chief Justice said, ‘It does not direct attention to what a tribunal of fact is likely to conclude’.

[56] Assessment of the probative value of the evidence, whether for the purposes of ss 97, 98, 101 or 137 Evidence Act, does not, generally speaking, depend on any assessment of its credibility or reliability: Shamouil at 237 [60]. Nor does it depend upon any prediction of the likelihood that a jury will in fact accept it. The trial judge considering probative value has to make his own estimate or assessment of probative value predicated upon the assumption that the jury will accept the evidence.

…

[78] In this appeal the Crown has conceded that, in performing the task under s 98, a trial judge may, in an appropriate case, have regard to an alternative explanation arising on the evidence. The Crown, however, insisted that, in so doing, the trial judge is restricted to examining whether the Crown hypothesis has cogency, that is, whether the Crown evidence is capable of being regarded as significant in its ability to prove the Crown case. If the coincidence evidence, either by itself or having regard to other evidence in the Crown case, positively and forcefully suggested an explanation consistent with innocence, then the coincidence evidence could scarcely be regarded as important or of consequence in proving the fact or facts in issue. What is required is this: the trial judge must ask whether the possibility of such an alternative explanation substantially alters his (or her) view as to the significant capacity of the Crown evidence, if accepted, to establish the fact in issue. Does the alternative possibility, in the judge's view, rob the evidence of its otherwise cogent capacity to prove the Crown's case? If it does not, the trial judge may safely conclude that the evidence has significant probative value.

[79] In a practical sense, there are two avenues of approach to be taken. First, in examining the coincidence evidence (together with other material already in evidence or to be adduced) the trial judge is required to ask whether there emerges, from a consideration of all the Crown evidence, a possible explanation inconsistent with guilt. For regard to be had to the alternative explanation, it must be a real possibility, not a fanciful one. It must be a broad or overarching possibility, capable of being stated in general terms, even though it may derive from an individual piece or pieces of evidence or the evidence taken as a whole.

[80] Second, the trial judge must ask whether that possibility substantially alters his (or her) view as to the otherwise significant capacity of the coincidence evidence to establish the fact or facts in issue. Of course, if the trial Judge has already concluded that the coincidence evidence does not reach that level of significance in terms of its capacity, he will have rejected the evidence in terms of s 98. In that situation, the possibility of an alternative inference may, for the time being, be set to one side. Later in the trial, when the evidence has concluded, that possibility will become a matter for the jury to assess and determine when it comes to consider whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.

[81] The Crown, in making its concession, however, stressed that at no stage in this process was the trial judge required or entitled to assess the actual weight of any part of the evidence, or to make any actual assessment concerning the probabilities of any alternative theory. Nor was the trial judge required or entitled to make a comparison of the Crown theory and the probabilities of any alternative theory. This proposition appears consistent with established authority. Any attempt by the trial judge to anticipate the actual weight the jury would attach to the evidence is prohibited, as I have explained.

[82] I agree with the Crown’s concession …”


	
	Bathurst CJ, having noted (at [8]) that the judge must assess the possibility of the evidence being relevant and is not required to assess whether the evidence would affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue, that is, “engage in a fact-finding exercise involving an assessment of the reliability and credibility of the evidence”, (citing Shamouil), later stated –
	


“[10] … [A]s Whealy JA has pointed out (at [78]-[81]), the trial judge in forming a view as to whether the evidence has significant probative value must consider by reference to the evidence itself or other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party tendering it, whether there is a real possibility of an alternate explanation inconsistent with (in this case) the guilt of the party against whom it is tendered. This is because the availability of such an alternative hypothesis will be relevant to forming the view required by the section that the evidence has significant probative value. However, this does not involve either undertaking the fact-finding analysis suggested by senior counsel for DSJ or reaching a conclusion that the explanation for the coincidence proffered by the party seeking to tender the evidence was more probable than an alternative hypothesis. Each of these approaches go beyond what is required by the terms of s 98(1)(b) of the Act and would involve the judge usurping the fact-finding role of the jury.”

Allsop P and McCallum J agreed with Whealy JA and the comments of the Chief Justice; McClellan CJ at CL agreed with Whealy JA. It may be worth noting that s 101 did not call for consideration, since the coincidental facts relied on were not relevantly prejudicial as reflecting on the character or conduct of the accused. It may be for this reason that neither AE nor BP was mentioned.


	
	In R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121; 84 NSWLR 363 a five judge Bench of this Court (Basten JA, Hoeben CJ at CL, Simpson, Blanch and Price JJ) was convened to reconsider Shamouil in light of the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v Dupas (No 3) [2009] VSCA 202; 26 VR 380 that it was wrong. The evidence in contention was that of two recorded telephone conversations between the complainant and the accused. All judges accepted that Shamouil stated the law in this State but how it should be applied was not agreed. Basten JA (with Simpson J, in the minority on the effect of Shamouil) said –
	


“Application of principles - s 137

[66] The importance of Shamouil lies not in the precise language used (the judgment is not to be treated as a statute) but in the general principle it articulates. The operation of that principle may vary depending upon the circumstances of the case. In broad terms, the principle has three elements:

(1) in determining inadmissibility under s 137, the judge should assess the evidence proffered by the prosecution on the basis of its capacity to advance the prosecution case;

(2) it follows from (1) that the judge should deal with the evidence on the basis of any inference or direct support for a fact in issue which would be available to a reasonable jury considering the proffered evidence, without speculating as to whether the jury would in fact accept the evidence and give it particular weight;

(3) it also follows from (1) that the judge should not make his or her own findings as to whether or not to accept the inference or give the evidence particular weight.

[67] This principle does not produce uniformity of approach in all cases. The ""weighing"" exercise required if s 137 is engaged not only involves incommensurates, but elements that may interrelate in a variety of ways. For example, in the present case there are a number of possible inferences to be drawn from the recorded conversations. Those on which the prosecution relied, based on the key response of the accused … were that his response –

(a) was made after he had identified who the complainant was;

(b) involved a realisation that she was referring to sexual activities between them, and

(c) involved acceptance of the occurrence of such activities.

Other available inferences were, for example, that:

(d) the respondent had not correctly identified the complainant;

(e) whether he had or not, he guessed she was referring to sexual activities and gave a jocular response, and

(f) even if there had been some form of acceptance of her suggestion, because no particular activities had been identified, his admission could not support any particular count in the indictment.

[68] Determining which inferences should be accepted was quintessentially a function for the jury. Before the exclusionary obligation in s 137 could arise, the judge had to identify the relevant ""unfair prejudice"". That meant identifying how the evidence (if admitted) would be left to a jury and wherein lay the risk of misuse. No particular element of prejudice was identified. Had it been, the risk that a jury would not appreciate the nature of the problem after proper direction had then to be assessed. The trial judge did not undertake that exercise because the previous step had not been taken. That was an error of law …” [Emphasis added.]

(I would respectfully point out that a submission that the court must weigh the probative value of the evidence does not involve the contention that this required assessment of what the jury should do but, rather, what the jury could find: the lower the rational support for the prosecution’s contention, the greater the need for speculation and the less the probative value.)


	
	In the result, Basten JA held (at [72]) that, since the jury could readily be directed as to the alternative inferences, if they drew the inference contended for by the prosecution, there would be no unfair prejudice. However, if the jury thought that the appellant was referring to another schoolgirl, no inference was available as to the truthfulness of the complainant’s evidence. Such a direction would be readily understood and any risk of unfair prejudice was fanciful.
	
	
	Hoeben CJ at CL agreed (at [86]) that, “when assessing the probative value of the prosecution evidence sought to be excluded, the Court should not consider its credibility, reliability or weight” and (at [87]) that Shamouil was not wrong and should be followed in this State. However, his Honour disagreed (at [88] et seq) with Basten JA and Simpson J (as her Honour then was, to whose judgment I refer below) as to the significance of the availability of available innocent inferences inconsistent with the prosecution case which, in his view, could properly be taken into account in assessing the probative value of the impugned evidence, as distinct from determining which should be or is most likely to be preferred. Accordingly, his Honour concluded (at [90]-[91]) that, because of the competing inferences, the probative weight of the evidence was outweighed by its prejudicial effect, so that there “is a significant risk that the jury would give the evidence more weight than it deserves and that the content of the evidence might ‘inflame the jury or divert the jurors from their task’”, quoting from Festa (supra) at [51]. This risk could not be adequately met by a direction from the trial judge.
	
	
	Simpson J (at [162]) adhered to her Honour’s concurrence with the judgment of Spigelman CJ in Shamouil and went on to say that the relevant predictive judgment that must be made by a trial judge in considering s 137 is “of what use the jury could rationally make of the evidence, in the context of the trial evidence in its complete form” (at [167]). There “is nothing obvious in the language of the statute that suggests that probative value, at the admission stage, is to be determined by reference to the weight to be assigned to the evidence”. Accordingly, “questions of [actual] credibility, reliability and weight play no part in the assessment of probative value with respect to s 137” (at [175]). (I would respectfully suggest, however, that it is difficult to see how it would significantly alter the meaning of s 137 if it were to read “the court must refuse to admit evidence … if the weight of the evidence is significantly less than the danger of unfair prejudice”.)
	
	
	Blanch J, in agreeing (at [194]) that Shamouil should be followed and that, in undertaking the task posed by s 137, cited DSJ (at [10], [78]) as authority for the view that whether evidence has significant probative value must be evaluated by reference to any real possibility of an alternate explanation inconsistent with the guilt of the accused, since it might “rob the evidence of its otherwise cogent capacity to prove the Crown’s case”. Because innocent interpretations of the accused’s words were open as a real possibility, the trial judge was correct to reject it. Price J agreed with Hoeben CJ at CL that the appeal should be dismissed, primarily for the reason that the requirement of s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act that the exclusion of the evidence must “substantially weaken” the prosecution case was not satisfied “on the assumption that the jury accepted the evidence”, observing (at [215]) in this context that the “prosecution case is to be considered as a whole and questions of weight are irrelevant”, citing Shamouil. His Honour considered that it was “unnecessary to consider questions of competing explanations as the evidence viewed at its highest is weak” and added the comment –
	


“[224] Whilst upon my analysis, it is unnecessary to consider the conflict in the approaches to be taken to s 137 Evidence Act since the decision in Dupas v The Queen [2012] VSCA 328, it seems to me that enabling the trial judge to consider questions of credibility, reliability or weight when s 137 is invoked, is likely to enhance the fundamental principle that an accused is to receive a fair trial. Although Simpson J … refers to the practical difficulties that may arise by adopting such an approach, it is not uncommon for a witness to be cross-examined during a voir dire and an assessment can be made by the trial judge of the actual probative value of the evidence. More often than not, the probative value of evidence may be assessed from the witness statements without the necessity of calling witnesses.

[225] In my opinion, the approach taken in Dupas does much to avoid evidence being before a jury which in reality (rather than being taken at its highest in favour of the Crown) has little probative value and is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused.”

(This boat has sailed, but I wish to express my strong agreement with these remarks and with the correctness of the highly persuasive reasoning of the Victorian Court of Appeal in Dupas v The Queen (2012) 218 A Crim R 507.)


	
	It seems to me, therefore, that what might, with respect, be called the “absolutist” approach of Basten JA and Simpson J did not prevail and that the position, as XY left it, is that, at least where the impugned evidence itself gives rise to competing inferences, one or more consistent with innocence, this was relevant to considering whether, and to what extent, the evidence has significant probative value in light of the issues in the trial and the other evidence relied on by the prosecution. This analysis assumes acceptance by the jury of the fact and content of the conversation. Another example might be: the prosecution evidence identifying the voice of the accused is inferential and the uncontested foundational facts left open the significant possibility that it was not his. It seems to me that this would be regarded as substantially reducing the probative value of the conversation and, likely, it was not admissible; otherwise, if the identification of the voice was simply the subject of competing evidence, one witness asserting the voice was that of the accused and another asserting that it was not. This latter example strikes me as rather more similar to the problem posed by the possibility of concoction or contamination than where the issue concerns inferences available from an uncontested conversation.
	
	
	In JG v R [2014] NSWCCA 138, a separate trial of sexual offences in respect of four complainants had been refused on the basis that the evidence of the two complainants was cross-admissible as tendency and coincidence evidence. Part of the coincidence evidence concerned items seized from the appellant's home to support the assertion of one of the complainants that the appellant showed him pornographic videos and magazines. As it happened, at the first trial, the jury was unable to agree. At the second trial, the defence submitted that the cross-admissibility question should be considered in light of the complainant’s cross-examination at the first trial and the appellant’s evidence in which, amongst other evidence, he gave an innocent explanation for his conduct in relation to the seized items. The appeal was dismissed. Simpson J (Hall and Schmidt JJ agreeing), holding that the reasoning in DSJ applied also to s 97, summarised the position as follows –
	


“[105] … [The submissions as to the matters that the trial judge should consider in determining the admissibility of the tendency and coincidence evidence] were, in my opinion, misconceived. The task of a judge determining admissibility of evidence under s 97 or s 98 is to decide, first, whether it would have ""significant probative value"". Since ""probative value"" is the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue (Evidence Act, Dictionary), the assessment is of the capacity of the evidence to have that effect to a significant degree. In DSJ v DPP (Cth); NS v DPP (Cth) [2012] NSWCCA 9; 84 NSWLR 158, this Court held that, for the purposes of s 98, the assessment of probative value may take into account any alternative explanation (in a criminal case, inconsistent with guilt) of which there is a real possibility: at [10] (per Bathurst CJ) and at [78]-[82] (per Whealy JA). That appears to be because s 98 specifically directs attention to other evidence adduced, or to be adduced, by the tendering party. (The same must, obviously, apply to evidence tendered under s 97.) Both the Chief Justice and Whealy JA, however, also held that in the assessment of probative value it is no part of the judge's function to embark upon an assessment of the credibility of the evidence. That is, and remains, within the province of the jury: R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338; 156 A Crim R 308; R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121; 84 NSWLR 363 at [167]. That applies equally whether the evidence is tendered under s 97 or s 98, or is sought to be excluded under s 137. In a criminal case, a further assessment is required: to be admissible under s 97 or s 98, the probative value of the evidence must substantially outweigh any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant (s 101(2)).

[106] The submissions put to Garling ADCJ invited his Honour to make an assessment of the probative value of the evidence by evaluating the credibility of the two complainants on the basis of the evidence they gave in the first trial, particularly their cross-examination. That was wrong in principle, and Garling ADCJ was correct not to succumb to the invitation.”


	
	Jones v R [2014] NSWCCA 280 concerned the significance of the possibility of concoction or contamination in the assessment of the probative value of tendency evidence sought to be used in the trial of the appellant for sexual offences against three complainants. The trial judge had concluded that the possibility was relevant only to issues of credibility and reliability and Shamouil precluded any consideration of it. Referring to DJS and XY, Bellew J (with whom Gleeson JA and Schmidt J agreed) concluded that the primary judge had overstated the effect of Shamouil and that his Honour should have taken into account, when assessing the probative value of the tendency evidence, “such competing inference(s) as may arise from the evidence”, without determining its weight or the likely acceptance or rejection of the evidence by the jury (at [87]-[88]). Bellew J went on to say –
	


“[90] It is conceivable that there may be cases in which evidence of concoction and contamination gives rise to competing inferences. It may be that in such a case, those inferences are relevant to a determination of the probative value of the evidence. However, the evidence in the present case does not give rise to such inferences.”

His Honour noted that the evidence of the relationship between the complainants was insufficient to support a finding of concoction; there was no evidence of motive to do so; neither had the suggestion of opportunity or allegation of concoction been put to them. The circumstances in which the complaints were made appeared to be spontaneous. The trial judge’s conclusion that there was no evidence of concoction was well open.


	
	In DJW v R [2015] NSWCCA 164, which involved the proposed use of the evidence of six complainants as tendency evidence where the trial judge found there was a real risk of concoction and contamination in respect of two of the complainants but no such risk as to the rest, R A Hulme J (with whom Simpson JA and Bellew J agreed) concluded that the trial judge had correctly found that there was no real risk of concoction or contamination in respect of the four remaining complainants. Jones was, in substance, followed.
	
	
	In McIntosh v R [2015] NSWCCA 184 the Court revisited the problem in the context of the issue of concoction or contamination. Basten JA (with whom Hidden and Wilson JJ agreed) said –
	


“(iii) Assessment of probative value – concoction

[42] The role that a possibility of concoction or contamination may play in the application of s 97 requires careful consideration. The first question requires the assessment of whether the proposed evidence has significant probative value. That assessment may depend on whether the evidence is accepted by the jury or not. If it is rejected in its entirety, it will have no probative value. On the other hand, if it is accepted in its entirety, it will still be necessary to assess its probative value. That exercise is separate from the assessment of its possible prejudicial effect.

[43] Two questions arise in this context: first, are questions of reliability and credibility relevant in assessing probative value? Some assessment must be made both for the purposes of ss 97 and 98 and for the separate exercise required under s 101. The latter section has a similar function (though the language differs) to s 137, which requires the Court to refuse to admit prosecution evidence ‘if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.’ The proper approach to assessing probative value for the purposes of s 137 was discussed in R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121; 84 NSWLR 363. In that case the Court, following R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228 held that the function of the judge in applying s 137 was to assess the capacity of the evidence to support a particular finding, but not its credibility and reliability, those being matters to be left to the jury if the evidence be admitted [XY at [2]]. That approach depended in part on the definition of ‘probative value’ in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act as meaning ‘the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect that assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue’ [emphasis added; see XY at [43] referring to the reasoning of Spigelman CJ in Shamouil at [61]]. Spigelman CJ in Shamouil noted that ‘[t]he focus on capability draws attention to what it is open for the tribunal of fact to conclude’ [Shamouil at [61], emphasis in original]. Further, the words ‘rationally affect’ were apt to refer to ‘capability rather than weight’ [Shamouil at [62]; XY at [43]].

[44] In the discussion which followed in XY, I considered the extent to which reliability and credibility could be involved in the exercise to be undertaken by the judge under s 137. In particular, that discussion noted that the term “credibility” can be used to refer to plausibility, objectively considered. On the other hand, it may refer to an assessment of the truthfulness of the witness [XY at [49]]. The term “reliability” can have similar nuances of meaning.

[45] In adopting the reasoning in Shamouil and XY, it is appropriate to acknowledge that the exercise to be undertaken pursuant to s 97 differs in one respect from that likely to arise under s 137. It was noted in XY at [44] that the question of exclusion under s 137 was likely to arise in isolation from the full circumstances of the prosecution case. By contrast, both s 97 and s 98 require the judge to assess the probative value of the proffered evidence “either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced” by the prosecution. Acknowledging the difference in statutory language, the practical differences will often be less marked. That is partly because the exercise required by s 137 will not be carried out in total ignorance of the other evidence to be called in the prosecution case. Similarly, as demonstrated by the conduct of the present case, a decision to admit evidence under ss 97, 98 and 101 is most likely to be made before the full detail of the prosecution evidence has been revealed. The primary reason for the additional language in ss 97 and 98 is that, like the general law principle relating to ‘similar fact evidence’, tendency and coincidence evidence cannot have probative value except in a context where, for example, both the conduct of the accused and the relevant tendency to act have been identified with some particularity.

[46] The concept of ‘concoction’ suggests a deliberate fabrication of the evidence. By contrast, the term “contamination” may involve an unconscious process of suggestion being adopted.

[47] Whilst, in determining probative value as a question of capability to affect the assessment of a fact in issue, the court is not required to disregard inherent implausibility, on the other hand, contestable questions of credibility and reliability are not for the trial judge, but for the jury. Accordingly, the suggestion that the possibility of concoction is a factor which must be taken into account in determining whether particular evidence has significant probative value should not be accepted.

[48] It should be acknowledged that this conclusion is inconsistent with the approach identified in the leading Australian text, Cross on Evidence [JD Heydon, Cross on Evidence (LexisNexis, 10th ed, 2015) at 768]. However, that reasoning appears to have relied upon cases which predated R v Ellis in 2003 [see R v OGD (No 2) [2000] NSWCCA 404; 50 NSWLR 433; R v Colby [1999] NSWCCA 261]. Further, the view accepted here appears to be consistent with the explanation of R v XY accepted by the author of Cross as the applicable law in this State [JD Heydon, “Is the Weight of Evidence Material to its Admissibility?” (2014) 26 Current Issues in Criminal Justice 219 at 227 and 237].”


	
	Counsel for the appellant, as it happened, had not objected to the tendency evidence on the ground of possible concoction, so that it was not an error for the trial judge not to have considered the matter. Accordingly, the discussion as to whether it was capable of being relevant was, with respect, obiter dicta. Furthermore, the provision under consideration was s 97, not s 101. This may explain why no reference was made to AE in this context, though it was cited (at [13]) with Ellis in connection with the need to apply the statutory test as distinct from that of the common law as expounded in Hoch. Nor was any reference made to BP, DSJ, JG, Jones or DJW (though these last two were then restricted). In the result, given the way the case was run, it was not an error for the trial judge not to consider the possibility of concoction and the ground of appeal that raised the question was rejected.
	
	
	It will be noted that Basten JA was considering the question posed by s 97 whether the proposed evidence has significant probative value. That question is not at all the same as that posed by s 101, requiring the evidence to be excluded unless its probative value substantially outweighs the prejudicial effect.
	
	
	I have not found it possible to reconcile BP, DSJ, JG, Jones and DJW with McIntosh, despite the fact that issues of contamination and concoction reflect directly on the credibility and reliability of the evidence of the complainants. The weight of authority favours the view, in my respectful opinion that, in considering the question under s 101 whether the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect, the court is entitled to take into account any real possibility that the putative tendency may be explained by contamination or concoction and for this purpose, to consider the relevant evidence on the voir dire. Nor does there seem to be a basis for excluding from the scope of the enquiry other evidence that might weaken the capacity of the impugned evidence to rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the fact in issue. However, in light of the finding of the trial judge, which should be accepted for the reasons mentioned below, that there is no reasonable possibility of concoction, it is unnecessary to resolve this question.
	
	
	In this case, the finding of the trial judge that there was no evidence of concoction was not disputed, as such. It was submitted, relying on the passage set out above from AE, that the mere fact that complainants B and C were sisters in contact with each other at the time of their complaints, sufficed to establish the reasonable possibility of concoction. The trial judge found there was no evidence of a motive for concoction, the complainants denied doing so and, implicitly, that there was no reasonable possibility of concoction. It is not for this court to examine for itself the evidence upon which her Honour’s findings were based. Nor is it appropriate, by exploring the factual basis for a conclusion in another case, to compare the circumstances here to see whether the trial judge’s decision was open. A finding of fact from another case, however distinguished the judge, provides no basis for concluding that, on the facts here, her Honour’s conclusion was not open.
	
	
	It follows that the issue of concoction or contamination should be put aside in determining the extent of separation of the trials. Accordingly, I would not be prepared to separate the trials of counts 16 to 20.
	


Orders


	
	Given that I am in the minority, it is unnecessary to propose any orders.
	


Additional comments


	
	In accordance with the usual practice, Beech-Jones J has been good enough to provide me with a copy of his judgment in draft. It raises a number of matters upon which I wish to respectfully comment. The first of these concerns the identification of prejudice by counsel in submissions to the primary judge. Beech-Jones J (at [108]) points out that counsel relied on the matters that had been identified by Hoeben CJ at CL in Sokolowskyj which, his Honour said, had been taken out of context and inapposite. Of course, the passage italicised by Beech-Jones J was the situation that had been thrown up by the circumstances of the particular case, but this was a mere example of the general principle which had been invoked. It is correct that Hoeben CJ at CL had concluded that the proposed tendency evidence did not satisfy the requirements of s 97(1)(b) and that this was sufficient to dispose of the appeal (at [45]). However, his Honour went on to consider the possible application of s 101(2) in the event that there might be a doubt about this conclusion. In the course of that discussion, his Honour made the remarks at [48], characterised by Beech-Jones as inapposite in the present case. However, with respect, the Chief Judge was simply pointing out why the particular evidence might be prejudicial. In the present case, counsel submitted that the likely characterisation of the applicant as a sexual deviant, in brief, might lead the jury to be dismissive of his evidence and would be disinclined to give him the benefit of a reasonable doubt. This reasoning – which is simply a way of characterising the risks inherent in cases where the tendency evidence is likely to give rise to indignation or emotional disapprobation – is precisely the assessment that s 101 assumes may be present and requires to be considered. In the nature of the case, greater precision may not be possible and all that can be done is an assessment of the risk that the rational assessment of the evidence (including the tendency evidence) might not occur. The mere fact that, here, the tendency (in substance, to have opportunistic sexual contact with prepubescent children) happens to be the very tendency involved in the charges does not change the substance of the matter. That, of course, is highly relevant to its probative value but whether it has the capacity to overwhelm the dispassionate consideration of the other evidence is a different question. With respect, the mere fact that the tendency evidence here, if true, shows that the applicant has committed acts of the very kind alleged in the offences and thus is more likely to have committed the offence under consideration does not mean that submissions directed to the unfair prejudicial result that adducing such evidence might have is vague or uncertain. Of its nature, there is no bright line. The argument focused on whether there is a risk that the jury might give it, because of its character, greater weight than it fairly bore and otherwise affect the jury’s dispassionate consideration of the evidence as a whole. That the propensity established sexual deviancy is also obvious (indeed, essential since mere conventional sexual acts could scarcely be used to prove a sexually deviant act). Again, the mere fact that the deviancy was, as it happened, of the kind involved in the offences does not mean that counsel’s citation of Sokolowskyj was inapt: he was pointing to the inherent adverse character of evidence of that kind. In Shamouil, Spigelman CJ applied the test set out by McHugh J in Festa (at 609-10) that the relevant prejudice occurs “when the jury are likely to give the evidence more weight than it deserves or when the nature or contents of the evidence may influence the jury or divert the jurors from that task”. This was precisely what counsel endeavoured to establish. I am therefore unable to agree that no relevant form of prejudice was identified. There was no requirement to suggest any different tendency to that alleged which might prejudice the jury (though that happened to be what occurred in Sokolowsyj). Nor, with respect, do I agree that counsel had submitted merely that it was unfairly prejudicial to treat the tendency (appropriately) as evidence of the applicant’s tendency to commit the alleged offences, as is made clear by his submissions on this point set out above.
	
	
	Beech-Jones J has concluded –
	


“[108] … In fact the only relevant form of prejudice that pertained was the risk of the jury reasoning in the impermissible manner that is always present with such evidence and which the standard directions warn against.”


	
	I apologise in advance if I am mistaken about this but it seems, with respect, that this suggests, in effect, that evidence of a tendency of the kind that an offender would have if he or she has committed the offences in issue does not, as a matter of principle, raise any problematic risk of unfair prejudice which cannot be overcome by directions. If so, this must be wrong. First, it is inconsistent with s 101(2) which assumes that tendency evidence may need to be excluded despite the possibility of corrective directions. Secondly, it amounts to, in effect, a refusal to consider the very questions posed by the sub-paragraph – namely what is the probative value of the evidence and what is the risk of unfair prejudice. Obviously enough, some tendency evidence will carry only a slight risk of distorting the jury’s consideration but other evidence is likely to have far more impact. In this latter class, allegations of paedophilia are particularly likely to engender strong feelings of indignation, disgust and disapprobation. One only needs a passing acquaintance with daily media reports to demonstrate this obvious truth, if it were not sufficiently obvious already. It cannot accord with principle that, merely because the tendency evidence is such that it establishes the accused has a propensity to do the kind of things that form part of the case alleged against him and hence is more likely than someone without that propensity to have committed them, to conclude that therefore directions will always suffice. With respect, it seems to me that Beech-Jones J’s analysis of this issue is at odds with the section itself, since it involves no consideration of the character and likely (inappropriate) prejudicial effect of the impugned evidence.
	
	
	It is obvious enough that, disagreement about principle aside, I respectfully differ from my colleagues essentially on three fundamental measures: first, the actual probative value of the evidence is less than their Honours have concluded is the case; secondly, the risk of unfair prejudice is very much more considerable than they assess it to be and; thirdly, the real ability of directions to avert an unfair trial is significantly less than their Honours implicitly calculate. To put it succinctly, the characterisation of the applicant as a paedophile since the age of 10, into his teens and then as an adult, is likely to overwhelm dispassionate consideration of the evidence, despite any amount of admonition by the trial judge. In my respectful view, the approach of Simpson JA and Beech-Jones J will, in large measure, render s 101(2) an empty letter. It goes even further down the road of what was described in Dupas at [226] as the undermining of “an important safeguard which the common law provided against an unfair trial and which the legislatures intended should be replicated in the Evidence statutes”.
	
	
	I should add another relevant consideration, which concerns the asymmetry of the various occasions that are said to establish the relevant tendency. This is a rare situation: mostly it will not matter in which order the jury considers the charges, but this is not so in this case. Thus, I think it must be obvious that the offences committed when the applicant was an adult could not be significantly probative of the likelihood that he committed similar offences when a child of 10 or 11 (or, for that matter, as a teenager). As it happens, the converse must also be true. I do not doubt that, if the only tendency evidence was that of his conduct as a child, it would not be significantly probative of his conduct as an adult. (Necessarily, its prejudicial effect would not be outweighed by its probative value if s 101(2) came into play.) Although it is not essential to this point, working back from his adult offences (if that is where the jury starts), that evidence, if it passed the hurdle of s 97, would not be sufficiently probative for the purposes of s 101(2), in respect of the teenage offences. Thus, we have the unusual situation that, if the jury started at one end of the chronology, the evidence would be inadmissible as tendency in respect of certainly the childhood offences and (at least, to my mind) the teenage offences. The apparent persuasiveness of what has been called the “pattern” depends in large part on it being a sequence moving from conduct whilst the applicant was young to that when he is older. But it cannot be so regarded, since no such assumption can be made as to the order in which the jury will approach the charges. The various episodes relied on as tendency cannot therefore be considered as a sequence. This must therefore significantly reduce, if it does not altogether destroy, the probative value of one set of charges in respect of one or more of the others. I appreciate that an answer might be to consider that the episodes have the capacity to be considered as a sequence. But that capacity is not far different in point of principle from the capacity for innocent inferences of the conversation in XY, though I think it is less capable of resolution.
	
	
	BEECH-JONES J: This is an application for leave to appeal under s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) from a judgment refusing an application to sever various sets of charges on an indictment containing 20 counts of sexual assault against children that was presented against the Applicant in the District Court. The relevant facts alleged in the Crown case are set out in the judgment of Adams J which I have read in draft. They need not be repeated.
	
	
	The principal basis for the application to sever the indictment was that the direct evidence against the applicant in respect of each set of counts was not admissible as tendency evidence in respect of the other sets. For the reasons that follow I consider that the application for leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal should be dismissed. I am not satisfied that any material error has been shown in the trial judge’s reasons for admitting the tendency evidence and dismissing the motion to sever the indictment.
	
	
	Before addressing the grounds of appeal it is necessary to note the following two matters of principle which I consider to be of critical significance to the application and then note certain matters by way of background to this application in addition to those noted by Adams J.
	
	
	First, in light of the submissions that were made in support of the application it is appropriate to note exactly what tendency evidence is. Sections 97 and 101 of the Evidence Act 1995 relevantly provide:
	


“97 The tendency rule

(1)   Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

(2)   Subsection (1) (a) does not apply if:

(a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or

(b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by another party.

…

“101   Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution

This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.

Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.

This section does not apply to tendency evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by the defendant.

   …” (emphasis added)


	
	In Elomar v R; Hasan v R; Cheikho v R; Cheikho v R; Jamal v R [2014] NSWCCA 303 at [253] (“Elomar”) the Court (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Simpson J) stated that:
	


“Tendency evidence is evidence tendered to establish that a person has or had a tendency to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind. It is evidence that is tendered in order to provide the foundation for an inference that, because the person has or had that tendency, it is more likely that he or she behaved in a particular way, or had a particular state of mind at a time or in circumstances relevant to the issues in the dispute: see Gardiner v R [2006] NSWCCA 190 ; 162 A Crim R 233 at [124].


	
	Later in Elomar at [360] the Court explained:
	


“The process of reasoning [with evidence tendered to show a person has a tendency to act in a particular way] is:

on an occasion or occasions other than an occasion in question in the proceedings, a person acted in a particular way;

•   it can therefore be concluded or inferred that the person had a tendency to act in that way;

•   by reason of that tendency, it can therefore be concluded or inferred that, on an occasion in question in the proceedings, the person acted in conformity with that tendency …”


	
	It is necessary to restate this because both before the trial judge and in this Court the applicant relied heavily on the following passage taken out of context from the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL in Sokolowskyj v Regina [2014] NSWCCA 55 at [48] as identifying the prejudicial effect of the evidence sought to be led in this case:
	


“In the present case, one of the dangers of unfair prejudice was that the jury would use the evidence in the way they were directed not to use it – to show that the appellant was a sexual deviant who, as a result, was the sort of person who was likely to have committed the offence alleged against him. A second danger was that the jury would be so emotionally affected by the evidence that they would disregard the appellant‘s account in his police interview and disregard the directions to assess the evidence in an unemotional manner. A third danger was that the jury might be disinclined to give the appellant the benefit of any reasonable doubt.” (emphasis added)


	
	In Sokolowskyj the trial judge erroneously permitted the Crown to rely upon “tendency evidence” concerning the accused’s three prior convictions for exposing his penis to adult women in public places at his trial on a charge of indecently assaulting an eight year old child in a shopping centre parents’ room. Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom Adams and Hall JJ agreed) held that the tendency evidence did not have “substantive probative value” and was therefore inadmissible (Evidence Act; s 97(1)(b)); at [44]-[45]). His Honour found that there was “a large qualitative distinction” between the conduct the subject of the tendency evidence and the conduct the subject of the charge (at [43]). His Honour also found that the “flaw in the Crown case in support of the admission of the tendency evidence was that it failed to have regard to the fact that the evidence only had probative value if it increased the probability that the appellant committed the offence of indecently assaulting the complainant” (at [44]). His Honour’s conclusions in respect of the prejudicial effect of the tendency evidence were only expressed if “there was any doubt” concerning s 97(1) (at [46]).
	
	
	It follows that the observations set out in the passage from Sokolowskyj extracted above at [78] must be considered in the context of the lack of any connection between the form of sexual deviancy pointed to by the supposed tendency evidence and the conduct the subject of the charge in that case. A risk that the jury would or might reason to the effect that, because the appellant in Sokolowskyj was the “sort” of person who would expose himself to adult women in a public place, he was more likely to have sexually assaulted a child was truly a form of prejudice. Similarly in such a case there was an appreciable risk that the jury “would be so emotionally affected by the evidence” of his commission of what in substance were unrelated offences that they would disregard any account in the police interview and “might be disinclined to give the appellant the benefit of any reasonable doubt”.
	
	
	However it follows from the above statement in Elomar that in some cases, although not Sokolowskyj, it is not improper and thus not prejudicial for a jury to reason that if the accused is a particular “sort of person”, namely a person who has demonstrated the alleged tendency, then he is (more) likely to have committed the offence alleged against him. To the contrary, that is the very reasoning that the tendency evidence supports and is the very basis upon which it is admitted. Further, in most such cases, provided that s 97(1)(b) is satisfied, it is to be expected that the risk that the jury would be so “emotionally affected” by the evidence of the commission of other offences such that they would disregard the accused’s version and not afford the accused the benefit of any reasonable doubt, can be accommodated by the giving of appropriate directions to the jury.
	
	
	Second, an assessment of whether the evidence sought to be adduced has “significant probative value” is not confined to the evidence itself but is to be made having regard to all the evidence sought to be adduced by the tendering party (in this case, the Crown). In this case that involves a consideration of the continuous nature of the alleged conduct of the applicant, over approximately 15 years, said to give rise to the alleged tendency.
	
	
	The relevant statutory provisions concerning the admission of tendency evidence are set out above. The basal steps involved in determining whether to admit evidence as tendency evidence is, first, to determine whether it is relevant evidence under s 55, then to determine whether it satisfies s 97(1) and, in particular, has “significant probative value”, and finally to consider whether it is excluded by s 101(2) (or s 137). In DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9; 259 FLR 262 at [72] (“DSJ No 1”) Whealy JA (with whom Bathurst CJ at [1], Allsop P at [11], McClellan CJ at CL at [135] and McCallum J at [136] agreed) referred to the approach adopted in determining whether tendency evidence has significant probative value by Simpson J in R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338; 156 A Crim R 308 (“Fletcher”) at [33]-[35] and stated as follows (at [72]):
	


“... if a hypothetical jury would think it unlikely that the evidence were important in relation to the facts in issue then the trial Judge might the more readily conclude that the evidence lacks the capacity required for admissibility. Simpson J's formulation [in Fletcher] recognises that the trial Judge has no part to play in the evaluation of the actual weight to be given to any of the evidence or to its ultimate assessment. The substance of her Honour's formulation is that the trial Judge is required to take the evidence at its highest, and to determine whether it has the capacity to be of importance or of consequence in establishing the fact in issue. In undertaking that task, the statute also requires, as her Honour [in Fletcher] recognised, that the evidence may be examined on its own account, or by having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the tendering party. As I have said, the trial Judge does not make any evaluation of the actual weight of the evidence nor does he or she make any prediction about the weight that will actually be assigned to the evidence by the jury in the trial. As stated in Mundine [R v Mundine [2008] NSWCCA 55], what must be assessed is the role that the evidence, if accepted, would play in the resolution of the disputed fact – its capacity to contribute to that resolution.” (emphasis added)


	
	Although DSJ No 1 concerned coincidence evidence, this statement is equally applicable to tendency evidence.
	
	
	The reference in the above passage from DSJ No 1 to the examination of the evidence by reference to “other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the tendering party” is reflected in the words of s 97(1)(b) and is of particular significance in this case. One matter that arose during the hearing of this application concerned the evidentiary significance of the fact that the applicant was only aged 11 to 13 years at the time of the alleged commission of counts 1 to 3. Although a submission was made to the trial judge that the necessity to prove that the applicant was not doli incapax at the time he allegedly committed the offences the subject of counts 1 to 3 was a matter that warranted a severing of at least those counts (see [122]), it was not contended before the sentencing judge that the age of the applicant at the time of the alleged commission of counts 1 to 3 was a matter that affected an assessment of the similarities in the allegations or otherwise denied the evidence significant probative value. However the written submissions of the applicant in this Court in relation to ground 1 of the application contended as follows:
	


“In addition, counts 1 to 3 allege behaviour when the applicant was a child. It is difficult to see how those counts could constitute evidence of an abnormal interest in young children, if the offences were alleged to have been committed when the applicant was a child himself.”


	
	Further, as Adams J has found that the trial judge erred, his Honour has embarked upon a reconsideration of whether the evidence should be admitted and concluded that the direct evidence the subject of counts 1 to 3 does not have significant probative value in relation to the other counts (at [39]).
	
	
	I respectfully disagree. Considered in isolation there may be serious reason to doubt that evidence of such conduct by an 11 to 13 year old is capable of being “of importance or of consequence in establishing” that the applicant committed, say, counts 19 and 20 when he was aged between 25 and 28 years. However the evidence of counts 1 to 3 is not to be considered in isolation but is to be considered with the other evidence to be adduced. That evidence is capable of demonstrating that the applicant engaged in the relevant form of conduct on nine occasions being when he was aged about ten years (the uncharged act), aged between 11 and 13 (counts 1 to 3), aged between 15 and 16 years (counts 4 to 7), aged between 16 and 18 years (counts 8 to 11 and 12 to 15), aged 19 years (count 16), aged 20 years (count 17), aged between 21 and 23 years (count 18) and then aged between 25 and 28 years (counts 19 and 20). Thus, for example, in relation to counts 19 and 20 the direct evidence in support of counts 1 to 3 is part of a body of evidence that is capable of showing that the applicant engaged in the relevant form of conduct on eight occasions from when he was aged 10 until he was aged between 21 and 23 years. In my view that evidence clearly satisfies s 97(1)(b). The same reasoning applies to the other counts.
	


Background


	
	A summary of the Crown case, the submissions made by Counsel for the applicant to the trial judge and her Honour’s judgment are set out in the judgment of Adams J at [7] to [13]. Three further matters should be noted.
	
	
	First, the ruling given by the trial judge was based on the statements of the complainants as well as some supplementary oral evidence from complainants B and C in relation to the suggestion of concoction or contamination. However, as noted by Adams J, as events have transpired the complainants have all given evidence in a trial that was aborted. Nevertheless it was not suggested that the evidentiary basis upon which the trial judge determined the admissibility of the tendency evidence was materially affected by the evidence adduced at the aborted trial. All the parties to this application proceeded on the basis of the accuracy of the summary set out in the judgment of Adams J in [7].
	
	
	Second, leaving aside one aspect of ground 1, the fundamental complaint on this application concerns the trial judge’s determination to admit the tendency evidence sought to be led by the Crown. In DSJ v R; NS v R [2014] NSWCCA 77 at [6] to [7], Gleeson JA (with whom Hidden and Rothman JJ agreed) observed:
	


“[6] First, leave should not readily be granted, unless an appropriate case is made out showing an error of principle which is apt to cause an irregularity or an injustice: Queanbeyan City Council v Environment Protection Authority [2011] NSWCCA 108 at [25] per Whealy JA (Hall and McCallum JJ agreeing) citing R v Van Phu Ho (NSWCCA, 18 July 1994, Gleeson CJ, Mahoney JA, Dunford J, unreported).

[7]  Secondly, a significant factor in determining the grant of leave is that rulings on the admissibility of evidence are not interlocutory orders. It is well established that s 5F is not available to review a decision as to the admissibility of evidence: R v Powch (1988) 14 NSWLR 136 at 137D-138B; R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633 at 639F; Dao v R at [74]. This is a strong consideration against the grant of leave in respect of an order refusing separate trials, where a ruling on the admissibility of evidence is a central issue: DAO v R at [16] per Spigelman CJ, at [106] per Allsop P and at [208] per Simpson J (Kirby and Schmidt JJ agreeing).”


	
	Third, it is necessary to identify the alleged tendency that the Crown seeks to prove the relevant accused possessed. Unless that tendency is kept in view it is difficult to apply the tests posed by s 97 and s 101. In this case the tendency identified by the Crown in its tendency notice dated 11 May 2015 was as follows:
	


“The tendency sought to be proved was [the Applicant’s] tendency to act in a particular way and to have a particular state of mind, namely:

(i)   He had a sexual interest in children aged between 4 & 14 years;

(ii)   He was prepared to act on that sexual interest for the purpose of his own sexual gratification; [and]

(iii)   He used his position of trust as either a relative of such children or as a family friend of such children to facilitate the sexual abuse of them.”


	
	A review of the transcript of the argument of the voir dire reveals that the parties proceeded on the basis of this formulation of the relevant tendency. In its written submissions on the appeal, the Crown referred to the applicant having a “clear tendency to engage the complainants in a particular way, namely not by threats, force or fear but by expressly seeking their consent and physical co-operation”. At least at the point of considering whether leave to appeal should be granted, attempts to reformulate the tendency should be rejected, although this submission points to one of the relevant similarities between the various incidents.
	


Ground 4: Alleged error in finding that the allegations in relation to the various complaints were similar


	
	Ground 4 of the application for leave to appeal contends that her Honour erred in finding that the allegations in relation to the various complainants were “similar”.
	
	
	It is appropriate to address this ground first as it is directed towards the trial judge’s conclusion that s 97(1)(b) was satisfied which is a logically anterior step to any consideration of whether the evidence was unfairly prejudicial as suggested by grounds 2 and 3.
	
	
	In his written submissions the applicant accepted that the trial judge applied the correct test in determining whether the proposed evidence had “significant probative value” within the meaning of s 97 (1) of the Act. It was also accepted that her Honour correctly approached her consideration of the issue of whether or not the evidence was capable of showing that the alleged acts were similar. Nevertheless, the applicant submitted that her Honour erred in her ultimate finding that the allegations were “similar”.
	
	
	The principal difficulty with this ground is that her Honour did not find that the allegations were “similar”. The closest the trial judge came to making a finding to that effect was, after reviewing the circumstances of each of the alleged offences in detail, her Honour stated as follows:
	


“Therefore, [the] similarities are that the complainants were young or very young when contact first occurred, about 5 years; on most occasions [B], [A] and [C] consent was sought; for [D] a request was made which was complied with. The contact was opportunistic, it does not appear to have been planned; there was no threat or violence in any alleged event; the offences commenced with touching and then progressed to oral sex for 3 of the complainants; for [D], the allegation is oral sex; there was what was referred to as a wider definition of a position of trust, that is, the accused was in the complainant’s home with the consent of the parents; and the type of touching is very similar, that is touching the child under the clothes and/or having the child touch him. And where the touching continued, the acts progressing to oral sexual activity; in relation to the [uncharged act concerning E], the child was about 5 years old, and masturbation appears to have been included, the accused was in the home with consent when the opportunistic act was interrupted.” (emphasis added)


	
	Later in the judgment her Honour applied s 97(1)(b) in a manner consistent with Fletcher (as explained by DSJ No 1) before concluding that the evidence “will have significant value in the jury’s deliberations”. Thus her Honour did not find that the allegations were “similar”. Instead her Honour had regard to the similarities between the allegations as part of the assessment of whether the test in s 97(1)(b) was made out. This approach was entirely orthodox (see R v PWD [2010] NSWCCA 209; 205 A Crim R 75; “PWD”).
	
	
	Nevertheless I would not dismiss this ground on the basis that it is a challenge to a finding that was not made but instead treat it as a challenge to her Honour’s ultimate finding that the evidence satisfied s 97(1)(b). Such a finding can only be challenged in this application on the grounds stated in House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 504 to 505 (DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63; 278 ALR 765, at [70] per Spigelman CJ; at [81] per Allsop P; at [157] and [171] per Simpson J; at [210] per Kirby J and [211] per Schmidt J). Given that it was accepted that the correct test was applied and the submissions do not point to any relevant matter that was omitted or irrelevant matter that was taken into account, other than the issue raised by ground 1, this ground reduces to a contention that her Honour’s finding that s 97(1)(b) was satisfied was “unreasonable” because the allegations were too disparate in nature for them to have significant probative value in relation to any of the counts.
	
	
	The written submissions in support of this ground contended that the acts commenced with “touching” and progressed and that the type of touching, being under the complainant’s clothes, was “commonplace” as was the occurrence of the events in the applicant’s home. They further contended that the “striking feature” about these allegations is the “degree of dissimilarity” between them in that two of the complainants were male, two were female, there is only one allegation of sexual penetration namely the alleged offence involving B, only one of the complainants is alleged to have a cognitive impairment, namely D, and in the case of B there was evidence that she was later in a consensual relationship with the applicant when she was 16. The last of these matters is irrelevant to the present issue which is directed to the similarities between the conduct the subject of the offending. The applicant’s relationship with B took place well after the time he is alleged to have committed offences against her. Otherwise none of the other matters raised warrants any interference with the trial judge’s assessment that the similarities in the allegations supported a determination that the evidence had significant probative value. Some features may be “commonplace” with allegations of this kind but that does not deny them some significance to a determination of whether s 97(1) was satisfied.
	
	
	In oral submissions Senior Counsel for the applicant, Mr Stratton SC, further contended that there was no “pattern” to the offending and that it was not correct that the offences took place in the “complainant’s house” in that counts 1 to 3 took place in the complainant’s home, count 16 occurred in bushland and counts 4 to 7, 8 to 11, and 18 to 20 occurred at a place where they were both living. However this overlooks the significance that her Honour attributed to the location of the alleged offending, namely that it was indicative of the applicant having occupied some “wider position of trust” vis-à-vis the complainants. As noted by the Crown “in all cases the [alleged] conduct commenced when the applicant was a guest [at the relevant] house at the invitation of the complainant’s parents”.
	
	
	The effect of the trial judge’s assessment was that the evidence sought to be led was capable of demonstrating “a pattern of behaviour, modus operandi, system or pattern and common threads ... in the [applicant’s] conduct” (PWD at [35] per Beazley P). The allegations had a number of common or similar features, namely the young age at which some of the complainants were first abused and then abused later when they were older, the complainants were each known to the applicant, the above occurred in a context where he was trusted to exercise some form of supervision of them, and he did not force himself on the complainants but sought their consent or made a request. True it is that not all features were present with all complainants but that was not necessary.
	
	
	Subject to considering the remaining grounds of appeal, no basis has been demonstrated for interfering with the trial judge’s assessment as to the existence of similarities between the conduct the subject of the allegations or the significant probative value of the evidence in support of them.
	
	
	I would reject ground 4 of the appeal.
	


Grounds 2 and 3: Application of Section 101 of the Evidence Act


	
	Ground 2 of the application contends that the trial judge did not apply the correct test for the admission of tendency evidence. Ground 3 contends that the trial judge incorrectly found that there was (in effect) no danger of unfair prejudice. The submissions in support of ground 2 confirm that the relevant test that was said not to have been applied was that set out in s 101(2) of the Evidence Act 1995. These grounds can be dealt with together.
	
	
	Although it is set out in the judgment of Adams J, it is necessary to repeat the submission on prejudice that was made on behalf of the applicant to the trial judge:
	


“It is my submission that the primary … unfair prejudice is that a jury, despite any direction that the Court could give, may well reason, ‘Well they couldn’t all be lying, they couldn’t all be making it up’. And that’s impermissible reasoning in relation to one complainant, but lay people could well reason that way.

And if your Honour would say, ‘You shouldn’t reason that way’, it’s exactly as Hoeben [CJ at CL] said in … Sokolowskyj [v R [2014] NSWCCA 55] … [that] one of the dangers of unfair prejudice was that the jury would use the evidence in the way they were directed not to use it, to show [in that case] that the appellant was the sexual deviant who, as a result, was the sort of person who was likely to have committed the offence alleged against him.

The second danger was that the jury would be so emotionally affected by the evidence that they would disregard the appellant’s account in the police interview and disregard the directions to assess the evidence in an unemotional manner. The third danger was that the jury might be disinclined to give the appellant the benefit of any reasonable doubt.”


	
	It can be seen that this submission reflected the passage from Sokolowskyj extracted above. The trial judge addressed this contention as follows:
	


“It was submitted that the jury would misuse this evidence, but counsel had some difficulty in actually elucidating how a jury would misuse this evidence.

For example, it was suggested that they would misuse the evidence by incorrectly reasoning that, if there were so many complainants, then the allegations must be true.

Where there is a tendency argument, such a consideration would always be something that a judge would give strong directions against, and it is, indeed, part of the standard directions that a judge gives in relation to tendency evidence.

The jury are clearly told that they have to be satisfied, firstly beyond reasonable doubt in relation to each of these particular events, and then must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in relation to each of the particular events as to whether it does, or the corollary, does not, show that the accused has a tendency as the Crown will submit. It is a two stage process that the jury are given to understand they must undertake.

It was suggested to me that judicial directions cannot cure everything. Well that is certainly the case, and that is why the Court would have to be satisfied that there is no unfair prejudice, nor a danger that a tribunal of fact will use the evidence on a basis logically unconnected with the issues in the case.


	
	The first type of prejudice that is identified in the extract at [105] above is that the jury might reason that “they couldn’t all be lying, they couldn’t all be making it up” which is said to be “impermissible reasoning”. Although it is not entirely clear it appears that her Honour accepted that contention as identifying a possible form of prejudice but stated that it could be overcome by a direction. If anything this was only an error in the applicant’s favour. If the jury were to have regard to the number of complainants giving evidence of the occurrence of similar events over a number of years that would not per se be impermissible. The jury would be entitled to give weight to that matter as part of the assessment of whether the events said to demonstrate the tendency occurred. This is reflected in the standard direction for tendency evidence in the bench book which contemplates the jury being instructed that in making a finding that a particular act said to be evidence of the alleged tendency occurred the jury should “not consider each of the acts in isolation but consider all the evidence and ask yourself whether you are satisfied that a particular act or acts relied upon actually took place”.
	
	
	Otherwise the forms of prejudice that were identified to the trial judge in the extract set out above at [105] were directly reliant on the passage from Sokolowskyj at [48] discussed above at [78] to [81]. For the reasons there stated that passage was taken out of context and was inapposite. In those circumstances the trial judge was correct to observe that there was a difficulty in identifying the prejudicial effect of the tendency evidence sought to be adduced. No relevant form of prejudice was in fact identified. In substance the effect of the submission made to her Honour was that it would be prejudicial to treat evidence tendered to demonstrate the applicant had a particular tendency as tendency evidence. In fact the only relevant form of prejudice that pertained was the risk of the jury reasoning in the impermissible manner that is always present with such evidence and which the standard directions warn against.
	
	
	The written submissions in support of these grounds contend that the passage from the trial judge’s reasons set out at [106] reveals an error of the kind identified by Hoeben CJ at CL in the following passage from Sokolowskyj at [52]:
	


“That error was compounded when his Honour came to consider the s101 question in that there was no attempt to assess the prejudicial effect of the tendency evidence and to balance that against its probative value. What his Honour did was to assume that a judicial direction to the jury designed to minimise the risk of unfair prejudice would be completely effective. He did that without ever having assessed the risk of unfair prejudice.”


	
	I do not accept this submission. Her Honour sought to engage with what was submitted to be the prejudicial effect of the evidence but struggled to do so because it was based on an appeal to a passage in Sokolowskyj that was taken out of context. In this case, and unlike Sokolowskyzj, there was no particular prejudice identified or apparent. In those circumstances there is no error in the approach taken by her Honour of dealing with the general risk of prejudice that arises from the adducing of tendency evidence by pointing to the directions that will be given to the jury. The position was explained by Latham J (with whom Giles JA and Rothman J agreed) in R v SK; SK v R [2011] NSWCCA 292 at [34]:
	


“ … the applicant did not identify how the risk of misuse of the evidence by the jury could arise. It is no answer to make general statements about the arousal of prejudice. A jury's antipathy towards an accused, assuming that the accused is guilty and failing to properly consider a defence are all potential by-products of tendency evidence. In that sense, the nature of tendency evidence is inherently prejudicial, hence the need for strong directions, including the requirement that the tendency evidence be proved beyond reasonable doubt. It is not however, prejudicial simply because it tends to prove the commission of the offences. That constitutes, subject to proper directions, appropriate use of the evidence, not its misuse.”


	
	It follows that I would reject grounds 3 and 4.
	


Ground 5: Reasonable possibility of concoction


	
	Ground 5 of the application contends that her Honour erred in determining whether or not there was a reasonable possibility of concoction. This ground relates to the evidence of B and C, who are sisters. As there is some controversy as to whether a suggestion of concoction should be dealt with at the point of considering s 97(1), s 101(2) or at all, I have considered this ground separately.
	
	
	The applicant’s written submissions to the trial judge contended that there was “a real possibility of contamination or concoction involving” B and C’s evidence although they did not state whether that matter should be considered at the point of considering s 97(1)(b) or s 101(2). On the voir dire and after B and C had given oral evidence, counsel for the applicant submitted that it was for the “prosecution to prove [that there is] no reasonable possibility of concoction or contamination”. This appears to be a reference to the test stated in Hoch v The Queen [1988] HCA 50; 165 CLR 292 (“Hoch”). Counsel submitted that the events surrounding the creation of their statements meant they had the opportunity to collude (although they denied having done so). Ultimately Counsel submitted that the Crown had not “negated … a reasonable possibility” of concoction and contamination.
	
	
	Her Honour addressed this contention at length in the following passage:
	


“In relation to the issue of concoction, [if] it is a reasonable possibility that the evidence has been contaminated or concocted, then it should be withheld from the jury. In this case it is suggested only, in relation to the sisters [B and C], that there has been the opportunity of concoction because they are sisters and their statements were taken at the same place, same time, but of course, in different rooms. It is suggested that there is the possibility of concoction because there was a phone call between the sisters beforehand.

Both sisters gave evidence in court today and they were cross-examined at length in relation to the conversations that they had. The answers to the questions that were put to them were not exactly the same for each witness. Both witnesses were clear, however, that neither of them had discussed the evidence that the other was to give, or the allegations in general in relation to what they were going to see the police about.

In fact, it is perfectly clear that the younger sister, [C], only had one complaint to make about when she was five years of age, and the complaint that she made is the most minor of all of the complaints by all of the complainants.

The older sister makes much longer and much stronger complaints over a longer period of time, and her complaints are far more serious.

It is clear on the cross-examination that I heard on the evidence that the girls gave that they have not discussed the evidence, and if there was any opportunity to do so, they did not take that opportunity. The older sister gave a reason for that, and she made it perfectly clear that her reasons were both personal and based on what she had been told. In relation to the younger sister, her evidence of being told something in general terms by her older sister again was clear, and [it] was clear that she had not discussed this matter with the older sister. Where it was put to her she had, she took the time to consider her evidence very carefully, it is clear that she thought about what she wanted to say, it is clear that she was trying to recall a conversation, and she said quite clearly that, yes, she had discussed whether she would be a part of the court case with her sister, she said that only occurred towards the end of the conversation, after she had responded to her sister, ‘Me too’, when told about who the allegation was about.

Whilst there has perhaps been the opportunity for concoction, there is no motive for concoction, and there is absolutely no evidence of concoction; in fact there is evidence to the contrary.” [emphasis added]


	
	In the written submissions in support of the appeal it was accepted that the “real possibility” test stated in Hoch had no application in respect of the admission of tendency evidence under the Evidence Act (see R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319; 58 NSWLR 700 at [95]). However it was nevertheless submitted that her Honour erred in finding that “there was no evidence of concoction, rather than considering whether or not there was a reasonable possibility of concoction”.
	
	
	This contention seeks to agitate an underlying issue about the relevance, if any, of a suggestion of concoction or contamination between witnesses to the admission of tendency evidence under s 97(1)(b) and its possible rejection under s 101(2). On one view suggestions of concoction raise matters that are relevant to credibility and reliability and as such are matters solely for the jury and not the trial judge (R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228) with the result that “… the suggestion that the possibility of concoction is a factor which must be taken into account in determining whether particular evidence has significant probative value should not be accepted” (McIntosh v R [2015] NSWCCA 184 at [47] per Basten JA with whom Hidden and Wilson JJ agreed). However that approach sits uneasily with the observation of this Court in AE v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 52 at [44] that “it was not an error to consider the possibility of joint concoction in assessing the probative value of the evidence” and that “to the extent that his Honour did so, it was an error to find that there was no possibility of joint concoction”. Until the issue of the relevance of the possibility of concoction is finally resolved, these statements may perhaps be reconciled by accepting that the possibility of concoction is a matter that may, as opposed to must, be taken into account in considering s 97(1)(b).
	
	
	In relation to s 101(2) in BJS v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 239 at [24] Basten JA (with whom R.S. Hulme and Hall JJ agreed) stated that “[n]o doubt the reasonable possibility of concoction is a factor which must be taken into account in assessing the ‘prejudicial effect’ of the evidence, but a more nuanced approach is now required under s 101(2), dependent on the circumstances of the particular case (cf Ellis at [96])”.
	
	
	In Jones v R [2014] NSWCCA 280 (“Jones”) at [88] to [90], Bellew J (with whom Gleeson JA and Schmidt J agreed) reviewed the authorities dealing with concoction and stated (at [90]):
	


“It is conceivable that there may be cases in which evidence of concoction and contamination gives rise to competing inferences [and thus be relevant to an assessment of whether the evidence has significant probative value]. It may be that in such a case, those inferences are relevant to a determination of the probative value of the evidence. However, the evidence in the present case does not give rise to such inferences. For the reasons set out below, his Honour’s conclusion that there was no evidence of concoction or contamination was one which was well open to him.” (emphasis added).


	
	This aspect of Jones was followed in DJW v R [2015] NSWCCA 164 by R.A. Hulme J (with whom Simpson and Bellew JJ agreed). His Honour acted on the basis that he was “prepared to assume that the issue of possible concoction or contamination in the present case could give rise to a competing inference in the assessment of whether there was significant probative value” (at [44]) but held that it was open to the trial judge in that case to find that that there was not “any real possibility of concoction or contamination” (at [46]).
	
	
	It is not necessary to attempt to resolve the effect of these authorities (or the further authorities referred to in that part of the judgment of Adams J that deal with this topic). The opening part of the extract in [114] appears to misstate the approach to this issue by invoking Hoch but that was only an error favourable to the applicant and it was based on the erroneous submission of his counsel. Further, the findings of the trial judge in that extract amount to an acceptance of the opportunity for concoction but otherwise constitute a finding that there is “no evidence” of concoction. In Jones, such a finding was sufficient to avoid any suggestion that a competing inference of concoction should have been considered in determining whether the proposed evidence had significant probative value. There is no authority that this Court was referred to, including AE or BJS, for the proposition that a trial judge is obliged to consider whether the mere existence of an opportunity for concoction is relevant to determining whether proposed tendency evidence satisfies s 97(1)(b) or should be excluded under s 101(2).
	
	
	I would reject ground 5.
	


Ground 1: The issue of Doli Incapax was not taken into account


	
	Ground 1 of the Application contends that the trial judge erred because the “issue of doli incapax was not taken into account”.
	
	
	As noted the Applicant was between 11 and 13 years old at the time that the offences the subject of counts 1 to 3 were allegedly committed. It follows that a rebuttable presumption of doli incapax arises, namely that the applicant was incapable of committing the offences the subject of those counts because he lacked an understanding of the difference between right and wrong. As a consequence, in relation to those counts not only must the Crown prove beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant did the acts charged with the necessary intent, the Crown must also prove that the applicant knew that conduct was seriously wrong, as distinct from an act of mere naughtiness or mischief (BP v Regina, SW v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 172).
	
	
	In submissions before the trial judge counsel for the applicant contended:
	


“ … it would be very unfair to [the Applicant] to have to be required to defend a matter where there’s a presumption that he couldn’t form any criminal intent and defend other charges when he’s over the age of 14 and for a jury to be directed to, in effect, disregard the other charges or other counts because they’re different, there’s different legal issues in relation to them, to separately consider whether or not at that age, in all the circumstances, he could form a – or did form a criminal intent. It would make it complex and different …”


	
	Her Honour addressed this argument as follows:
	


“In relation to counts 1, 2 and 3, there may be another fact in issue, that is, whether the accused had the capacity at the time the events allegedly occurred … to understand that his actions were wrong, and seriously so. That is a matter that the Crown will have to address, and that is a hurdle that the Crown will have to leap over to the required criminal standard. That is a matter that does not bother me at this stage of the proceedings. It may bother me at the end of the Crown case …

I turn now to what is probably the final claim, and that is that when the first three counts are alleged to have occurred, the accused was perhaps 12 or under 12 years of age. The Crown would have the obligation, therefore, to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had the required capacity and understanding that, if a jury find that he did the touching alleged, that he understood to the required standard that he knew the things that he was doing were wrong, and seriously so.

That is a matter that the Crown is alive to. They say that they have evidence in support of it. I am told there is no school records or anything that is generally put before the Court in relation to such issues, but they say that the evidence that they will rely on relates to the request for secrecy, the attempt at privacy and the stopping of the actions when there was perhaps an adult drawing near. Depending on how the evidence comes out, that may or may not be sufficient for the jury, but that is a matter that we will wait to see.”


	
	Both the submission to the trial judge and her Honour’s response are difficult to grapple with. As best as I can determine the point being made to her Honour was that there was some form of unfairness in the combined trial of 20 counts where three of them had this extra element. It was contended that having an additional element for one set of counts would make the jury’s task complex. Her Honour’s response appears to have been that there was no such unfairness because the Crown’s case to rebut the presumption was solely confined to the applicant’s (alleged) conduct in relation to only counts 1 to 3, namely “his request for secrecy, the attempt at privacy and the stopping of actions when there was perhaps an adult drawing near” (see BP v Regina, SW v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 172 at [29] to [30]). Implicit in her Honour’s approach was that the Crown case (and the jury’s reasoning) would be confined in that regard by appropriate direction, if necessary. Further her Honour expressly did not address whether the direct evidence in support of counts 1 to 3 would be sufficient to rebut the presumption but instead would consider that at the “end of the Crown case”. No error is apparent in this approach.
	
	
	The written submissions in support of these grounds contended that a trial of counts 1 to 3 with the remaining counts would occasion unfairness to the applicant because with those counts he would be “entitled not to give evidence in these matters and require the Crown to rebut the presumption in its case”, whereas “if all the matters are heard together he may be forced to give evidence about the matters generally”. This contention was not raised before the trial judge and thus no error arises from her Honour’s failure to address it. In any event, as noted by the Crown, the fact that the evidence relied upon to rebut the presumption is solely the evidence of the very events that give rise to counts 1 to 3 “significantly weakens the applicant's argument that tactically he would have to meet a different case on that issue compared with the rest of the case”. In particular, it is difficult to see how any decision by the applicant to give evidence in his own case is affected by the further element the Crown must prove in relation to counts 1 to 3. If the applicant chooses to give evidence denying these events he would, in doing so, deny the evidence said by the Crown to rebut the presumption.
	
	
	The other matter raised in the written submissions in support of this ground is that the jury might use evidence that the applicant committed sexual offences when he was an adult (specifically, charges 16 to 20) to reason backwards that he may have had an understanding when he was under 14 that his actions were wrong. No complaint of prejudice to this effect was made to the trial judge. In my view, the risk of a jury reasoning in this manner is very slight but even so it can be addressed by an appropriate direction.
	
	
	I would reject ground 1.
	


Conclusion


	
	No material error in the trial judge’s judgment having been demonstrated, I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	The orders that I propose are that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed.

2702257,Shima v R [2015] NSWDC 410,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: There is currently before me an application for an adjournment. The adjournment was made by the appellant in person this morning. The matter was listed for hearing before me this morning in order to enable me to give judgment on the application which I entertained yesterday when the appellant was represented by Mr Singh of Sydney Criminal Lawyers of 367 Castlereagh Street, Sydney, a building opposite the Downing Centre Local and District Courts. Mr Singh told me that someone from his firm would be present today, but that is not the case, and I have heard nothing from Mr Singh or his firm. I do not know whether the firm is not represented today by way of oversight or whether it is because the appellant declined to have someone present from the firm to represent him today.
	
	
	The application which I entertained yesterday was an application under s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. To understand what has happened before and as to my ruling on this adjournment application it is necessary, in essence, to review the forensic history of the proceedings which have led to today’s application.
	
	
	The appellant was served with court attendance notices on 16 August 2013. The original court attendance notices were listed for hearing before the Hornsby Local Court on Tuesday 27 August 2013. They remained before the Local Court at Hornsby until 1 October 2013 when they appear to have been transferred to the Downing Centre Local Court. There were three offences charged against the appellant. The first one was an offence contrary to s 13 (1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007. The particulars pleaded were that between 11am and 11.30am on 11 September 2012 at Point Piper the appellant did intimidate Mihoko Numa with the intention of causing the said Mihoko Numa to fear physical or mental harm. The second charge was of a common assault upon Mihoko Numa at the same place and at the same time. The third offence was a further allegation of common assault upon Mihoko Numa between 3.10pm and 3.20pm on 12 June 2013 at Terry Hills. The appellant pleaded not guilty to each of the three charges.
	
	
	The matter was mentioned at the Downing Centre Local Court on 10 October 2013 when it was set down for hearing on 7 February 2014 with an estimate of three hours. On 7 February 2014 the matter was listed before Magistrate Mijovich. His Honour noted that the then accused, the current appellant, was to be seen at a forensic psychiatric assessment on 3 March 2014 and a report was awaited following upon that examination and that an application would be made under s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. His Honour then adjourned the matter to 10 April 2014.
	
	
	On 10 April 2014 the matter appears again to have come before Magistrate Mijovich who noted that the s 32 application was not being proceeded with. His Honour set the matter down for hearing on 19 May 2014. On that day it came before him. The appellant was represented by Mr Gallagher of Counsel, instructed by Messrs Watts McCray of Parramatta. A Japanese interpreter was present. The matter proceeded by way of the tender by consent of witness statements and an electronically recorded interview with the appellant. When that evidence had been presented the prosecutor closed the prosecution case. Mr Gallagher called no evidence. Mr Gallagher made no submission regarding the commission of the offences alleged. He addressed only on the question of penalty. The learned Magistrate found the offences proved but in respect of each offence recorded no conviction but placed the appellant on a bond to be of good behaviour pursuant to s 10(1)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for a period of 18 months. Those 18 months expired on 18 November 2015, that is, a month ago.
	
	
	His Honour also made an apprehended violence order for a period of one year. That apprehended violence order expired on 18 May 2015. Whilst there was a formal appeal against the making of that order that appeal was withdrawn and dismissed yesterday because it was otiose to proceed with the application, the AVO having been “spent”.
	
	
	The appellant filed a notice of appeal on 16 June 2014. The notice of appeal gives as the ground of appealing from the conviction or order, that he was “not guilty”. No formal conviction had been recorded. I do not wish, at this time, to go into the question of whether one can appeal against a finding of an offence proved without the recording of a conviction. That may be a moot point but I have not heard from any lawyer, nor do I intend in the circumstances to research the matter myself.
	
	
	The appeal has been before this Court on a large number of occasions. It was first listed before Judge Blackmore on 6 August 2014. It was before the Chief Judge, Justice Price, on 24 September 2014 and 15 October 2014 when his Honour set the matter down for hearing on 10 December 2014. On 10 December 2014 the hearing came on before Judge Finnane. On that occasion the appeal was, by consent, adjourned to 31 March 2015 for hearing before any District Court judge.
	
	
	However, on the day prior to that hearing date, namely, 30 March 2015 the matter was mentioned before Judge Hanley when it was adjourned and set down as a “three hour severity appeal” on 2 June 2015. However, no application has ever been made to add to the grounds of appeal an appeal against the “severity” of the sentence. His Honour Judge Hanley directed that the matter was to proceed on 2 June 2015.
	
	
	On 1 June 2015 an email was sent by Mr Graham of Counsel to a person in the registry advising that he and Mr Terracini SC were instructed to act for the appellant. Mr Graham advised that the application under s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 was being abandoned. On 2 June the matter was listed for hearing before his Honour Judge Blackmore. Mr Graham of counsel appeared for the appellant. The order made was that the appellant was to file and serve a notice of motion and affidavit, seeking leave to adduce fresh evidence. The documents were to be filed by 6 July 2015 and the notice of motion was set down for hearing on 22 July 2015. On 22 July 2015 the notice of motion was listed before Judge McClintock, apparently it was not then ready to proceed. He noted there was a notice of motion to adduce further evidence. His Honour made an order that all affidavits in support of the notice of motion were to be filed and served by 7 October 2015. The notice of motion which was actually filed on 20 July returnable on 22 July 2015 did not seek leave to adduce fresh evidence as such but sought an order that Mihoko Numa attend to give evidence in the proceedings. This would appear to be an attempt by the appellant to have the “victim” attend for cross-examination. However, that was of little moment if the appellant was to give no evidence. Judge McClintock set the notice of motion down for hearing on 21 October with an estimate of half a day.
	
	
	On 21 October 2015 Mr Singh of Sydney Criminal Lawyers appeared for the appellant, that was the third firm of solicitors that the appellant had instructed. In essence he withdrew the application to adduce fresh evidence and asked for an adjournment in order to make an application under s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. It is that, and only that, application which was put before me yesterday and on which I intended to rule this morning, but the appellant himself withdrew that application and, in essence, seeks an adjournment in order to adduce fresh evidence, namely, evidence from him contesting the evidence that had originally been tendered by consent from Ms Numa back before the Local Court on 19 May 2014.
	
	
	I explained as best I could to the appellant that because the matter was dealt with under s 10 no conviction had been recorded and, therefore, there is nothing adverse to him on any criminal record resulting from what occurred before Magistrate Mijovich on 19 May 2014. I also pointed out to the appellant that the penalties imposed, namely, the AVO and the good behaviour bonds were all spent, that there was nothing that still affected the appellant and that nothing was to be gained by proceeding further with this appeal. However, the appellant then proceeded to address me at some length about various vicissitudes of life which have befallen him and of his “research” into human DNA and his views as to how “bad DNA” can be overcome by nurture, the ancient debate as to whether evil or harm results from nature or nurture or a combination of both. However, the appellant would not tell me if he has any tertiary qualifications, and if so, from what institution and of what nature, because he fears that such “intimate” or “delicate” information fall into the hands of Ms Numa and perhaps of others.
	
	
	The matter is compounded by the fact that I have heard the application under s 32, which in itself was a bizarre application, requesting that I make orders under s 32 when the orders that were made in the Local Court have been spent and which would only expose the appellant to further penalty if he should fail to comply with an order made by the Court under s 32. However, this bizarre application perhaps resulted from the appellant’s conduct which is in itself quite bizarre and was evident in court this morning.
	
	
	The appellant was interviewed by Dr Bruce Westmore, a forensic psychiatrist on 3 April 2014. Dr Westmore provided a report on 7 April 2014 which is part of exhibit 3. I shall quote an early part of the report which gives some insight into the appellant’s behaviour. On p 2 of his report Dr Westmore said this:
	


“When asked his age, he said ‘it is a simple question but life is continuity. If we count the day from when we come out of the delivery room, I think it is unfair. I can tell you what is the number, (but) the purpose of my life is to pass on the message, we cannot think so narrowly otherwise we will not have the ancestors. It is not that I cannot calculate. I have to keep these thoughts to myself’. He went on talking about the importance of ancestors.

I ask him, was he single, married, separated or divorced and he said, ‘I have never married’. I enquired was he living alone or with others in a rented property and he said, ‘I think we are coming into the same philosophy. Nothing belongs to me. A legal piece of document, it is superficial. Nothing belongs to any individual, even if they have a document saying this or that. It is not like I can’t answer your question, it is a personal belief and I need to pass on this message’.

I then asked him was he working and he responded ‘I am always working. Since little, it is always teaching people. It is just a phenomenon (how) people present events. When the people around you, in the past, the future and now. It is how you interpret, it is change. There is something more meaningful in it’”.

The only real piece of information that one can glean from p 2 of the doctor’s report is that the appellant was a vegetarian.


	
	On p 4 of the report, Dr Westmore commenced asking the appellant his personal history. The appellant was asked what country he had been born in and he replied “the earth, or galaxy”. The appellant did not answer directly about questions concerning his education. Again, he was asked whether he had children and there was a long description of vicissitudes of life which did not directly answer the question.
	
	
	Under the heading “mental state examination” Dr Wesmore recorded this:
	


“Mr Shima presented punctually, he had longish dyed hair. He was wearing black clothes, which included a short black shirt. He had black cotton or wool gloves on both hands. Mr Shima maintained good eye contact and he spoke spontaneously and expansively. Some of his earlier speech patterns were consistent with Formal Thought Disorder (disorganised speech) and he spoke “around” various questions, topics and issues, which were put to him. He did not provide personal information, he preferred to answer to questions of that type in a very vague and philosophical way. He responded in a similar way when asked did he hear “voices”. There appears to be a “grandiose theme” to his thought content and I refer to comments he made about his DNA, him [sic] being a mentor to various professors and how his life purpose was to help and assist people. He did not appear to be distracted by auditory perceptual disturbances and I have already commented on some aspects of his thought content. He was alert and attentive, but he requires a full range of investigations.”


	
	Dr Westmore was unable to provide a diagnosis. On p 7 of his report, he said this:
	


“Mr Shima is clearly presenting in a very odd and peculiar fashion but, at this time, I am not able to reach a provisional diagnosis in relation to his history or clinical presentation. While he was not clearly depressed, he appeared to be a little anxious and he did become tearful towards the end of the assessment. His thought content may have some grandiose themes, it is unclear whether his reluctance to provide personal details about himself reflects an underlying paranoia. His presentation also suggests some very eccentric personality traits and characteristics. Again, it is unclear whether these arise primarily from his personality or whether those characteristics reflect something more sinister in his mental state. He is clearly suffering from a mental condition, which requires quite urgent medical investigation at this time.”

On the final page of this report Dr Westmore made a recommended treatment plan which required the appellant to urgently consult a general practitioner, that the general practitioner be supplied with Dr Westmore’s report and that the appellant undergo a wide range of medical investigations, including an MRI scan of the brain to exclude organic pathology and that he then have appropriate medical treatment which might require consultation with a psychiatrist and the taking of psychotropic medication.


	
	Dr Westmore saw the appellant again on 29 May 2015. He obtained a history that Mr Shima had been reviewed by Dr Adams, a psychiatrist, who had then scheduled the appellant under the Mental Health Act. The appellant then fled Dr Adam’s office and contacted his solicitors. Subsequently, the appellant was admitted to St Vincent’s Hospital as an involuntary patient. Because of a lack of beds he was transferred from St Vincent’s Hospital to the Sutherland Hospital at Caringbah and was then under the Community Health Services at Caringbah. This period of hospitalisation appears to have been from 24 November 2014 to 5 December 2014. From what the appellant has said this morning the appellant was sent to see Dr Adams by Mr Winston Terracini SC and Dr Adams, it was, who then scheduled him under the Mental Health Act leading to his being an involuntary patient for the period I have just mentioned.
	
	
	Part of the history obtained by Dr Westmore on this occasion I quote only because it became a large part of the history subsequently given by the appellant to Mr Sam Borenstein, a clinical psychologist:
	


“Mr Shima continued speaking and then he told me that he had been ‘raped by two women in the past. The first woman (who raped me) had four children’. He said he is the father of the four children. He said that woman had come to him initially as a client and she wanted his DNA. Mr Shima then said, ‘But once I talk about this, you will say, delusion’”.

I understand the appellant’s position now to be that the alleged victim of the assaults, Ms Numa, was a maid working for him and that she “raped” him leading to birth of a son Kito, who as at 13 August 2013, was said to be five years old.


	
	Dr Westmore recorded that Dr Adams had thought that when he saw the appellant on 19 November 2014 he was psychotic, that is, suffering from a psychosis. It appears, according to Dr Westmore’s second report that Dr Adams was much concerned about the thought content of the appellant. Dr Westmore then speaks of what he read in the notes made at St Vincent’s Hospital and the Sutherland Hospital and by the Local Community Health Service and it appears that no definitive diagnosis was made. However, it is clear that if the appellant was psychotic at the time of his admission that psychosis did not continue. On p 10 of his second report, Dr Westmore said this:
	


“Having now had an opportunity to examine Mr Shima at some length on two occasions, I am reluctant to diagnose him as suffering from a specific psychiatric illness. He does present as a somewhat unusual man and that is most evidenced in his presentation. That, however, is neither indicative nor does it confirm that he suffers from a mental illness.”

He disagreed with the diagnosis of psychosis. He noted that the appellant did not wish to be dealt with under s 32.


	
	The application which I heard yesterday was largely based on an opinion of Mr Sam Borenstein who saw the plaintiff for Sydney Criminal Lawyers on 4 November 2015. Because the appellant turned up late to the first interview with Mr Borenstein, Mr Borenstein needed to again interview him on 9 November 2015. Mr Borenstein’s history commences thus:
	


“Mr Shima’s presentation was unusual from the outset. He was attired as a woman, he wore his hair blonde and long. He wore mirrored sunglasses, a long black dress, which covered his arms, his legs were also covered and he wore gloves”.

The appellant appeared similarly in Court, but wore neither sunglasses, nor gloves.


	
	On p 2 of his report Mr Borenstein said this:
	


“Mr Shima began the interview discussing Japanese submissiveness and DNA research. Mr Shima said he was working on ‘nature versus nurture’ concepts. My understanding of his verbalisations is that he regards himself as an experiment on DNA research, ‘to self -nurture, to change the seed, to change the DNA’”.

Given the brevity of our initial consultation, Mr Shima was directed to the offence. Mr Shima responded to questions in an over-elaborate and over inclusive manner. He informed me he has four older children born in 1983, 1989, 1991 and 1993. The first child, Primavera, is the only female, currently studying piano in Julliard in New York.

Mr Shima claimed he was raped by the children’s mother on four separate occasions. The impression given is that Mr Shima’s DNA is sought after, as was the case by the mother of his four oldest children. Mr Shima says the mother of the children abandoned Mr Shima and her children. Mr Shima hired an “au pair girl” to care for the children. Mr Shima says he was “manipulated” to return to New York to attend to his daughter’s (Primavera) needs. Mr Shima hired Mihoko Numa as his au pair girl, “this is when this woman came into my life, and she raped me”. Mr Shima states his fifth child was born on 5 July 2007 and is now aged eight, “she just took him away in 2012. That’s what they want. She forced me into a role play. She recorded the role play and told the police I hurt her. She told the Court I am the de facto, I am not the de facto”.

Mr Shima denies his involvement in the offence, “I am charged with assault. How can I assault someone if I have been raped. I use myself as an example, to improve the final DNA, so nurture can change nature. If you are born and have a bad DNA you can still get married”.


	
	When the appellant returned to see Mr Borenstein on 9 November he was dressed as he was on the first occasion but on this occasion also wore a surgical mask and ear plugs. Also, during the interview he produced a stethoscope and proceeded to listen to his own heartbeat which he thought was equivalenting to listen to music. He told Mr Borenstein that the reason he dyed his hair blonde is because Ms Mihoko Numa hated blonde people. The appellant told me so much today in his long discursive reason as to why he needed an adjournment. He then told Mr Borenstein that he did not want the matter to be dealt with under s 32 because he wished to bring civil proceedings against Ms Numa and, if he was deemed to be mentally ill, no one would believe him. When Mr Borenstein reviewed the documentation before him he thought that the appellant’s presentation to Dr Westmore was similar to how he presented to Mr Borenstein. A further detail later noted in Mr Borenstein’s report is that the appellant when at the Sutherland Hospital was treated with an antipsychotic medication which caused him to become increasingly irritable and demanding and led to his threatening legal action against those treating him at Sutherland.
	
	
	Contrary to what was said by Dr Westmore, Mr Borenstein believed that the way the appellant had presented at the Sutherland Hospital suggested that the appellant was undergoing an attack of mania. In his opinion Mr Westmore expressed the view that the appellant’s presentation was unusual and had the flavour of a complex delusional system with grandiose theme. He thought the appellant was suffering from a known mental illness or condition. He said this:
	


“In my opinion, Mr Shima suffers Schizotypal Personality Disorder ... Mr Shima satisfies the diagnosis [sic] criteria for that diagnosis. He relates a pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits, acute discomfort, with a reduced capacity for close relationships as well as cognitive or perceptual distortions and eccentricities of behaviour. I am uncertain as to whether such behavioural cognitive perceptual distortions begin early adulthood, which have been present for many years. Mr Shima’s symptoms include the ideas of reference, beliefs or magical thinking that influences behaviour and is consistent with sub‑cultural norms, unusual perceptual experiences, odd thinking and speech, which is vague, circumstantial, metaphorical or over‑elaborate and stereotypical, suspiciousness and paranoid ideation. Mr Shima’s behaviour and appearance is odd, eccentric and peculiar. He lacks friendships and has no contact with first-degree relatives. I note excessive anxiety, which I suspect does not diminish with familiarity, and tends to be associated with paranoid views rather than negative judgments about self.

Schizotypal Personality Disorder has a relatively stable course, with only a small proportion of individuals going on to develop schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders. Schizotypal personality disorder may be first apparent in childhood and adolescence with poor peer relationships, social anxiety, under achievement at school, hypersensitivity, peculiar thoughts and language and bizarre fantasies. Such children may appear odd or eccentric, or attract teasing.”

I agree with Dr Westmore. A differential diagnosis may evidence a neurodevelopmental disorder which is due to other medical conditions. Mr Shima categorically denies substance or alcohol abuse disorders.

Treatment for those who suffer with schizotypal personality disorder is problematic. Such personalities can easily come to the attention of psychiatric services, as was the case when Mr Shima was scheduled to St Vincent’s Hospital in 2014. Mr Shima’s belief system is well entrenched and unlikely to change.

It would be difficult to institute a treatment plan, which would ensure results could be achieved within a six month period.”

The doctor went on to point out that personality disorders are lifelong conditions and then he went on to suggest what treatment might help the appellant but he did not put it in any formal treatment plan as such.


	
	When I tried to ascertain from the appellant why he wanted the adjournment it was to contest his having the offences alleged against him proved but the real reason appears to justify his own views about DNA and the like, to suggest that the alleged victim Ms Numa had bad DNA, and ultimately the only reason was for the edification or instruction of his own offspring so that they knew that their father was a good man and that their mother or stepmother, as the case might be, was a bad woman. That is as much as I could glean from the discursive reasons given by the appellant.
	
	
	In my view, no good reason can be given for permitting these proceedings to stay on foot any longer. Legally they are spent. No conviction has been recorded. Such penalties as were imposed have been spent. Were I to grant an adjournment it would be necessary for the appellant to again proceed by way of notice of motion and affidavit, to adduce reasons why he should be granted leave to adduce further evidence and as to the evidence that was to be adduced and, for example, that he required Ms Numa for cross‑examination. To make such an application he would require legal assistance. He has now had three different firms of solicitors and two separate sets of Counsel. Given what I have said about the appellant’s presentation to the psychiatrist it is highly unlikely that any legal practitioner would wish to take on the appellant’s case and prepare the sort of application he would have this Court entertain. In other words, in my view, the granting of the application would be a futility and long-term would achieve nothing, and other than more distress to Ms Numa and more distress to the appellant himself. Things are now “spent” and nothing is to be no one’s real interests are objectively to be advanced by the granting of an adjournment.
	
	
	For those reasons the application for the adjournment is refused.
	
	
	For many of the reasons which I have already given, I should indicate that had the appellant not withdrawn the application under s 32, I would have refused it because to grant the relief was an otiose exercise: the previous penalties having been imposed being spent there was no point in law in exposing the appellant to the possibility of any further legal sanction.
	
	
	Now Mr Shima, unless you’ve got some other application, I intend to dismiss this appeal for want of prosecution. Yes. What do you wish to say now?
	
	
	APPELLANT: Your Honour, am I allowed to make my final statement in two or three minutes?
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes. What is it?
	
	
	APPELLANT: I think the psychiatrist, your Honour, and everyone present at present deserve to know it’s also concerned am I a violent person or am I capable to have any violent act and I think I have a responsibility to present that. Number 2, there’s G Golgo 13. G-O-L-G-O and then numeric 13, 1-3. This is an extremely violent and a sexual video. Mihoko Numa in order to force me to do a lot of things, unspeakable things for her, she was go as far as to show a four year old Kito, when he was four, constantly exposing him to this many program, including Golgo 13, G-O-L-G-O and space, numeric 13. If you search internet that’s an extremely violent and the sexual content that even in Japan the adults was feeling uncomfortable watching that.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Look, Mr--
	
	
	APPELLANT: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I don’t research anything on the internet, that’s not my role.
	
	
	APPELLANT: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: My role is to adjudicate on matters--
	
	
	APPELLANT: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: --put before by the parties. If you have any concerns about the behaviour of Ms Numa--
	
	
	APPELLANT: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: --towards your son you can complain to either the Department of Family and Community Services.
	
	
	APPELLANT: Yes, I will.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Or the police. I suspect that you might get further with Family and Community Services than the police. All right.
	
	
	APPELLANT: Yes. Thank you, so much.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: But that’s the way to go.
	
	
	APPELLANT: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: If you have any concerns about the health of any of your children who are still under 18 years of age, go to Family and Community Services.
	
	
	APPELLANT: Thank you, so much. I thank everybody.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: There being no further application before me, I dismiss the appeal for want of prosecution. The Court will adjourn.

2702261,Hughes v R [2015] NSWCCA 330,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The applicant was convicted by a jury of ten sexual offences against four victims, when each was under 16 years of age. The jury was unable to reach a verdict in relation to another count involving a fifth victim, also aged under 16. The applicant was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 10 years and 9 months, with a non-parole period of 6 years. The applicant advanced 14 grounds appealing both his conviction and sentence.

The applicant’s case on appeal raised the following issues:

(1)   Whether his Honour erred in refusing an application for a voir dire to determine issues relating to a permanent stay and separate trials of the counts with which the applicant was charged;

(2)   Whether his Honour erred in refusing to permanently stay the indictment due to adverse publicity regarding the applicant;

(3)   Whether his Honour erred in respect of his ruling that all the tendency evidence was admissible, and consequently, in refusing the application for separate trials of the counts in respect of each victim;

(4)   Whether his Honour’s directions to the jury concerning the risks of contamination and concoction and the use of the tendency evidence were inadequate;

(5)   Whether the trial miscarried because of the manner in which the Crown Prosecutor cross-examined the applicant, addressed the jury and delivered her final address, and whether his Honour erred in not discharging the jury following the final address; and

(6)   Whether the sentence imposed by his Honour was too severe.

The applicant contended that these errors amounted to a miscarriage of justice.

Leave to appeal was sought, and granted, as to the applicant’s appeal against sentence. Leave to appeal was sought and refused in relation to ground 5, namely, whether his Honour’s directions as to tendency evidence were inadequate.

Held per the Court, dismissing the appeal:

(1)   The question as to whether a trial judge should permanently stay a trial cannot be approached prospectively. In circumstances where a trial has been held after an application to stay the trial has been refused, what actually transpired at trial is to be considered in assessing the decision to refuse a stay, including the steps taken to ensure a fair trial and the results of those steps. [62]

Dupas v The Queen [2010] HCA 20; 241 CLR 237

(2)   Notwithstanding developments in technology and social media, it is expected that juries will decide cases on the evidence and in light of the submissions advanced at trial and the directions of law which are given by trial judges. The sequences of events at trial did not leave it open to doubt that the jury decided the applicant’s case on the evidence, as it had been directed. [71], [79]

(3)   It is not part of a judge’s function to make his or her own findings as to the likely weight of evidence, or its likely acceptance or rejection by a jury. It is conceivable that there may be cases in which evidence of concoction or contamination gives rise to competing inferences, which are relevant to a determination of the probative value of the evidence by a judge. Given the evidence of prior complaints, this was not such a case. [94]-[95], [200]-[204]

BJS v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 123; 231 A Crim R 532; Jones v R [2014] NSWCCA 280; R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228; DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9; 84 NSWLR 758l; R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121; 84 NSWLR 363; McIntosh v R [2015] NSWCCA 184

(4)   For evidence to be admissible as tendency evidence pursuant to s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), it is not necessary that it exhibit “underlying unity”, “a modus operandi” or a “pattern of conduct”. Rather, the admissibility of tendency evidence requires that it have “significant probative value”. The extent and nature of any similarity is nonetheless relevant to that question. [166]-[167], [188]

Saoud v R [2014] NSWCCA 136; 87 NSWLR 481; R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306; 201 A Crim R 451

(5)   Tendency evidence need not show a tendency to commit acts that constitute the crime or crimes with which an accused is charged. There is a wide range of evidence relevant to the determination of the guilt of a person of a particular crime. The question to be asked is whether conduct said to exhibit a tendency allows an inferential process of reasoning that the person was more likely to act in a particular way or have a relevant state of mind on the particular occasion the subject of the charge or charges. [160], [182]-[185]

Gardiner v R [2006] NSWCCA 190; 162 A Crim R 233; Elomar v R; Hasan v R; Cheikho v R; Jamal v R [2014] NSWCCA 303; 316 ALR 206; FB v R; R v FB [2011] NSWCCA 217; Doyle v R; R v Doyle [2014] NSWCCA 4; DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63; 81 NSWLR 568; R v PWD [2010] NSWCCA 209; 205 A Crim R 75; BP v R; R v BP [2010] NSWCCA 303; R v Ford

(6)   Section 101(2) involves an evaluative judgment by the trial judge, not the exercise of a discretion, as to the prejudicial effect evidence may have on the defendant, taking into account the ameliorating effect of any directions that may be available. The principles in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 apply to the appellate review of such a judgment. [189], [192]

R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319; 58 NSWLR 700; R v Ford; DAO v R; R v Fletcher; Ceissman v R; R v Ngatikaura [2006] NSWCCA 161; 161 A Crim R 329; Sokolowskyj v R [2014] NSWCCA 55; 239 A Crim R 528

(7)   The questions asked by the Crown prosecutor in cross-examination of the applicant were not inconsistent with the obligations governing the conduct of a Crown prosecutor, nor did they reverse the onus of proof. While aspects of the final address of the Crown prosecutor were inappropriate, some of them seriously so, they led to no miscarriage of justice. It was not beyond the bounds of the legitimate exercise of discretion by the trial judge to deal with these matters by way of firm directions to the jury. [280], [320]

(8)   There was no error in his Honour’s factual findings or in his approach to the assessment of the nature and seriousness of the applicant’s offending for the purpose of sentencing. His Honour was well aware of the distinction between not increasing a penalty based on aggravation and not granting an offender leniency on account of the fact that the events charged were not isolated incidents. [351], [353]

Dousha v R [2008] NSWCCA 263

(9)   His Honour properly regarded the sentencing practices at the time when the offence was committed and, in light of those practices, his conclusions as to the non-parole period and aggregate sentence were properly open to him. [358]

Magnuson v R [2013] NSWCCA 50; Featherstone v R [2008] NSWCCA 71; 183 A Crim R 540

(10)   No error was established as to the weight his Honour placed upon the applicant’s evidence of extra curial punishment, or his consideration of how harsh the applicant’s conditions of custody were likely to be. Nor did his Honour err in his consideration of the victim impact statements and sworn evidence received from the complainants at trial. [370], [372]-[373]

R v Slack [2004] NSWCCA 128

(11)   The incidents of extra curial punishment the applicant has suffered while in custody should not have happened, and raise matters of public interest which ought to be referred by the Crown to the Minister and the Commissioner of Corrective Services (NSW). [390]

Held per the Court, refusing leave to appeal ground 5:

(12)   When considered as a whole, his Honour’s written and oral directions to the jury as to the use of tendency evidence were correct and adequate. A direction in stronger terms was not required. [234]

Judgment


	
	THE COURT: On 7 April 2014, a jury convicted Robert Lindsay Hughes of nine sexual offences committed between 1984 and 1987 against three victims, when each was aged under 16 years. On 8 April he was convicted of a 10th offence committed in 1990, involving an act of indecency towards a fourth victim, also then aged under 16 years. The jury was then discharged, being unable to reach a verdict in relation to another count involving a sexual offence, which it was alleged he had committed in 1988, against a fifth victim, who was also then aged under 16 years.
	
	
	On 16 May 2014, Zahra SC DCJ sentenced Mr Hughes to an aggregate sentence of 10 years and 9 months, with a non-parole period of 6 years, to date from 7 April 2014.
	
	
	Mr Hughes appeals against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against sentence. Leave is required in respect of ground 5 on the conviction appeal in accordance with r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. For convenience, Mr Hughes is hereafter referred to as the applicant. His case is that he has been the victim of a miscarriage of justice.

The grounds of appeal


	
	The grounds of appeal advanced in the notice of appeal were:
	


“Ground 1: His Honour erred in refusing an application for a voir dire to determine issues relating to a permanent stay and separate trials of the counts against [the applicant]

Ground 2: His Honour erred in refusing to permanently stay the indictment.

Ground 3: His Honour erred in refusing the application for separate trials of the counts

Ground 4: His Honour erred in respect of his ruling that all of the tendency evidence was admissible

Ground 5: His Honour’s directions to the jury concerning their use of the tendency evidence were inadequate

Ground 6: His Honour’s directions concerning the risks of contamination were inadequate

Ground 7: The trial miscarried because of the manner in which the Crown Prosecutor cross-examined [the applicant]

Ground 8: The trial miscarried because of the manner in which the Crown Prosecutor addressed the jury

Ground 9: His Honour erred in refusing to discharge the jury following the Crown Prosecutor’s final address

Ground 10: His Honour erred by failing to adequately direct the jury concerning the Crown Prosecutor’s final address

Ground 11: The sentence imposed by his Honour was too severe because:

(i)   His Honour erred in assessing the objective seriousness of [the applicant’s] offending;

(ii)   His Honour had insufficient regard to sentencing practices at the time of the offending;

(iii)   His Honour had insufficient regard to the [applicant’s] extra curial punishment; and

(iv)   His Honour fell into error in his approach to the victim impact statements.”


	
	During the course of the applicant’s submissions, three further grounds were sought to be advanced:
	


“Ground 12:   The trial miscarried as a consequence of his Honour’s refusal of the application for a permanent stay of proceedings.

Ground 13:   The trial miscarried as a consequence of his Honour’s refusal to separate the counts on the indictment.

Ground 14:   His Honour’s sentencing exercise miscarried because it was not fully apparent to the court at the time of sentencing how harsh the [applicant’s] conditions of custody were likely to be.”


	
	The Crown did not oppose the leave sought in relation to grounds 12 and 13, in respect of which leave was granted at the hearing. Leave to advance ground 14 was opposed.
	


Pre-Trial Publicity


	
	Before turning to the grounds of the appeal, the unusual level of attention which the allegations made against the applicant and the trial generated in mainstream and social media should be explained.
	
	
	There was no issue between the parties that there had been an extraordinary level of interest in the allegations the subject of the charges, reflected by mainstream media reports over the course of the preceding two years, as well as in social media. It was also common ground that the nature of the media coverage was correctly described by Zahra DCJ in his 14 February 2014 permanent stay judgment (R v Hughes (District Court (NSW), Zahra DCJ, 14 February 2014, unrep)), where his Honour referred in detail, at pp 2 – 12, to extracts of reporting of specific allegations against the applicant, in both mainstream and social media. These reports were also variously referred to in his Honour’s 14 February tendency judgment (R v Hughes (District Court (NSW), Zahra DCJ, 14 February 2014, unrep)).
	
	
	The applicant was an actor who had the lead role in a well-known Australian series, Hey Dad..!, which aired in the late 1980’s to the mid-1990’s. The complainant, SM, had played the role of his daughter in that series. An editor of the magazine Woman’s Day, Mr Jackson, became aware of rumours that the applicant had abused SM, while they worked on the program together. In 2010 he asked a publicity agent, Mr Moriarty, to approach SM about an interview. Mr Jackson later interviewed SM and published an article in Woman’s Day in March 2010, which did not name the applicant, but contained allegations of sexual abuse against a cast member.
	
	
	SM then lived in America and the applicant in Singapore. She later agreed to be interviewed by the television program, A Current Affair. That interview was later broadcast on 22 March 2010. Again the accused was not named. Other complainants then came forward. During a second interview broadcast on 25 March 2010, in which JP and her sister were also interviewed, it was alleged that the accused had engaged in sexual misconduct. AA, later called as a tendency witness, then came forward.
	
	
	It emerged at trial that Mr Moriarty and SM had both received payments for interviews which SM had given. In total, SM had received some $100,000.
	
	
	Both the magazine article and these television programs generated considerable interest, including in the mainstream media and social media. A police investigation into the applicant began soon afterwards. The applicant was confronted by media in Singapore. That confrontation also received media coverage. He then moved to London, where he was arrested on 9 August 2012, by the London Police Extradition Unit. He did not contest extradition and was granted conditional bail. He later surrendered to police and was transferred to Sydney. This, too, attracted media attention, as did the later court proceedings.
	
	
	In the permanent stay judgment, Zahra DCJ described the media coverage at each of these stages to have been “substantial and extensive” and in March 2010 to have been “intense and widespread”. On the stay application, the applicant had tendered evidence of newspaper publications, television and radio reports gleaned through media monitoring organisations, as well as what internet searches using the search engine Google had revealed, and what had been published on other social media, including Facebook and Twitter.
	
	
	Zahra DCJ outlined in detail the media reporting, by reference to the titles of published articles. He noted that cast members had been interviewed, and that they had referred to rumours of sexual misconduct by the applicant toward young cast members, as well as to the specific allegations made by SM. Photos of SM and the applicant, while she was a small child, were widely published. That reporting, his Honour found, maintained some momentum from 2010 to 2012, largely due to reporting of the continuing delay in the police investigation. In that period, there was ongoing reporting about SM’s complaints, as well as extensive reporting of complaints by other complainants, some of whom were interviewed and their complaints broadcast on television.
	
	
	His Honour at pp 6 – 7 described the types of allegations then propagated in the public domain as follows:
	


“•   A number of articles referred to multiple victims coming forward. One article contained a reference to the complainant noting “she knew he was a ‘dirty old man’ but had been pressured to stay quiet”.

•   Triggering events which precipitated further reporting included reference to civil action being brought by a complainant in March 2011. A further article in March 2011 noted “Daughter of Hey Dad! star rejects sex abuse claims”.

•   Reporting of the competition between the rival television stations for news stories relating to the allegations in itself became the focus of reporting at this time; at one time reporting related to the nomination of the A Current Affair program for a ‘Logie’, a television industry award, relating to media reporting of the allegations.

•   A media posting by commentator Mr Derryn Hinch notes: “I had several reactions...sadness that yet another vulnerable little girl had been treated so badly...frustration that for a number of reasons, especially our defamation laws, the name of the man who did this is still being protected...what hell was that little girl going through...where were the adults to stop it or listen...the child must be disturbed...”

•   Media reports of ratings surveys noted the program A Current Affair as receiving a “ratings jackpot”.

•   The pattern of continuing reporting included articles related to the complainant SM such as “TV robbed me of my Childhood” and articles reporting on the continuing investigation including: “100 witnesses more alleged victims, but Hey Dad star not pursued” The text of this article included the following: “...Sunday Telegraph has learned the number of police witnesses has blown out to “just” under 100 people, many of whom have corroborated allegations made by two former cast members... police are reinvestigating a number of similar complaints made to police about Mr Hughes during the 1980’s and 1990’s. Others included “Hey Dad star still to be questioned; “Sex case against Hey Dad star Robert Hughes widens as alleged victims rise to seven”; “Hey Dad Star still to be questioned”.

•   An article was published in the Woman’s Day magazine (Jan 2012) concerning the complainant headed: “Hey dad [SM] my bittersweet baby joy”, with an attribution to the complainant SM, “Main life [sic] now is to protect others...”

•   March 2011 report: “Hey Dad star to launch civil action”; “Ms [SM] told [A Current Affair she will not wait for New South Wales Police to finish investigations into the allegations before launching a civil action”. This reporting triggered further media interest including further articles noting: “Hey Dad! star to sue network”.

•   In March 2011 media reporting included footage and photographs of media confronting the accused in a car in Singapore.

•   14 March 2011 media reporting included an A Current Affair – “Special Sunday Report” on an earthquake in Japan which contained an additional report which was described as a “one year update” on the Hey Dad allegations. That report referred to a report to be screened on another television station which was said to contain an interview with the tendency witness [AA].

•   An article dated 14 March 2011 in the magazine New Idea was headed “Hey Dad! Scandal one year on – Please give us justice”. Further reporting at this time referred to concerns about the delay in investigation.

•   In December 2011, in an interview with the commentator Mr Derryn Hinch during the television program 7.30 Report, reference was made to Mr Hinch’s “campaign” to reveal child sex offenders and his history of breaching court orders in naming alleged offenders. Reference was made to a letter received from the complainant SM and allegations of molestation. Reference was made to the ability to use an ‘app’ to identify child sex offenders adding “it’s common sense”.

•   On 28 February 2012, a further A Current Affair program announced: “Hey Dad!” Scandal continues” adding: “It was one of the biggest scandals in Australian television history – two years since we exposed the Hey Dad! sex scandal that shocked the nation, more confessions are about to be heard from behind the scenes of the 80’s family comedy”.

•   Also in February 2012, a report “Fresh abuse claim against former Hey Dad! star Robert Hughes” referred to an allegation that the accused groomed a teenage fan during an eight month relationship.

•   An article in March 2012 noted: “Police slam parody of Hey Dad child abuse allegations...” as “...impacting upon the trauma of victims”.”


	
	Zahra DCJ also outlined the nature of the reporting when the applicant was confronted in Singapore and when he was later arrested in London. Comments attributed to police investigators were then published in The Sydney Morning Herald. Mr Derryn Hinch also commented on his website on SM’s bravery in coming forward with her allegations. His Honour observed, at p 8, that:
	


“The extensive media reporting led to commentators, including lawyers’ associations, questioning whether the accused would obtain a fair trial as the reporting was said to amount to “trial by media”. This issue in itself, which was extensively commented upon, had the effect of propagating the publication of allegations of sexual misconduct by the accused.”


	
	His Honour went on to outline the types of reporting in the media following the London extradition proceedings, the Local Court appearance in July 2012 and later in the District Court. He then dealt with the September 2013 program “Predators under Protection” presented by Mr Derryn Hinch, which was broadcast on 8 September, when SM was interviewed and on 15 September, when viewers were invited to vote for a petition advocating a “Megan’s Law” in Australia. That referred to legislation enacted in a number of States in America, where the location of convicted sex offenders is published and signs are placed outside their homes, notifying the public that a sex offender resides there. Publicity for that program included photographs of SM sitting on the applicant’s lap. Published ratings for the program indicated that it had attracted 1.2 million viewers.
	
	
	Zahra DCJ then turned to consider what had been published on social media, extracts from Facebook, Twitter and YouTube having been tendered. His Honour observed that the entries tended to follow the same pattern as reporting in other media, with increased traffic coinciding with mainstream media reporting. His Honour observed, at p 11, that:
	


“A volume containing a schedule of extracts from social media including Facebook; Twitter and You Tube was tendered on the application. The entries tend to follow the same pattern as reporting in other mediums. At times of triggering events, the internet traffic tends to increase. In most instances it is difficult to determine the degree of access by the public to the particular sites. Little information is provided as to the numbers of persons exposed to the material. Some information is provided on a number of sites which note the number of “Likes”. This however does not necessarily indicate the number of persons who might have been exposed to the sites.

The material contained on social media sites is not constrained and contributors are largely anonymous. The material refers to the accused in a derogatory way and opinions are expressed about the alleged conduct of the accused. Much of the material vilifies the accused. By way of example, in July 2013 at the time of the reporting of the committal for trial of the accused, Facebook entries attached to the Channel 9 News site included comments such as the following: “Lock the pedo up”; “Innocent men don’t hide out in Asia”; “Once a pedo always a pedo”; “Lock him up so he can’t ruin any more lives”; “Hang the pedo”- The notation on the Channel 9 website indicated “228,376 likes” and “35,006 talking about this”.

Additionally, the social media site of the complainant SM tends to act as a running commentary of her views of the investigations undertaken by police. The information is disseminated with quite some frequency. A number of postings by the complainant SM at the time of arrest and charging acknowledge the investigation carried out by police.

The dissemination of material and commentary through social media continued throughout and up until the trial date in this court.”


	
	His Honour also noted, at p 12, that there had been some 700,000 - 800,000 “views” to sites connected to the “Mr Doodleberger” videos, which on appeal were submitted to have been the worst of the applicant’s vilification on social media, together with the “Hitler Bunker” video, which had been published on YouTube.
	
	
	The Mr Doodleberger videos were dubbed extracts from the Hey Dad..! program, which contained images of the accused and other cast members, with the original dialogue replaced with offensive language, describing the accused as a paedophile. He was also then referred to in other demeaning and derogatory ways, intended to portray him as a sexual predator. The Hitler bunker video was a scene from a German film set in Hitler’s bunker in which English subtitles referred to the applicant in derogatory terms.
	
	
	We were taken to that material on appeal. The applicant’s counsel submitted that, at the time of the appeal hearing, it was still accessible on social media. Whether it was created before, or after the applicant was charged in 2012, is not apparent.
	
	
	During the course of the trial, attention was also drawn to inaccurate and prejudicial reports published in mainstream media, which had also been taken up on social media. On 21 March 2014, for example, an article published in The Daily Telegraph was marked MFI 103. The submission advanced by the applicant’s advocate on 21 March was:
	


“I can hand up the marked transcript pages just to ensure accuracy, your Honour. I also hand up ABC report from Lucy McNally on the second page. She also took up the same sort of reporting in suggesting walking around the set in his underwear. My submission is this, if the press can’t accurately report the evidence then the Court may have to be closed; it’s got to this stage. This is about the fourth or fifth time; it truncates the proceedings, it takes up undue time it causes, this accused is about to be cross-examined, undue stress and anxiety to him and his legal representatives. I’m sure the Crown would be concerned about any further prejudice to the trial. This is a very serious situation.”


	
	His Honour observed:
	


“It is important for those members of the media who are present that the reporting be accurate. I have given the jury a number of directions that they should not access the media and to rely only on the evidence but bad reporting like this makes their job exceptionally much more difficult and it may in fact prejudice the trial. I can’t do anything more, Mr Walsh, than indicate a degree of frustration that the Court’s time is again occupied by dealing with matters of this kind which can be clearly overcome by ensuring that reporting is accurate. I can only indicate that at this stage nothing has been done that requires me to make any order at this stage, Mr Walsh, but I’m becoming increasingly concerned that the reporting is inaccurate.”


	
	Orders were later made, directed to particular media organisations, for example in relation to an ABC Media Watch program aired on 29 March 2010.
	
	
	During the trial, there was no application for takedown orders in relation to various prejudicial material, but various concerns were raised with Zahra DCJ from time to time as to the ongoing coverage of the trial, both by the Crown and the applicant. On 10 March 2014, for example, an order under the Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) was made in relation to what had been published on the website mamamia.com.au.
	
	
	As a result, during the course of the hearing, Zahra DCJ also gave various directions to the jury as to the need to decide the case on the basis of the evidence, not what was said in media reports.
	


The Conviction Appeal

Ground 1:   His Honour erred in refusing an application for a voir dire to determine issues relating to a permanent stay and separate trials of the counts against the applicant.

Ground 2:   His Honour erred in refusing to permanently stay the indictment.

Ground 6:   His Honour’s directions concerning the risks of contamination were inadequate.

Ground 12:   The trial miscarried as a consequence of his Honour’s refusal of the application for a permanent stay of proceedings.


	
	All of these grounds must be rejected.
	


The relevant procedural history


	
	The applicant was arraigned before Zahra DCJ on 10 February 2014, when numerous pre-trial applications raised by notices of motion filed by the applicant in January 2014 were dealt with. The respondents to the motion which sought suppression orders in relation to the pre-trial applications, as well as other orders, were:
	


Director of Public Prosecutions (First Respondent)

Twenty Three claimed complainants and tendency witnesses (Second Respondent)

Fairfax Digital Australia and New Zealand Pty Ltd (Third Respondent)

Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd (Fourth Respondent)

News Digital Media Pty Ltd (Fifth Respondent)

Nationwide News Pty Ltd (Sixth Respondent)

Australian Broadcasting Corporation (Seventh Respondent)

Yahoo!7 Pty Ltd (Eighth Respondent)

Seven Network (Operations) Ltd (Ninth Respondent)

Ninemsn Pty Ltd (Tenth Respondent)

Derryn Hinch (Eleventh Respondent)


	
	The motions also sought orders as to:
	


“i.   A permanent stay of the indictment;

ii.    A separate trial in relation to each complainant;

iii.   A ruling on the admissibility of tendency and coincidence evidence;

iv.   A voir dire be conducted as to the stay application and the admissibility of the tendency and coincidence evidence.”


	
	On 5 February 2014, Zahra DCJ had made interim orders in relation to the hearing of the pre-trial applications, which prevented publication of the applicant’s identity and the motions. They were vacated at the pre-trial hearing on 10 February.
	
	
	On 11 February, Zahra DCJ made a non-publication order in relation to the complainants and any material that might identify them (T 51.20-24). This order was later vacated, his Honour taking the view that the provisions of s 578A of the Crimes Act were adequate, the section making it an offence to publish any matter which identified the complainant in prescribed sexual offence proceedings or any matter which is likely to lead to the identification of the complainant (T 58.32-37). There are also similar provisions contained in the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW).
	
	
	There are exceptions provided for in s 578A(4), including in relation to publications authorised by the presiding Judge or Justice and those made with the consent of a complainant of or over the age of 14 years at the time of publication. On 8 April 2014, a non-publication order was made in relation to the identity of various tendency witnesses. On 9 April 2014, Zahra DCJ revoked that order in relation to a tendency witness AA, on her application.
	
	
	The applicant’s pre-trial applications were heard in February 2014, the parties advancing both written and oral submissions. On 11 February, Mr Sibtain, appearing for the media respondents, referred to discussions with the applicant’s advocate about steps which might be taken by agreement to take down particular publications. That matter was then deferred and, finally, no take down order was pressed at that stage.
	


The applicant’s case on the stay


	
	The case advanced for the applicant at the pre-trial hearing was that the nature of the extraordinary level of adverse publicity earlier explained, which was submitted to have been directed to the merits of what was in issue at the trial, namely, the applicant’s guilt of the charges he was defending, was such that he could not receive a fair trial. Prospective jurors had necessarily been exposed to it, with the result, it was argued, that they were likely to have prejudged the prosecution case, in a way that was adverse to him. In these circumstances, it was submitted, justice required that the proceedings be permanently stayed.
	
	
	The media reporting which had extended over some four years was submitted to have moved well beyond objective reporting, to a portrayal of the applicant as having preyed on vulnerable young actors, with the evidence against him being represented to be so overwhelming, that he must be guilty. The circumstances were submitted to be such that no jury, properly instructed, could go about their task in an impartial way, the applicant having been portrayed as a vile, despicable human being, who had preyed upon the young and vulnerable and was guilty of the allegations made against him. Complainants had been portrayed in a sympathetic way and a deliberate campaign to obtain interviews with witnesses and complainants, and to publish the evidence it was expected that they would give, had been pursued.
	
	
	The applicant also argued that there had been no proper motive for the “Predators under Protection” program, broadcast after his extradition, while he was awaiting trial. Directions to the jury could not undo the damage done to the impartiality of jurors who had seen that program, which it was argued had done him great prejudice, given that actual and implied assertions of guilt had been made.
	
	
	A report led from Professor Thomson, a psychologist, was relied on to support the application. He had studied the capacity of jurors exposed to pre-trial publicity to reach a verdict solely on the evidence and the operation of “confirmatory bias”, which was a tendency to seek out information based on established belief and to overlook material inconsistent with such belief.
	
	
	It was argued that, while there was a public interest in open discussion of sexual abuse of children in the community, the prejudice which had flowed to the applicant from what had occurred could not be cured by directions given at a trial, particularly given the ongoing access to that material available to jurors through use of the internet.
	
	
	In the result, the circumstances were submitted to fall into that type of case discussed in R v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; 173 CLR 592 at 623-24, where “extreme” or “singular” circumstances had arisen, which justified a permanent stay, given the abiding effect of the pre-trial publicity and the inability of a trial judge, by thorough and appropriate directions, to dispel that effect.
	
	
	The Crown opposed the application, contending that the case did not fall into that exceptional class of cases, notwithstanding the nature of the publications about the applicant. It contended that the applicant could receive a fair trial before a jury, properly instructed.
	


The applicant’s application to cross-examine witnesses on contamination


	
	Each of the complainants had made complaints about the alleged offending, while they were still children. Those complainants had been dealt with in various ways, but none had resulted in charges being laid against the applicant. Each complainant pursued their allegations as adults, after the media interest in the applicant had arisen in 2010. After he was charged, the applicant was served with statements made by the complainants and other witnesses the Crown proposed to call at the trial. There was no committal hearing and the applicant thus sought the opportunity to cross-examine the complainants and other witnesses, prior to the trial. That application was opposed.
	
	
	The application to cross-examine was pressed on the basis of a 120 page document (Exhibit 13), which identified the questions which the applicant sought to ask, prior to trial, in order to explore the possibility of contamination and/or concoction of their evidence, having regard to communications between complainants and witnesses and exposure to others’ complaints, through access to publicity.
	
	
	On 12 February 2014, Zahra DCJ drew to attention the difference between calling a witness, where there was a real possibility of concoction, as opposed to a possibility because there may have been an opportunity to communicate. The applicant then tendered Exhibit 19, a schedule of alleged contamination and Exhibit 20, an amended schedule of witnesses sought to be cross-examined and questioned, which comprised 56 pages.
	
	
	The Crown maintained its opposition to the application, given the history of complaints, prior to the complainants having come forward as adults in 2010.
	
	
	The applicant’s case before Zahra DCJ was that his Honour was not being called on to assess the credibility of those sought to be examined, based on contamination, fabrication and motive, such as to earn money, but rather to determine whether there was a real chance of contamination having occurred. His Honour considered that this argument required some precision, given that while it appeared that complainants had come forward relatively soon after the A Current Affair programs, which had put particular information into the public domain, they had earlier made particular complaints. The applicant then sought the opportunity to consider his position further.
	
	
	On 13 February, the applicant’s advocate conceded that his application to cross-examine all of those identified was “something like a wish list”, but submitted that the opportunity to examine AK, for example, was required in order to examine what she had said in her police statement in 1986/87 and differences in her later statement. His Honour raised the difficulty that examination of such a witness as to the impact which access to information which had come into the public domain had had on her recollection, could only establish that it was possible that contamination had resulted, even accepting that possibility, at its highest.
	
	
	The hearing that day concluded with Zahra DCJ indicating his preliminary view to the parties, that he could see no utility in permitting the cross-examination sought on the voir dire. He indicated that he would allow Mr Walsh, the applicant’s advocate, to address him further the following day. The next day Mr Walsh advanced nothing more, but relied on his written submissions.
	


The 14 February judgments


	
	On 14 February 2014, Zahra DCJ delivered a number of judgments, one refusing the permanent stay application and another dealing with the admissibility of the tendency evidence, the separate trial application and the application that the applicant be permitted to cross-examine the complainants and proposed witnesses about contamination and concoction of their evidence.
	


Reasons for refusing the stay


	
	In his February 2014 stay judgment, his Honour concluded that the media material relied on demonstrated significant prejudice to the applicant, given its volume and content (at 18), and that its dissemination through social media was likely to engender significant ill will towards him and sympathy towards the complainants (at 19). He also considered that the reporting of SM’s complaints had moved well beyond objective reporting, as had use of comments by investigating police officers.
	
	
	The frequency of the reports, his Honour found, over the course of some four years, had also reinforced impressions of the applicant’s guilt, the reporting prior to his charge having involved unrestrained commentary of a most prejudicial kind, which was in many instances irresponsible (at 19). His Honour considered that the “Predators under Protection” programs arguably contained elements of contempt. As to this, his Honour observed:
	


“The program, which refers to the upcoming trial of the accused, contains undertones of vigilantism in the commentary; contains depictions of law enforcement officers disclosing the identity of child sex offenders and depicts the complainant SM in a campaign to disclose the whereabouts of child sex offenders.”


	
	His Honour concluded that it was highly likely that a large proportion of potential jurors in the State had been exposed to the pre-trial publicity, the predominant driver of which was commercial interest, without due “regard for the interests of the accused and the community in a fair trial” (at 20). His Honour then observed:
	


“It is however not part of my function to control the dissemination of material through the various media forms; to discern the motives of those behind the prejudicial reporting or to sanction or send a message to the media by staying the proceedings. The decision to stay proceedings must be based upon the proper application of principle.”


	
	This observation was argued on appeal to have revealed the error into which his Honour fell, in refusing to grant the permanent stay sought.
	
	
	His Honour concluded at pp 20 – 21:
	


“I am of the view that with appropriate directions, despite the sustained and prejudicial nature of the publicity here, a fair trial can be ensured. In forming that view I have taken into account the particular qualities of the publicity here which may mean that potential jurors exposed to that publicity may have engaged in prejudgment. I am of the view ultimately that careful directions will be effective in focussing juror’s minds on the necessity that, as judges, they must base their decision making solely on the evidence led in the trial. As I have indicated, the touchstone is the need to ensure a fair trial and whilst regard is to be had in the balancing process to the community’s expectation that persons charged with criminal offences are brought to trial, the community expects a trial of the accused to be fair.

There are a number of steps that can be undertaken which will operate to minimise the risk of prejudice to the accused. Prior to empanelling, members of the jury panel would need to be directed to seek to be excused if the effect of any pre-trial publicity is such that they cannot bring an impartial mind to bear on the issues to be determined in the trial.

Careful directions need to be given to the jury during the trial and in the summing up. The jury need to be reminded of the qualities that they must bring into the jury room in their role as judges in this trial and to confine their consideration to the evidence led in the trial and to ignore any publicity they may have been exposed to.

I am not of the view that considering the matters raised and their cumulative effect that this is an exceptional case warranting intervention by the grant of a stay of proceedings.”

Reasons for refusing the application to cross-examine on contamination


	
	In his 14 February tendency judgment, Zahra DCJ dealt with the possibility of contamination and concoction in the context of the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). His Honour outlined the evidence to be called from the complainants and the tendency witnesses from pp 9 to 37 of his judgment, before turning to evidence touching on communications between two of the complainants, AK and SM; the evidence of awareness of complaints on the part of tendency witnesses LJ, CS and VR arising from communications between them and from media reporting; and other evidence of contamination/concoction arising from media reporting, particularly the Woman’s Day article and the two A Current Affair interviews. His Honour also outlined the chronology of complaints made prior to the media reporting in March 2010.
	
	
	Having reviewed that evidence, Zahra DCJ concluded that the media reporting was the catalyst for a number of complainants having come forward, but considered that “at its highest the evidence does no more than establish a merely speculative chance of contamination, rather than a ‘real possibility’”. His Honour concluded at p 49:
	


“It is important to consider the nature and content of the reporting and what was in the public domain at the time the particular complainants came forward and made statements to police. In my view, the material in the public domain at the relevant time to which I have referred was limited. Primarily, the material disseminated related to the complainants SM and JP, and was limited in its content and in parts lacked specificity. In my view, in assessing the potential for contamination it is significant that the other complainants had made complaint well before the media publicity. This is clearly apparent when one considers the history of complaint, which I have referred to in detail, and is manifest in the chronology produced here. There are some elements of the evidence of the other complainants, such as inappropriate touching and exposure of genitals, which are common to the conduct described by SM and reported in the media in the way I have extracted here. The conduct described by the other complainants, however, covers a wide range of conduct and a wide range of circumstances in which the conduct occurred, which a number of them described in detail when they complained of the accused’s conduct well before the media publicity.

The fact that a complainant or tendency witness has read or heard of publicity concerning allegations made against the accused does not of itself give rise to the risk of contamination. I have considered the potential for contamination in relation to each complainant and tendency witness separately.

Even if one presumes that each of the complainants was exposed to all the information concerning the particular sexual conduct of the accused in media reporting, to which I have referred, the possibility of contamination or concoction is no more than speculative. In my view it does not give rise to a real risk of contamination.”


	
	His Honour also considered the possibility of earlier contamination, through direct and indirect contact between a number of persons in 1986-87, when there were rumours about the applicant at a school and an investigation by police and a report to DOCS. His Honour considered that the possibility of contamination at that time having occurred was at best speculative, and that there was no real possibility of either contamination or concoction for which complainants other than SM and tendency witnesses had any motive, they all having made statements to police independently. He also considered that it was speculation to consider that complainants were emboldened by media publicity to give false accounts (at pp 52 – 53).
	
	
	His Honour considered the payments made to SM to be relevant, but concluded that they also raised no more than a possibility of concoction, given her prior complaints. His Honour concluded, at p 53, that:
	


“In my view, despite the vast volume of media reporting, the reporting which referred to the nature of sexual conduct engaged in by the accused is limited and does not give rise to a risk of contamination of the evidence at trial.

The nature of the allegations made by the complainants are different to the accounts given in the media reporting, though there is some commonality of allegations of the accused exposing his genitals and engaging in touching. The fact that there is some commonality, in my view, is insufficient to amount to a reasonable possibility of concoction or contamination.”


	
	On appeal, there was no suggestion that his Honour’s findings involved any factual error. It was the conclusions which were reached on those facts, in relation to the application to cross-examine the complainants and witnesses, which were attacked as erroneous.
	


Zahra DCJ did not fall into error on the stay


	
	There were no appeals against either judgment brought under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). In the result, on this appeal what arises for consideration is not only whether, on the material before his Honour at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings when the applicant’s applications were refused, there was error, but also whether there is error in light of what subsequently occurred at trial.
	
	
	What is pursued on appeal must be approached in the way discussed in Dupas v The Queen [2010] HCA 20; 241 CLR 237 at [19], that is, the complaints advanced cannot be approached purely prospectively, as Zahra DCJ had to consider what fell to him to decide. The issues lying between the parties on appeal must be resolved with the assistance provided by what actually transpired at the trial, including the steps taken to ensure that it was a fair trial, and their results.
	
	
	For the reasons which his Honour explained, he concluded that despite the nature and extent of pre-trial publicity established on the evidence, there was not a serious risk that it would deprive the accused of a fair trial. What unfolded at the trial bore out that his Honour had a proper basis for that conclusion.
	
	
	As discussed in Dupas, at [26], it has been long settled that:
	


“.. the experience and wisdom of the law is that, almost universally, jurors approach their tasks conscientiously. The point was made as follows by Hughes J, with the endorsement of the English Court of Appeal, in R v Abu Hamza [See [2007] QB 659 at 685-686]:

""Extensive publicity and campaigns against potential defendants are by no means unknown in cases of notoriety. Whilst the law of contempt operates to minimise it, it is not always avoidable, especially where intense public concern arises about a particular crime and a particular defendant before any charge is brought. Jurors are in such cases capable of understanding that comment in the media might or might not be justified and that it is to find out whether it is that is one of their tasks. They are capable of understanding that allegations which have been made may be true or may not be and that they, the jury, are to have the opportunity and responsibility of hearing all the evidence which commentators in the media have not and of deciding whether in fact the allegations are true or not. They are not surprised to be warned not to take at face value what appears in the media, nor are they these days so deferential to politicians as to be incapable of understanding that they should make no assumptions about whether any statements made by such people are justified or not. They are also capable of understanding and habitually apply the direction that they are given about the standard of proof.""”


	
	In R v Burrell [2004] NSWCCA 185, it was suggested by the then Chief Justice, at [39], that:
	


“The accessibility of information on the internet has been enhanced by contemporary search engines to such a degree that special measures are now called for. In addition to strong warnings to the jury, it may be advisable for the Crown to conduct searches in advance of a trial and request Australian based websites to remove references to an accused for the period of a trial.”


	
	Given how the internet and social media have developed since 2004 and how they now operate, as was explored during the pre-trial applications, when representatives of the media appeared, the efficacy of such steps is entirely questionable. That explains why few take down orders were pursued by the applicant, even during the course of the trial, which continued to attract considerable ongoing attention by both mainstream and social media.
	
	
	That does not, however, mean that an accused who now becomes the subject of intense community interest, as the applicant did, cannot receive a fair trial. Nor did the evidence establish that the applicant’s trial was not a fair one.
	
	
	All of us, accused, victims, judges, jurors and other members of our community now live in a world of instant, largely unregulated communication of opinions disseminated by publication on social media, where they can endlessly be accessed and responded to by others. Such opinions range from the mildest of those depicted on the material in evidence (to the effect that if convicted the applicant should be appropriately sentenced), to the most extreme. In this case, that included satirical videos in the poorest of taste accessible on YouTube and even worse, commentary that not only denigrated the applicant in the way Zahra DCJ discussed, but which contained commentary which his Honour described as amounting to vigilantism.
	
	
	The reality remains, however, that our civil society and the justice system which it has devised, is the means by which we help ensure that such views remain confined to social media, where those who hold such views are free to express them, rather than being acted on.
	
	
	For centuries now, courts have had confidence that juries will decide the cases which they are called on to judge, on the basis of the evidence and that they will adhere to the directions which they are given by the presiding trial judges. Experience, including that revealed by this trial, demonstrates that despite fast moving technological advances which have provided people with enhanced means of communication, jurors still approach their tasks conscientiously.
	
	
	There is good reason to continue in the expectation that, notwithstanding these technological developments and what they permit, juries will continue deciding cases on the evidence, in light of the submissions advanced at the trial by those who represent the parties to the proceedings and the directions of law which they are given by trial judges. This case demonstrates that jurors still accept that their decisions should not be made on the basis of what is published elsewhere, including on social media, about what falls to them to decide.
	
	
	Zahra DCJ having identified the difficulties of ensuring that the applicant received a fair trial, took a number of appropriate steps, which ensured that the trial was a fair one. That began with what his Honour said, even before the jury was selected, after the applicant and witnesses were identified to potential jurors. His Honour then said:
	


“Ladies and gentlemen there has been substantial publicity concerning the allegations made against the accused which are the foundation of the charges that have been read from the indictment. Many if not most of you may have been exposed to some of that publicity. Many would have been exposed to a substantial amount of publicity. That publicity has occurred in print, both newspapers and magazine[s] and in electronic media. Substantial publicity occurred in 2010 at the time of the arrest of the accused and the period following. There has also been substantial reporting on Internet sites. Those of you who will be selected as the jury, will swear an oath or take an affirmation, that is, that you will solemnly and sincerely declare and affirm that you will give a true verdict according to the evidence. That you listen to the evidence and consider closely the evidence in the trial and to give a true verdict according to the evidence. Your role as a juror if you are selected in this trial will be that of a judge. You will by taking that oath or making an affirmation become a judge in this trial, a judge of the facts. You as a jury of 12 alone have the role of returning the verdicts in this trial. You must have some understanding of the qualities that you must bring in your role as a judge. As a judge you will decide the issues based only on the evidence led in this trial, not on what someone else might have said elsewhere, for example in a newspaper or other media report. As a judge you must act impartially.”


	
	After the jury was empaneled, Zahra DCJ addressed the jurors as to the onus of proof falling on the Crown; the presumption of innocence; their role as judges of the facts, based on the evidence; being impartial in the proceedings; and applying the law as directed by his Honour, to the facts as they found them to be. They were also given written directions that their verdict must be based solely on the evidence and that they had to exclude from their minds any publicity. His Honour later revisited what he had said before the empanelment, as to the significant pre-trial publicity which juries might have seen or read, as the trial continued. That topic was also addressed in the applicant’s submissions and was again taken up in his Honour’s summing-up.
	
	
	This was undoubtedly a jury which attended to those directions. It posed a number of questions during the trial, including pertinently, during the summing-up, in relation to publicity. By the jury note marked MFI 121 the jury asked:
	


“Can his honor [sic] please help us to better understand his Direction specifically regarding “that we ensure we go into a detailed and specific assessment of the “Defence counsel” “suggestion” in his closing address that the “similarity and consistency” in all the Complainents [sic] and Tendency witnesses evidence regarding the behaviour of the accused, somehow shows “contamination” and “collusion” from Awareness of Details Published in the Media Reports of Channel 9, Channel 7 and other media???

In light of the Directions His Honor [sic] has given us repeatedly to ignore all awareness of Media Report Details as “not evidence” as “not facts to be judged by us in this trial” How can we then apply this suggestion of scrutinizing “evidence” against Media Reports??? Many of us have also never seen any of the said “Media Reports” or even “Hey Dad” show ever.

If e.g. we were to apply such intense scrutiny to evidence of Defence Witnesses who said they have read all Witnesses Statements, All evidence of all witnesses, wouldn’t that mean we would also have to read all the material as well to see if there are any match ups or “contamination and collusion” that it enabled?

His Honour has repeatedly given us “Directions” to understand “suggestions of questions of Counsel” are “not evidence” “the answer of the witness is evidence.”

So how do we go about apparently to judge for contamination and collusion based on evidence, “Media” or “Police and Witness Statements” we are not given as evidence?”


	
	This question was answered by his Honour in summing-up, by reference to the evidence and the parties’ submissions in terms to which it will be necessary to return below.
	
	
	The jury retired at 12 pm on 3 April 2014, deliberated all day on 4 April and until 2:30 pm on 7 April. A note was then sent to the effect that:
	


“We have carefully and dutifully considered the evidence of each indictment. As we stand we are unanimous on nine of the 11 indictments. After a day and a half of debate and consideration we cannot reach a unanimous decision yet on two indictments despite our best efforts. We ask for your direction and instruction on how to proceed.”


	
	Verdicts were then entered in relation to counts 1-9 and the jury directed to resume their deliberations. A further note was sent on 8 April at 11:48 am:
	


“We have reached a verdict on count 11 on the indictment. However we are certain that we will be unable to reach a verdict on count 10 after further deliberation with no progress.”


	
	A verdict was then entered in relation to count 11. The foreman was examined by his Honour and the jury was then discharged.
	
	
	That sequence of events demonstrates, unarguably, that this jury approached its task in the way discussed in Dupas. The course which the trial took, including as it did the various directions given by Zahra DCJ over the course of the trial and finally in summing-up; the question the jury asked about publicity and how it was answered; the fact that a verdict was first reached in relation to counts 1 to 9, before the jury reached a verdict in relation to count 11, after further deliberation which related to SM, when considered with the fact that the jury could not reach a unanimous verdict in relation to count 10, simply does not leave open to doubt that this jury decided the case on the evidence, as it had been directed to do.
	
	
	That further time was required before a conclusion was reached in relation to the charge concerning SM, indicates that the jury reached its verdict in relation to her allegations on the evidence relevant to the charge which concerned her and, notwithstanding the evidence as to her feelings towards the applicant, how she had pursued them through social media and the interviews for which she had received considerable payment in 2010.
	
	
	All of this does not leave open the conclusion that there was a miscarriage of justice, because the applicant was refused a permanent stay.
	
	
	To the contrary, the evidence establishes that the applicant did receive a fair trial, notwithstanding the publicity and the refusal of the application to cross-examine the complainants and the tendency witnesses on the voir dire, as explained below.
	
	
	To come to a contrary conclusion in the face of all this evidence would require undue attention to be paid to the views expressed in mainstream and social media and insufficient attention to what actually transpired in this trial. To uphold the appeal because a permanent stay was refused, despite the prejudicial commentary, before and after the applicant was charged, would be to create a mechanism by which those of ill will could undermine the proper operation of our system of justice. Such a mechanism would also be readily available to be exploited by an accused and those who support him or her, who are intent on ensuring that charges brought cannot go to trial.
	
	
	The evidence in this case well demonstrates that the jury system is robust and capable of ensuring that a person accused of serious offences can receive a fair trial, despite prejudicial and ill intended comments widely and irresponsibly published on mainstream and social media.
	
	
	That does not mean that those who commit a contempt of court in publishing such material ought not to be appropriately dealt with for that conduct, be they representatives of mainstream media, or those who publish contemptuous material on social media.
	
	
	Neither the parties nor Zahra DCJ considered it necessary, however, for any particular person or organisation to be dealt with for contempt. Nor was that course urged by the parties on appeal. It is not appropriate for this Court now to deal with any apparent contempt in the trial proceedings. That must remain a matter for the judge presiding over the trial to determine, after hearing from the parties.
	


Zahra DCJ did not fall into error on the application to cross-examine as to contamination and concoction


	
	There was no error in his Honour’s refusal of the application to cross-examine the complainants and the tendency witnesses about the possibility of concoction and/or contamination.
	
	
	Again, there was no suggestion that his Honour had made any factual error in his judgment. The attack was on his Honour’s conclusions, having regard to the authorities which bound him.
	
	
	The argument advanced on appeal rested on Hall J’s approach in BJS v R [2011] NSWCCA 239 where, in a s 5F appeal witnesses had been cross-examined in relation to contamination and concoction. There, the issue was pursued by way of two grounds of appeal. First, that it had been wrongly found that there was no relevant evidence of contamination, concoction or fabrication in the cases of some witnesses. Secondly, that it had been wrongly found that there was not a real chance of contamination or concoction in the case of other witnesses. This was also a case where a tendency notice had been served, but questions of contamination and concoction can, of course, arise in other circumstances in a criminal trial.
	
	
	Hall J observed, at [203], that:
	


“When there is an issue raised as to whether complainants and other witnesses have been affected or influenced by media publicity or internet material such to have contaminated their evidence, the inquiry, in my opinion, involves the investigation of a number of issues. In general terms, these include the following:-

(1) The content of media releases or articles or internet material to which complainants and/or non-complainant witnesses have had access or to which they are likely to have had access.

(2) In particular in that respect, the extent and level of detail in the discussion of factual matters concerning the accused person and his/her alleged conduct or that of others.

(3) Whether the subject matter of published material related to matters that were central to proof of charges made against the accused.

(4) Whether the complainants and/or witnesses discussed such material amongst themselves.

(5) Whether there are signs of contamination having infiltrated or influenced the contents of the statements of complainants and/or witnesses.”


	
	Here, as already explained, in concluding that the applicant’s application to cross-examine the complainants and the witnesses should be refused, Zahra DCJ accepted that it was reasonable to assume that all of them had had access to the adverse publicity which his Honour described. The extent of the communication between them and the nature of the allegations which they had advanced in the complaints they had made before the 2010 publicity, when compared to what was described about the applicant’s acts in that publicity, was also considered. There was no error in so approaching the application which his Honour had to determine.
	
	
	The approach which his Honour took, proceeding on the basis that each complainant and witness had been exposed to this prejudicial publicity, taken at its highest, and comparing what was there revealed with what they had earlier complained of, involved no overemphasis of the importance of the fact that there had been prior complaints, as the applicant argued on appeal. To the contrary, in this case, the fact that such complaints had been made while the complainants were each children, years before they came forward to make complaints to police as adults, after the publicity which SM’s interviews generated in 2010, was of crucial relevance, given the questions of credibility and reliability thereby raised.
	
	
	In BJS v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 123; 231 A Crim R 532, the difficulty with pre-trial rulings as to admissibility sought on the issue of contamination, which require a trial judge to usurp the function of a jury, to whom such issues fall to be determined, was discussed at [66].
	
	
	Jones v R [2014] NSWCCA 280 was another case where the trial judge had concluded that questions of concoction and contamination were relevant only to issues of credibility and reliability, which were jury questions, applying R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228. At [88], Bellew J observed that Shamouil, as well as DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9; 84 NSWLR 758 and R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121; 84 NSWLR 363, all supported the conclusion that, in a jury trial, it was not part of a judge’s function to assess and make his or her own findings as to the likely weight of evidence, or its likely acceptance or rejection by a jury. As to concoction and contamination, his Honour observed, at [90], that it was conceivable that there may be cases in which evidence of concoction and contamination gives rise to competing inferences, which are relevant to a determination of the probative value of the evidence by a judge, but that was not such a case.
	
	
	Nor was this such a case, given the evidence of prior complaints.
	
	
	In McIntosh v R [2015] NSWCCA 184, it was observed, at [46], that the concept of “concoction” suggests a deliberate fabrication of the evidence and that the term “contamination” may involve an unconscious process of suggestion being adopted. Thus, it was observed by Basten JA, at [47], that:
	


“Whilst, in determining probative value as a question of capability to affect the assessment of a fact in issue, the court is not required to disregard inherent implausibility, on the other hand, contestable questions of credibility and reliability are not for the trial judge, but for the jury. Accordingly, the suggestion that the possibility of concoction is a factor which must be taken into account in determining whether particular evidence has significant probative value should not be accepted.”


	
	However, his Honour further observed, at [49], that:
	


“If a possibility of concoction at a level sufficient to affect the capacity of the evidence to bear significant probative value were to be identified, it would probably have been necessary to carry out a reasonably searching cross-examination on the voir dire, before admissibility was ruled on.”


	
	That was the opportunity sought and refused in this case, the conclusion being reached by Zahra DCJ that contestable questions of credibility and reliability resting on the possibility of contamination or concoction were a matter for the jury. In the circumstances, that conclusion was well open.
	
	
	Publicity of the kind here, extensive and adverse as it was, occurred years after the initial complaints were made. That gave rise to no inherent implausibility in the complaints which the complainants made as adults or in the evidence of the witnesses as to what had occurred when the complainants were children. Nor did it give rise to an inference of either concoction or of contamination of those complaints, by the various complainants. The possibility of exposure to post complaint publicity giving rise to unconscious contamination of what was later reported to police was a matter for jury assessment of the witnesses.
	


Zahra DCJ did not fall into error in relation to the directions given as to concoction and contamination


	
	Undoubtedly the applicant had to make difficult forensic decisions at the trial. Even if the trials had been separated as the applicant sought, difficult decisions would have had to have been made in relation to questions of potential contamination and concoction.
	
	
	Apart from the complaint the subject of count 10, the challenges to the complainants’ evidence failed.
	
	
	The applicant’s case at trial was that the allegations against him were a fabrication and that the complainants and the tendency witnesses were not accurate, honest and reliable witnesses. The prosecution case depended on word against word and, for reasons advanced by reference to the evidence as to each complaint, it was submitted that the prosecution witnesses could not be believed. In the case of SM, it was submitted that she had done her best to destroy the applicant and that she hated him, not because he had ever acted inappropriately towards her, but because she was motivated to make money.
	
	
	As to contamination and concoction, the applicant submitted that:
	


“Ladies and gentlemen the second feature I want to talk to is the issue of how these allegations arose. Some of you may have heard of the term contamination. What does it mean? I suggest to you there is generally two sources of contamination. One is people getting their heads together. The sit down [sic]. They have a talk and they might collaborate and they might want to get someone but there’s the term getting their heads together. That’s the usual way that we think of contamination, isn’t it? I suggest to you there’s another source of contamination and that is when someone such as Mr Hughes is the subject of discussion, rumour, innuendo, and in this case for a very significant period and this source of contamination I suggest to you is very effective. In a small community it can be entirely destructive but also in a modern age once it gets hold as I gave you that example in the opening address of a bushfire, it’s devastating.”


	
	That submission was then developed in the context of the complaints each complainant had made against the applicant in childhood and subsequently. There were submissions which addressed the convergence of the accounts given by various witnesses and why it was that the detail of their evidence would not be accepted.
	
	
	Directions were sought by the applicant in relation to contamination and concoction, by reference to documents marked MFI 113 and MFI 114. The Crown did not accept that there was evidence of contamination of the kind for which the applicant contended. MFI 117 was a document produced by the Crown, which summarised the evidence on contamination. It was accepted to be accurate.
	
	
	His Honour raised with the applicant’s advocate the nature of the cross-examination of the complainants and other witnesses about the extracts from the Woman’s Day article and how the issue of contamination in summing-up needed to be directed to the evidence actually led. A further document dealing with “convergence” was then provided (marked MFI 120), which was also addressed. The directions to be given were addressed again, during another adjournment during the summing-up. Zahra DCJ indicated the directions he proposed to give and was addressed on whether the questions of innocent infection or unconscious influence were thereby adequately addressed.
	
	
	The jury question concerning contamination is set out earlier. His Honour addressed that question when he summed up in the way he had discussed with counsel:
	


“Now ladies and gentlemen let me give you a direction which addresses the question that you have just raised. Ladies and gentlemen both the Crown Prosecutor and Mr Walsh for the accused referred in their closing address to the issue whether when assessing the evidence given by the complainants and tendency witnesses that their evidence may have been influenced, firstly by information disseminated in the media at the time of and subsequent to SM or SB making complaint about the conduct of the accused to the media in March 2010.

   Secondly, whether the evidence of the contact between the persons JH, IZ and AD raises an issue whether because of information that may have been relayed at that time that the evidence of the complainants SH and AK has been influenced. Now I will return to the second of those at a later stage but let me address the first- Whether the evidence of the complainants might have been influenced by information disseminated in the media at the time of and subsequent to [SM] making complaint about the conduct of the accused to the media in March 2010.

   Now ladies and gentlemen clearly if you find that the witnesses’ evidence has been influenced in this way that you would take that into account when you are assessing the reliability of the witnesses’ evidence separately. You would need to consider, if you make such a finding, how that finding would also impact upon the question whether the accused has a tendency to act with a particular state of mind or a tendency to act in a particular way as alleged by the Crown.

   That is, whether the similarities and the conduct of the accused could be explained by the influence of other information about the alleged conduct of the accused that a complainant or a tendency witnesses has become aware of. As I have indicated to you before you take into account the tendency evidence relied upon by the Crown, you have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that one or more of the acts relied upon by the Crown to prove the particular tendency to act with a particular state of mind or the tendency to act in a particular way occurred.

   Let me take you to the evidence in relation to the information of the particular conduct of the accused that was disseminated in the media from March 2010. It is essential that you are aware of the extent the was disseminated before you go on to consider whether that publicity influenced, in anyway [sic], the evidence of the complainants or tendency witnesses.

   It is important that you not speculate what information was in the public domain in relation to the actual conduct alleged by the accused and rely only on the relevant evidence led in the trial. Whilst there has been evidence that there was significant publicity in the media generally, the only evidence that has been placed before you that any specific allegation has been made of particular sexual conduct of the accused was an article in Woman’s Day. The evidence of the content of that article is as follows. I will take you to parts of that article that were referred to in evidence when some witnesses were cross-examined- who said they saw the Woman’s Day article.

   The relevant extracts are as follows:

“Put me on his lap… tickle me… put his arm around me and trying to do this reach around thing and grabbing me on the breast… or just tickle me… sometimes try and feel me up”.

“He was always there flashing me or trying to cop of feel” [sic] and “whole pants down the ankle”.

   Now ladies and gentlemen that is the extent of the evidence in relation to what information was in the public domain regarding any particular conduct of the accused. As you know that there were ‘A Current Affair’ interviews and other television interviews involving JP and [AA]. Whilst there has been much reference to programs such A Current Affair and other current affairs programs at Channel 7, no evidence is before you that those programs or articles specifically refer to the detail of alleged sexual acts of the accused.

   In considering the considering [sic] the submissions of Mr Walsh about the possible influence of the media reporting on the evidence of the complainant and the tendency witnesses, you need to keep very much in mind the extent of the publicity that related specifically to the sexual conduct of the accused and that is the extract that I read to you from the Woman’s Day article. Further in considering the possible influence of the media reporting of alleged sexual conduct from March 2010 you need to consider the evidence of the complainant witnesses, JP, SH and AK that they made complaint to others soon after the conduct they alleged or many years before the media reporting in 2010 and following.

   Ladies and gentlemen I took you again purposely through the detail of each of the complaint witnesses by reading extracts and you should take particular regard to the times that they said that complaint was made and you would need to consider the nature of the complaint, the nature of what was said and no doubt take that into account in the context of what you know about what information was out there in the public domain which, as I have indicated to you, is the material in the Woman’s Day article that I have read to you. It is important that you take into account the timing and content of these earlier complaints when you come to consider whether their evidence has been influenced by what was disseminated in the media after March 2010, whether any publicity influenced a complainant or tendency witness to adopt the information disseminated.

   Further you need to keep in mind this history of complaint when you come to consider the submission of Mr Walsh that, because of the publicity, the evidence of the complainants or tendency witnesses is influenced by a desire to assist [SM] or because of the animus or ill-will towards the accused engendered by the publicity. I have taken you in detail to the evidence of complaint in relation to each of the complainants. As I have said to you it is important that you not only consider what the complainant said in evidence about the particular conduct of the accused and what was said about particular conduct of the accused to others but you also take into account when the complaint was made when you come to consider whether their evidence is influenced either consciously or subconsciously by what information was in the public domain sometime after about actual acts of the accused.

   Now ladies and gentlemen hopefully that addresses the issues that you have raised in that question to me. If that is not the case can you provide a further note to me seeking further assistance. But again ladies and gentlemen you cannot speculate as to what might have been there in the public domain, in the media. The evidence in the trial is that there were interviews with A Current Affair. That JP gave an interview, [AA] gave an interview. That the evidence that you must rely upon is the evidence in the trial and that is so far as any allegation of a particular act of the accused is concerned that that information is limited to the Woman’s Day article and again let me repeat that for you. “Put me on his lap… tickle me…, put his arm around me and trying to do this reach around thing and grabbing me on the breast… or just tickle me… sometimes try and feel me up”, “ he was always there flashing me or trying to cop a feel” and then “whole pants down the ankle””.

   Now hopefully that addresses the question that you have asked ladies and gentlemen but if you require further assistance, I will attend to that, just send me a note. I will in relation to this issue also take you to the exchange of emails between AK and SM and also the other matter in relation to the contact between JH, IZ and AD later in my summing-up.”


	
	His Honour also explained the parties’ cases to the jury by extensive reference to the evidence of the various witnesses.
	
	
	Redirections were then sought by the applicant’s advocate, who was also invited to put anything further which he wished to have entertained, in writing. He then produced another document (MFI 122), a flow chart, which he addressed on 3 April 2014. His Honour took up those matters of rumour, innuendo and convergence later in his summing-up, referring to the evidence of communications between SM and those who had produced the A Current Affair program, as well as the Woman’s Day article and those witnesses who had had access to it and had seen the interviews. The applicant’s advocate then raised some further matters, to which his Honour also returned, when the summing-up continued.
	
	
	No further matters were then raised by the applicant’s advocate.
	
	
	On appeal, it was argued that, despite all of this, the directions given in summing-up dealt inadequately with the risk that attitudes and memories could be affected by the volume, tone and force of information in the media, or by rumours and innuendo circulating in a closed community such as a school or workplace. It was also submitted that the directions his Honour had given had emasculated much of the argument which the applicant had put to the jury. Further, it had been suggested that it was the applicant who had a burden to prove that a witness had copied another’s allegations, before it was considered whether the witnesses’ evidence had been contaminated.
	
	
	Such complaints were not raised at trial, where the applicant’s advocate was given, but did not pursue, yet a further opportunity to seek further redirection on such matters. They are, in any event, not criticisms of the summing-up which can be accepted, given the terms of his Honour’s summing-up earlier quoted, and the detailed summing-up by reference to evidence given by the various witnesses.
	
	
	His Honour referred to what was in the public domain, by reference to the evidence led, connecting the evidence given by particular witnesses as to their exposure to, or involvement in, discussion of such material. As was accepted on appeal, the parties’ addresses and the summing-up each had to be directed to what was in evidence. Neither the Woman’s Day article nor the A Current Affair interviews were tendered, but witnesses had been cross-examined about the acts referred to in the Woman’s Day article and their involvement in discussion of that publicity and in the case of some witnesses, their exposure to earlier rumours.
	
	
	The applicant’s advocate took up various opportunities to seek further directions, which were given, in part by reference to documents he produced. The complaints now advanced on appeal simply cannot, in the face of that approach by Zahra DCJ, be accepted as having a proper foundation.
	
	
	Accordingly, grounds 1, 2, 6 and 12 are dismissed.
	


Ground 3:   His Honour erred in refusing the application for separate trials of the counts.

Ground 4:   His Honour erred in respect of his ruling that all of the tendency evidence was admissible.

Ground 13:   The trial miscarried as a consequence of his Honour’s refusal to separate the counts on the indictment.


	
	In May 2013, the Crown, in accordance with the requirements of the Evidence Act, s 97(1), served notice on the applicant indicating an intention to adduce tendency evidence against him. The notice was amended in July and September 2013 (I, 411), and again in February 2014 (III, 1940).
	
	
	The tendency upon which the Crown sought to rely, as particularised in its final notice was as follows:
	


“2.   The tendency sought to be proved is [the applicant’s] tendency to act in a particular way, and to have a particular state of mind, namely:

(i)   To having a sexual interest in female children under 16 years of age;

(ii)   To use his social and familial relationships with the families to obtain access to female children under 16 years of age so that he could engage in sexual activities with them;

(iii)   To use his daughter’s relationship with female children to obtain access to them so that he could engage in sexual activities with them;

(iv)   To use his working relationship with females to utilise an opportunity to engage in sexual activities;

(v)   To engage in sexual conduct with females aged under 16 years of age by either:

a.   touching in an inappropriate sexual way but maintaining the contact was inadvertent or accidental;

b.   by exposing his naked penis / genitalia;

c.   by making the child come into contact with his penis / genitalia;

d.   touching the child’s vaginal area;

e.   by carrying out sexual acts upon the complainants when they were within the vicinity of another person.” (III, 1940)


	
	The Crown proposed to call 11 tendency witnesses: the five complainants; JP; SH; AK; EE and SM; LJ; VR and CS, each of whom had worked on the set of Hey Dad..! as wardrobe assistants; and VOD; AA and BB, each of whom had known the applicant through social or familial connections. The Crown sought to admit each complainant’s evidence as tendency evidence in relation to the counts pertaining to each other complainant, and the testimony of the six other witnesses as tendency evidence in relation to all the counts on the indictment.
	
	
	In his tendency judgment, Zahra DCJ ordered that the tendency evidence sought to be adduced by the Crown be admitted, and that the trial relating to each of the complainants be heard together. Grounds 3 and 13 of the appeal, which challenge the latter ruling, will be discussed later in this judgment.
	
	
	Two principal issues were raised on appeal in relation to his Honour’s determination that the tendency evidence was admissible:
	



	
	Whether his Honour erred in his finding that the evidence had “significant probative value” within the meaning of s 97(1); and
	
	
	Whether his Honour erred in failing to exclude the evidence under s 101.
	



	
	Critical to the determination of the first issue, that is, whether the proposed evidence had “significant probative value”, were the following sub-issues:
	



	
	Whether his Honour erred in finding that the evidence was sufficiently similar so as to have significant probative value;
	
	
	Whether his Honour erred in his assessment of the impact of the risk of contamination or concoction upon the determination of significant probative value;
	
	
	Whether his Honour erred in his factual finding that there was no reasonable evidence of contamination or concoction of the tendency evidence.
	


Sub-issues (b) and (c) were also relevant to his Honour’s determination to admit the evidence under s 101. There is also an overlap between these issues and the discussion of the risk of contamination and concoction as it applies to grounds 1 and 2.


	
	For the reasons given below, the Court is of the view that his Honour did not err in his decision to admit the tendency evidence led by the Crown against the applicant. Ground 4 therefore fails.
	


Sections 97 and 101 of the Evidence Act 


	
	The admissibility of tendency evidence is governed s 97(1) which provides:
	


“97   The tendency rule 

(1)   Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person's character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:

(a)   the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence; and

(b)   the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.”


	
	“Probative value” is defined in the Dictionary to the Act as:
	


“… the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.”


	
	Section 101 provides an additional restriction in a criminal trial to the admissibility of, relevantly, tendency evidence, as follows:
	


“101   Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution

(1)   This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.

(2)   Tendency evidence about a defendant … that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant …”

The tendency evidence before Zahra DCJ


	
	The complainants’ tendency evidence, can be summarised as follows:
	


JP: JP and her family were family friends with the applicant and his family. The families socialised together. After a few years during which the applicant was very friendly towards her, he began touching her. She grew uncomfortable because over time, the touching grew to become inappropriate. Count 1 concerned an evening when the applicant and his wife, together with others, were guests at a dinner party at JP’s home. She was sharing a bed with the applicant’s daughter. She woke to find the applicant kneeling down with his hand going down inside her pyjama pants. She was shocked and scared. Initially, she pretended still to be sleeping while he rubbed around her vagina and then inside her vagina and clitoris, but not enough to hurt her but when it went on, she opened her eyes and pushed his hand away. He did not say anything, but licked her cheek and left.

Count 2 concerned events which occurred a month or two later, when JP was asleep in her bed on her own, when she woke up to find the applicant’s hand in her pants. She tried to move his hand, but he pushed his hand into her vagina. She was holding his wrist, trying to push him away, while he was touching her clitoris kind of roughly. He said nothing while this continued for about 10 minutes. She did not know what to do and cried after he left.

SH: SH lived across the street from the applicant after her family moved there when she was in Year 3. She regularly played with his daughter, who attended a different school, and she also slept over at his house. Counts 3 and 4 concerned events which occurred while she was sleeping over one night when the applicant told her to roll over in bed and then put her hand on his penis and made her move her hand back and forward until he ejaculated. The semen went over her hand and arm and he then rubbed some of it around the mound of her vagina with his penis, where he left it. He then said “Good girl, go back to sleep”.

Counts 5 and 6 concerned events which occurred when SH was again sleeping over at the applicant’s house, lying on her stomach with her hands underneath her, in the hope that he would not take her hands. He woke her saying “come on”, rolled her over and took her hand and again made her masturbate him and then wiped the semen over her vagina with his penis. He then told her to roll over, gave her her teddy and told her to go back to sleep. Similar events occurred on other occasions that were not the subject of counts on the indictment.

AK: AK was a school friend of the applicant’s daughter. She stayed over at the applicant’s house several times, sleeping in his daughter’s bedroom. Counts 7 and 8 concerned events which occurred when the applicant took AK and his daughter to the beach in the school holidays. The applicant asked them if they wanted to swim between his legs. When AK swam between his legs, she saw that the applicant’s penis was exposed, and the applicant pinned her between his legs and released her after she struggled. AK swam between the applicant’s legs a second time and once again his penis was exposed. He released her again after she kicked and thrashed around.

Count 9 concerned events which occurred when AK slept over at the applicant’s house on an occasion when she had an infection in her ears, which had just been pierced. She lay down on his lap, so that he could put drops on her ears. He moved her head to position her in the light. She could feel that his penis was hard and rubbing against her face, along her cheek bone. She felt the same thing when she swapped sides so that he could put the drops on her other ear. He again moved her head up and down to position her. She was nervous and upset. On another occasion he told her to sit on his lap. She could feel his penis digging into her buttock and he was moving her legs from side to side. He also exposed his penis and testicles to her on other occasions, once while wearing a sarong and opening and closing his legs, while sitting on the lounge; once while sitting on his daughters bed; and once while naked in his bedroom, which he asked her to enter, but she refused.

EE: Count 10 concerned EE. The applicant visited EE’s uncle, a friend of the applicant’s wife, while her uncle was staying at her home, after being discharged from hospital. When aged 15, EE was given the opportunity to do work experience with the applicant’s wife and frequently saw the applicant during that work experience. After the work experience ended, they met several times. On one occasion when he drove her home they began kissing, during which he pressed his erect penis into her hip and then moved her hand onto his penis and said “that’s it”. This conduct constituted count 10. They met a few more times. On one occasion at Tunks Park she sat on a rock with her back leaning against the applicant. She could feel his erect penis in the small of her back and he touched her nipples through her clothing. They kissed and then he moved and she was reclining on him when he touched her vulva through her clothing. She later refused to have sex with him.

SM: SM worked with the applicant on the Hey Dad..! series from age 8. She often had to sit on his lap for publicity photos. She felt uncomfortable because he would pick her up and have one hand underneath her and would put his hands on her chest, making her feel uncomfortable and she would push him away. Count 11 concerned an occasion when she was on the ground, drawing during a break. The applicant came out of his dressing room and stood in front of a mirror, where she could see him. He made eye contact with her and then undid his belt, let his pants fall to the floor pulled his underpants down and wiggled his hips, in order to make her look at his penis in the mirror. When he pulled his pants back up, she grabbed her belongings and ran to the makeup room, where she told another cast member that he had exposed his penis to her.


	
	The tendency evidence of other witnesses included that of BB. She said that when she was aged 11 and attending her grandparent’s 90th birthday party at the applicant’s home, the applicant had put his hand under her shirt and then touched her breast, played with her nipples and then slipped his hand underneath the elastic of her jeans.
	
	
	AA’s evidence was that when she was a young girl, while swimming in a pool with the applicant, he had swum up to her and started touching her breast. He also touched her between the legs, while asking her if she liked being tickled. She pushed him away and left and got changed. The applicant later also got changed and when she walked into the hallway, he had left his bedroom door open and she saw him standing naked, touching himself while standing in front of a mirror. On another occasion while staying over at his home he had started touching her breasts, after his daughter had left the room. He asked her if she liked him touching her, to which she responded “no”. He stopped when his daughter returned.
	
	
	VOD also lived in the same street as the applicant and slept over at his house, while she was aged between 7 and 9 years, on occasions when SH was also staying. She said that the applicant often walked around without clothes on; that he had come into the room where they were sleeping while not wearing clothes; that he had walked around in the room; and that she had seen his genitals while he was in the room.
	
	
	The evidence of LJ, a costume designer on the Hey Dad..! program, was that the applicant often had a sleep in his dressing room during breaks and that she had to wake him. He asked her to shake him, to make sure he woke. Initially, the applicant slept naked and draped by a sheet. However, on occasions LJ would find the applicant naked and uncovered, and she would call to him to wake up and leave the door open and he would quickly cover himself. He also made her uncomfortable by trying to grab her breast when hugging her and brushing past her, rubbing her with his genitals on her back or bottom.
	
	
	The evidence of CS, who worked in the wardrobe department on the Hey Dad..! series was also that the applicant made her uncomfortable on occasions, by brushing past and making indirect sexual contact with her bottom or breast, with his genitals or hands. He would brush it off when she said “What are you doing?” On one occasion, while in his dressing room, he also exposed his penis to her, when he dropped his pants. He had pulled them up when she had said “What are you doing?”
	
	
	The evidence of VR, who had worked as a wardrobe assistant on the series when she was aged 18 years, was that on one occasion the applicant had slipped his hand under her armpit, just near her breast. After the third such incident she considered that it had not been an accident and had felt very uncomfortable around him and kept her distance. She had to take clothes into his dressing room and, on occasions, wake him from a nap. On one occasion, he was naked from the torso up and on the next he was completely naked and she pulled up a sheet up to cover him. After the third occasion when she found him lying naked on his back, she reported what had happened to her boss.
	


Zahra DCJ’s findings


	
	Zahra DCJ at pp 6 – 7 of the tendency judgment, observed that:
	


“‘Significant’ probative value means something more than mere relevance but something less than a ‘substantial’ degree of relevance. The evidence must be important or of consequence.” (emphasis in original)

This is an accurate reflection of the test in stated in R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457 at 459 per Hunt J, affirmed by this Court in DSJ at [60] and BJS (No 2) at [47].


	
	His Honour noted that tendency evidence was necessarily inferential evidence, tendered to prove that because on a particular occasion:
	


“… [a] person acted in a particular way or had a particular state of mind that person on an occasion relevant to the proceedings, acted in a particular way or had a particular state of mind …”

see R v Cittadini [2008] NSWCCA 256; 189 A Crim R 492 at [22]-[23], per Simpson J (as her Honour then was); DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63; 81 NSWLR 568, per Simpson J at [180]. His Honour further observed that tendency evidence does not need to show a tendency to “commit a particular crime”, but rather a tendency to act in a particular way, be it criminal or otherwise: R v Li [2003] NSWCCA 407.


	
	Zahra DCJ then addressed the degree of similarity required as between the tendency evidence and the particular acts allegedly undertaken by the applicant. His Honour, at p 7, held that it was not necessary that the acts or state of mind the subject of the tendency evidence be “closely” or “strikingly” similar to the acts constituting the crime. His Honour cited Campbell JA’s judgment in R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306; 201 A Crim R 451, at [125], as follows:
	


“In my view there is no need for there to be a ‘striking pattern of similarity between the incidents’. All that is necessary is that the disputed evidence should make more likely, to a significant extent, the facts that make up the elements of the offence charged.”

Zahra DCJ referred additionally to R v PWD [2010] NSWCCA 209; 205 A Crim R 75 and BJS (No 2) as authority for the same proposition.


	
	Zahra DCJ expressed the view, at p 53, that there were a number of features of the evidence that involved “closely similar” conduct on the part of the applicant. His Honour also commented that, although there were differences in the sexual acts alleged against the applicant in the various counts and in the circumstances in which they were allegedly committed:
	


“.. [that did] not deplete the [proposed tendency] evidence of its probative value. To determine the matter by isolating only identical acts would focus too narrowly upon a tendency to engage in a sexual act of a particular fashion. The tendency which is established here is a wider and more detailed pattern of behaviour or modus operandi [the applicant’s] behaviour.”  


	
	His Honour determined, at p 54, that the Crown had established that the proposed evidence established a pattern of behaviour that established the tendency for which the Crown argued, namely, a “tendency to take advantage of situations which arose where [the applicant] came into contact with young female children”. His Honour found that those situations included “situations which arose from social and familial relationships, and also included situations which arose in the context of work relationships” and “included those arising from social relationships between [the applicant’s] daughter and the complainants”.
	
	
	His Honour, at p 54, considered the pattern of behaviour revealed by the evidence of the complainants was “manifest, if not striking”. His Honour held that the proposed evidence of all 11 witnesses was admissible as being capable of establishing that the applicant had a particular state of mind, that of “having a sexual interest in female children under 16 years of age”.
	
	
	Zahra DCJ admitted the evidence of the complainants and the evidence of VOD, AA and BB as tendency evidence in respect of all counts on the indictment. However, his Honour limited the use of the proposed tendency evidence of VOD, AA and BB as being capable of establishing that the applicant had a particular state of mind, that is, a “sexual interest in female children under the age of 16”, and being capable of establishing that the applicant had a tendency to act in the following particular ways, namely, that the applicant:
	


“●   … took advantage of his social and familial relationships with the families to obtain access to female children under 16 years of age so that he could engage in sexual activities with them;

●   … took advantage of his daughter’s relationship with female children to obtain access to them so that he could engage in sexual activities with them;

●   … engaged in sexual conduct with females aged under 16 years of age by:

i.   touching in an inappropriate sexual way but maintaining the contact was inadvertent or accidental;

ii.   by exposing his naked penis/genitalia;

iii.   by making the child come into contact with his penis/genitalia;

iv.   touching the child’s vaginal area;

v.   by carrying out sexual acts upon the complainants when they were within the vicinity of another person.”

Not included in the use to which the evidence of VOD, AA and BB could be put was the tendency alleged in para 2(iv) of the tendency notice.


	
	His Honour restricted the admissibility of the evidence of the wardrobe assistants to count 11 (being the count relating to SM). His Honour held, at p 55, that the evidence of those witnesses was capable of demonstrating the following tendencies:
	


“●   That [the applicant] took advantage of his working relationship with females to utilise an opportunity to engage in sexual activities;

●   [The applicant] engaged in touching in an inappropriate sexual way but maintaining the contact was inadvertent or accidental;

●   That [the applicant] exposed his naked penis/genitalia.”


	
	In his Honour’s view, there was no reasonable evidence of concoction or contamination that would produce a risk of prejudice or would significantly reduce the otherwise probative value of the evidence. In coming to this view, his Honour addressed four possible sources of contamination or concoction.
	
	
	First, that the complainants AK and SM had corresponded between 29 March 2010 and 26 July 2010 by way of email. His Honour set out the content of those emails, and observed, at p 42, that they contained “no reference… to any particular sexual conduct of the [applicant]”. His Honour therefore held that the communication between AK and SH was limited in nature.
	
	
	Secondly, his Honour addressed the impact of the awareness of LJ, CS and VR of rumours and allegations against the applicant. His Honour took the view, at p 43, that:
	


“… clearly each of these tendency witnesses was exposed to rumour and innuendo relating to sexual misconduct by [the applicant] and there was discussion about [the applicant] within the workplace.”


	
	However, his Honour found that the fact a proposed witness had been exposed to such rumour did not necessarily give rise to a risk of contamination or concoction, and that there was no evidence of such a risk in this case.
	
	
	Thirdly, Zahra DCJ addressed the possibility of concoction or contamination arising from media reporting. His Honour considered, at p 44, that, when determining whether a risk of contamination or concoction arose as a result of media coverage, it was “necessary to look with some precision as to what information was in the public domain at the time”. His Honour held that the relevant coverage “touching upon the nature of the sexual misconduct [of the applicant was] somewhat limited”. In light of the nature of this coverage, and the early and detailed complaints of the witnesses before the media coverage, his Honour held that even if exposed to all the relevant media information, the possibility that a witness’ evidence was concocted or contaminated was “no more than speculative”.
	
	
	Finally, his Honour held that the contention that a possibility of contamination through indirect contact between SH and AK was, at its highest, also speculative.
	
	
	His Honour further concluded that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice arising from it.
	


Submissions of parties


	
	The applicant contended that the tendency evidence was inadmissible on a number of grounds.
	
	
	First, the applicant contended that the tendency particularised in the tendency notice at para 2(i) (see at [117] above), that is, having a sexual interest in female children under 16 years of age, was so broad as to encompass the entirety of the evidence in relation to each complainant and of itself insufficient for the tendency evidence to have significant probative value. In so submitting, the applicant relied on Sokolowskyj v R [2014] NSWCCA 55; 239 A Crim R 528, where, at [40], Hoeben CJ at CL held that “a tendency to have sexual urges was so general as to be meaningless”.
	
	
	Secondly, the applicant contended that not every tendency detailed in the notice was relevant to each of the counts. In particular, the tendencies set out at para 2(ii) and (iii) of the notice, namely, that the applicant used “his social and familial relationships” and “his daughter’s relationship” with female children to obtain access to them “so that he could engage in sexual activities with them”, applied to counts 1-9 but had no application to counts 10 and 11. Conversely, the applicant submitted that the tendency detailed at para 2(iv) (see at [117] above), that the applicant used “his working relationship with females to utilise an opportunity to engage in sexual tendencies”, only applied to count 11 and for that reason did not have significant probative value in relation to counts 1-10.
	
	
	Thirdly, the applicant submitted that the type of sexual conduct alleged in the tendency notice related to different counts in different ways. In brief:
	


(a)   evidence of touching in an inappropriate but allegedly accidental way only related to count 11 and the evidence of witnesses LJ, VR and CS;

(b)   evidence that the applicant made a complainant come into contact with his penis/genitalia did not relate to counts 10 or 11;

(c)   evidence that the applicant touched a complainant’s vaginal area did not relate to counts 7, 8, 9, 10 or 11;

(d)   carrying out sexual acts upon the complainants when they were in the vicinity of another person did not relate to count 11 concerning SM.


	
	The applicant submitted that when properly analysed, both the circumstances surrounding the sexual acts, and the acts themselves, were different in nature and not capable of being the subject of any alleged tendency.
	
	
	The applicant placed emphasis on the following differences to contend that the evidence ought not to have been admitted, as it did not have significant probative value:
	



	
	The conduct alleged against SM and EE was substantially different from the other tendency evidence, considering the nature of the charge relating to SM as well as the age of EE, who was older than the other complainants at the time of the alleged offending;
	
	
	The wardrobe assistants’ evidence was significantly different from all the other witnesses’ evidence, excepting SM;
	
	
	AA’s evidence was significantly different to all the evidence but that of JP and SH, to which it also bore little resemblance; and
	
	
	BB’s evidence bore little resemblance to SM’s evidence and was quite different from JP, SH and AK’s evidence.
	



	
	The applicant also complained that the trial judge failed to analyse the tendency evidence to determine whether each witnesses’ evidence had significant probative value and if so, in relation to what counts. In this regard, the applicant relied upon authorities where attention has been given to whether there were similarities in the evidence such as to give the evidence significant probative value: see BP v R; R v BP [2010] NSWCCA 303 at [108]; KJR v R [2007] NSWCCA 165; 173 A Crim R 226 at [3]; DAO at [180]; Doyle v R; R v Doyle [2014] NSWCCA 4 at [148] and Sokolowskyj at [43].
	
	
	The applicant submitted that having regard to what was said in those cases, it was appropriate, in determining whether evidence was admissible as tendency evidence, to have regard to:
	


i.   How often the particular conduct occurred: RHB v The Queen [2011] VSCA 295 at [20];

ii.   The time gap between each event: Doyle at [92];

iii.   The degree of similarity between the conduct on each occasion: R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338; 156 A Crim R 308 at [57] and [68]; Sokolowskyj at [44];

iv.   The degree of similarity of circumstances in which the conduct took place: Fletcher; PWD; BP at [112]; and

v.   Whether the tendency evidence was disputed: AE v R [2008] NSWCCA 52 at [79].


	
	The applicant further submitted that there was such a risk of concoction or contamination of the evidence that the proposed tendency evidence ought to have been rejected as not having significant probative value, or as not having satisfied the test in s 101. The applicant submitted to the trial judge that there was a real risk of contamination or concoction arising from several overlapping features, as follows:
	


“1.   The circumstances in which there has been extensive and ongoing and pervasive publicity about rumours/allegations against [the applicant];

2.   That there have been very significant financial incentives offered and paid to complainants and tendency witnesses in respect of rumours/allegations involving [the applicant];

3.   That the media organisations involved stood to gain and did in fact gain significant financial advantage by the sensational publication of such allegations;

4.   The key Crown witnesses, SM and SB, and other complainants and tendency witnesses were interviewed together on multiple occasions and had an active opportunity and did in fact communicate both personally and electronically and discussed their recollections involving [the applicant];

5.   That there is evidence of animus or ill disposition towards [the applicant] and that some complainants and tendency witnesses have ‘an obsessional hatred towards [the applicant]’. It is submitted that key complainants and tendency witnesses have communicated directly with each other and actually met and discussed the allegations against [the applicant].” (tendency judgment at p 38)

These features can be broadly categorised into three aspects: exposure to pre-trial publicity and motives for engaging in such publicity; knowledge of rumours about the applicant; and pre-trial contact, either directly or indirectly, with other witnesses.


	
	The Crown submitted that there was no basis for finding error in his Honour’s determination. The Crown referred to the analysis of the evidence undertaken by his Honour and his assessment of the evidence in accordance with the legal test for its admissibility as tendency evidence. The Crown contended that his Honour “undertook the evaluative and predictive task required [by s 97] and determined that there was an underlying pattern”. The Crown further contended that his Honour considered the relevance of the evidence to each count on the indictment. The Crown submitted that this determination was open and that his Honour’s reasoning did not reflect an error of principle.
	


Legal principles


	
	It was not suggested by either party that his Honour erred in his references to authority. However, given the challenge to his Honour’s ruling that the evidence was admissible, it is appropriate to refer to the case law concerning the proper construction of s 97 and s 101. It can also be instructive to understand how s 97 has been applied in various factual circumstances. For that reason, we propose to consider the case law in some detail. In doing so, we emphasise that a court’s task is, in each given case, to apply the statutory test of admissibility to the particular evidence that is sought to be adduced as tendency evidence in relation to the crime of which the person is charged.
	
	
	There are three matters that call for consideration. The first is what the phrase in s 97, “evidence that a person has a tendency to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind”, means. The second is the meaning of significant probative value in s 97(1)(b). As explained below, the first and second of these matters are interrelated. The third is what is involved in the judicial task required by s 101 in determining whether the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.
	
	
	It needs to be understood at the outset that evidence that a person had a particular tendency is adduced for the purpose of providing the foundation for an inference that the person was more likely to act in a particular way or have a relevant state of mind on the particular occasion that is subject of the charge or charges: see Gardiner v R [2006] NSWCCA 190; 162 A Crim R 233 at [124] per Simpson J. This was explained in Elomar v R; Hasan v R; Cheikho v R; Jamal v R [2014] NSWCCA 303; 316 ALR 206 at [359]: 
	


“The inference is that, because the person had the relevant tendency, it is more likely that he or she acted in the way asserted by the tendering party, or had the state of mind asserted by the tendering party on an occasion the subject of the proceedings. Tendency evidence is a stepping stone. It is indirect evidence. It allows for a form of syllogistic reasoning.”


	
	In FB v R; R v FB [2011] NSWCCA 217 Whealy JA (Buddin and Harrison JJ agreeing) observed, at [23], that:
	


“The section proceeds on the basis of inferential reasoning that people behave consistently in similar situations. The evidence is used to provide a foundation for an inference to that effect.”

Significant probative value


	
	It is appropriate to commence with an understanding of the meaning of the defined term “probative value”. In Shamouil, Spigelman CJ (with whom Simpson and Adams JJ agreed) said in relation to the definition in the Evidence Act of “probative value”:
	


“61   … the critical word in this regard is the word could in the definition of probative value as set out above, namely, ‘the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment ...’. The focus on capability draws attention to what it is open for the tribunal of fact to conclude. It does not direct attention to what a tribunal of fact is likely to conclude. Evidence has ‘probative value’, as defined, if it is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty.

62   This conclusion is reinforced by the test that evidence must ‘rationally affect’ the assessment. As Gaudron J emphasised in [Adam v R [2001] HCA 57; 207 CLR 96], a ‘test’ of ‘rationality’ also directs attention to capability rather than weight. (emphasis in original)”


	
	The question of the meaning of significant probative value was dealt with by a five judge bench of the Court in DSJ. That case involved the admissibility of coincidence evidence pursuant to the Evidence Act, s 98, which, in terms of the section, involves an assessment of similarities. Such evidence must also have significant probative value to be admissible. The Court accepted the meaning given to “significant” in Lockyer, where Hunt CJ at CL, who, having observed that the definition of “probative value” was substantially similar to the definition of “relevance” in the Act, stated at 459:
	


“... the probative value of evidence is the degree of its relevance to the particular fact in issue. There is no definition of ‘significant’ probative value as that phrase is used in s 97. In its context as I have outlined it, however, ‘significant’ probative value must mean something more than mere relevance but something less than a ‘substantial’ degree of relevance ... One of the primary meanings of the adjective ‘significant’ is ‘important’, or ‘of consequence’. In my opinion, that is the sense in which it is used in s 97. To some extent, it seems to me, the significance of the probative value of the tendency evidence ... must depend upon the nature of the fact in issue to which it is relevant and to the significance (or importance) which that evidence may have in establishing that fact.” (emphasis in original)


	
	In DSJ, the Court dealt with what was required in the judicial task of evaluating whether the evidence had significant probative value. Bathurst CJ stated at [10]:
	


“… the trial judge in forming a view as to whether the evidence has significant probative value must consider by reference to the evidence itself or other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party tendering it, whether there is a real possibility of an alternate explanation inconsistent with (in this case) the guilt of the party against whom it is tendered. This is because the availability of such an alternative hypothesis will be relevant to forming the view required by the section that the evidence has significant probative value.”


	
	In making these observations, the Chief Justice endorsed the approach to that evaluation suggested by Whealy JA at [78]-[81]. The essence of that approach was stated by his Honour, at [78], as follows:
	


“… [w]hat is required is this: the trial Judge must ask whether the possibility of such an alternative explanation substantially alters his (or her) view as to the significant capacity of the Crown evidence, if accepted, to establish the fact in issue. Does the alternative possibility, in the Judge's view, rob the evidence of its otherwise cogent capacity to prove the Crown's case? If it does not, the trial judge may safely conclude that the evidence has significant probative value.”

The meaning of “tendency”


	
	The New South Wales authorities have not accepted that it is necessary, for evidence to be admissible as a “tendency” that it exhibit, to use the language of the common law relating to similar fact and propensity evidence, “underlying unity”, “a modus operandi” or a “pattern of conduct”: Velkoski v The Queen [2014] VSCA 121 at [171]. As Basten JA (Fullerton and R A Hulme JJ agreeing) said in Saoud v R [2014] NSWCCA 136; 87 NSWLR 481, at [40], “such language … may provide little guidance in applying the current statutory test”. Rather, the admissibility of tendency evidence requires that it have “significant probative value”.
	
	
	The extent and nature of any similarity is nonetheless relevant to that question, as was articulated by this Court in Ford. That case concerned a Crown appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act, s 5F from a ruling as to the admissibility of the evidence of two complainants as tendency evidence. The accused had originally been charged in a single indictment with one count of sexual assault without consent and two counts of indecent assault. The offences were alleged to have been committed against three complainants, each of whom at the time of the offence were staying at the offender’s house after attending a party, were asleep and had consumed a significant amount of alcohol.
	
	
	The count of sexual intercourse without consent (the sexual assault count) was severed from the two indecent assault counts. The accused was convicted on both indecent assault counts. The Crown then sought to admit evidence of the indecent assaults as tendency evidence in respect of the sexual assault count. The tendency relied on by the Crown was that the accused had:
	


“… a tendency to act in a particular way, namely to sexually molest young women who (1) have stayed over at his house after attending a party, (2) have consumed a significant amount of alcohol, (3) are asleep, (4) where there is a risk of being discovered by others in the house.” (Ford at [27])


	
	In a pre-trial ruling, the evidence was rejected on the basis that it was not sufficiently similar. The trial judge considered that:
	


“… the similarities of the sexual interference on the two occasions are significantly different to such a degree that the proposed evidence of the Crown’s tendency does not amount to tendency and the application fails.” (Ford at [30])


	
	This approach was held to be erroneous. Campbell JA (Howie and Rothman JJ relevantly agreeing), identified, at [38], that one of the two serious errors made by the trial judge was:
	


“… the judge’s apparent view that the tendency evidence must itself show a tendency to commit acts that are closely similar to those that constitute the crime with which a particular accused is charged. That is not so. All that a tendency need be, to fall within the chapeau to section 97(1), is ‘a tendency to act in a particular way’.”


	
	His Honour continued, at [41]:
	


“… a tendency to engage in a particular type of behaviour can be relevant to whether an accused has committed a particular crime charged, even though that tendency does not in itself involve performance of a contravention of the same provision of the criminal law as that charge, or closely similar behaviour.”


	
	Campbell JA observed, at [44], that although the evidence of the complainants in the indecent assault trial would not suffice to make out the charge concerning sexual intercourse without consent, a jury could justifiably take the view that it increased the probability of the evidence concerning the elements of sexual intercourse charge being correct, and thus possessed significant probative value as required by s 97(1)(b).
	
	
	Campbell JA further observed, at [52], that:
	


“For a judge to decide that evidence has ‘significant probative value’ is, like the decision about whether the evidence has ‘probative value’ at all, a decision about the reasoning processes that are open to a jury.”


	
	Relevantly to the issue in this case, as to the relationship between similarity and significant probative value, Campbell JA stated:
	


“125   … there is no striking pattern of similarity between the incidents. In my view there is no need for there to be a ‘striking pattern of similarity between the incidents’. All that is necessary is that the disputed evidence should make more likely, to a significant extent, the facts that make up the elements of the offence charged. In my view, it meets that test.

126   The Respondent submits that ‘the phenomenon of young women, who are drunkenly sleeping after a social event, being the subject of sexual interference is unfortunately not so compellingly rare or exceptional as to give the evidence significant probative value’. I do not accept that tendency evidence has to be of a tendency to do an act that is ‘compellingly rare or exceptional’ before it can have significant probative value.”


	
	His Honour’s approach was applied in PWD, where the accused, the music master and principal of a Catholic boarding school, was charged with 10 counts of sexual misconduct against four boys. The prosecution sought to adduce evidence of the four complainants, and a further two witnesses of sexual conduct by the accused as tendency evidence admissible on all counts. The sexual conduct described by each complainant was different, both as to the type of sexual act and the seriousness of the alleged conduct. The trial judge, in a pre-trial ruling, ordered that the counts on the indictment relating to each of the complainants be severed on the basis that, as the acts and surrounding circumstances constituting the several offences were so different, the tendency evidence lacked significant probative value (at [4]-[6]).
	
	
	The Crown case expressly eschewed a case of striking similarities, but contended that there was a “pattern of behaviour, modus operandi, system or pattern and common threads (the pattern) in the respondent’s conduct” (at [35]). The alleged pattern or modus operandi was that:
	


“… the respondent had a sexual interest in young boys and for the purposes of gratification of that interest, he preyed upon boys in his care in a variety of circumstances, but all of which it is alleged involved some vulnerability”. (PWD at [76])


	
	A feature of the alleged tendency, in the context of the accused’s position of authority, was:
	


“… an element of selection and encouragement of the boys to whom he directed his sexual attention: only boarders were involved, all of whom reported feelings of isolation, homesickness and not fitting in, although this exhibited itself variously …” (PWD at [83])


	
	This Court held that the evidence was admissible as tendency evidence and ordered that the counts on the indictment be tried together, stating, at [79]:
	


“The authorities are clear that for evidence to be admissible under s 97 there does not have to be striking similarities, or even closely similar behaviour.”


	
	The same approach was taken in BP. After stating that incidents relied on as tendency evidence did not have to be closely similar to the circumstances of the alleged offence, nor did there have to be striking similarity, Hodgson JA (Price and Fullerton JJ agreeing) further observed, however, at [108], that “generally the closer and more particular the similarities, the more likely it is that the evidence will have significant probative value”.  In DAO, at [180], Simpson J observed that:
	


“Similarity or dissimilarity in the nature of the conduct alleged is relevant to the assessment of both whether the evidence has probative value, and, if so, whether it is significant.”


	
	In Doyle, where the accused was charged with 39 offences against five complainants, the tendency sought to be proved was threefold: to have a sexual interest in young male employees; to engage in sexual activities with young male employees; and for the accused to use his position of authority to obtain access to young male employees so that he could engage in sexual activity with them. There were then particularised 29 different types of conduct that were said to demonstrate those tendencies. Some of those tendencies were ordinary incidents of employment, such as giving young male employees and members of their family free admission to films at the cinema complex where they were employed. Other conduct was sexual conduct. Not all the conduct related to each complainant or each charge.
	
	
	Although the challenge in Doyle in relation to tendency evidence was to the directions given to the jury, the following observations of Bathurst CJ are pertinent:
	


“127   … In the context of this case, to prove the second tendency it would be at least necessary for the jury to, first, be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant engaged in one of the activities referred to in subpars (j) to (o) of the tendency notice and, second, to also be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the engagement in such activities proved that the appellant had the tendency alleged in par (2) of the tendency notice. The position, in my opinion, was the same so far as the third tendency in the notice was concerned, having regard to the fact that the notice states that the purpose of obtaining access to young male employees was to engage in sexual activity with them.

128   However, that does not mean that the other activities described in the tendency notice or the first listed tendency were irrelevant. Whilst some of those activities, even if proved beyond reasonable doubt, may well have been insufficient to establish the second tendency, the jury if satisfied that a number of those events occurred could have concluded beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had a sexual interest in young male employees. This conclusion would have been a relevant factor in their deliberations of whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that one of the charges against the appellant was established.”


	
	Thus, in summary, the law in this State is that whether the Court thinks that evidence has significant probative value for the purposes of s 97 involves an assessment by the Court as to whether a jury could treat it of importance in supporting an inference of guilt of the accused on the count charged. It is an assessment of the capacity of the evidence to have that effect. In undertaking that task, the Court must consider, having regard to the evidence adduced, whether there is a real possibility of an alternate explanation consistent with innocence.
	
	
	In making the assessment whether evidence tendered as tendency evidence has significant probative value, regard will inevitably be had to similarities in the conduct relevant to the offence. That is different from requiring that the conduct bear similarities to the conduct with which the person is charged. This was emphasised by the Court in Saoud where Basten JA observed, at [44], that “the nature of the similarities will depend very much on the circumstances of the case”.
	
	
	The critical point made in these authorities is that tendency evidence need not show a tendency to commit acts that constitute the crime or crimes with which the accused is charged. There only needs to be a “tendency … to act in a particular way” (s 97(1)) relevant to the conduct subject of the charge. Relevance is determined by reference to the Evidence Act, s 55, that is, evidence which, if accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.
	
	
	When regard is had to the inferential nature of tendency evidence and the requirement that it be relevant evidence, it is apparent that tendency evidence is not only directed to the particular type of conduct that constitutes an element of the charge. There is a wide range of evidence relevant to the determination of the guilt of a person of a particular crime. When the question of admissibility of tendency evidence arises the question is whether conduct said to exhibit a tendency allows, by an inferential process of reasoning, that the person was more likely to act in a particular way or have a relevant state of mind on the particular occasion that is the subject of the charge or charges: see Gardiner at [124] per Simpson J.
	


Velkoski


	
	The applicant referred to Velkoski in support of his submission that the tendency evidence adduced in this case did not satisfy the requirements of s 97. In Velkoski, the Victorian Court of Appeal, although not concluding that PWD was “plainly wrong”, nonetheless approached the question of what was necessary for evidence to be admitted as tendency evidence in terms different from the approach taken in New South Wales in the cases discussed above. According to the Court (Redlich, Weinberg and Coghlan JJA), at [164]:
	


“Section 97(1)(b) is intended to address the risk of an unfair trial through the use of tendency reasoning by ensuring a sufficiently high threshold of admissibility. We consider the approach currently taken by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal to tendency and coincidence goes too far in lowering the threshold to admissibility. To remove any requirement of similarity or commonality of features does not in our respectful opinion give effect to what is inherent in the notion of ‘significant probative value.’ If the evidence does no more than prove a disposition to commit crimes of the kind in question, it will not have sufficient probative force to make it admissible. This view, we think, clearly represents the present position of our Court reflected in the long line of authority to which we have referred.”


	
	While the Court recognised that “striking similarity” is not a condition of admissibility for tendency evidence, it held, at [171], that:
	


“In order to determine whether the features of the acts relied upon permit tendency reasoning, it remains apposite and desirable to assess whether those features reveal ‘underlying unity’, a ‘pattern of conduct’, ‘modus operandi’, or such similarity as logically and cogently implies that the particular features of those previous acts renders the occurrence of the act to be proved more likely. It is the degree of similarity of the operative features that gives the tendency evidence its relative strength.” (emphasis added)


	
	For the reasons we have given, we do not accept that the language used by the Victorian Court of Appeal represents the law in New South Wales. We recognise, however, that although s 97, unlike s 98, does not use the language of similarity, the greater the similarities, the more readily will a court find that that the evidence has significant probative value. Nor, as we have already examined above, does s 97 require that there be an “underlying unity”, a “pattern of conduct”, or the like. That is the language of the common law relating to similar fact evidence.
	


Section 101 – whether probative value significantly outweighs prejudicial effect


	
	Section 101(2) provides that tendency evidence cannot be used against a defendant in a criminal trial, unless its probative value substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect on the defendant. The section involves an evaluative judgment by the trial judge, not the exercise of a discretion: see R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319; 58 NSWLR 700 at [94]-[95], although it is accepted that the principles in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 apply to the appellate review of a determination made under s 101(2). see Ford at [110]; DAO at [170]; Fletcher at [48]. As Simpson J (Kirby and Schmidt JJ agreeing) stated in DAO at [170]:
	


“What is involved under s 101 is quintessentially a judgment – a judgment as to the probative value of the evidence relative to any potential prejudicial effect. That, no doubt, is why it is established that a so called ‘decision’ (read judgment) under s 101 is reviewable only on House v The King principles.”


	
	The determination to be made under s 101(2) requires the trial judge to engage in a balancing exercise. As explained by this Court in Ceissman v R [2015] NSWCCA 74 at [36], in relation to coincidence evidence, although the same principles apply in respect of tendency evidence:
	


“The question [under s 101(2)] requires an evaluation of the probative value of the evidence balanced against an evaluation of its potential prejudicial effect. Both evaluations are to be undertaken by the trial judge on the basis of the information available at the time its admission is determined. The first evaluation (of probative value) is to be made on the assumption that the evidence said to constitute coincidence evidence is accepted by the tribunal of fact: R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228.”


	
	As is the case with s 97, the “no rational explanation” test as held in Pfenning v The Queen [1995] HCA 7; 182 CLR 461 no longer reflects the appropriate consideration of the matters to be balanced under s 101(2): see Ellis at [95]-[96]. As Campbell JA stated in Ford, at [64]:
	


“The proper carrying out of the balancing task requires the judge to identify the type or types of prejudicial effect it may give rise to, and why it is that the judge has reached the view that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs (or does not substantially outweigh, as the case may be) any such prejudicial effect: R v Harker [[2004] NSWCCA 427] at [47], [58]; R v RN [2005] NSWCCA 413.”


	
	In Sokolowskyj, the Court (Hoeben CJ at CL Adams and Hall JJ agreeing) held, at [47], that “[t]he concept of ‘prejudicial effect’ is understood in substantially the same way as ‘unfair prejudice’”, as the latter term is used in s 137, namely, that there is a risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in an unfair manner: see also Gardiner at [57]; Ford at [55]. The question for determination under s 101(2) is whether probative effect outweighs that prejudicial effect. The section calls for a determination of the “prejudicial effect” the evidence “may have on the defendant” (emphasis added). In DAO, Simpson J considered, at [171], that such terminology meant that:
	


“… it is legitimate and appropriate for the judge to take into account the ameliorating effect of any directions that may be available to reduce the prejudicial effect.”

See also R v Ngatikaura [2006] NSWCCA 161; 161 A Crim R 329 at [32].


	
	This observation in DAO is to the same effect as observations made in Sokolowskyj. It is a function of the trial judge in a jury trial to give such directions in order to ensure a fair trial.
	


Consideration

Significant probative value


	
	Leaving aside for the moment the question of risk of contamination or concoction, we consider that the trial judge was correct in his understanding of the tendency evidence and his assessment of it as having significant probative value, for the very careful reasons he gave.
	
	
	As set out above, at [149], the applicant’s first and, in effect, essential complaint was that the tendency asserted by the Crown was so general as to be meaningless. This was said to be particularly so with respect to the first alleged tendency, “having a sexual interest in female children under 16 years of age”. The applicant contended that much of the evidence related to differing circumstances in which the alleged acts took place, and that the alleged sexual acts were themselves dissimilar.
	
	
	There is no doubt that the tendency evidence in this case was admitted on a basis that allowed dissimilar circumstances and dissimilar acts to be used in respect of different counts. That is relevant to the assessment of whether such evidence has significant probative value. But the fact of dissimilarity of itself may not be determinative. Much will depend upon what the dissimilarities relate to. Sokolowskyj is an example where the dissimilarities were such that the evidence was not properly characterised as tendency evidence.
	
	
	By contrast, Doyle raised similar considerations to the present case. The Crown’s case on tendency contended that there were two essential tendencies: to have a sexual interest in female children under 16 years of age; and to engage in sexual conduct with female children under 16 years of age. Those tendencies were exhibited in three different, but not significantly disassociated, contexts: of social and familial relationships; his daughter’s relationships with her young friends; and the work environment.
	
	
	These dissimilarities are obvious on their face. However, what was common to them all was that they represented occasions on which young females were present and the applicant used those occasions for the purpose of engaging in sexual activities with them.
	
	
	The same may be said of the dissimilarity in the sexual conduct alleged in the various counts. However, notwithstanding the dissimilarities, the conduct alleged was sexual in nature, directed towards young females, on occasions that presented themselves to the applicant. Underlying the similarity was that the conduct was, in effect, referable to the circumstances as they presented to the applicant. In short, the conduct occurred opportunistically, as and when young female persons were in the applicant’s company.
	
	
	In those circumstances, the evidence underpinning the tendency notice quoted at [117], which described the alleged tendency in the five paragraphs which identified, in detail, the various aspects of the tendency sought to be relied on, was correctly assessed as having significant probative value.
	


Risk of contamination or concoction


	
	There is a question whether the possibility of concoction or contamination is even a relevant consideration in determining whether evidence has significant probative value. There are numerous cases on this question. It is necessary to refer only to BJS, which his Honour applied as well as Jones and McIntosh.
	
	
	In BJS, to which we have already referred at [89] – [90], the Court was concerned with the tests posited in both s 97 and s 101 for the admissibility of tendency evidence. Basten JA, at [23], pointed out that the common law “no rational explanation” test was inapplicable both in respect of s 97 and s 101. His Honour at [27], also approved as “unimpeachable” a statement in FB as follows:
	


“110   One matter that powerfully affects both the probative value of tendency evidence and the possibility of prejudicial effect is the risk of concoction or contamination of evidence.”


	
	The manner in which the risk of contamination and concoction should be dealt with is addressed in the cases of Jones and McIntosh, to which we have already referred, at [94] – [97]. It may be that Basten JA’s remarks in McIntosh at [47] and [49] are to a different effect than his remarks in BJS. We do not, however, see them as inconsistent with Jones, which has been substantially endorsed in DJW v R [2015] NSWCCA 164. However, it would be a distraction in this case to analyse the nuances of the various authorities on this question, given Zahra DCJ’s finding at p 55, which, on our consideration of the evidence was well based, that the Crown had excluded:
	


“… the reasonable possibility that there has been any concoction by the complainants or tendency witnesses or there is a reasonable possibility their evidence is contaminated.”


	
	His Honour took the view, at p 52, that there was no reasonable evidence of contamination or concoction that would produce a risk of prejudice or would act to reduce the otherwise significant probative value of the tendency evidence. In any event, to the extent that his Honour, at p 8, applied the approach in BSJ, that approach was favourable to the applicant.
	
	
	We have already examined in detail the complaint made in grounds 1 and 2 as to the risk of contamination and concoction. That reasoning also applies to this aspect of the applicant’s complaint. We would only add at this juncture that, as his Honour pointed out, at p 52, there was no evidence of a motive for any of the complainants or the tendency witnesses to concoct an account of the alleged conduct. Significantly, each of the complainants complained at or about the time they alleged the conduct occurred or, at least, at a time well before the allegations came into the public domain:
	



	
	JP spoke to her mother “a couple of months” after the incident constituting count 2 in 1985, as she was expected to attend a holiday with her family and the applicant and his family at Myall Lakes. She told her mother that “Robert came into the bedroom and woke me up and put his hand down my pants”. JP’s mother also gave evidence to that effect. JP complained of the applicant’s actions to her first boyfriend at the age of 16, and to a number of friends over the years, to her husband in 2000 and to a psychologist in 2009. She discussed the applicant with her sister DWP in 1997. DWP did not give evidence at trial but suggested to JP at that time that she had also been molested.
	
	
	SH was seven or eight when she went into her parent’s bedroom and told them “what [the applicant] had been doing” to her. This was corroborated by both of her parents. SH also complained to VOD, her friend, that the applicant made her “hold his penis”. She complained, additionally, to a number of friends, her fiancée and his family and her mother’s friend, however she gave evidence that, excepting her parents, she had “not told anyone the exact details of what [the applicant] did to me”.
	
	
	AK complained to her mother the day following her final “sleep over” with the applicant’s daughter, telling her mother that she did not want to stay the night at his house again because of the applicant. AK’s parents contacted police and AK made a formal statement on 9 March 1988 and was examined by a doctor. AK also told her husband of the applicant’s actions in July 1998.
	
	
	EE told her boyfriend and a friend of the applicant’s actions the weekend after the conduct constituting count 10 occurred, describing these actions as a “demand for sex”. She told a number of boyfriends, friends and her husband in about 1996.
	
	
	SM confided in SB and another male cast member when the applicant touched her, and did so “as it occurred”. SM discussed these incidents with SB “many times over the years”. She also told her mother that the applicant was “flashing” her while she was still working on the show and discussed the applicant’s actions with friends, colleagues and former cast members of Hey Dad..! in later life.
	



	
	Importantly, where complaint was made to the police, that occurred without reference to other witnesses. Further, as his Honour observed, at p 53, it is speculation to consider that the complainants were emboldened by the media publicity and thereby motivated to give a false account. The prior complaints and the detail in which those complaints were given belie the applicant’s submission in that regard.
	
	
	Whilst it was true that SM received payment for engaging in the media interviews, we agree with Zahra DCJ that that raised, at the most, a possibility of concoction. Even that possibility is marginal, given that, years before the media interviews, SM discussed the massaging incidents with SB many times and at the time of the exposure incident, she told SB about it immediately. SM also made other contemporaneous complaints, as set out above at [126].
	
	
	It follows that the applicant’s submissions in relation to whether the tendency evidence had significant probative value should be rejected. His Honour was correct in concluding as he did, that the evidence had significant probative value.
	


Whether Zahra DCJ erred in failing to exclude the tendency evidence under s 101


	
	The applicant contended that Zahra DCJ erred in that he regarded the fact that the prosecution had excluded the reasonable possibility of concoction as “determinative” of the balancing exercise under s 101. This submission misconstrued his Honour’s reasoning. In making his determination under s 101, his Honour outlined his factual finding that no reasonable possibility of concoction existed and then observed, at p 55:
	


“I am of the view there is no reasonable evidence of concoction or contamination that would produce a risk of prejudice or would significantly reduce the otherwise significant probative value of the evidence.”


	
	His Honour also concluded, at p 55, that the significant probative value of the evidence substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect. When regard is had to the meaning of “prejudicial effect” for the purposes of s 101, then, given his Honour’s assessment that there was no reasonable evidence of concoction or contamination, his Honour’s conclusion was open. That is different from saying that his Honour regarded the fact that the prosecution had excluded the reasonable possibility of concoction as “determinative” of the balancing exercise under s 101. To so assert effectively amounted to a contention that his Honour did not carry out the balancing exercise. That is not borne out by his Honour’s express determination at p 55.
	
	
	The applicant further contended that his Honour fell into error in failing to have regard to:
	


“ii.   the risks of unfair prejudice caused by the pre-trial publicity when considering s 101;

iii.   the risk of unfair prejudice caused by [SM’s] demonstrated malice towards the appellant; and

iv.   the risk of prejudice caused by admitting the evidence of the wardrobe assistants solely in relation to count 11.”

Unfair prejudice caused by pre-trial publicity


	
	This contention may be disposed of briefly. In the way the applicant’s proposition was framed, it appeared to suggest that Zahra DCJ was required to assess the risk of unfair pre-trial publicity independently of the question of whether the tendency evidence had significant probative value. If that is what the applicant contended, it is not correct. What has to be balanced is the probative value of tendency evidence as compared to its prejudicial effect on the accused person. On the applicant’s case, the impact of the pre-trial publicity was integral to the assessment of the probative value of the tendency evidence because of the real risk of concoction and contamination. His Honour held that there was no such risk. In the balancing exercise it was not then necessary to consider unfair prejudice of the pre-trial publicity, separately from and unassociated with the assessment of the probative value of the tendency evidence.
	
	
	If the complaint was in truth that Zahra DCJ did not consider the pre-trial publicity by assessing the danger of unfair prejudice to the applicant, that must be rejected. His Honour’s judgment shows that the publicity was considered in that way.
	


Unfair prejudice caused by the demonstrated malice of SM


	
	We have already referred to the approach Zahra DCJ took to the impact of the pre-trial publicity, which included that generated by SM, on the risk of concoction and contamination.
	
	
	As we have already pointed out, however, his Honour’s conclusion that there was no real risk of contamination was well based. To the extent the fact of animus may have impacted on the ability of the applicant to have a fair trial, his Honour’s directions to the jury dealt adequately and appropriately with this question. Although in having regard to those directions we have looked at the matter from the perspective of hindsight, it reinforces the observations of Simpson J in DAO at [171] to which we have referred.
	


Unfair prejudice caused by admitting evidence of the wardrobe assistants


	
	We will deal with this submission in the context of Ground 5. This, too, was not made good for the reasons there discussed.
	
	
	Accordingly, Ground 4 is dismissed.
	
	
	As we have dismissed ground 4, ground 3 should also be dismissed. Both parties considered grounds 3 and 4 to be co-dependant, and addressed these grounds together in their submissions.
	
	
	Zahra DCJ also treated these issues as being interdependent in his tendency judgment. His Honour held that the applicant’s application for separate trials was:
	


“… generally based upon the principle that sexual offences involving separate complainants should not be tried together unless evidence in relation to one complainant is properly admissible to prove another, or that directions would guard against the risk of impermissible prejudice: De Jesus v The Queen [1986] HCA 65; 61 ALJR 1].”


	
	His Honour also held that “the question of the admission of tendency reasoning is critical to the determination of the application for severance of the counts involving the complainants”.
	
	
	There was no challenge to his Honour’s reasoning on this issue. It also follows that ground 13 should be dismissed.
	
	
	Grounds 3 and 13 are thus also dismissed.
	


Ground 5:   His Honour’s directions to the jury concerning their use of the tendency evidence were inadequate.


	
	This ground may be dealt with briefly, in light of the Court’s reasoning in relation to ground 4.
	
	
	Zahra DCJ first directed the jury on tendency evidence during the course of that evidence being given. This direction was given following consultation with and the agreement of both parties. Further written directions were also provided to the jury, which is Honour recited during his summing-up.
	
	
	His Honour’s directions were extensive and we do not propose to set them out in full. In brief, his Honour, in accordance with his judgment on the admissibility of tendency evidence, directed the jury as to which witness’ evidence could be used for the purpose of establishing the respective tendencies alleged by the Crown in relation to the separate counts on the indictment.
	
	
	His Honour then directed the jury that the evidence could only be used to prove a tendency of the applicant to act in a particular way or with a particular state of mind if they were satisfied:
	


“… that the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt that [the applicant] did in fact commit the acts which the Crown alleges demonstrate the relevant tendency [and]

… from the act or acts that you have found proved, you can conclude beyond reasonable doubt that [the applicant] had the tendency to act with a particular state of mind or the tendency to act in a particular way that the Crown alleges.”


	
	His Honour’s directions also warned the jury that they must be “concerned with the particular and precise occasions alleged by each of the complainants in relation to each count”.
	
	
	The written directions given by his Honour substantially replicated the Criminal Trial Bench Book recommended directions on tendency evidence.
	
	
	The applicant contended that his Honour, in giving the directions he did, erred in the following respects:
	


“(1)   By directing the jury that they could use a finding that the appellant had sexual interest in female children under the age of sixteen years to prove all of the allegations in each of the counts;

(2)   By directing the jury that they could use the evidence that the appellant had a tendency to act in numerous disparate ways in relation to their consideration of all counts on the indictment;

(3)   By directing the jury that they could use the evidence of the wardrobe assistants as evidence that the appellant had a tendency to act in disparate ways in relation to count 11; and

(4)   By failing to direct the jury that they could not use the evidence of the wardrobe assistants in relation to the jury’s consideration of counts 1 to 10.”


	
	The applicant’s first and second contentions are predominately addressed by this Court’s finding that his Honour did not err in admitting the evidence on the grounds the subject of those contentions. As outlined at [195], although the evidence involved dissimilar acts and circumstances, there were two essential tendencies, one being that the applicant had a sexual interest in female children under the age of 16, making his Honour’s direction to that effect appropriate. Further, as stated at [196] – [199], although it was accepted that there were some dissimilarities in the tendency evidence, as we have explained, dissimilarity is not determinative. There was no error in the directions given to the jury.
	
	
	The applicant’s third argument related to his Honour’s direction that the evidence of LJ, CS and VR could be used to establish that the accused “engaged in touching in an inappropriate sexual way but maintaining the contact was inadvertent or accidental”. The applicant contended that his Honour’s direction was misconceived “because none of the wardrobe assistants described the applicant engaging with them in sexual activities”. This submission is not borne out by the evidence. LJ, CS and VR each gave evidence of the applicant touching them in an inappropriate sexual manner:
	



	
	LJ stated that the applicant “would often brush up inappropriately against me and the other females causing either his hands or his genitals to make subtle contact with either our breasts or bottoms”;
	
	
	VR stated: “I specifically remember on at least two occasions [the applicant] pulled me over to him using his hands. When he pulled me over I remember that his hands would grab me from behind and his fingers would slide to the side (and around) my breast”; and
	
	
	CS stated, in regards to herself and other female cast members, that the applicant “would constantly make indirect sexual contact with females breasts and bottoms [sic]”.
	



	
	Contrary to the applicant’s assertion, the submission was misconceived, not the trial judge’s direction.
	
	
	The applicant’s fourth submission related to the direction given in respect of the use that could be made of the evidence of LJ, CS and VR in respect of count 11. The applicant submitted that his Honour erred in that he “should have given a strong direction that the jury could not use their evidence in relation to any other count on the indictment”. However, when considered as a whole, his Honour’s written and oral directions to the jury were clear that the evidence of LJ, CS and VR could not be used in consideration of counts 1 to 10.
	
	
	In addition, his Honour directed the jury, at the time the evidence was led, that “the matters that these witnesses refer to are not the subject of any count in the indictment” and that the jury “must ultimately be satisfied considering each count on the indictment separately”. This direction was correct and adequate. A direction in stronger terms was not required.
	
	
	The applicant needed leave to raise this ground of appeal, as no complaint was made at trial as to the inadequacy of the directions, nor was any request made for further directions or any redirection to be given to the jury: Criminal Appeal Rules, r 4.
	
	
	In Jubraeel v R [2015] NSWCCA 131, Macfarlan JA observed:
	


“24.   In light of a trial counsel’s duty to object to evidence and seek redirections following the Summing-Up, leave under r 4 is not lightly given. Obtaining leave requires an applicant to satisfy the court that the failure to give the jury a particular direction (or other error) has caused a miscarriage of justice (Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; 196 CLR 297 at [72] per McHugh J), or at least that there is a possibility that that is the case (R v Roberts [2001] NSWCCA 163 NSWLR 138 at [55] per Howie J).

25.   In ARS v R [2011] NSWCCA 266, Bathurst CJ provided the following summary of important considerations in relation to r 4:

148   The requirements of r 4 are not mere technicalities. The Criminal Appeal Act does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted on one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which could or should have been raised at the first trial: R v ITA [2003] NSWCCA 174; (2003) 139 A Crim R 340 at [94], citing with approval R v Fuge [2001] NSWCCA 208; (2001) 123 A Crim R 310, 319. See also Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [170].

The appellant must establish that he or she has lost a real chance (or a chance fairly open) of being acquitted: Picken v R [2007] NSWCCA 319 at [20]-[21].

A failure by counsel to take objection or to raise an issue on summing-up may be explicable by the fact that counsel said nothing hoping to gain an advantage at a later stage, or that counsel took no objection as, in the atmosphere of the trial, counsel saw no injustice as to what was being done: Germakian v R [2007] NSWCCA 373; (2007) 70 NSWLR 467 at [10]-[13]; Sanchez v R [2009] NSWCCA 171; (2009) 196 A Crim R 472 at [58]-[61].

An unexplained failure to take the point at the trial is usually a reasonably reliable indicator of the fairness and adequacy of the summing-up: Tekely v R [2007] NSWCCA 75 at [88], [130].”


	
	The applicant has failed to establish the matters of which he complains. In those circumstances, leave to raise ground 5 should be refused.
	


Ground 7:    The trial miscarried because of the manner in which the Crown Prosecutor cross-examined the applicant.

Ground 8:   The trial miscarried because of the manner in which the Crown Prosecutor addressed the jury.

Ground 9:    His Honour erred in refusing to discharge the jury following the Crown Prosecutor’s final address.

Ground 10:    His Honour erred by failing to adequately direct the jury concerning the Crown Prosecutor’s final address.


	
	Because these grounds are derived from the conduct of the Crown prosecutor in the latter stages of the trial, it is convenient to deal with them together.
	


Background


	
	A chronological sketch of the salient events in court is as follows.
	
	
	The applicant was called to give evidence in the defence case on the morning of Thursday 20 March 2014.
	
	
	His cross-examination by the Crown prosecutor commenced in the afternoon of Friday 21 March 2014. After a time, the applicant’s advocate made an objection, and there was discussion between his Honour and the advocates in the absence of the jury. The nub of the complaint was that the questions being asked by the Crown prosecutor were suggestive of a reversal of the onus of proof, in that the applicant was allegedly being asked to express a view or opinion as to why each complainant had given their version of events, or indeed why they might have lied.
	
	
	The cross-examination recommenced, and again after a time there was another objection that was discussed in the absence of the jury. The nub of the complaint on this occasion was that, in recounting large “slabs” of evidence given by the complainants during the trial within the questions being asked of the applicant, the Crown prosecutor was asking the applicant to prove a motive for the making of allegations against him. The cross-examination recommenced. Thereafter the trial adjourned for the weekend.
	
	
	On the morning of Monday, 24 March 2014, the applicant’s advocate provided his Honour with written submissions about assertedly inappropriate portions of the cross-examination of the accused. Discussions occurred in the absence of the jury. To summarise them, it was asserted that the recital of the evidence of each complainant by the Crown prosecutor had the practical effect of placing the applicant in the invidious position of seeking to explain why a particular complainant had given that evidence; that the questions themselves, and the way that they were being framed by the Crown prosecutor, had no relevance or probative value; and that, as a result of the recital of the evidence by the Crown prosecutor, the applicant was able to provide only affirmative answers that were suggestive of his acceptance of the truth of the allegations made by the complainants.
	
	
	During the course of the applicant’s cross-examination on 24 March, his Honour gave the following directions to the jury:
	


“Ladies and gentlemen, as I have indicated to you at the start of the trial and reminded you during the trial, the Crown bears the onus of proof and must prove the elements of each of the counts on the indictment beyond reasonable doubt. The accused is presumed to be innocent until you members of the jury, having considered the evidence in the trial, find guilt to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.

It follows from the presumption of innocence that the accused does not have to prove anything. It is not for the accused to prove that a witness or witnesses are lying or that their evidence is unreliable. If that were the approach that you were to adopt in assessing the evidence of the witnesses [then] that would be an impermissible approach as it would place an onus on the accused, that is an onus to prove that the account given by a witness is an untruthful account. He bears no such onus.

It is for the Crown to prove that the evidence of the witnesses that the Crown relies upon to prove its case in relation to a particular count is a truthful and reliable account. It is important to keep this direction very much in mind when the accused is cross-examined. When the Crown puts the evidence given by the complainants and other witnesses in detail to the accused in cross-examination it is not up to the accused in answer to questions to be able to give reasons why the evidence of a particular witness is either untruthful or unreliable. The accused does not have to prove a witness is untruthful or unreliable nor does he have to prove that a witness has a motive to lie.

The failure of the accused to explain why a witness gave a particular account does not mean that the evidence is therefore a truthful and honest account and you should not draw an adverse inference against the accused because he in answer to questions does not provide a motive of any witness to give untruthful evidence. It is for you, ladies and gentlemen, to assess whether the evidence of the witnesses is a truthful and reliable account before you can act upon it in determining whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.

The onus of proof remains at all times on the Crown. The accused does not have to prove anything. The fact that he has chosen to give evidence does not reverse the onus of proof. I will give you further directions concerning the assessment of the accused's evidence during my summing-up. Thank you.”


	
	The cross-examination concluded on Monday 24 March 2014. The applicant’s advocate then re-examined the applicant briefly.
	
	
	The final address of the Crown prosecutor commenced on Thursday 27 March. It concluded (one can infer from his Honour’s remark to the jury that “there’s half an hour to go”) at about 3:30 pm that day. The jury was asked to return to court on the following Monday, giving rise to a three day break in the involvement of the jury in the trial.
	
	
	Neither before nor after the departure of the jury on 27 March was any application made by the applicant’s advocate to his Honour before the court adjourned for the day.
	
	
	The court reconvened the following day, Friday 28 March. As we have said, the jury was then not present in either the court room or the courthouse. The applicant’s advocate immediately made an application for the discharge of the jury, upon two bases. The first was “impermissible comments made by the Crown Prosecutor and her final address”. The second basis was “extraordinary prejudicial media reporting last evening” on a particular television station.
	
	
	The applicant’s advocate said that the remarks of the Crown Prosecutor were:
	


“…intemperate and inflammatory, being comments which would arouse, in a practical sense, prejudice, and invite the jury to use emotion to convict the accused. Her comments also amounted to the belittling and ridiculing of the accused’s case, and also expressed personal opinions”.


	
	As for the media reporting, the television transmission was played before us. In a nutshell, it spoke of the possibility that, if convicted, the applicant would be sentenced to imprisonment for many years. A noteworthy aspect of the telecast was that some at least of it showed a reporter speaking to the camera in front of a prison.
	
	
	Thereafter, the applicant’s advocate provided his Honour with a schedule of the particular matters in the Crown prosecutor’s final address that founded his application. It featured over 60 portions of the final address which do not need to be analysed further, because a refined and less extensive schedule was contained in the written submissions of the applicant in this Court. His Honour then received detailed submissions from the applicant’s advocate and the Crown prosecutor, and reserved his decision about whether to discharge the jury until the following Monday.
	
	
	In a judgment dated 30 March, delivered on 31 March, his Honour refused to discharge the jury, but indicated that he would give some firm directions to the jury about aspects of the Crown’s final address.
	
	
	On Monday 31 March, the transcript does not record any discussion of the question of a discharge between his Honour and the parties in the absence of the jury. Nor is there any reference to there being a separate transcript of the judgment of his Honour refusing the discharge. Still, one can infer that his Honour refused to discharge the jury on the Monday morning, and communicated that to the parties in open court. After other aspects were discussed briefly, the final address of the applicant’s advocate commenced. That address concluded late in the afternoon of Monday 31 March.
	
	
	His Honour commenced to sum up “late in the day” of the same day. There, his Honour said: 
	


“Ladies and gentlemen, as judges, you have important matters to decide in this case, important not only to the accused but also to the community. The privilege that you have of sitting in judgment upon your fellow citizens, as I said to you during the course of the trial, is one that carries with it corresponding duties and obligations. You must not exercise your function capriciously or irrationally. You are obliged by the oath or the affirmation that each of you took to determine all relevant issues of fact according to the evidence. As I told you from the outset of the trial that the evidence is the only material on which you should arrive at your conclusion as to whether the individual offence you are considering has been proved beyond reasonable doubt. I am sure by now, ladies and gentlemen, that you are well aware that the evidence comprises what has been said by the witnesses who have given their evidence before you and, of course, all the exhibits which have been tendered, all of which you will have when you retire to consider your verdicts.

Members of the jury, as judges, it is of course your duty to act without any form of partiality and without any prejudice. You must divorce from your judgment any question of sympathy or emotion or views you may have at the type of crime that the Crown here alleges was committed. It is your responsibility to evaluate the evidence you have heard calmly and dispassionately. Emotion of any kind must play no part in your deliberations. The Crown Prosecutor in closing address, in describing the nature of the allegations, used emotive language. She described the alleged conduct as ""disturbing, bizarre, extraordinary to any right minded person"". Further, the Crown made general comments concerning the type of offence alleged to have occurred here. The Crown spoke about ""disturbing things happening to our children at the hands of strangers and friends and at the hands of those who are placed in their trust"". The Crown ended her closing address by inviting you by your verdict to tell ""that man"", referring to the accused,"" what he did to those girls was wrong and criminal"".

Ladies and gentlemen, it is necessary to put these submissions to one side and to disregard them. As I have indicated, emotion concerning the type of offence alleged to have been committed here must play no part in your deliberation. It is not part of your reasoning or your role to ensure that the ultimate verdict must send a message to the community or to the accused based on personal views about the type of conduct alleged here. That would be an improper exercise of your function as a judge to consider the evidence dispassionately and to decide the case based only on the evidence from a totally objective point of view. It is important that you keep this direction in mind throughout your deliberations. You are judges in this trial and acting judicially requires you to act only on the evidence that you must consider from an objective and totally dispassionate point of view. Both the Crown and the accused are entitled to your judgment, totally free from sympathy and/or prejudice.

Ladies and gentlemen, you may recall at the start of the trial before you were empanelled I alerted you to the considerable publicity concerning the arrest of the accused and asked you to seek to be excused if you believed the exposure to that publicity was such that you could not bring any partial [sic] mind to bear on the issues in the trial and the subject matter of the trial.

I have reminded you on many occasions during the trial that as a judge you must decide the issues based only on the evidence led in the trial not what someone else has said elsewhere for example, in a newspaper or in other media reporting. It is important that in exercising your role as a judge you put out of your mind any publicity concerning the accused either before the trial or any media publicity you may have been exposed to during the course of the trial. It is important, ladies and gentlemen, that you focus only on the evidence led in the trial.

As I said to you at the outset of the trial our system of criminal justice has as its foundation the independence and impartiality of jurors drawn from the community who give a true verdict according to the evidence.” (emphasis added)


	
	Very soon afterwards, the trial adjourned for the day.
	
	
	The summing-up continued for some days. It concluded on Thursday 3 April, when the jury retired to consider its verdicts shortly before midday. No further application was made by the applicant’s advocate for a discharge based on any aspect of the conduct of the Crown prosecutor; nor was any redirection sought at any stage by the applicant’s advocate from his Honour altering or expanding upon anything that appears in the extract from the summing-up that we have provided above.
	


Submissions of the applicant


	
	Senior counsel helpfully provided a table of extracts from the final address of the Crown prosecutor said to be inappropriate. It is convenient to reproduce that table in its entirety.
	



	
		
			
			T 1899.17-20
			
			
			“...The Crown submits that after assessing their evidence carefully and taking into account the surrounding evidence, the evidence of complaint, the evidence of opportunity, of the inherently unreliable and incredible testimony of the accused…” (The first matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1899.36-40
			
			
			“The Crown case is also at times disturbing and at times a harrowing tale of sexual abuse, committed upon young girls at the hands of the accused. It can at times seem extraordinarily bizarre or brazen, extraordinary in its sexual depravity and brazenness, and extraordinary to any right-minded person that such things could possibly occur, but they did”. (The second matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1899.42-46
			
			
			“...Sadly horrible disturbing things happen to our children and they happen at the hands of strangers and friends and they happen at the hands who are supposedly there to look after them and are placed in their trust. You don't have to understand why it happened, you just have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it did happen”. (The third matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1900.50-1901.8
			
			
			“Now you will no doubt hear submissions in time from my friend on behalf of his client as to why the Crown, he will submit, has not proven its case concerning any counts on the indictment against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. Now we ask you to listen closely. Listen to ascertain if there is any real substance to the submissions especially when one considers the supporting evidence surrounding each complainant, the age of the complainants at the time that they say they are abused by the accused…” (The fourth matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1902.7-12
			
			
			“...There was simply no evidence of any sort of form of any amateur conspiracy with receiving information for one and ensuring another person was handed it. Simply nothing and again the Crown would submit that when listening to those type of submissions, you listen to whether it's actually just there to distract you from the real evidence and the real issues in the cage and simply just being a red herring”. (The fifth matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1903.8-13
			
			
			“...And you might well think that this simply does not stack up with the overwhelming surrounding evidence, independent evidence in this trial. You might think he was desperately and artificially trying to distance himself from the children to limit the opportunities that existed for him to assault the children if he was so inclined and the Crown case is that he was clearly so inclined to do so…” (The sixth matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1903.21-26
			
			
			“...And also to remember their haunting and compelling evidence as to their reasons why they didn't immediately complain at times. And it was not in relation to all of them but for some of them. JP, ""I didn't tell mum immediately because I just felt mortified. I was just embarrassed, I didn't know her response, just really embarrassed about it all”. (The seventh matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1903.50 – 1904.5
			
			
			“Now there's also the component of the brazenness of his conduct. Well you might well think that the accused had got away with this for years. He was confident that they would not disclose what he was doing and at times with the complainants he touched them in a way, you might well think that he could explain away if caught or that they yelled out, in a way that could explain it as inadvertent touching…” (The eighth matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1904.23-25
			
			
			“…And no doubt the media profited from this but the media is not on trial. The media is not on trial. It is the accused and his actions that are on trial…” (The ninth matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1904.28-31
			
			
			“…There were doctors, there were psychiatrists or psychologists and a complaint was made. And you heard from Bill Hall that the parents decided not to proceed with this because of the tender age of their own little girl…” (The 10th matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1905.13-21
			
			
			“Now I would like to deal generally why you can safely and confidently convict the accused on all counts in the indictment, and the number one reason is the complainants themselves. The evidence of the complainants, you might well think, and the Crown submits to you, was utterly convincing...They all gave a clearly disturbing account of what occurred to them during their childhood”. (The 11th matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1905.23-25
			
			
			“Once again I remind you that they were not the age when they gave you that evidence, and quite helpfully in cross-examination you had before you several pictures of these young girls at around about that age…” (The 12th matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1905.33-36
			
			
			“In relation to cross-examination all of them were subjected to extensive and at times forceful cross-examination; SM, I understand or remember, being in the witness box under cross-examination for nearly three days. None of them, none of them resiled one iota from what they had told police as to what the accused had done to them years ago…” (The 13th matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1906.5-9
			
			
			“We ask you to compare their evidence. We ask you to look and assess their attempts to give an honest recollection based upon their memory to that of the accused when he gave his evidence and how he gave his evidence. The Crown submits his evidence showed a willingness to guess, to assume, to backtrack, to fabricate and to change…” (The 14th matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1909.11-16
			
			
			“The Crown submits that the accused’s evidence as to this is inherently implausible, that he can remember their renovations occurring August and September. The Crown has submitted and put to him in cross-examination that he has simply based this on the document that is in the brief of evidence to try and help him and try and back-date the timing of the incidents so that it is outside the dates on the indictment…” (The 15th matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1911.13-14
			
			
			“What does the accused say, that this just simply never happened, neither encounter. Never came in”. (The 16th matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1915.33-36
			
			
			“…She told you that she “didn’t feel comfortable talking about it but I suppose I have to”. And then proceeded to give a blow by blow account of being up on the top of the houseboat, lying down and Ms Bakker coming over to her or Ms Woodley-Page with her husband and the kids downstairs and stroking her and effectively propositioning her for sex…” (The 17th matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1915.49-1916.2
			
			
			“…A complete load of rubbish and we ask you to consider her evidence and consider how [she] was cross-examined about that and consider her answers to you in the witness box”. (The 18th matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1922.5-7
			
			
			“…The fact that he effectively put himself in a position blocking the sight from Jessica, by putting himself in between herself and the young girl he was assaulting…” (The 19th matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1924.10-12
			
			
			“…It is simply a book on an explanation of conception explained to children, not seven-year-old girls getting masturbated by the father of their friend…” (The 20th matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1944.13-16
			
			
			“…Again the Crown submits the rigidity of his evidence, the inflexibility to actually admit that yeah possibly I might have gone into the studio at Epping to see someone or to pick up a pay cheque or to do something like that, but it’s this no, never happened..” (The 21st matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1944.45-48
			
			
			“…Also the ability to pick up a TV and move it from room to room, even if you’ve only got one TV, it is just something to consider but of course, according to the accused, that simply never happened”. (The 22nd matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1946.28-30
			
			
			“…To suggest that that is evidence or that that suggests that her evidence is false and that she didn’t have a problem with the accused, again the Crown submits just does not stack up whatsoever”. (The 23rd matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1956.46-48
			
			
			“You’ll remember the Crown submits you’ll look at his questioning and his answer whenever he was taken off script or off what the general pattern of evidence was…” (The 24th matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1957.1-2
			
			
			“…Well it is the Crown submission that it was most definitely not and it can be rejected by you out of hand…” (The 25th matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1957.25-28
			
			
			“…She drew that diagram for you and in the diagram she had nominated a place for a bed. And you’ll remember that office and bed where there was a connection for a phone and a fax, there was a bed in there. Bunk beds yes, but there was a bed in there…” (The 26th matter)
			
		
		
			
			T 1958.4-7
			
			
			“…Ladies and gentleman the Crown invites you to tell that man what he did to those young girls was wrong and it was criminal. The Crown invites you to convict this man and return verdicts of guilty on every count in the indictment”. (The 27th matter)
			
		
	



	
	As well as that, it was said that the wrongfulness of what had occurred in cross-examination was as follows. The nub of the complaint was that the Crown prosecutor had engaged in conduct that “inflamed” the emotions of the jury, thereby causing them to act in an improper and prejudicial manner. In short, it was submitted that, in directing the applicant in cross-examination to the evidence of the complainants in some detail, the Crown prosecutor was inviting the accused to explain why the complainants had given that evidence. In other words, the Crown prosecutor was pressing to have the applicant suggest that the evidence of the complainants was untrue.
	
	
	In oral submissions before us, senior counsel for the applicant explained that the cross-examination, bearing in mind the firm directions given by his Honour half-way through it, did not give rise to a miscarriage of justice of itself. Rather, it was a factor to be taken into account when the cumulative effect of all the factors in the trial that should have, in his submission, led to a discharge were considered.
	
	
	In short, it was submitted it was not a matter of looking at each individual asserted failing seriatim, devoid of context. Rather, it required the asserted wrongs in the cross-examination to be analysed, together with the asserted wrongs in the final address; the context of a trial of allegations of child sexual assault with many complainants; a vast amount of publicity before and during the trial; the particular publicity on the television station that occurred a few hours after the final address of the Crown prosecutor concluded; and, finally, the delay of three days between the offending remarks in the final address of the Crown prosecutor and the giving of the directions about them in the summing-up.
	
	
	In all of these circumstances, it was said that nothing less than a discharge of the jury could have avoided a miscarriage of justice, and that the directions finally given by his Honour were simply inadequate to do so.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	In oral submissions, it was accepted that it would be objectionable for a cross-examiner to use questioning of an opposing party merely to repeat, for tactical reasons, the details of the evidence in the cross-examiner’s case. But it was said that that did not happen in the applicant’s cross-examination.
	
	
	As for the Crown’s final address, it was accepted that there were “aspects of the Crown’s address that your Honours would no doubt censure”. But it was said that the Court would not be satisfied that those aspects of the final address would have caused the jury to refrain from a “rational consideration of the evidence”.
	
	
	In short, it was said that in light of the firm directions given by his Honour, both during cross-examination and at the start of his Honour’s summing-up, no miscarriage of justice had occurred.
	


Determination of these grounds


	
	It is convenient to begin with some basic principles governing the conduct of persons appearing as an advocate for the Crown in a criminal trial. Although what we have to say applies equally to private counsel and solicitors appearing in such a role, for convenience we shall use the term Crown prosecutor to describe such a person.
	
	
	First, the Crown prosecutor has a special role that combines that of an advocate contending for a cause in adversarial proceedings with that of a Minister of Justice: see Subramaniam v The Queen [2004] HCA 51; 211 ALR 1 at [54] (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ); and McCullough v The Queen (1982) 6 A Crim R 274 at 285. In that fundamental sense, the role of a Crown prosecutor is different from that of a counsel appearing for a plaintiff, who bears the onus of proof in civil proceedings, and from that of accused’s counsel in criminal proceedings.
	
	
	Secondly, a Crown prosecutor should never use language designed or calculated to inflame the jury: see Livermore v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 334; 67 NSWLR 659 at [24].
	
	
	Thirdly, a Crown prosecutor should take special care not to use such language when the subject matter of a criminal trial has an inherent tendency to cause the jury to react emotionally to the evidence in the Crown case. Examples that spring readily to mind are trials of horrific murders and trials of allegations of child sexual assault, crimes for which the community reserves a special abhorrence.
	
	
	Fourthly, a Crown prosecutor is not prohibited from forcefully and firmly putting the prosecution case to the jury: see McCullough at 285; and R v Rugari [2001] NSWCCA 64; 122 A Crim R 1 at [52] (Carruthers AJ, with whom Spigelman CJ and Sperling J agreed). Nor is a Crown prosecutor prohibited from utilising rhetoric: see Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at 600 (Heydon J). Nor is a Crown prosecutor prohibited from firmly calling upon the jury to reject defence evidence or a defence case as inherently unbelievable.
	
	
	Fifthly, on the other hand, the Crown prosecutor must not belittle or ridicule either an accused person, or his or her evidence, or his or her case: see Livermore at [31].
	
	
	Sixthly, a Crown prosecutor should especially eschew advocates’ tricks designed to curry favour with the judge and especially with the jury, or to gain an ulterior advantage: see Wood v R [2012] NSWCCA 21; 84 NSWLR 581 at [605] (McClellan CJ at CL, with whom Lathan and Rothman JJ agreed). An example of what may be described as an advocate’s trick, (there are many, regrettably), is asking a question in the presence of the jury that one believes or knows will be the subject of a successful objection merely in order to force that response from one’s opponent, and to cause the jury to reflect upon the subject matter of the question that will remain unanswered.
	
	
	Seventhly, the conduct of a Crown prosecutor in a criminal trial can of itself lead to a miscarriage of justice, that can found a successful appeal against conviction: see Whitehorn v The Queen [1983] HCA 42; 152 CLR 657 at 663-4 (Deane J).
	
	
	Eighthly, speaking generally, no advocate in criminal or civil proceedings should place his or her personal opinion before the tribunal of fact or law, because it is irrelevant: see KNP v R [2006] NSWCCA 213 at [53] (McClellan CJ at CL, with whom James and Hall JJ agreed); R v Liristis [2004] NSWCCA 287 at [95] (Kirby J, with whom Studdert J and Hislop JJ agreed); and Rugari at [60].
	
	
	Ninthly, speaking generally, every advocate in criminal or civil proceedings is entitled to mount a firm attack on the evidence and submissions (with regard to matters of both fact and law) placed before the court by his or her opponent. Great care should be taken, however, to ensure that a personal attack is not made upon one’s opponent himself or herself, unless there are very sound bases for doing so.
	
	
	Tenthly, the determination of grounds such as these is very much a matter of this Court analysing exactly what was said or done, and considering it in the context of the entirety of the trial, including remedial steps (if any) taken by the presiding judge: see, for example, KNP.
	
	
	It is convenient now to apply those principles to the specific matters that found these grounds of appeal.
	
	
	Turning to the cross-examination of the applicant first, it will be recalled that the jury had heard from very many complainants and tendency witnesses about the alleged sexual crimes of the applicant and the context in which they occurred. It was not inappropriate for the Crown prosecutor to cross-examine the applicant about each allegation, and to question him about his response to it. By that we mean, it was not inappropriate to take the applicant to a particular allegation of a particular complainant, and to ask him, for example, whether his position was that it never happened; or that something of that nature did occur, but that it had been misinterpreted as having a sexual connotation; or that something of that nature did occur, but he had in fact touched a different and unremarkable part of the complainant’s body.
	
	
	Of course, it is well established that no accused may be asked explicitly or implicitly why a complainant would lie about an allegation of sexual offending, and a jury may not be asked by a Crown prosecutor to reflect on the same question, whatever the nature of the allegation: see Palmer v R [1998] HCA 2; 193 CLR 1 at 7 (Brennan CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ). Indeed, speaking more generally, it is well established that one witness cannot be asked to comment on the evidence of another witness, in the sense of being asked to provide an explanation as to why he or she considers that it differs from the evidence of the witness being questioned. Apart from anything else, that is lay opinion evidence that is inadmissible.
	
	
	As well as that, it would be an advocate’s trick to direct a witness to the evidence of another witness (or indeed to his or her own evidence in re-examination) in circumstances in which the directing question itself is deliberately designed, by way of its detail or extent, to constitute a repetition upon the mind of the jury of the evidence that supports the case of the questioning party.
	
	
	Here, the applicant was repeatedly taken to the evidence of various complainants, and asked what his position was about the events that they alleged had occurred. That was an aspect of cross-examination that was entirely to be expected; indeed, it was almost inevitable. We do not consider that the way the questions were asked gave rise to an explicit or implicit reversal of the onus of proof. Nor are we satisfied that the terms of the directing questions themselves were an advocate’s trick inconsistent with the obligations of the Crown prosecutor. Finally, it is to be recalled that, before the cross-examination had concluded, his Honour gave the jury a detailed direction about their approach to the subject matter of these questions, and explicitly informed the jury that the cross-examination by the Crown prosecutor of the applicant about what the complainants had said had not the slightest effect upon the onus of proof.
	
	
	In short, we consider that the questions complained of in the cross-examination of the applicant do not establish that a miscarriage of justice occurred in this case.
	
	
	We turn now to the aspects of the final address of the Crown prosecutor in the order in which they appear in the table, which is extracted above.
	
	
	As for the first matter, we do not consider it inappropriate for a Crown prosecutor to characterise the evidence of an accused person as “inherently unreliable”. We also interpret the use of the word “incredible” in this context as meaning “incapable of belief”. There is nothing exceptionable about such a submission.
	
	
	As for the second matter, the point being made was that the offences had allegedly been committed brazenly, perhaps so brazenly that a tribunal of fact may be reluctant to accept that they occurred at all. The Crown prosecutor was entitled to address the jury to seek to dispel any such reaction. But there was no call for the use of the word “depravity”, which is loaded with emotional connotations, and the Crown prosecutor should not have used it.
	
	
	As for the third matter, it was open to the Crown prosecutor to place before the jury the proposition that sexual assault does indeed occur in the Australian community. Having said that, the emotive word “horrible” should not have been used.
	
	
	As for the fourth matter, it was open to the Crown prosecutor to ask the jury to reflect in due course upon whether the submissions of applicant’s counsel had any real substance.
	
	
	As for the fifth matter, it was open to the Crown prosecutor to submit that the jury should reject any proposition that there had been a conspiracy in existence to implicate the applicant falsely. It would also have been open for the Crown prosecutor to submit that the question of a conspiracy was, on the evidence, a distraction. It was also open to use a colloquialism for a distraction or false path, namely, a “red herring”. But we consider that it was inappropriate for the Crown prosecutor to submit that there was a possibility that a putative submission of the applicant’s advocate was “actually just there to distract you”. That was open to interpretation by the jury as being an attack upon the person and motives of the applicant’s advocate himself, and not upon his predicted submissions.
	
	
	As for the sixth matter, it was open to the Crown prosecutor to submit that the jury would find that the applicant was attempting to distance himself from the complainants, and was doing so “desperately and artificially”.
	
	
	As for the seventh matter, it was open to the Crown prosecutor to describe the evidence of the complainants about why they did not complain immediately as “compelling”, and to quote what one of the complainants had said about that. But in the context of a discussion of the effect of sexual assault upon young children, the emotive word “haunting” should not have been used.
	
	
	As for the eighth matter, there can be no complaint about the Crown prosecutor submitting that, on her case, the applicant had got away with his crimes for years, and had developed an attitude of confidence and brazenness as a result.
	
	
	As for the ninth matter, it was not inappropriate for the Crown prosecutor to remind the jury that the actions of the media were not to be the object of their verdicts, but rather, they were concerned with the asserted actions of the applicant.
	
	
	As for the 10th matter, a reference to a child being of “tender age”, although a little old-fashioned perhaps, is not exceptionable.
	
	
	As for the 11th matter, there can be no complaint about the Crown prosecutor submitting that the jury would confidently return verdicts of guilty based upon the evidence of the complainants themselves; that that evidence was “utterly convincing”; and that the evidence was “disturbing”.
	
	
	As for the 12th matter, there can be no complaint about the Crown prosecutor reminding the jury that the women who gave evidence were not the girls whom the Crown prosecutor submitted the applicant had sexually assaulted.
	
	
	As for the 13th matter, there can be no complaint: about the Crown prosecutor describing the cross-examination of a Crown witness as being “extensive and at times forceful”; nor about the Crown prosecutor reminding the jury of the duration of the cross-examination; nor about the Crown prosecutor submitting that the complainants had not resiled in the witness box from what they had told police many years before.
	
	
	As for the 14th matter, there can be no complaint about the Crown prosecutor submitting that an accused who has chosen to go into the witness box gave thoroughly unsatisfactory evidence. Indeed, so long as the principles in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 have been complied with, there can be no complaint about a Crown prosecutor submitting that the evidence of an accused person is wholly untruthful and should be completely rejected by the jury.
	
	
	As for the 15th matter, there can be no complaint about the Crown prosecutor submitting that the evidence of an accused person is “inherently implausible”. No",2015-12-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2702277,R v Peart; R v Sorokin [2015] NSWCCA 321,"Judgment


	
	WARD JA: The respondents (Kylie Anne Peart and Alexander Daniel Sorokin) were charged in 2014 with three counts of drug-related offences relating to the alleged importation of, and trafficking in, a controlled drug (3,4 – methylenedioxymethcathinone) (“MDMC”). The importation was alleged to have occurred through the post.
	
	
	On 10 June 2014, the respondents waived their right to committal. The trial commenced in the District Court on 8 September 2015. Each of the respondents pleaded not guilty.
	
	
	Relevantly, the first two counts on the indictment presented against the respondents charged that, contrary to s 307.3(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth) (“the Code”) with s 11.2A(1) of the Code, between about 13 March 2013 and 5 June 2013 at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales, they did jointly commit an offence, in that they imported “a border controlled drug, namely 3,4-methylenedioxymethcathinone, a drug analogue of the border controlled drug Methcathinone”. The remaining (third) count on the indictment was a charge relating to an alleged offence of trafficking in MDMC on or about 3 July 2013, contrary to s 302.4(1) with s 11.2A(1) of the Code.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor quite properly raised as a preliminary issue the question whether counts 1 and 2 on the indictment (the importation offences) were sustainable having regard to the operation of s 301.9(2) of the Code, following amendments to the legislation which had taken effect on 28 May 2013. He accepted that if the construction given to that provision by Murrell CJ in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory in R v Poulakis (No 3) [2015] ACTSC 191 were correct then there was no question but that counts 1 and 2 on the indictment should be quashed.
	
	
	The issue for determination by the trial judge was whether MDMC (itself a listed controlled drug under the Criminal Code Regulations 2002 (Cth) (“the Regulations”)) was, by reason of its listing as a controlled drug, not capable of being a “drug analogue” of the border controlled drug Methcathinone. The trial judge heard submissions on that issue and the following day published his reasons for concluding that the answer to that question was that MDMC was not, as a listed controlled drug, capable of being a drug analogue of Methcathinone. His Honour proceeded to quash the relevant counts on the indictment and vacated the hearing to allow for the bringing of a foreshadowed appeal to this Court by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5C of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	


Legislative provisions


	
	The legislative scheme in relation to cross-border drug importation/exportation offences and domestic trafficking offences is to be found in Pt 9.1 of the Code and the Regulations. As the drugs in question were intercepted on 5 June 2013, the Crown submits, and the respondents appear to have accepted, that the applicable version of the Code is that which includes the amendments introduced into Pt 9.1 by the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious Drugs, Identity Crime and Other Measures) Act 2012 (Cth), which took effect from 28 May 2013.
	
	
	Broadly speaking, under the Code there are separate offences in relation to the cross-border importation of proscribed “border controlled drugs” (s 307.3) and in relation to the domestic trafficking in and manufacturing of proscribed “controlled drugs”. The terms “border controlled drug” and “controlled drug” are separately defined in s 300.2 by reference to the meaning given to those terms in separate sections (s 301.4 and 301.1 respectively).
	
	
	The meaning statutorily attributed to those terms is in broadly identical terms and includes in each case both a drug listed by a regulation as a border controlled drug (in the case of s 301.4) or listed as a controlled drug (in the case of s 301.1) and a drug analogue of a listed border controlled drug or listed controlled drug as the case may be. As indicated by the meaning attributed to the terms, there are separate lists in the Regulations of border controlled drugs (to which the cross-border import/export offences apply) and controlled drugs (to which the domestic trafficking/manufacturing offences apply). There is a single provision ascribing statutory meaning to the term “drug analogue” (s 301.9).
	
	
	So, by way of example, in the context of offences relating to border controlled drugs (i.e., the offences the subject of counts 1 and 2 on the indictment), the text of the relevant provisions is as follows.
	
	
	“Border controlled drug” is defined in s 300.2 by reference to s 301.4, which provides that:
	


301.4   Meaning of border controlled drug

For the purpose of this Part, a border controlled drug is a substance, other than a growing plant, that is:

   (a)   listed by a regulation as a border controlled drug; or

   (b)   a drug analogue of a listed border controlled drug; or

   (c)   determined by the Minister as a border controlled drug under section 301.13 (which deals with emergency determinations of serious drugs).

   Note 1:   Some conditions must be satisfied before:

   (a)   a regulation can be made for paragraph (a) (see section 301.7); or

   (b)   a determination can be made for paragraph (c) (see subsection 301.8(2)).

   Note 2:   For the meaning of drug analogue, see section 301.9.


	
	Section 301.9 gives the following meaning of drug analogue (applicable to both the controlled drug offences and the border controlled drug offences):
	


301.9   Meaning of drug analogue

(1)   For the purposes of this Part, a substance is a drug analogue of a listed controlled drug, or a listed border controlled drug, if the substance is of any of the following in relation to the listed drug (or in relation to a primary analogue of the listed drug), however the substance is obtained:

   (a)   one of the following (a primary analogue):

      (i)   a stereoisomer;

      (ii)   a structural isomer having the same constituent groups;

      (iii)   an alkaloid;

   (b)   a structural modification obtained by the addition of one or more of the following groups:

   …

   (c)   a structural modification obtained in one or more of the following ways:

   …

   (d)   any other homologue, analogue, chemical derivative or substance substantially similar in chemical structure.

(2)   However, a drug analogue does not include a substance that is itself a listed controlled drug or a listed border controlled drug.


	
	In lay terms, drug analogues are substances very similar but not identical in chemical composition to listed proscribed drugs.
	
	
	Relevantly, for present purposes, Methcathinone is both a listed controlled drug (Item 159, Schedule 3 of the Regulations) and a listed border controlled drug (Item 119, Schedule 4 of the Regulations) whereas MDMC is a listed controlled drug (Item 177, Schedule 3 of the Regulations) but not a listed border controlled drug.
	
	
	The issue of statutory interpretation that arises in this appeal is whether, on the proper construction of s 301.9(2) of the Code, the fact that MDMC is listed as a controlled drug (for the purpose of the domestic manufacturing and trafficking offences) means that it is excluded from the definition of a drug analogue of the border controlled drug Methcathinone (and hence is not within the ambit of the cross-border import and export offences).
	


Legislative history


	
	Before the amendments to Pt 9.1 of the Code which took effect in May 2013, there were, as there are now, separate lists of controlled drugs (in the now repealed s 314.1 of the Code) and of border controlled drugs (in the now repealed s 314.4 of the Code). Each list contained a separate provision extending that list to cover drug analogues of the listed drugs (ss 314.1(2) and 314.4(2) respectively). The definition of drug analogue in each of ss 314.1(2) and 314.4(2) was identical. In each case once a substance was listed (as a controlled drug or border controlled drug, as the case may be) it was no longer a drug analogue for that list. There was, however, nothing to preclude a listed controlled drug (or listed border controlled drug) being a drug analogue of a listed drug on the other list.
	
	
	There is therefore no dispute that, prior to the relevant amendments, if a drug analogue of a border controlled drug was listed in its own right as a border controlled drug that did not have the effect that the substance could no longer be a drug analogue of a controlled drug, and vice versa.
	
	
	On and from 28 May 2013, the effect of the amendments to the Code was that the separate lists of controlled drugs and of border controlled drugs hitherto found in s 314 of the Code were moved into the Regulations, no doubt for ease of amendment to the content of the respective lists from time to time. Section 314 was repealed and the definitions of border controlled drugs and controlled drugs, respectively, formerly found in s 314 were amended and inserted into ss 301.4 and 301.1.
	
	
	Following the May 2013 amendments there continued to be two separate lists, of controlled drugs and of border controlled drugs respectively, albeit now contained in the Regulations. However, there is now only a single provision giving the meaning of a drug analogue (that being s 301.9).
	
	
	The Crown refers to statements made in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious Drugs, Identity Crime and Other Measures) Bill 2012 (Cth) that s 301.9 was to replace the existing drug analogue provisions in ss 314.1(2) and 314.4(2) of the Code and that s 301.9(2) “is consistent with the existing provisions for drug analogues in the Criminal Code”.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the amendments were designed to favour flexible responses to new and emerging substances; that the purpose of the provisions was to strengthen the framework of the drug laws with a view to being effective in inhibiting the illicit drug trade; that there was no stated intention to alter the former provisions even though the drug analogue definition was altered; and that the definitions of controlled drug and border controlled drug were newly defined expressly to include in the definition of each the concept of an analogue of a listed controlled drug or border controlled drug, respectively.
	


Submissions

Crown


	
	The Crown’s primary position is that, read in context with s 301.9(1), s 301.9(2) is to be construed such that a drug analogue of a listed controlled drug does not include a substance that is itself a listed controlled drug and a drug analogue of a listed border controlled drug does not include substance that is itself a listed border controlled drug.
	
	
	In other words, it argues that the word “or” in s 301.9(2) is to be read distributively. The Crown thus submits that the presence of a substance on one list continues (as was the case prior to the amendments) to have no bearing on its status as a drug analogue of a substance appearing on the other list.
	
	
	The Crown acknowledges that in construing the legislation the Court must begin with the text of the statute and that the clear meaning of the text cannot be displaced by extrinsic material or historical considerations (referring to Alcan (NT) Alumina Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Territory Revenue [2009] HCA 41; (2009) 239 CLR 27) but says that the ordinary and grammatical sense of the word “or”, having regard to its context and the relevant legislative purpose, means that s 301.9(2) has the meaning for which it contends. The Crown submits that the legislative intent is clear when proper regard is had to the context in which s 301.9(2) appears and that the use of “or” plainly refers to what are still two entirely separate lists of proscribed drugs in respect of two separate classes of offences.
	
	
	Reliance is placed on the recognition in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; (1998) 194 CLR 355 (at [69]-[70]) that the primary object of statutory construction is to construe the relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute and that a legislative instrument must be construed on the prima facie basis that its provisions are intended to give effect to harmonious goals.
	
	
	The Crown’s alternative argument, if its primary contention not be accepted, is that there is an overriding obligation on the Court, reinforced by ss 15AA and 15AB(1)(b)(ii) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) to interpret the legislation in a way that makes sense (citing Bailey v Director-General, Department of Natural Resources NSW [2015] NSWCA 318 (at [44], per Basten JA, Gleeson and Leeming JJA agreeing) and Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 26; (1981) 147 CLR 297 (at 320-321)).
	
	
	The Crown argues that there is no logical reason for the change in the way in which the drugs were listed (i.e., in the Regulations rather than the Code), with corresponding machinery changes being made for the definition of drug analogues, to make any difference as to what it is illegal to import (on the one hand) or to traffic in or manufacture domestically (on the other). It submits that on no rational view could it have been the intention of the legislature to create an interaction between the two lists that had never existed before and, in so doing, to legalise the importation of dangerous substances which it is still illegal to manufacture or to traffic in domestically.
	
	
	In this regard, the Crown says that, on the interpretation accepted by the trial judge, there are now some 55 substances listed as controlled drugs that “overnight” have become legal to import because they are no longer drug analogues of border controlled drugs. The absurdity of the construction for which the respondents contend, and which his Honour accepted, is that a drug which it is illegal to manufacture or traffic in within Australia can now be imported into the country with impunity.
	


The respondents


	
	The respondents, each of whom was separately represented in this Court and before the trial judge, maintain that the construction contended for by the trial judge is correct.
	
	
	Counsel for Ms Peart, Mr Pontello, submits that the ordinary and grammatical sense of the relevant words in s 301.9(2), having regard to their context and the legislative purpose of the amending legislation is as his Honour found. Emphasis is placed on the recognition in Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) v Yuill [1991] HCA 28; (1991) 172 CLR 319 at 340 that “those who are subject to the law’s commands are entitled to conduct themselves on the basis that those commands have meaning and effect according to ordinary grammar and usage”.
	
	
	Mr Pontello notes that the stated purpose of the amending legislation was to strengthen the Commonwealth’s serious drug offences framework and to ensure that the framework remains up to date and effective in combating the illicit drug trade. He points out that the amending legislation greatly increased the number of different substances listed as controlled drugs (from 15 to 249), noting that the stated purpose of so doing was to permit certain substances covered by the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, or drug analogues of those substances, to be treated as controlled drugs. He also notes that there was no similar statement of purpose in relation to the (lesser in number) increase in the substances listed as border controlled drugs. From this, it is suggested that the legislature may have decided to place greater emphasis on drug trafficking than on drug importing. (It is also suggested by Mr Pontello that “mere importation, without more, of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances has little detrimental effect on the community” and that the “real evil” lies in its sale, distribution and consumption.)
	
	
	Reliance is placed (both by Mr Pontello and by Counsel for Mr Sorokin, Mr Ozen) on the existence of the separate (not identical) lists of controlled drugs and border controlled drugs. Mr Pontello submits, hardly controversially, that it is for Parliament to determine those substances that it will be illegal to import and those (not necessarily identical) substances in which it will be illegal to traffic. He notes that had the legislature intended the lists to be identical it would presumably have included a single list of substances with respect to border controlled and controlled drugs.
	
	
	Mr Pontello submits that the text of the subsection, as construed by the trial judge, does not lead to a result that is absurd or unreasonable. In that regard, reference is made to two matters: the highly scientific and broad compass of the definition of drug analogue and the broad terms of the definition of “traffics”.
	
	
	As to the scientific nature of the definition of drug analogue, Mr Pontello submits that the legislature recognised that certain substances will be a drug analogue of two or more listed serious drugs (referring to ss 301.10, 301.11 and 301.12 of the Code). He submits that, absent expert scientific evidence, the Court should exercise caution in reaching any conclusion that, as a result of the enactment of the amending legislation, it ceased to be illegal to import a large number of substances (as the Crown has submitted) . It is postulated, for example, that the drug the subject of counts 1 and 2 on the indictment may be a drug analogue of a border controlled drug not appearing on the list of controlled drugs and that scientific opinion may differ on this.
	
	
	As to the breadth of the definition of “traffics”, which includes mere possession with the intent of selling any of the substance (s 302.1(1)(e)), it is submitted that there will be many cases where it will be possible to prosecute an offender for trafficking a controlled drug that the offender imported even though, because of s 301.9(2), the offender could not be guilty of an importation offence. Mr Pontello notes in this regard that the maximum penalties for trafficking in a controlled drug are the same as for importing a border controlled drug for any given quantity.
	
	
	Mr Pontello accepts that consideration of the extrinsic material referred to by the Crown would be permitted if the Court is of the view that the ordinary meaning of s 301.9(2) leads to an unreasonable result but submits that nothing in that material warrants any change to the ordinary meaning of the words used in the legislation. In that regard, he submits that concepts such as similarity and consistency do not equate to the provisions in question being the same.
	
	
	In essence, Mr Pontello argues that the meaning contended for by the Crown requires the impermissible reading of words into the statute. He submits that it is not for the Court to “extend” a statute merely because (if that be the case) the Court accepts that the legislature has acted inadvertently and produced an unintended consequence; and that this is particularly so where the issue of the liberty of the subject is at stake. It is submitted that the purposive approach to the construction of a statute does not justify expanding the scope of a criminal offence beyond its textual limits. Reference is made in this regard to what was said in Re Bolton; Ex Parte Beane [1987] HCA 12; (1987) 162 CLR 514 at 518 per Mason CJ, Wilson and Dawson JJ.
	
	
	Reference is also made to Saeed v Minister of Immigration and Citizenship [2010] HCA 23; (2010) 241 CLR 252 where French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ said (at [31]):
	


Statements as to legislative intention made in explanatory memoranda or by Ministers, however clear or emphatic, cannot overcome the need to carefully consider the words of the statute to ascertain its meaning.


	
	Ultimately, the position of Ms Peart is that the words of the section do not permit a construction other than that reached by the trial judge and that it is not sufficient to point to the general purpose of the legislation at the expense of the actual text of the legislation, the latter being controlling in the task of statutory construction.
	
	
	Mr Ozen adopts the submissions made on behalf of Ms Peart and argues that the Crown’s position constitutes an invitation to “a radical degree of judicial activism” which would represent “an unwarranted encroachment on the prerogative of the legislature” in order to “fix” a problem or assume that the legislation reads in the way the Court might think preferable.
	
	
	Emphasis is placed on the existence of the two separate lists as compelling a conclusion that the legislature envisaged situations where it would be illegal to deal with a particular drug in one way but not in another way.
	
	
	As a textual matter, Mr Ozen submitted that there is significance in the use of commas in s 301.9(1), and their absence in s 301.9(2), as indicating that the legislature had not overlooked the existence of separate lists. It is submitted that the legislative intention disclosed by subsection (2) is that there should be uniformity between controlled and border controlled drugs as to what constitutes an analogue; i.e., that the definition of an analogue covers the same listed drugs with respect to controlled or border controlled drugs.
	


Crown’s response


	
	In response to the submission made for Ms Peart as to the lack of any scientific expert opinion, the Crown sought leave at the hearing to read an affidavit sworn 2 December 2012 of Nathan Green, to provide expert evidence to support the proposition that the effect of his Honour’s interpretation was that it has ceased to be illegal to import 55 substances (including MDMC). That affidavit was read, over the objection of Mr Ozen on the basis that it could have been adduced at the hearing before the trial judge. It was submitted by Mr Ozen that in any event it did not address the issue raised against the Crown’s absurdity argument. It is not necessary to rely on the information provided in this affidavit for the conclusion I have reached as to the proper construction of the provision.
	
	
	As to the propositions put for Ms Peart that the Crown is asking the Court to extend or expand the legislation and for Mr Sorokin that a radical degree of judicial activism is being invited, the Crown emphasises that its primary position is that the ordinary meaning of the section, read in context and with regard to its legislative purpose, is that for which the Crown contends. The Crown points out that so reading s 301.9(2) does not involve an “expansion” of the list of prohibited drugs; rather, that section operates as a machinery provision being an exception to a definition. The Crown emphasises that the only change being made by the introduction of the amending legislation was to the pathway by which the illegal nature of a substance may be proved (by comparison with a listed controlled or border controlled drug if the substance is a drug analogue or by reference to the list once the substance was listed in its own right).
	
	
	Finally, insofar as reference was made in the respective respondents’ submissions to the effect that it was for Parliament to rectify any inadvertent consequences of the amending legislation, the Crown noted that the legislature is presently moving to amend the legislation in order to address the construction that has been placed on the legislation but did not suggest that this was a matter that could affect the interpretation to be placed on the legislation as it currently stands. I have not taken that into account.
	


Determination


	
	There can be little doubt but that, when s 301.9(2) is read in isolation, the ordinary meaning of the words of the section (“does not include a substance that is itself a listed controlled drug or a listed border controlled drug”) would be that for which the respondents contend. However, there is also no doubt that the subsection must be read in context.
	
	
	Once s 301.9(2) is read with s 301.9(1), its meaning must be that for which the Crown contends. There are two textual reasons for that conclusion.
	
	
	First, the term a “drug analogue” in the opening words of s 301.9(2) clearly imports the meaning given to that term in s 301.9(1), in which a clear distinction is drawn between a drug analogue of a listed controlled drug and a drug analogue of a listed border controlled drug.
	
	
	Section 301.9(2) is therefore addressing an exception to the definition of “drug analogue” for two separate purposes: the definition of “a listed border controlled drug” and the definition of a “listed controlled drug”. That indicates that a distributive reading should be accorded to the two types of listed drugs that are linked by the word “or” in that subsection.
	
	
	Second, there is the repetition of “listed” before each of “controlled drug” and “border controlled drug”. That makes clear that the focus is on two separate lists of drugs.
	
	
	I accept that the absence of commas in the phrase “itself a listed controlled drug or a listed border controlled drug” as it appears in s 301.9(2), in contrast with the use of commas in the corresponding phrase in s 301.9(1) could indicate that the draftsperson was not drawing such a distinction. However, the clear separation between a listed controlled drug and a listed border controlled drug at the commencement of s 301.9(1), when incorporated by way of the definition into the introductory words of s 301.9(2), suggests to me that rather than incorporating a further unwieldy definition into the subsection the draftsperson was using the concluding words of that subsection as a shorthand reference back to the relevant applicable list.
	
	
	The maintenance of separate and distinct listed drugs for the separate and distinct offences contextually supports the Crown’s interpretation. Such a construction is also supported by reference to the logic discernible in the exclusion of a drug analogue that has become a listed drug from the definition of the particular list in question. In other words, it makes sense that if a drug analogue of, say, a controlled drug is placed on the list of controlled drugs (relevant for the purposes of the domestic trafficking/manufacturing offences) it will cease to be a drug analogue for that class of offence. There could no longer be a need for it to be specified as a drug analogue once it was so listed. However, the same logic does not apply to the exception of a substance that becomes a listed controlled drug from the definition of a drug analogue of a substance on the other and separate list of drugs (for a separate class of offence). I agree with the Crown’s submission that there is simply no logical reason to assume that the legislature intended, by adopting a single definition of drug analogue, that the effect of listing a drug on the list for one class of offences would be that it could no longer be a drug analogue of a substance on the other list for the purpose of an entirely different class of offence.
	
	
	I agree that it is not permissible for a court, by a process of statutory interpretation in effect to substitute its own view of what should be the preferable ambit of legislation or to take it upon itself to re-write legislation in a way that corrects what is thought to be an inadvertent consequence of infelicitous language in a statute. However, it has been noted (albeit in other contexts) that the word “or” can be read in different senses (disjunctive, conjunctive or a hybrid thereof) (see for example the discussion in Re the Minister for Works; ex parte Duffy [2002] WASCA 295 at [22]-[23] per Burchett AJ, with whom Murray and Anderson JJ agreed).
	
	
	I do not consider that reading “or”, in the present context and having regard to the legislative purpose of strengthening – not weakening – the drug enforcement framework, as having a distributive function involves an impermissible re-writing of the section. True it is, that the section could more clearly have been drafted (say by including the word “respectively” or the words “as the case may be” at the conclusion of the section) or the legislation could have continued the former practice of having a separate (though essentially identical) definition of drug analogue for each of the respective lists. By the same token, had the legislature intended the result for which the respondents contend it would have been a simple matter to insert the word “either” before “a listed” or, which would have been even clearer, to say “itself listed either as a controlled drug or a border controlled drug or both”.
	
	
	Had I been of the contrary view, then I would nevertheless also have been of the view that such an outcome produces a manifestly absurd result, and would have resolved the ambiguity arising from the use of the word “or” in this context by reading the subsection so as to give it a distributive function by reference to the separate lists.
	
	
	It is not, in my opinion, an answer to the Crown’s absurdity argument to point to the separate lists and say that the legislature contemplated that there might be different drugs on different lists. It does not follow from that that the legislature should be taken to have intended that drugs on one list could not at the same time be drug analogues of a substance on another list.
	
	
	Nor is it an answer to say that there may be drugs the chemical composition of which is open to scientific debate. The submission for Ms Peart to that effect (i.e., that the drug the subject of counts 1 and 2 might be scientifically analysed as a drug analogue of some other border controlled drug that was not listed as a controlled drug and hence, if I understand the submission correctly, would remain a substance that it was illegal to import) seems to be inconsistent with the basis on which counts 1 and 2 on the indictments were quashed. In other words, if MDMC was scientifically analysed as a drug analogue of some other listed border controlled drug – not Methcathinone – that was not a listed controlled drug, then at most what was required was an amendment to those counts of the indictment, not them being quashed. In any event it appears no more than a matter of speculation and there is no warrant for this Court to engage in some form of chemical analysis of the respective drugs.
	
	
	I have not found it necessary, to reach the above conclusion, to have regard to the number of drugs that would now become legal to import (but would remain illegal to traffic in or manufacture). The fact that MDMC is apparently such a drug of itself sufficiently illustrates the absurdity of the outcome if the legislation is interpreted in the way for which the respondents contend. Nor have I placed weight on the extrinsic materials, beyond noting that there was no suggestion made at the time of passage of the amending legislation that a radical change from the existing operation of the definition of drug analogues was there contemplated.
	
	
	As to the suggestion that the “real evil” lies in the sale, distribution or consumption of controlled drugs rather than the importation of substances that would up until 28 May 2013 have been illegal to import because they were sufficiently similar in composition to have been recognised as analogues, I do not find this a compelling argument. Insofar as the legislature has specified the same penalties for the respective offences it is hard to draw any conclusion as to where the legislature considers the “real evil” lies and it makes no sense to contemplate the legal importation of drugs which it is illegal to manufacture or in which it is illegal to traffic domestically.
	
	
	For the above reasons, I am of the view that the construction for which the Crown contends is correct and that the orders quashing counts 1 and 2 in the indictments should be set aside.
	


Orders


	
	I would make the following orders:
	



	
	Allow the appeal.
	
	
	Set aside the order made by Toner SC DCJ on 9 September 2015 quashing counts 1 and 2 on the indictment presented against Kylie Anne Peart and Daniel Alexander Sorokin on 8 September 2015.
	



	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Ward JA.
	
	
	FAGAN J: The word “analogue” means, in ordinary English, something having an analogy with something else. It would not make sense to speak of “an analogue” without more. An analogue must be of something. The word describes a dependent entity: reference to a thing as an analogue only has meaning if the other thing to which it bears analogy is identified.
	
	
	In s 301.9(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth) where the expression “drug analogue” is defined, the legislature has used the word “analogue” in a meaningful and conventional sense. The sub section does not speak of a “drug analogue” at large or standing alone. It speaks of a “drug analogue of a listed controlled drug, or a listed border controlled drug” (underlining added). “Drug analogue” in sub section (1) thus refers to a thing which has an analogy with “a listed controlled drug, or a listed controlled border drug”.
	
	
	Sub section (2) of section 301.9(2) reads as follows:
	


“(2) However, a drug analogue does not include a substance that is itself a listed controlled drug or a listed border controlled drug.”

Here, the expression “drug analogue” is unaccompanied by any words to convey the meaning of something. But as an analogue must always be of something, it is necessary to identify what Parliament intended in that regard. It would be wrong to attribute to the legislature that it has used the expression “drug analogue” in sub s (2) in a meaningless fashion, without reference to anything to which the analogy is borne. One does not have to look any further than sub s (1) to find what Parliament intended. When the two sub-sections are considered together it becomes clear that the expression “drug analogue” in sub s (2) has been used, as Ward JA has said, by way of shorthand for the full expression in sub s (1) “drug analogue of a listed controlled drug, or a listed border controlled drug” (underlining added).


	
	With the full expression inserted in sub s (2), it reads in the following sense (with the inserted words underlined): However, a drug analogue of a listed controlled drug, or a listed border controlled drug does not include a substance that is itself a listed controlled drug or a listed border controlled drug.
	
	
	Thus understood, with the shorthand expression “drug analogue” expanded to its full intended meaning, the distributive reading of sub s (2) for which the Crown contends becomes compelling. That is, a reading of the sub section in the sense that a drug analogue of a listed controlled drug, or a listed border controlled drug does not include a substance that is itself a listed controlled drug or a listed controlled border drug respectively (or, as the case may be). That interpretation follows from the words of the section themselves once it is recognised that the expression “drug analogue” is an abbreviation of the concept spelled out in full in sub section (1). This distributive interpretation is strongly further supported by the considerations of legislative history and of the absurdity of the results which would flow from the respondent’s alternative interpretation – matters which have been elaborated by Ward JA.
	
	
	I agree with Ward JA’s reasons and with the orders which her Honour proposes.

2702278,R v Rose [2015] NSWCCA 318,"Judgment


	
	WARD JA: The respondent, Mr Rose, pleaded guilty at Queanbeyan Local Court on 10 April 2015 to one count of robbery armed with an offensive weapon contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). That offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment. No standard non-parole period applies.
	
	
	On 25 June 2015, Mr Rose was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 3 years and 3 months to date from 11 October 2014 and to expire on 10 January 2018, with a non-parole period of 21 months to expire on 10 July 2016.
	
	
	The Crown had acknowledged that Mr Rose was entitled to a utilitarian discount of 25%. The Crown had also conceded that a finding of special circumstances for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) was appropriate.
	
	
	The Director of Public Prosecutions appeals pursuant to s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against the sentence imposed upon the respondent on the ground that it is manifestly inadequate.
	


Facts


	
	At the sentencing hearing on 18 June 2015, an agreed statement of facts was tendered. The relevant facts (as drawn from that agreed statement unless otherwise indicated) may be summarised as follows.
	
	
	Mr Rose was 23 years old at the time of the offence. The two victims of the armed robbery (Mr and Mrs Westwood) were aged 76 years and 74 years respectively. They lived on a 30 acre property at Bywong. There was a house and a number of sheds on the property. The shed nearest the residence contained a firearms cabinet as well as a number of cabinets containing ammunition. Securely stored in the firearms cabinet were a .22 calibre bolt action rifle and a 12 gauge double barrel shotgun.
	
	
	On 14 September 2014, Mr Rose drove with his co-offender (Mr Brown), in Mr Brown’s car, with Mr Brown’s then girlfriend (Ms Pang) to Bywong, with the intention of breaking into the shed to steal the firearms. (I interpose here to note that there was some inconsistency between this stated fact and Mr Rose’s evidence at the sentencing hearing. In the course of that evidence, he agreed that he set out to go to the property and find guns but he also said that he did not “intend on choosing the property” and that he went that way and “just ended up out there”; denied that he had directed others to the address of the property and said they “went out that way”; and said that Mr Brown told him his boss lived on a particular road “so that’s where we started”. He said he did not know when guns “came into the plan”. Nevertheless, he also gave evidence that he knew the property because it had previously belonged to his grandfather and agreed it had not been selected at random.)
	
	
	Mr Rose was dropped near the property. The other two drove away and parked nearby, waiting for about an hour and a half, and then drove to the boundary fence of the Bywong property parking the vehicle with a direct line of sight to the residence and the shed containing the firearm and ammunition cabinets.
	
	
	Meanwhile, Mr Rose entered the shed at the rear of the property. Mr Westwood heard his dogs barking and went into the shed. He saw Mr Rose crouched at the rear of the shed. Mr Rose was holding a serrated knife approximately 8-9 inches long. (The Crown case was that Mr Rose also had with him a claw hammer. Although this is not referred to in the statement of facts tendered to the sentencing judge, in evidence Mr Rose said that he had had a little crow bar (a “jimmy bar thing”) with him.)
	
	
	Mr Rose began to approach Mr Westwood who, fearing for his safety, took hold of a nearby metal frame and placed it between himself and Mr Rose. Mr Rose struck the metal frame, which hit Mr Westwood on the forehead and knocked him to the ground. Mr Westwood got to his feet in a dazed state. Mr Rose repeatedly said “I'm not gunna hurt you” but then went into a rage, saying repeatedly “I want your guns”. Mr Rose was alternately agitated and then calmed down. When agitated he was very aggressive. He threatened to kill Mr Westwood and his wife.
	
	
	Mr Westwood attempted to pacify Mr Rose by asking him into the dwelling. Mr Rose was at the outside corner of the house. Mr Westwood called his wife to come outside and asked her to get Mr Rose a glass of water and a sandwich to calm him down. Mr Rose kept asking for the guns. Every time he took a drink of water he would wipe the glass clean.
	
	
	After finishing the food, Mr Rose became agitated again. He told the victims to go inside the house. They heard the windows of the shed smash. Mr Rose again demanded the guns. Both victims told Mr Rose they were not in possession of guns but Mr Rose said that he knew they were and demanded access to them.
	
	
	Mr Rose told the victims that he wanted the phone cut off. Mr Westwood told Mr Rose to leave his tools outside and took him inside. Mr Westwood pulled the house phone from the wall and showed Mr Rose that he had done so. Mr Rose demanded the victims’ mobile phones but did not take them. He continued to threaten to kill the victims and cut their throats.
	
	
	Fearing for their lives, Mr and Mrs Westwood provided access to the shed and gave Mr Rose the gun safe keys. On gaining access to the shed Mr Rose made mobile phone contact with a person and said “[w]e’re right. I’ve got the keys, I’m right. I’m in”. (Pausing here, I note that Senior Counsel for Mr Rose, Ms Loukas SC, emphasised in the course of argument that the statement of facts did not state that the victims heard Mr Rose’s telephone conversation. There was no explanation as to where that information could otherwise have come from. It was not the subject of evidence from Mr Rose at the sentencing hearing.)
	
	
	Mr and Mrs Westwood escaped from the residence in fear of their lives, running through paddocks to a neighbouring property. Mr Rose gained access to the gun cabinet; removed the firearms, ammunition and accessories which he placed in a wheelbarrow; and took them to Mr Brown who was waiting nearby. Police were contacted when Mr and Mrs Westwood reached the neighbouring property. By the time that the police attended the property a short time later the offenders were gone and the firearms, ammunition and accessories had been removed.
	
	
	Following police investigations, the police executed a search warrant at a house in the ACT on 23 September 2014, recovering the .22 calibre rifle, ammunition and accessories and locating the barrel of a shotgun and the butt of a rifle that had been sawn from a firearm. Ms Pang was at that house at the time with another person. They were both arrested. Ms Pang provided an electronically recorded interview and statement to the police implicating Mr Brown and Mr Rose.
	
	
	Mr Rose was arrested in the ACT on 1 October 2014 and was extradited to NSW. On entry into custody at Queanbeyan, Mr Rose declined legal advice and participated in an electronically recorded interview where he made full admissions in relation to his involvement in the matter. He indicated that he attended the location assuming that the residence would have firearms given that it was a property; and that, at the time of the incident, he was using the prohibited drug “ice” and was suffering from “withdrawals”.
	


Sentencing hearing


	
	At the sentencing hearing it was conceded by Mr Rose’s solicitor that the offence occurred when Mr Rose was on conditional liberty relating to charges of a similar nature, although there was some uncertainty as to the status of the particular charges in respect of which he was on conditional liberty at the time.
	
	
	A pre-sentence report dated 5 June 2015 was tendered in which reference was made to Mr Rose’s family’s ongoing support and his care of his young disabled sister. He was assessed as at medium risk of re-offending. His identified needs were alcohol/drug problems and emotional/personal problems. It was considered that he would benefit from a period of supervision by Community Corrections, including residential rehabilitation. He was assessed as unsuitable for a community service order due to unresolved drug issues.
	
	
	A psychological report from Dr Magor-Blatch was also tendered, in which it was noted that Mr Rose’s drug dependency had been for a relatively short period of time. Dr Magor-Blatch considered that Mr Rose had every chance of a positive and strong recovery. She acknowledged the seriousness of the offence and the trauma caused to the victims and that the court might decide on a custodial sentence. However, she recommended that treatment be considered for Mr Rose and that, if this include residential rehabilitation, it take place within a residential therapeutic community with a record of success in working with stimulant use dependency. She noted that Mr Rose had detoxified from the effects of substance abuse but that this only represented a “gateway to treatment”.
	
	
	Character references were also tendered.
	
	
	Mr Rose gave evidence at the sentencing hearing. In the course of that evidence he conceded that it was not true (contrary to what he had told the writer of the pre-sentence report) that he had selected the premises at which the armed robbery took place at random. Rather, he had selected it because it used to be “our property”, i.e., that of his grandfather and mother. As noted earlier, he said that he did not intend on choosing that property; he went out that way and just ended up out there; and that he “thought I knew the place I could get in and out and it didn’t look like anyone was home”.
	
	
	Mr Rose acknowledged that he was trying to break into the gun cabinet in the shed. He said that he did not know why “we” (presumably he and his co-accused) were thinking to steal guns or why he wanted to steal anything. He agreed that he had told police he had fears for his safety but that, being on drugs, he did not think about it properly.
	
	
	Mr Rose said that at the date of the offence he had been awake for two or two and a half weeks on ice (a point or two a day) and had consumed ice on the morning of the offence.
	
	
	Mr Rose said that he did not intend to hurt the victims. He had read the victim impact statements and he said that he understood that the victims were devastated by the incident. He had told the writer of the pre-sentence report that he had made an application for restorative justice, though he did not know what he could say to the victims to help them move on - just to say that he knows how he made them feel and that they were the same age as his grandfather. (A copy of a letter he has written (but not sent) to the Westwoods was part of the material before the Court on the hearing of the present application.)
	
	
	By reference to the transcript, it appears that Mr Rose became emotional in the witness box when asked about a distressing event which had occurred a few years earlier (a motorbike accident in 2011 in which his brother suffered an acquired brain injury) but said that that was not the reason for him taking drugs.
	
	
	Mr Rose expressed his motivation to rehabilitate himself and said he had abstained from using drugs during his incarceration. He was willing to undertake a residential drug rehabilitation program.
	
	
	Mr Rose also gave evidence that he had provided information to the Australian Federal Police in relation to the guns, that being information as to location of the guns. There was little detail as to the nature of that assistance beyond Mr Rose saying he had spoken with a Canberra police officer, to whom he had given the phone number of a person with knowledge of the location of a gun, and with two members of the Australian Federal Police. He agreed that he was well aware of the danger of guns in the community. He accepted that he had a knife and a “little crow bar” with him. He knew that the victims were old and little and he did not doubt that they were terrified and that they remained terrified.
	


Remarks on sentence


	
	The sentencing judge, having summarised the facts, the evidence at the sentence hearing, various aspects of Dr Magor-Blatch’s psychological report (including that testing of Mr Rose indicated diagnoses of substance use disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and persistent depressive disorder), and the victim impact statements, summarised the submissions made for Mr Rose and the Crown, respectively.
	
	
	His Honour concluded (at [41]) that the case fitted within the elements set out in the guideline judgment of R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [162], listing seven matters in that regard, including (at (iii)) that there was a “limited” degree of planning and (at (vi)) that a “small amount” had been taken.
	
	
	His Honour noted (at [43]) that the guideline judgment took into account a guilty plea of “limited value”, which he understood to involve a late plea of guilty, whereas in the present case (as noted above) the Crown had acknowledged that a 25% discount was warranted.
	
	
	At [44], his Honour expressed his satisfaction that the offending was the product of Mr Rose’s addiction to methylamphetamine and said that, while that did not constitute a mitigating factor, the impulsiveness involved in the conduct might be regarded as a mitigating factor in the circumstances, though also noting that there was “some planning” involved (in terms of the selection of the property and the purpose for which the crime was committed, namely, to obtain guns against a perceived threat).
	
	
	His Honour concluded that the objective seriousness of the offending fell just below the mid-range of offences pursuant to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act but accepted that the offence was still very serious and a terrifying incident for the victims ([45]).
	
	
	His Honour accepted that the offences had had a substantial impact on the victims ([46]), noting that the Crown did not submit that this would amount to an aggravating factor for the purposes of s 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act ([47]). His Honour (at [49]) made clear that, by this, he was indicating that he had taken the victim impact statements into account but not so as to aggravate Mr Rose’s culpability.
	
	
	It was accepted by his Honour that Mr Rose had not consumed any drugs while in custody and that he had good prospects of rehabilitation back into the community ([50]). His Honour noted that there were significant subjective factors to be taken into account, namely that Mr Rose was supported by his family and community; had already undertaken some steps to rehabilitate and address his drug problem; and was still young ([51]).
	
	
	His Honour then stated (at [52]) that he had had regard to the principles of totality, proportionality and parity set out in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [45]. No indication was given as to how those principles had been factored into the sentencing process in the present case.
	
	
	His Honour concluded that no sentence other than imprisonment was appropriate but also that, having found special circumstances, a long period of supervised rehabilitation (including residential rehabilitation) was appropriate to ensure Mr Rose’s return to a meaningful and productive life. His Honour then proceeded to set a non-parole period of 21 months’ imprisonment with a total term of imprisonment of 3 years and 3 months. (Having regard to the 25% discount considered appropriate, the undiscounted sentence must therefore have been 4 years and 4 months.)
	


Appeal


	
	The sole ground of appeal in the notice of appeal filed on 3 July 2015 was that the sentence is manifestly inadequate. In written submissions, the Crown has identified two particular matters by reason of which it contends that his Honour erred in the exercise of his sentencing discretion leading to a manifestly inadequate sentence, those being:
	



	
	The approach adopted to the guideline judgment in Henry.
	
	
	The failure properly to consider the respondent's conditional liberty status at the time of the offending.
	


Evidence


	
	At the hearing in this Court, the Crown relied on an affidavit of a solicitor in the Court of Criminal Appeal Unit of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for New South Wales (Ms Meagan Betteridge) sworn 12 October 2015 relating to an offence in custody when Mr Rose was disciplined for the offence of possess offensive weapon or instrument and the punishment that was imposed. As to that evidence, Mr Rose has in turn sworn an affidavit in which he acknowledges that he received a jail charge for possession of a knife but deposes that he did not know the knife was there (it was found in a hole in his mattress); as well as to his training and occupation in jail and his case plan for parole. In the event of re-sentencing, I would not take into account the offence in custody charge on that basis.
	
	
	Mr Rose’s solicitor has affirmed an affidavit annexing a letter of apology written by Mr Rose and addressed to Mr and Mrs Westwood (though not sent) as well as copies of training certificates obtained by Mr Rose while in custody. Mr Rose’s mother (Ms Causon) has also sworn an affidavit, filed 9 November 2015, deposing to the family support for Mr Rose and to Mr Rose’s devastation about the offence he committed; as well as his stress at the appeal hearing.
	


Submissions


	
	The Crown accepts that on a manifest inadequacy appeal it is required to establish that the sentence imposed was unreasonable or plainly unjust in a sentencing environment where there is no single ""correct"" sentence, and judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with the application of proper principle and consistency of approach (referring to Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]; Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at 538 [58]).
	
	
	The Crown also accepts that the primary purpose of a Crown appeal against sentence is to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5D Criminal Appeal Act. In that regard it submits that guidance is required for sentencing judges as to the proper approach to and application of the guideline judgment (Henry).
	
	
	The Crown points to the following aspects of the offending, which it submits leads to the conclusion that the Henry guideline judgment was not correctly applied and the sentence in this case was manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	First, the Crown submits that, unlike the position in Henry (at [162(iii)]), the degree of planning was much more than “limited”, in that the victims’ property was targeted because Mr Rose knew it had a gun safe and because it was isolated. It is submitted that even though Mr Rose was drug affected the offence was not impulsive, it being an agreed fact that he and Mr Brown spent some time discussing the offence that morning and that the co-offenders had dropped Mr Rose off at the property some one and a half hours before returning.
	
	
	As to the degree of planning involved, Ms Loukas submits that it was open to his Honour to conclude that this was limited. First, she points to the evidence of Mr Rose’s sleep deprivation and drug use, which it is submitted evidenced a clear inability to engage in planning that was “much more than limited”. Second, it is submitted that Mr Rose’s planning related only to a break, enter and steal offence not the offence of armed robbery (in that his evidence was that it did not appear that anyone was at home as there were no cars parked on the property and he thought he could get in and out of the property without detection). In those circumstances, it is submitted that it was open to his Honour to find that the selection of the property, possession of house breaking implements, and presence of others waiting nearby involved planning that was not more than limited.
	
	
	As to the reliance placed by the Crown on the discussion that it was agreed had taken place that morning between Mr Brown and Mr Rose (in the absence of Ms Pang), Ms Loukas points out that the agreed fact was that they were “presumably” discussing the matter. It is submitted for Mr Rose that that presumption could not support a finding beyond reasonable doubt that there was “much more than limited planning” as the Crown has asserted.
	
	
	The second matter to which the Crown points, is that Mr Rose was in company with two others. The Crown submits that this was known to the victims because, during the offence, Mr Rose called his co-offender to tell him that he had gained access to the shed. The Crown maintains that this was a serious aggravating factor for the purposes of s 21A(2)(e) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	Ms Loukas submits that it is not possible to conclude that the victims were aware that co-offenders were nearby simply by reference to the making of mobile phone contact. It is submitted that an aggravating factor must be proven beyond reasonable doubt (citing The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [24]) and that such a finding would not have been open to the sentencing judge on the evidence before him.
	
	
	Third, the Crown emphasises that there was both actual violence and the very real threat of serious violence. It is noted that the victims’ vulnerability was increased by the cutting off of the phone line and that they were subjected to a lengthy ordeal from which they escaped by running across the paddocks to a neighbour's property, knowing that the respondent was now armed with guns and ammunition.
	
	
	As to this, Ms Loukas notes that his Honour set out the agreed facts in relation to the violence and threats of violence and made reference to the impact of the violence on the victims. It is submitted that there was no failure on his Honour’s part in this respect.
	
	
	Fourth, the Crown notes that the offence was aggravated by reason of it having been committed in the home of the victims (s 21A(2)(eb) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.)
	
	
	Again, Ms Loukas points out that his Honour referred to the victims being in a vulnerable position, his Honour having noted that they were “an elderly couple in their own home, at a remote location”. It was said that this was taken into account in the application of the guideline judgment and for it to have been taken into account again separately would raise the risk of double counting (R v Street [2005] NSWCCA 139 at [35]).
	
	
	Fifth, the Crown submits that the goods taken (a .22 calibre rifle, a 12 gauge shotgun, a scope and numerous rounds of ammunition) did not equate to a “small amount” and points out that they were extremely dangerous goods the theft of which was a matter of grave concern.
	
	
	Ms Loukas notes that at various parts of the remarks on sentence his Honour referred to the taking of the guns ([5], [6], [9], [18], [21] and [38]) and submits that his Honour properly took this into account.
	
	
	The Crown argues that his Honour did not properly take into account the above matters when concluding that the offence “clearly” fitted within the elements set out in the Henry guideline judgment and in imposing a head sentence that was at the lower end of the range described in Henry for a typical offender (that range being a head sentence of 4-5 years). In effect complaint is made that his Honour adopted a mechanical or formulaic approach to the assessment of whether the present case fell within the guideline judgment.
	
	
	The Crown also submits that the fact that Mr Rose was on conditional liberty for an armed robbery in company at the time of the offending demonstrated a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law and that this was a significant aggravating factor that greatly increased the need for personal deterrence (referring to Yousif v R [2014] NSWCCA 180 at [30]). Ms Loukas, in response, maintains that Mr Rose being on conditional liberty at the time was a matter taken into account by his Honour.
	
	
	For Mr Rose, an additional factor raised is the assistance given by him to locate the stolen guns. Ms Loukas notes that the evidence Mr Rose gave (the nub of which has been summarised at [28] above) as to his assistance in providing information as to the location of guns was not disputed by the Crown at first instance. She submits that this warranted a reduction in the sentence in accordance with s 23(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	


Determination


	
	There can be no doubt, in my opinion, that his Honour erred in characterising the subject matter of the theft as a “small amount” in the sense in which it appears that expression was used in the Henry guideline judgment (where the Court was considering armed robbery offences to obtain money to feed a drug addiction). Although only two guns were taken, on any view of the matter they were dangerous weapons and their theft (together with ammunition) was a serious issue. This aspect of the offending was well outside the notion of a “small amount”, as Ms Loukas in effect conceded. His Honour therefore erred insofar as he treated this as part of the elements of the offending that his Honour considered brought the matter clearly within the guideline judgment.
	
	
	I am also persuaded that his Honour erred in concluding that the planning was “limited”. Notwithstanding Mr Rose’s drug-affected state and his inconsistent evidence as to when the intention was formed to steal the guns, Mr Rose accepted that he went to the property with the intention of stealing the guns and it was agreed by him that he spent some time with Mr Brown and Ms Pang in the course of the morning during which he and Mr Brown “presumably” discussed the matter. Mr Rose had the forethought to have brought with him not only a crow bar or “jimmy bar type thing” with which to break into the property or the gun safe but also a knife. There was also an element of planning obviously involved in the arrangements pursuant to which he was dropped off at the property and was to be collected there some time later. His Honour’s conclusion that there was some limited degree of planning so as to bring the matter within the Henry guideline judgment is not supported by the evidence.
	
	
	As to the offence being “in company”, what is relevant is the coercive effect of the group. In R v Button; R v Griffen [2002] NSWCCA 159; (2002) 54 NSWLR 455, Kirby J said at [121] that:
	


…There must be such proximity as would enable the inference that the coercive effect of the group operated either to embolden or reassure the offender in committing the crime, or to intimidate the victim into submission.


	
	It must be accepted that if one or both of the victims had heard what it is agreed Mr Rose said to the unidentified person on the other end of the phone this would be expected to have led to the belief that Mr Rose was not acting alone and to have increased their fear. Whether that would necessarily have led them to fear that the co-offender(s) was (or were) in the proximity of the shed is of course another matter.
	
	
	Here, the agreed facts do not expressly record either or both of the victims having overhead the phone conversation and there is some lack of specificity as to the location of the offender and the victims at various points in the chronology of the offence. While it is difficult to see how else that conversation came to be known to the Crown, and hence included in the agreed facts, I would accept that this Court could not conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the victims did hear the conversation.
	
	
	Nevertheless, it may readily be inferred that the fact of the nearby presence of Mr Brown was such as to have emboldened Mr Rose in the offending. Therefore, I consider that the evidence supported a finding that the offence was aggravated by Mr Rose being “in company”, though in circumstances where this does not seem to have been put to his Honour by the Crown as being an aggravating factor it is difficult to say that his Honour erred in not making such a finding.
	
	
	As to his Honour’s characterisation of the other elements referred to in the Henry guideline judgment, although his Honour did make reference to the actual use and threat of serious violence, the vulnerability of the victims, the aggravating factor that the offence took place in the victims’ own home, and the terrifying ordeal that the victims suffered, the conclusion that this offence “clearly” fell within the elements of the guideline judgment is inconsistent with account having properly been taken of those matters and, when coupled with the errors noted above, error in the application of that guideline judgment has been demonstrated.
	
	
	I do not accept that his Honour erred in approaching the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending simply because his Honour did so principally by reference to the factors listed in Henry. Rather, the operative error was in concluding that the offending (having regard to the agreed facts and Mr Rose’s evidence) fell within that guideline judgment.
	
	
	As to the assessment of objective seriousness as being just below the mid-range of offending for this offence, it is difficult to see on the face of his Honour’s reasons that any account was made of the fact that Mr Rose was on conditional liberty at the time of the offending. There was no more than a passing reference to that issue. In my opinion, this was a factor increasing the objective seriousness of the offending since it clearly demonstrated a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law (as Ms Loukas ultimately seems to have conceded) and hence his Honour erred in failing to take that factor properly into account.
	
	
	As to the reduction in sentence that Ms Loukas maintains was warranted for Mr Rose’s assistance in locating the guns, the evidence on that issue was limited. It would have been open to his Honour to have concluded that on the evidence before him the assistance did not warrant any further reduction in the sentence, though it is unclear whether his Honour did in fact take this issue into account.
	
	
	Error having been established in the factual basis on which his Honour applied the Henry guideline judgment and in his assessment of the factors relevant to the objective seriousness of the offending, was the sentence imposed one that was manifestly inadequate? I have concluded that the answer to that question should be “yes”. The objective seriousness of the offending was higher than the offending considered in the Henry guideline judgment. The victims were elderly; they were vulnerable (being in an isolated property and having been forced to cut off their home phone); there was a degree of planning (this was not some spontaneous drug-induced crime); and the property stolen could not be dismissed as a “small amount”. The objective seriousness of the offence was, in my view, above the mid-range for such offences. Mr Rose, though drug-affected and sleep deprived, was capable of understanding the consequences of his actions and his conduct occurred while on conditional liberty for similar offences. The offences occurred while Mr Rose’s co-offender was nearby and, for part of the time, while Mr Brown had a line of sight to the property. His presence must be taken to have had an emboldening effect. There was both actual violence and serious threats of violence. The ordeal was a terrifying one for the victims, taking place in their own home. They escaped in fear for their lives, knowing that Mr Rose by then had access to the guns and ammunition.
	
	
	The fact that Mr Rose was drug-affected does not mitigate the circumstances of his offending nor does it make him a lesser vehicle for general deterrence. The evidence as to Mr Rose’s subjective circumstances similarly does not lessen the need for specific deterrence.
	
	
	Accepting that the discount placed by his Honour on the utilitarian value of Mr Rose’s guilty plea was not inappropriate, and having regard to the evidence as to Mr Rose’s prospects of rehabilitation and the acknowledged need for a finding of special circumstances, I consider that the appropriate sentence should have been not less than 5 years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years.
	


Residual discretion


	
	I turn then to the question whether the Crown has negated any reason why the residual discretion in the exercise of the s 5D jurisdiction (to refuse to intervene) should not be exercised (see Griffiths v The Queen [1977] HCA 44; (1977) 137 CLR 293; Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462; CMB v Attorney-General (NSW) [2015] HCA 9; (2015) 89 ALJR 407 at [36]).
	
	
	The Crown points to the fact that there has been no relevant delay in either the institution of the Crown appeal or the period within which there is likely to be a resolution of the Crown appeal (referring to R v Harris [2015] NSWCCA 81 at [65]), noting that the appeal was filed and served eight days after sentence and that the appeal was listed for hearing (and has, I note, been heard) within 16 weeks of the date of sentence.
	
	
	It is submitted by the Crown that concerns about interfering with Mr Rose’s rehabilitation diminish once it is accepted that any sentence imposed on him will involve a substantial parole period (arising from the extended period of parole that should be imposed pursuant to the finding of special circumstances that the Crown accepts - referring to the discussion in R v Cortese [2013] NSWCCA 148 at [68]-[69]) during which supervision and treatment can occur.
	
	
	The Crown accepts that increasing the non-parole period will cause Mr Rose significant distress but argues that this is the natural consequence that invariably follows from incarceration, whether following sentence at first instance or after a successful Crown appeal.
	
	
	For Mr Rose, it is submitted that the Crown has not discharged its onus in this regard and that the purpose of the appeal and the guidance required can be achieved by a statement of this Court that the sentences imposed were wrong and why they were wrong.
	
	
	Ms Loukas notes that substantial progress has been made towards rehabilitation and submits that re-sentencing Mr Rose will have a negative effect on the progress of his rehabilitation (reference being made to the recognition in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen at [43] that re-sentencing may have an effect on the progress towards an offender’s rehabilitation).
	
	
	In that regard I note that what was said in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen was that “the effect of re-sentencing on progress towards [the offender’s] rehabilitation” is one circumstance which “may”, combined with others (such as delay in the hearing and determination of the appeal and the imminent or past occurrence of the offender’s release on parole or unconditionally) “combine to produce injustice if a Crown appeal is allowed”. It was not suggested that there is a presumption that re-sentencing will negatively affect rehabilitation nor that such a potential effect is determinative of the issue as to whether injustice will result. Furthermore, while his mother has deposed to the stress and anxiety suffered by Mr Rose pending the Crown appeal, there is no similar evidence from Mr Rose to that effect and the appeal has been prosecuted without delay.
	
	
	I consider that the Crown has discharged its onus in relation to the residual discretion not to intervene and that it is important, in the interests of general and specific deterrence and to maintain adequate standards of punishment, to impose an appropriate sentence for what was a very serious offence.
	


Orders


	
	Having regard to the matters referred to above, including the objective seriousness of the offence, the fact that it was committed while Mr Rose was on conditional liberty for a similar offence, the vulnerability of the victims, Mr Rose’s subjective circumstances, and the finding of special circumstances (which warrants a longer period of rehabilitation through a residential program with expertise in dealing with drug addiction), I consider the appropriate orders are as follows:
	



	
	Crown appeal be allowed.
	
	
	Sentence imposed on the respondent on 25 June 2015 be set aside.
	
	
	In its place, the respondent is sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 5 years, commencing on 11 October 2014 and expiring on 10 October 2019, with a non-parole period of 3 years to expire on 10 October 2017.
	
	
	The earliest date upon which the respondent will be eligible for release on parole is 11 October 2017.
	



	
	DAVIES J: I agree with the orders proposed by Ward JA and with her reasons. I also agree with the additional remarks of RS Hulme AJ.
	
	
	RS HULME AJ: I have had the advantage of reading in draft form the reasons for judgment of Ward JA. I agree with the orders proposed by her Honour and, subject to the following remarks, with her Honour’s reasons.
	
	
	There was no reasonable basis upon which the sentencing Judge could have regarded the Respondent’s offence as falling within the R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 guideline and even less for imposing on the Respondent a sentence which, when allowance is made for the Respondent’s plea was right at the bottom of the range of sentences contemplated in that case.
	
	
	Demonstrably what was stolen, a .22 calibre rifle and scope, a 12 gauge double barrel shotgun, a leather ammunition belt and numerous rounds of ammunition cannot be regarded as, or equated with, a “small amount taken”, one of the characteristics of an offence to which the guideline applies.
	
	
	Nor am I able to regard the Respondent’s offence as exhibiting “a limited degree of planning, a second of the characteristics referred to in R v Henry.
	
	
	During the Respondent’s evidence on sentence, he agreed he “set out to go to the property and find guns”. Although a little later he said he did not know when guns came into his mind as a plan, he recounted an incident a few days before his offence when someone had pulled a gun on him and his friends and it then seemed a good idea to get one. The statement of facts recounts that on the morning of the offence, the Respondent and a co-offender, Brown, and Brown’s girlfriend met. They stopped for breakfast at Fyshwick and then drove to Bywong where the victims lived. The distance between these two places is over 30 kilometres.
	
	
	The statement of facts records that the Respondent and Brown spent some time together in the absence of Brown’s girlfriend “presumably discussing the matter” and that thereafter the Respondent was dropped nearby by Brown who drove away and parked, waiting about an hour and a half. Later Brown drove his vehicle to the boundary fence of the victims’ property, taking up a position with a direct line of sight to the victim’s residence and shed.
	
	
	It is clear that the offence occupied a substantial amount of time. After accosting the Respondent in a shed, the male victim on two occasions took the Respondent into his house in an endeavour to calm him down and demonstrate compliance with the Respondent’s demand that the phone be disconnected. Some food was also provided. At times the Respondent was calm but at other times in a rage threatening to kill the victims.
	
	
	Three further circumstances distinguishing the subject case from R v Henry are firstly that the Respondent’s offence happened in the victims’ home (a term which in my view includes an adjacent shed), secondly, there were two victims who had to endure the Respondent’s rage and threats and suffer consequential psychological trauma and thirdly, that at the time the Respondent was on conditional liberty in respect of an offence of a similar nature. The courts have made it clear that the latter is a seriously aggravating circumstance.
	
	
	Whether approached from the viewpoint of the decision in R v Henry or from basic sentencing principles including s 97(1) of the Crimes Act providing for a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, the sentence imposed on the Respondent was manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	It was submitted on behalf of the Respondent that the purposes of the appeal and the provision of guidance to sentencing courts could be achieved “by a statement of this court that the sentence imposed was wrong and why it was wrong”. I disagree. This court has made patently clear in R v Henry and other cases, the obligation which there is on sentencing judges to impose proper sentences. The sentence imposed in this case is an indication that that message has not been heard, at least by the judge who sentenced the Respondent.
	
	
	There is however, one matter which bears on the residual discretion of the court not to interfere to which I must refer. For reasons I find impossible to comprehend, Counsel appearing for the Crown during the sentencing hearing in written submissions remarked “the guideline judgment of R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 applies.
	
	
	In some circumstances one might conclude that an erroneous submission by the Crown had led a sentencing judge into error. However, so well-known is the decision in R v Henry and so commonly is it applied that I do not regard it as possible to blame the Crown for the error his Honour made. In my view the court should exercise its discretion so as to allow the appeal and re-sentence the Respondent.
	
	
	In his favour on that issue is the fact that he is but 24 and that he has the support of obviously caring parents who are both in a position and interested to assist. Prior to his addiction to methylamphetamine he himself has demonstrated a caring attitude and desire to assist his family. For reasons similar to those which were canvassed in the guideline judgment his sentence must be increased. However, there are grounds for making it towards to the bottom of the available range.
	
	
	Thus I agree with the proposal of Ward JA that the sentence be one of imprisonment for 5 years including a non-parole period of 3 years.

2702281,Skelton v R [2015] NSWCCA 320,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

This case related to the stabbing by the appellant of the victim, who was at that time unknown to him, at the Brighton Hotel on Oxford Street in the early hours of 23 September 2012. The appellant was found guilty after a trial before Culver DCJ and a jury of one count of reckless wounding, contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 35(4). That offence was the alternative count on the indictment, the principal charge being a count of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to the Crimes Act, s 33(1)(a). The appellant was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 3 years, with a non-parole period of 18 months.

The appellant appealed against his conviction pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5(1)(a) and sought leave to appeal against his sentence pursuant to s 5(1)(c).

On the evening of the stabbing incident, the appellant had attended the end of year ball of the National Art School, where he was enrolled as a student. He acquired the knife at the ball, and gave evidence that he often picked up things he found. He started to “blank out” after leaving the ball and walking towards the Oxford Hotel, and he had no memory of what had occurred there. The incident was captured on the hotel’s CCTV camera system. It appears that the appellant approached the victim at the bar and stabbed him in the course of a brief struggle. The victim was treated with three stitches and spent a short time in hospital.

The appellant was given bail and was diagnosed with schizophrenia while being treated as an inpatient at a mental health clinic. He had a history of mental illness which included treatment for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) from age seven and treatment for depression and anxiety, including by medication. There was some evidence that he had experienced paranoid episodes and ‘black outs’ prior to the stabbing incident.

The appellant raised two grounds in respect of his appeal against conviction: first, that a miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the manner in which he was cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor; and secondly, that the trial judge failed to give adequate directions to the jury in respect of the mental illness defence, particularly in respect of a direction that the “second branch” of the M’Naghten test, relating to the appellant’s capacity to understand the wrongfulness of his actions, did not turn upon whether he knew his actions were illegal.

The appellant raised a further two grounds in respect of his application for leave to appeal against sentence: first, that the sentencing judge gave insufficient weight to the evidence concerning his mental condition; and secondly, that her Honour gave an insufficient discount for the appellant’s offers to plead guilty to reckless wounding.

Held:

Beazley P and Davies J, dismissing the appeal against conviction:

(1)   Neither any specific element of the Crown Prosecutor’s cross-examination of the appellant, nor its cumulative effect, was unfair in the sense that warrants appellate intervention. It is true that some elements of the cross-examination may have been objectionable, and the appellant may have been occasionally confused. However, any unfairness that might have arisen in those instances was resolved in further questioning or by appropriate management by the trial judge. [95].

Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559

(2)   The trial judge’s directions to the jury in respect of the mental illness defence were adequate. There was no requirement that a jury must be directed that the test for whether a person knew his actions were wrong was not concerned with whether the person knew that his actions were illegal. [118]-[123].

Stapleton v R [1952] HCA 56; 86 CLR 358; R v Windle (1952) 2 QB 826

R S Hulme AJ, dissenting on the appeal against conviction:

(3)   The number and nature of the Crown Prosecutor’s errors in cross-examination of the accused amount to a miscarriage of justice. [34]-[35].

Beazley P and Davies J, R S Hulme AJ agreeing, granting leave to appeal against sentence and allowing the appeal

(4)   The trial judge, in sentencing the appellant, failed to adequately take account of the extent to which his mental condition reduced his moral culpability. In particular, her Honour erred in determining that she was required to undertake the sentencing exercise on the basis that any impairment in the appellant’s ability to appreciate his actions were wrong was not significant. Rather, the jury’s verdict left open the possibility that the appellant was impaired in that ability to some degree. [135]-[141]

R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255; R v Z [2006] NSWCCA 342; Hassan v R [2010] VSC 352; GWM v R [2012] NSWCCA 240; ZZ v R [2013] NSWCCA; Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1

(5)   Contrary to the findings of the trial judge, general deterrence had no real role to play in the sentencing process, as the appellant’s significant mental illness precluded him from being an appropriate medium for the making of an example to others. [146].

R v Mooney (Court of Criminal Appeal (Vic), 21 June 1978, unreported); Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.

(6)   The trial judge gave insufficient allowance for the utilitarian value of the appellant’s offer to plead guilty to the reckless wounding offence in the District Court, the offence of which he was ultimately convicted. The appropriate discount was 20 per cent rather than 15 per cent. [150]-[152].

Judgment


	
	BEAZLEY P and DAVIES J: The appellant, Cameron Skelton, was found guilty after a trial before Culver DCJ and a jury of one count of reckless wounding, contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 35(4). That offence was the alternative count on the indictment, the principal charge being a count of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to the Crimes Act, s 33(1)(a). A conviction of the related offence of possessing a knife in a public place was also recorded but no further penalty was imposed.
	
	
	The offence of reckless wounding carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment of 7 years. A standard non-parole period of 3 years applies: the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), Div 1A. The appellant was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 3 years, with a non-parole period of 18 months. The term was backdated to commence on 21 November 2014 so as to take account of the period of 119 days during which the appellant had been in custody prior to sentencing. Account was also taken of a period of 21 days in which the appellant was in residential rehabilitation. The non-parole period is thus to expire on 20 May 2016.
	
	
	The appellant appeals against his conviction pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5(1)(a) and seeks leave to appeal against his sentence pursuant to s 5(1)(c).
	
	
	The charges related to the stabbing by the appellant of the victim, Blair Sidhu, at the Brighton Hotel on Oxford Street in the early hours of 23 September 2012. The incident was captured on the hotel’s CCTV system. The victim was, at that time, unknown to the appellant.
	
	
	It was not at issue in the trial that the appellant stabbed Mr Sidhu and thereby wounded him. Rather, the question for the jury was whether the appellant had the requisite mental state to be found guilty of either the principal or alternative offence with which he was charged or whether he was not guilty by reason of the defence of mental illness.
	
	
	The jury’s not guilty verdict on the principal charge meant that the jury was not satisfied that the appellant intended to cause the victim grievous bodily harm. The guilty verdict on the reckless wounding count meant that the jury considered that the appellant was reckless as to causing the victim actual bodily harm and that he had not established the defence of mental illness.
	


Factual background

The incident


	
	The appellant gave evidence that, on the day leading up to the incident, he had spent the day with his father building a studio at the back of their house. He had smoked cannabis during the day. He was attending the National Art School at the time and the school’s end of year ball was that evening. The appellant had initially planned not to go to the ball, but his friend Hugo Fisher had arrived at the house and told him he should go.
	
	
	The appellant first went to Mr Fisher’s house, where, on Mr Fisher’s evidence, he had one beer before they went to the ball, arriving at about 8.30 pm. The appellant gave evidence that he drank at the ball, but that he was not a big drinker and did not like the drinks on offer. He said that he talked to a few people he knew but he mostly just sat there all night.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence that he picked up the knife at the ball. It was a folding knife. When cross-examined as to why he had picked it up, he answered “[b]ecause I usually pick things up and collect them. I work with found objects and sculpture”.
	
	
	The appellant was not sure when he left the ball but recalled leaving with a friend and walking down Oxford Street to the Brighton Hotel. In cross-examination, he agreed that the Brighton Hotel was a place where he felt comfortable because it was a place where he used to drink with his friends.
	
	
	The appellant said that he started to “blank out a bit” as he was walking to the hotel and that he could not recall entering the hotel or anything that happened there. He said that viewing the CCTV footage of the incident had not assisted him to recollect anything.
	
	
	The victim had arrived at the hotel at about 1 am with his girlfriend, Lauren Brown, and a number of other friends. They had been drinking at various hotels around the city earlier that night, and he had taken half a cap of MDMA. At about 2:25 am the victim observed the appellant sitting across from him, a table away, and noticed that he “looked a bit crazy in the face, in the eyes”. He commented on the appellant to Ms Brown and to another friend. Ms Brown said it was unlikely that the comment to her was heard as it was very loud in the hotel. Another friend, Claudia Pearce, said the appellant “wouldn’t stop staring at [the victim]”.
	
	
	The victim gave evidence that he went to the bar approximately 10 to 15 minutes after making the comment about the appellant. The appellant approached the victim and came “really close” to him. The victim pushed him away. Ms Brown gave evidence that the appellant put his arm around the victim’s neck and said something to him at which point they started pushing each other and “got into a bit of a fight”. Another witness, Ms Vareslija, said that “the dispute” between the appellant and the victim lasted about 20 seconds. As noted above, the incident was recorded on the hotel’s CCTV camera.
	
	
	The victim was not immediately aware that anything serious had happened to him. However, when Ms Brown walked over to the victim, she noticed blood dripping on his shoes. She lifted his shirt and told him he had been stabbed. Ms Brown told the bartender to call the police and then went outside with the victim, who was beginning to lose consciousness.
	
	
	Mr Richard Gold, the hotel’s security guard, entered the venue when he saw the panic light go on. He gave evidence that as he approached the appellant, the appellant tried to covertly pass the knife to his friend. Mr Gold grabbed the knife from the appellant and told him that he needed him to come outside with him. Mr Gold said that the appellant then told him to “throw him [the victim] out first, as he started it”, and then said, “you have to take him first or I’ll stab him again”. At that stage, Mr Gold had already taken possession of the knife.
	
	
	Shortly thereafter, police officers arrived and the appellant was taken into custody. He spent three or four days in the mental health unit at Silverwater Correctional Centre before being placed with the general prison population. Dr Olav Nielssen, forensic psychiatrist, saw the appellant on 5 October 2012 and arranged for his admission to the Hills Clinic, a private psychiatric health service. On 9 October, the appellant was released on bail and spent three weeks as an inpatient at the Hills Clinic, where he saw Dr Edward Cassidy. He has continued to receive outpatient treatment from the Clinic.
	
	
	The victim was taken by ambulance to St Vincent’s Hospital, having sustained a three-centimetre wound to his left abdominal area that penetrated to the muscle layers. The wound was closed with three stitches and he was released from hospital the next day.
	


Evidence on the appellant’s medical history and condition


	
	At the time of the offence, the appellant was 21 years old and was in his second year at the National Art School. He was living with his parents. The appellant and a number of witnesses gave evidence that he was substantially introverted, rarely went out, did not enjoy large crowds of people, and was only comfortable with people he knew well.
	
	
	The appellant had a history of mental health issues. He was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at age 7 and was treated with various medications, principally dexamphetamine, until he was in about Year 10. He saw a number of psychiatrists and psychologists during his adolescence. In a report of Dr Melissa Barrett of the Black Dog Institute, dated 10 August 2011, a question was raised whether the appellant may have been suffering bipolar disorder. He was prescribed Zoloft for depression and mood disorder, but stopped taking it a few weeks before the incident.
	
	
	The appellant was examined in detail on his use of drugs. He gave evidence that, in September 2012, his general daily consumption of cannabis was slightly over a gram per day, although in cross-examination he agreed that he was using half an ounce to an ounce (about 15 to 30 grams) per week. He also said that he had used LSD, ecstasy, amphetamines and cocaine in the past, but was not using them on the evening of the incident. He said that, in the period before September 2012, he was “using a lot more drugs, not just cannabis anymore, I was kind of doing a bit of everything and large quantities of it … self-medicating”.  The jury were given a direction that the evidence of use of illegal drugs could not be used to impute dishonesty to the appellant or as evidence of a tendency to commit the offences with which he was charged.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence that he started experiencing paranoia from the end of Year 11. He said that his paranoia involved strangers and that he felt hostility from people. He said he would not go to places by himself. He said he did not discuss his paranoia with health professionals or his family prior to the incident. However, Dr Nielssen gave evidence that he had become aware from the medical records with which he had been provided that the appellant had been seeing his General Practitioner, Dr Telan, for various mental issues, including paranoia.
	
	
	Mr Fisher and the appellant’s parents, Mr and Mrs Skelton, gave evidence that the appellant had become thinner, more reclusive and isolated in the period leading up to the offence. The appellant gave evidence that he had attempted to commit suicide a week before the incident, and that that was the second time he had done so. In that period, on 14 September 2012, the appellant saw Kathi Pauncz, psychologist. Ms Pauncz’s notes from that consultation were in evidence and recorded that the appellant had told her that the past year had made a big difference and that he did not want to be involved in the drug scene. In cross-examination, the appellant said that he would go to sessions with Ms Pauncz and “present a false life”.
	
	
	Four medical experts were called:
	


Dr Stephen Allnutt, forensic psychiatrist engaged by the Crown, who saw the appellant once, on 26 September 2013;

Dr Bruce Westmore, forensic psychiatrist engaged by the appellant, who saw him on 4 November 2013;

Dr Olav Nielssen, psychiatrist retained by the appellant;

Dr Edward Cassidy, consultant psychiatrist at the Hills Clinic and the appellant’s treating psychiatrist.


	
	All of the experts agreed that the appellant was suffering from a disease of the mind at the time of the incident.
	
	
	Dr Cassidy diagnosed the appellant with schizophrenia during his time at the Hills Clinic. There was no dispute between the experts about the correctness of that diagnosis.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt was of the opinion that the appellant “was likely depressed at the time [of the incident] and that would be sufficient to conclude that he had a disease of the mind”. He also gave evidence that the appellant was “likely paranoid” and that although he was “not entirely clear that [the appellant] was psychotic in the full sense of the term”, he “could not definitely rule that out either”.
	
	
	Dr Westmore considered that the appellant was in the transition phase between the prodromal phase of schizophrenia and psychosis, or may have gone into psychosis, at the time of the incident.
	
	
	Drs Allnutt, Westmore and Nielssen agreed that the appellant knew the nature and quality of his act in stabbing the victim.
	
	
	In Dr Westmore’s opinion, the appellant was undoubtedly paranoid about the victim, but his amnesia precluded any determination of the extent or content of those views. Dr Nielssen agreed that it was likely that the appellant was generally paranoid at the time of the attack and that he experienced a “specific paranoid ideation” in relation to Mr Sidhu.
	
	
	The question whether the appellant had the capacity to know that his actions in stabling the victim were wrongful caused the experts the most difficulty, particularly in the context of his amnesia.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt considered that it was a “borderline situation” but that his position was “equivocal falling on the side that he likely maintained that capacity”.
	
	
	Dr Westmore considered that, particularly on the basis of the “extremeness of [the appellant’s] behaviour”, a court might be able to come to the conclusion that he was compromised in his ability to reason in relation to his actions but that “a psychiatrist can’t say it because … [the psychiatrist] can’t get a history as to precisely what [the appellant] was thinking at the time”. Nevertheless, in his opinion, the appellant “on the balance of probabilities … was compromised to some degree”.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen’s position was that:
	


“… because of [the appellant’s] mental illness … he wasn’t able to reason with sense and composure about the wrongfulness at the time that [he] believes that he’s under threat, or that he’s being provoked by the victim on a delusional basis … and he’s responded.”


	
	Dr Cassidy agreed that he was unable to resolve whether the appellant knew whether what he was doing was wrong. He considered that, given the sequence of events including the incident, the history of deterioration and the subsequent diagnosis of schizophrenia, that would be “very suggestive that he was acutely psychotic at the time, but … I would see this is a jury’s role”.
	


Appeal against conviction


	
	The appellant raised two grounds in respect of his appeal against conviction:
	


(1)   That a miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the manner in which the Crown Prosecutor cross-examined the appellant: ground 1;

(2)   That in the course of directions on the mental illness defence, the trial judge erred by failing to give adequate directions in respect of the “second branch” of the M’Naghten test. In particular, her Honour failed to explain that the appellant’s capacity to understand the wrongfulness of his actions did not turn upon whether he knew his actions were illegal: ground 2.

Ground 1: miscarriage of justice occasioned by the manner of the Crown Prosecutor’s cross-examination


	
	It is convenient to commence consideration of this ground of appeal by reference to the duties of cross-examiners in relation to the form and method of questioning. Those duties have a statutory basis pursuant to the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), s 41. That section provides:
	


“41   Improper questions

(1)   The court must disallow a question put to a witness in cross-examination, or inform the witness that it need not be answered, if the court is of the opinion that the question (referred to as a ""disallowable question"" ):

(a)   is misleading or confusing, or

(b)   is unduly annoying, harassing, intimidating, offensive, oppressive, humiliating or repetitive, or

(c)   is put to the witness in a manner or tone that is belittling, insulting or otherwise inappropriate, or

(d)   has no basis other than a stereotype (for example, a stereotype based on the witness’s sex, race, culture, ethnicity, age or mental, intellectual or physical disability).

(2)   Without limiting the matters the court may take into account for the purposes of subsection (1), it is to take into account:

(a)   any relevant condition or characteristic of the witness of which the court is, or is made, aware, including age, education, ethnic and cultural background, gender, language background and skills, level of maturity and understanding and personality, and

(b)   any mental, intellectual or physical disability of which the court is, or is made, aware and to which the witness is, or appears to be, subject, and

(c)   the context in which the question is put, including:

(i)   the nature of the proceeding, and

(ii)   in a criminal proceeding-the nature of the offence to which the proceeding relates, and

(iii)   the relationship (if any) between the witness and any other party to the proceeding.

(3)   A question is not a disallowable question merely because:

(a)   the question challenges the truthfulness of the witness or the consistency or accuracy of any statement made by the witness, or

(b)   the question requires the witness to discuss a subject that could be considered distasteful to, or private by, the witness.

(4)   A party may object to a question put to a witness on the ground that it is a disallowable question.

(5)   However, the duty imposed on the court by this section applies whether or not an objection is raised to a particular question.

(6)   A failure by the court to disallow a question under this section, or to inform the witness that it need not be answered, does not affect the admissibility in evidence of any answer given by the witness in response to the question.”


	
	The Legal Profession Uniform Conduct (Barristers) Rules 2015, r 61, also provides, relevantly, that:
	


“A barrister must take care to ensure that decisions by the barrister to make allegations or suggestions under privilege against any person:

(a)   are reasonably justified by the material then available to the barrister, …”


	
	One relevant aspect of the duty to avoid questions which are misleading, confusing or harassing is the general prohibition on the use of compound questions. The vices of such questions were discussed by Heydon J in Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559, at [127]:
	


“ ‘A compound question simultaneously poses more than one inquiry and calls for more than one answer. Such a question presents two problems. First, the question may be ambiguous because of its multiple facets and complexity. Secondly, any answer may be confusing because of uncertainty as to which part of the compound question the witness intended to address’. But compound questions have additional vices. It is unfair to force a witness into the position of having to choose which questions in a compound question to answer and in which order. Cross-examiners are entitled, if they can, to frame questions so as to seek a particular answer – either ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. Even though the answers desired by the cross-examiner to a compound question may be all affirmative or all negative, the witness may wish to answer to some affirmatively and some negatively. To place witnesses in the position of having to reformulate a compound question and answer its component parts bit by bit is unfair to them in the sense that it prevents them from doing justice to themselves. …” (citations omitted)


	
	The appellant submitted that the manner in which he was cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor, in circumstances where he was mentally unwell, in that he was suffering from schizophrenia, was taking antipsychotic medication and was affected by drowsiness as a side-effect of the medication, was unfair such as to amount to a miscarriage of justice. He submitted that given these circumstances, the Crown Prosecutor was required, in accordance with the requirements of the Evidence Act, s 41, to cross-examine him with an appropriate degree of caution and restraint. The appellant submitted that in such circumstances, the cross-examiner was required to:
	



	
	frame the questions put in cross-examination clearly and unambiguously so as not to cause avoidable confusion;
	
	
	refrain from unduly repetitive or aggressive questioning and refrain from sarcastic or ridiculing comment;
	
	
	refrain from asking questions with inadequate or inaccurate factual foundations; and
	
	
	avoid compound questions and argumentative questions or comments.
	



	
	The appellant, although contending that the cumulative effect of the cross-examination was unfair, identified six aspects of the cross-examination in which he contended that the Crown Prosecutor particularly transgressed in one or more of the above respects. Those six aspects, in the order in which we will deal with them, were:
	



	
	Cross-examination on alleged premeditation and the discharge application;
	
	
	Cross-examination on the appellant’s plans to go to the ball;
	
	
	Cross-examination on the history given to Ms Kathi Pauncz;
	
	
	Cross-examination suggesting that the appellant made up his illness;
	
	
	Cross-examination on the occurrence of auditory hallucinations;
	
	
	Cross-examination on the history of drug consumption given to Dr Allnutt.
	



	
	In oral argument, the appellant’s first complaint was in relation to the initial cross-examination, where, after the appellant stated at the end of his examination in chief that the medication he was taking, Seroquel, caused him to be “half asleep most of the time” and had an impact on his recalling things, the Crown Prosecutor asked him the following questions:
	


“Q. You’re not half asleep now, are you sir?

A. No.

Q. You sure about that?

A. Positive.

Q. What drugs are you on at the moment?

A. Well, I’ve had Seroquel last night and I’ve had Nausetil this morning.

Q. You’re absolutely sure that you’re able to answer my questions, are you?

A. Yes, I am.”


	
	In our opinion, given that the appellant was suffering from a mental condition and had given evidence that the medication he had been prescribed made him drowsy, the Crown Prosecutor was entitled to commence his cross-examination with questions that established that the evidence the appellant gave thereafter was not affected by problems associated with those matters.
	


Cross-examination on alleged premeditation


	
	In argument, the appellant referred to cross-examination on this topic being the worst of the cross-examination. This line of questioning related to the Crown contention that before stabbing the victim, the appellant had already planned to claim that the victim had started the fight between them. The relevant exchange was as follows:
	


“Q. What I'm suggesting to you is that you had planned, before you stabbed Mr Sidhu, to make a claim that the victim started it?

A. I don't know.

Q. I'm suggesting to you - and you can disagree with this, that the reason why you went up to Mr Sidhu and I suggest said something to him in his left ear - very close - do you understand?

A. Yes.

Q. Was because you wanted him to react, didn’t you?

A. I disagree. I also can't say.”


	
	The appellant complained that there was no proper factual foundation for those questions and the only evidence relating to them was that given by Mr Gold, the security guard, that, after the appellant and the victim were separated, the appellant had told Mr Gold that the victim had started it: see above at [15].
	
	
	The appellant accepted that had the form of the first question above been different so as to ask, “had you planned before you stabbed the victim to claim that he had started it?”, it may have been unobjectionable. He contended however, that to put to a witness a positive proposition carried with it the suggestion that there was a basis for it in the evidence. In circumstances where that was not so, such a question was contrary to the Evidence Act, s 41 and contrary to fairness. The appellant contended that such questioning was confusing to a witness and delayed the process of trial, creating an extra burden on the witness and the court in considering what was appropriate and what was inappropriate in the questioning.
	
	
	The appellant also contended that the cross-examination thereafter similarly offended the principles governing cross-examination. That cross-examination was as follows:
	


“Q. And you knew when you went into the hotel that you had a hunting knife in your pocket?

A. No, as I said I can’t remember going into the hotel, so I can’t answer that question with my memory.

Q. Well, you remember walking down Oxford Street to the pub?

A. Yes, I do remember walking down Oxford Street.

Q. You must remember then that you didn’t dispose of the knife on the way down, did you?

A. No.

Q. Because you had the knife in the pub?

A. I had it in my pocket.

Q. Yes, in the pub?

A. No, when I was walking down the hill.

Q. Yes, and in the pub too?

A. I can’t remember.

Q. But you accept, don’t you, that you have seen the CCTV footage?

A. I have seen the CCTV footage, but from my memory of the pub – I have none.

Q. But you accept, don’t you – having seen the footage, and having heard Mr Gold, you accept don’t you that you had the knife in the pub?

A. Yes.

Q. No doubt about it?

A. No.

Q. I want to suggest to you that the reason that you took the knife into the pub was because you intended to stab someone with it?

A. No.

Q. When you got into the pub you lined up Mr Sidhu and you stabbed him?

A. I can’t say.” (emphasis added)


	
	The appellant contended, in particular, that the bolded question above was improper, in that it did not have any foundation in the evidence and that the cross-examiner was merely “winging it”.
	
	
	Trial counsel did not object to any of this questioning. However, it appears that immediately after the last question was answered, the trial judge asked the jury to leave the court, and reproached trial counsel for audibly sniggering at the questions being asked in cross-examination. That led to a lengthy exchange between her Honour, trial counsel and the Crown Prosecutor as to the appropriateness of the line of questioning that had been engaged in by the Crown Prosecutor and, relevantly, as to the Crown case on intention. The following relevant exchange occurred:
	


“CROWN PROSECUTOR: … there has been a case from the start about intent. The Crown case has been, right from the beginning that it was an intentional wounding.

…

CROWN PROSECUTOR: … the Crown case now being a premeditated wounding and a premeditated wounding that [the appellant] had before he entered the hotel so he says, I’ve never put that at all. My case has always been that he went from where he was sitting, staring at [the appellant], got up, went over and stabbed him. I haven’t put that he had that premeditated view before the hotel. [emphasis added]

HER HONOUR: I think you put it to [the appellant] in cross-examination that he went into the hotel with the intention that he wanted to stab someone. Someone.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: If I’ve put that then that needs to be corrected. I’ll have to look at the transcript.

…

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I thought I put to him that he went into the hotel knowing that he had a knife.

…

CROWN PROSECUTOR: … if it’s wrong I can correct it, but I was never going to put the jury that he had the intention as he was walking down Oxford Street.

…

HER HONOUR: ... Mr Crown, to be clear then, your intention would be to put a further question to [the appellant] that would clarify that what you’re putting to him is that he formed the intention to stab Mr Sidhu at some time whilst in the pub?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, that he had the intention in the pub – not when he commenced to have the intention, or when it finished, but when he was sitting staring he had the intention.”


	
	Upon resumption of the cross-examination, following this exchange, the Crown Prosecutor stated to the appellant that he had made a mistake in suggesting that the appellant had formed an intention to stab the victim as he was walking down Oxford Street. The trial judge then intervened and asked the appellant whether he understood what was being withdrawn and what was now been put to him.
	
	
	Her Honour then invited trial counsel to let her know if there was an issue as to what she had said. Trial counsel responded that it might be better if the Crown Prosecutor withdrew the allegation as to having had any intention whilst walking down the street. The Crown Prosecutor did so.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor then said to the appellant that what he was putting was that when the appellant was in the hotel he formed the intention to stab the victim. The appellant said that he understood what he was being asked, but that he could not say whether he agreed with that proposition or not.
	
	
	Senior Counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant was confused about the propositions being discussed. We do not agree. It is apparent from the transcript that the appellant knew what had been asked, what had been withdrawn and what the new question was that was being put to him. His response, that he could not say whether he agreed or not that he had the intention to stab the victim in the hotel is indicative of his understanding of the questioning and consistent with his evidence that he was totally amnesic about what occurred in the hotel.
	


Cross-examination on the appellant’s plans to go to the ball


	
	During the course of the cross-examination on this topic, there was a double barrelled question that was the subject of objection and was reformulated. Complaint was made about the following cross-examination:
	


“Q. You understand that I’m suggesting to you that you had conversations with your two good friends, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And you planned to go to the ball?

A. No I didn’t – I didn’t usually follow through with things that I agreed to doing.

Q. I’m not asking you that --

[TRIAL COUNSEL]: I object --

CROWN PROSECUTOR

Q. I’m not asking you that sir, you planned to go to the ball?

A. I said I’d planned -

HER HONOUR: [Trial counsel] if you’re going to object you need to stand so I know you’re pursuing the objection.

[TRIAL COUNSEL]: I know your Honour but my friend was going on so I didn’t want to --

HER HONOUR: That’s the point of you standing; so I can cause a pause of the proceedings.

[TRIAL COUNSEL]: Your Honour I think the question is meaningless in terms of using the word ‘planning’ in light of the full answer. It’s word play your Honour, with respect.

HER HONOUR: I’m not seeing that at this stage but I think Mr Crown was moving on to the next point in any case.

CROWN PROSECUTOR

Q. Sir, I’m suggesting to you that at some point before the ball you had conversations with your friends which led to you planning to go to the ball, whether you’d decided to follow through with that or not?

A. Yes, that’s true.

Q. No doubt about that is there?

A. No.

Q. You can remember those conversations can’t you?

A. No I can’t.

Q. But you know they happened don’t you?

A. Well Hugo said they did so.

Q. I’m not asking you about Hugo, you know that you planned?

A. Yes.

Q. No doubt about that?

A. Yes.” (emphasis added)


	
	The appellant submitted that this cross-examination was ambiguous and particularly complained that the bolded question was unfair and that he only agreed that he had planned to go to the ball based on Hugo’s evidence.
	
	
	In our opinion, this is not a fair reading of the cross-examination, nor do we consider that it was it productive of any unfairness.
	
	
	The appellant further complained of the cross-examination that occurred shortly thereafter, as follows:
	


“Q. But on this occasion you were someone who wanted to attend things like that weren’t you?

A. That’s questionable.

Q. It’s not questionable sir, you dressed up, you planned it and you went, correct or not?

A. Yes.” (emphasis added)


	
	The Crown accepted that second of these two questions was objectionable, although not the subject of any objection by trial counsel. The Crown submitted, however, that it was only one of two such objectionable questions asked and of which complaint is now made. It was submitted that in the course of a lengthy cross-examination, the asking of two impermissible questions was not so unfair such as to constitute a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	Compound questions are generally impermissible, not least because it is usually not possible to ascertain which part of the question has been answered: see Libke, above at [38]. The question in this case may not have had that vice, as it was, in effect, a ‘wrapped up’ summary of the previous questioning. But in any event, as the Crown has pointed out, an occasional objectionable question in the course of a lengthy cross-examination rarely, if ever, gives rise to a miscarriage of justice. It should be noted that the question in this case did not fall into any such particular category of questions on credit to which, arguably, different considerations apply.
	


Cross-examination on the history given to Ms Pauncz


	
	As noted above, the appellant saw Ms Pauncz the week before the stabbing incident. On this topic, the appellant first complained about the following cross-examination, which also involved a compound question:
	


“Q. The reason was that you’d been in therapy, you’d been seeing your psychologist, you’d been on your medication and you were well?

A. No I wasn’t.”


	
	Objection was taken to this question, but after the answer was given. The basis of the objection was that the question contained a false statement, in that the appellant’s evidence was that he had stopped taking Zoloft some time before seeing the psychologist. It was further submitted on the appeal that the compound question was unfair, in that it included the assertion that the appellant was well at the time that he had planned to go to the ball, when that was a live issue that was being litigated before the jury.
	
	
	Whilst this last complaint is well based, the position at trial was that after objection was taken, there was argument on the point and the Crown asked the direct question whether the appellant was “on any medication at all on 23 September 2012” and a further question, whether the appellant was “well on 23 September 2012”. The appellant answered “no” to both questions.
	
	
	There was an exchange between these two questions, where it would appear that the Crown Prosecutor was confused as to what answer had been given to the compound question: the answer had been answered in the negative, whereas the Crown Prosecutor appeared to recall the question having been answered in the affirmative. In the course of this exchange, the appellant said that the Crown Prosecutor had been “quite aggressive and it confuses me a bit”, to which the Crown Prosecutor responded, “I see, it’s my fault. I’m sorry”.
	
	
	On the appeal, the appellant submitted that this was an example of the Crown Prosecutor engaging in sarcastic comment. It is, of course, not possible to know from the transcript of the tone in which the comment was made. However, the appellant’s answer was telling. He said “that’s all right”. It appears, therefore, that the appellant either did not interpret the comment as being sarcastic or, alternatively, had the measure of the Crown Prosecutor. In either case, in circumstances where the Crown Prosecutor broke up the relevant parts of the compound question into its component parts, we do not consider any unfairness arose out of the questioning of which the appellant complained.
	
	
	The appellant also complained that the suggestion that he was well at that time was contrary to the psychiatric evidence so that there was no basis upon which this question ought properly have been asked. However, the appellant conceded that there was a basis upon which this question could be asked, given that the context of the questioning related to his consultation with the psychologist, Ms Pauncz, who had suggested in her report the appellant was well at the time that she saw him, approximately a week before the stabbing incident subject of the charge.
	
	
	A similar submission was made about the sarcasm inherent in the Crown Prosecutor’s question “[a]re you serious?” when the appellant said that he could not remember whether in September 2012 he had decided to “vacate the drug scene”. This questioning was also based upon what Ms Pauncz had recorded in her report as the appellant had told her.
	
	
	This submission also suffers from the difficulty that it is not possible to know whether the tone in which the comment was made was sarcastic, or reflective of surprise at the answer. Further, there was no objection by trial counsel to this or the questions which immediately followed. It was not until some pages further on in the transcript that trial counsel made a more general complaint of unfairness in the questioning having regard to the evidence that the appellant had given in his examination in chief. The trial judge pointed out that the Crown Prosecutor was entitled to test inconsistencies in the evidence.
	
	
	Argument then proceeded in the absence of the jury. In particular, trial counsel complained that the cross-examination, when it related to previous evidence, had been “very fast”, “unduly aggressive” and that “nearly every answer is tagged with a comment”.
	
	
	Her Honour rejected these complaints, although she noted that the Crown Prosecutor had heard the concerns raised and would no doubt “accommodate them”. Her Honour was in the best position to make that determination. To the extent that this Court is able to make any assessment of the complaint, the transcript does not bear out the complaint, as her Honour correctly observed, that “nearly every answer was tagged with a comment”. We consider that there is no substance in these submissions.
	
	
	Another compound question was identified when the Crown Prosecutor asked “[y]ou were well, healthy and had decided to abandon the drug scene?”, to which the appellant responded “[n]o”. The comment made above at [58] likewise applies to the complaint about this question.
	


Cross-examination suggesting that the appellant had made up his illness


	
	The exchange complained of on this topic was as follows:
	


“Q. You didn't have any symptoms of voices or paranoia before you went to

Silverwater, did you?

A. Before Silverwater?

Q. Yes.

A. No.

Q. Silverwater made an impression on you, didn't it?

A. Yes.

Q. You hadn't been diagnosed with any psychotic disorders before you went

to Silverwater, had you?

A. Bipolar and depression.

Q. You weren't diagnosed with that.

[TRIAL COUNSEL]: I object, your Honour.

CROWN PROSECUTOR

Q. You were diagnosed with depression, not bipolar, were you?

A. Okay.

...

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I withdraw the question.”


	
	The appellant submitted that the implication in this exchange was that the appellant’s symptoms of mental disturbance were a recent invention motivated by the appellant’s experience of custody. That is a possible interpretation, although the questions do not appear to have been so understood by the appellant. The question of whether the appellant had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, as opposed to depression, was not pursued further at that point but was picked up again on a later day of hearing and was, we consider, fairly dealt with then. We do not consider that there was any unfairness in these questions.
	


Cross-examination on auditory hallucinations


	
	The appellant had a history of suffering auditory hallucinations which had become manifest when he was in custody after having been arrested following the stabbing incident. There was an issue, however, about when it was he suffered from auditory hallucinations and this was the subject of cross-examination, including in respect of what he had told Dr Nielssen. The cross-examination related to the appellant’s credit, the basis of the cross-examination being that what he had told Dr Nielssen in June 2013, that he had not suffered any auditory hallucinations from the time of his release on bail in October 2012, was inconsistent with his evidence in examination in chief, where he said that the auditory hallucinations had continued up to trial.
	
	
	The cross-examination on this point included the following exchange:
	


“Q. What I’m putting to you is that the evidence that you gave a couple of days ago is inconsistent with what you told Dr Nielssen. Do you understand that?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. You understand what I’m putting to you?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. That the two are different?

A. Yes.

Q. They can’t both be right.

A. They're different.

Q. They can’t both be right, can they?

A. They could, yes. I think, well, I’ve said that the other day as well, that it’s - it's normal to hear voices other than my own and my own voice.

Q. I’m not asking you about that.

A. Well, then I’m confused again, I’m sorry.

Q. I’ll try again. I’ll try again. You were trying to tell the jury a couple of days ago that the voices started when you went to prison on the 23rd and they continue up until the present day, weren’t you?

A. Yes.

Q. What you told Dr Nielssen was they didn’t continue once you had been granted bail? Understand that?

A. Yeah, I think I can offer an explanation for that, as well.

Q. Please. Please.

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Do you understand those two propositions?

A. Yes.

Q. I’m putting to you they can’t both be true, can they?

A. I can't answer that.

Q. You have to, sir.

A. I’m not sure.

Q. What do you mean? They either stopped after you were granted bail or they didn’t. Which one is correct?

A. They continued.

Q. So what you told Dr Nielssen wasn’t correct?

A. Yeah, I just thought about it why - why that was an actual - why that’s possible. I’d been on medication since I got bail.

Q. I’m not interested in possibilities. I want to know why you told Dr Nielssen something that wasn’t correct.

A. It’s possibly because I was - had just been put on medication as soon as I was granted bail.” (emphasis added)


	
	On the appeal, the appellant contended that there was no inconsistency in his telling Dr Nielssen that he was no longer suffering auditory hallucinations and subsequently telling the court that he was, that explanation being that the hallucinations stopped for a short time but subsequently returned. In fact, the appellant explicitly ventilated this possibility in his evidence in cross-examination, in the following exchange, which occurred prior to the exchange quoted in the previous paragraph:
	


“Q. You see, sir, what I am asking you is if the voices stopped shortly after you were released on bail in early October 2013, then the evidence that you gave yesterday at 497 line 25 that the voices continue to this day can't be true?

A. It’s been two years. If they finished for a short amount of time. I’m sure there’s a reasonable explanation for how that medically happens but I can’t answer that.”


	
	As the appellant accepted, the Crown Prosecutor was entitled to test the evidence on auditory hallucinations, which was at least potentially conflicting. However, he contended that the way the questioning occurred resulted in a degree of complexity which made it difficult for the appellant on an important issue.
	
	
	It is true that the questioning on this topic was, at times, complex, and that the transcript indicates that the appellant may have found it confusing. However, it also demonstrates that he understood the core proposition being put to him, which was that the two statements were inconsistent. He attempted to answer that proposition. To the extent that his answers required further clarification, that opportunity was potentially available in re-examination. In those circumstances, no unfairness arose by reason of the questioning on auditory hallucinations.
	


Cross-examination on history of drug consumption given to Dr Allnutt


	
	The appellant had told Dr Allnutt that he had not taken any drugs, including cannabis, on the day of the stabbing incident. His evidence to the jury was to the contrary. The appellant accepted that the Crown Prosecutor was entitled to cross-examine on this inconsistency. Again, the complaint made related to the manner in which the cross-examination was undertaken.
	
	
	One, if not the most, significant complaint made of the cross-examination is that it misrepresented the appellant’s evidence in chief. In his evidence in chief, the appellant said that he believed he would have smoked cannabis during the course of the day of the incident. He was asked what was his “general daily consumption, at about that time in September 2012, of cannabis”. The appellant said that that that it was “slightly over a gram during the day”, which he broke down to being “around 20, 30 [cones] maybe, throughout the entire day”.
	
	
	In cross-examination, the appellant was asked:
	


“Is it correct that when you gave your evidence a couple of days ago … you gave evidence about having smoked 20 or 30 cones on that day?”


	
	The appellant stated that he thought that was “out of context” and that he had said he “smoked 20 or 30 cones a day, like daily not that day”. The appellant, exhibiting an accurate recall of his evidence two days previously, said he did not think he had been asked how much he had “smoked on that day”. The Crown Prosecutor read an additional part of his evidence to the appellant and then posed the question, “[n]ow do you want to change the answer that you gave a minute ago?”.
	
	
	There was an objection and short argument, after which her Honour pointed out that the appellant’s answer on which he was being cross-examined had related to his general consumption of cannabis. At that point, the Crown Prosecutor withdrew the question. On the appeal, the appellant complained that the question had only been withdrawn “after a struggle”, that is, after objection was taken.
	
	
	No unfairness has been shown in this part of the cross-examination. The appellant had remembered his evidence accurately. When the Crown Prosecutor challenged the appellant, trial counsel, as it was his function, rightly objected. The trial judge, as was required of her, dealt with the objection and pointed out the Crown Prosecutor the error in his question and the Crown Prosecutor withdrew the question.
	
	
	The next complaint related to a series of questions which caused the appellant to state that he was becoming “confused”. The questioning again related to the appellant having told Dr Allnutt that he had not taken “illicit drugs” on the day of the incident. He was asked whether he was hiding something from Dr Allnutt. The appellant said he was not and that he “must have been confused” when he told Dr Allnutt something that was not correct. He suggested his confusion might have been due to the Seroquel.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor then asked the following two questions (although not sequentially):
	


“Q. You see, you told Dr Allnutt that you hadn’t taken any illicit drugs on that day, because that’s the truth, isn’t it?

A. No, it’s not.

…

Q. And you hadn’t smoked illicit drugs?

A. No.”


	
	The Crown Prosecutor next asked, “And you formed some dislike of [the victim]?”, to which the appellant responded:
	


“Yes, I had smoked illicit drugs. Look, I’m getting confused again. This constant roll of questioning is just not helping answer questions for me, so, I’m just unable to keep up.”


	
	There is no doubt that the two questions quoted above at [84] were at least confusing, and inaccurate, if they were intended to ask whether it was the position that the appellant had not smoked illicit drugs on the day of the incident. However, if they were intended to relate to what the appellant told Dr Allnutt, the questions were accurate, but confusing. The appellant realised the confusion and made it clear that he had smoked illicit drugs on the day of the incident.
	
	
	The trial judge again appropriately intervened and suggested to the Crown Prosecutor that he commence with a proposition at a time. She also informed the appellant that if he needed to pause before answering he could do so.
	
	
	There is no doubt that it would have been better had the cross-examination flowed smoothly and without the occasional mistaken question and the compound questions of which complaint is made. However, on each occasion that there was some uncertainty or confusion or error in the questioning, the trial judge dealt with the matter appropriately. To the extent that there were compound questions, that has also been dealt with that above.
	


The Evidence Act, s 44 issue


	
	During the course of oral argument, the question arose whether some or any of the questioning offended the Evidence Act, s 44. Section 44 provides:
	


“44   Previous representations of other persons

(1)   Except as provided by this section, a cross-examiner must not question a witness about a previous representation alleged to have been made by a person other than the witness.

(2)   A cross-examiner may question a witness about the representation and its contents if:

(a)   evidence of the representation has been admitted, or

(b)   the court is satisfied that it will be admitted.”


	
	The Crown submitted that s 44 had not been contravened as the representations about which the appellant was being asked were statements made by him and not by another person. To the extent that that was the nature of the questioning, we agree that s 44 was not contravened. However, there were other complaints made as to questions asked of the appellant to explain why someone else would say or report something. In particular, the appellant was asked questions in respect of the contents of the report of the psychologist and why he could not remember what he told her, but could remember other things. The questions asked were:
	


“Have you got any explanation for why she would have recorded [that he had decided to vacate the drug scene] if you hadn’t told her?

…

You’ve got no explanation why a professional psychologist would record that if it wasn’t what you said?

…

How is it you can’t remember what you said to Kathi Pauncz on 14 September but you can remember you had a good time at the ball?”


	
	It should be noted that there was an objection to this last question, but on the basis that it did not make sense, in that there was no logical connection between the two propositions raised by the question. The appellant submitted on the appeal that the question was therefore confusing. No objection was taken to any of the questioning on the basis that it offended s 44.
	
	
	The last question was reformulated in terms:
	


“You can’t remember what you told your psychologist on 14 September but you can remember whether you enjoyed yourself at the ball, is that what you’re telling the jury?”


	
	There was nothing objectionable or impermissible in the question as reformulated, which involved a testing of the appellant’s credit.
	
	
	There was a further exchange where the Crown Prosecutor asked the appellant whether he wanted “to answer [the] question”. An objection was taken and the trial judge, in effect, counselled the Crown Prosecutor that there had been an attempt to answer the question. Her Honour asked the Crown Prosecutor whether he wished to raise another question, at which point the Crown said that he would “move on”. In our opinion, this was an appropriate management of the trial and the cross-examination by her Honour. In those circumstances, no unfairness to the appellant arose.
	


Conclusion on ground 1


	
	We do not consider that any specific element of the cross-examination raised by the appellant was unfair in the sense that warrants appellate intervention. We also do not believe, having had regard to the transcript as a whole and particularly to those aspects of the cross-examination which the appellant identified as being unfair, that its cumulative effect was unfair. The cross-examination continued over three days and, necessarily, traversed a substantial number of complex issues. It is apparent from the transcript that it occurred in a somewhat combative atmosphere as between the appellant’s counsel and the Crown Prosecutor. However, this did not result in questioning that was unfair, improper, or contrary to s 41. To the extent that it appears that the appellant may have been occasionally confused, such confusion was generally cured in subsequent questioning and, on occasion, by appropriate interventions by the trial judge, and no unfairness arose.
	
	
	Ground 1 of the appeal should be dismissed.
	


Ground 2: failure to adequately address the jury on the “second branch” of the M’Naghten test


	
	The appellant submitted that the trial judge failed to adequately address the jury on the second branch of the M’Naghten test. He submitted that in particular, her Honour failed to explain that his capacity to understand the wrongfulness of his actions did not turn upon whether he knew his actions were illegal.
	
	
	As the appellant did not request any further or other direction in respect of the mental illness defence at trial, leave is required to raise this ground of appeal pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Rules, r 4.
	
	
	It is well established that the requirements of r 4 are not mere technicalities and that the grant of leave is not lightly given: ARS v R [2011] NSWCCA 266 per Bathurst CJ at [148]. The Chief Justice observed that although a failure to seek a further direction at trial may be explicable:
	


“An unexplained failure to take the point at the trial is usually a reasonably reliable indicator of the fairness and adequacy of the summing-up: Tekely v R [2007] NSWCCA 75 at [88], [130].”


	
	In Jubraeel v R [2015] NSWCCA 131, at [24], Macfarlan JA stated that in order for leave to be granted under r 4, an appellant was required to satisfy the court that the failure to give a particular direction had caused a miscarriage of justice or at least that there was a possibility that that was the case.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that as the trial judge was obliged to properly direct the jury on the elements of the defence mental illness and given that there was no conceivable tactical reason for trial counsel to decline to ask for the direction, the grant of leave was justified.
	
	
	The Crown objected to the grant of leave, contending that the trial judge’s directions to the jury were adequate.
	


Relevant legal principles


	
	The principles relevant to the defence of mental illness were summarised in R v Pratt [2009] NSWSC 1108 by R A Hulme J, as follows:
	


“15   The only real issue in this trial is whether the accused has available to her the defence of mental illness. It is a matter for her to establish not beyond reasonable doubt but on the balance of probabilities: Mizzi v The Queen [1960] HCA 77; (1960) 105 CLR 659.

16   Section 38(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 provides:

If, in an indictment or information, an act or omission is charged against a person as an offence and it is given in evidence on the trial of the person for the offence that the person was mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his or her action at the time when the act was done or omission made, then, if it appears to the jury before which the person is tried that the person did the act or made the omission charged, but was mentally ill at the time when the person did or made the same, the jury must return a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness.

17   The Act does not define the term ‘mentally ill’. That is something that must be determined in accordance with the M’Naghten Rules laid down in R v M’Naghten (1843) 8 ER 718:

Every man is to be presumed to be sane; and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary is proven ...; that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the quality and nature of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong.

18   To establish that the accused was mentally ill so as not to be responsible according to law for her acts of killing Mr and Mrs Keyte she must show that, as a result of a defect of reason from a disease of the mind, she did not appreciate the nature and quality of those physical acts or that she did not know that those acts were wrong.

19   In relation to the concept of a ‘disease of the mind’ which produces such a defect of reason, the law requires that the accused’s state of mind must have been one of disease, disorder or disturbance arising from some condition. The condition may be temporary or of long standing. It does not matter whether it is curable or incurable. It must result in the function of the reason, memory or understanding of the person being thrown into a state of derangement or disorder. A defect of reason, memory or understanding involves a disorder of the capacity to reason such as one that prevented the accused from knowing what she was doing, in that she did not know the physical nature or quality of her acts, or did not know that those acts were wrong, that is, wrong according to the ordinary standards of reasonable people in our community.

20   As to whether the accused did not know the acts to be wrong, the question is whether the accused could be said to know, in the sense of appreciating or understanding that the acts were wrong, if through a disease, disorder or disturbance of the mind she could not think rationally of the reasons which, to ordinary people, would make that act right or wrong.

21   A final matter to observe is that if through a disordered condition of the mind the accused could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure, it would be open to find that she did not know that what she was doing was wrong.”


	
	These principles were applied by this court in Da-Pra v R [2014] NSWCCA 211 at [9]-[10] per Emmett JA; [265] per R A Hulme and Bellew JJ.
	


Trial judge’s directions to the jury


	
	The trial judge gave written questions to the jury to answer. The questions in respect of the appellant’s defence of mental illness were in the following terms:
	


“Are you satisfied on the balance of probabilities (i.e that it is more likely than not), that at the time of the stabbing [the appellant] suffered from a disease of the mind which produced a defect in his capacity to reason and, as a result of that defect of reason, he:

a)   did not appreciate the nature or physical quality of the stabbing; or

b)   he did not know it was wrong according to the ordinary standards of reasonable people in our community, (noting that [the appellant’s] reasoning must be able to be done with a moderate degree of sense and composure)?

•   If ‘yes’ to either (a) or (b) then the verdict for Charge 1 must be ‘not guilty on the ground of mental illness’ and you do not go to charge 2.

•   If ‘no’, to (a) and (b) then proceed to question 3.”


	
	In her summing up, her Honour directed the jury by reference to the written questions in the following terms:
	


“Question two asks you whether you are satisfied on the balance of probabilities, that it is more likely than not that at the time [the appellant] stabbed [the victim], [the appellant] suffered from a disease of the mind which produced a defect in his capacity to reason and as a result of that defect he did not appreciate the nature or physical quality of the stabbing or he did not know it was wrong according to the ordinary standards of reasonable people in our community. Now there you should note that [the appellant’s reasoning must be able to be done with the moderate degree of sense and composure.”


	
	Her Honour returned to the defence of mental illness later in her summing up and directed the jury as follows:
	


“The next step is question 2 and that’s a step concerned with mental illness. Now this is where the onus shifts and it is the only point in this trial where it shifts and it shifts to [the appellant] at that lesser standard, on the balance of probabilities. So here if you conclude that the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the stabbing was voluntary then you must consider the question raised on behalf of [the appellant] that he was mentally ill so as not to be criminally responsible according to law. [The appellant] will not be criminally responsible according to law if he satisfies you on the balance of probabilities, that is that it is more likely than not, that at the time of the stabbing he suffered from a disease of mind which produced a defect in his capacity to reason … It must be such a disorder of the capacity to reason in moderate degree that it prevents him from knowing, appreciating or understanding the nature or physical quality of that stabbing or that it prevents him from knowing, appreciating or understanding that it was wrong according to the ordinary standards of reasonable people in our community.

If [the appellant] satisfies you on the balance of probabilities that through a disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the stabbing with a moderate degree of sense and composure it would be open to you to find that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.”


	
	These directions accorded with the relevant principles as summarised in Pratt and applied in Da-Pra, the latter case to which her Honour was referred by trial counsel for the appellant.
	


Appellant’s submissions


	
	The appellant contended that her Honour erred in failing to direct the jury that the “second branch” of the M’Naghten test, that is, that the appellant did not know that his actions were wrong, was not concerned with whether he knew that his actions were legally wrong. In other words, the appellant contended that the directions failed to distinguish between whether he knew his actions were legally wrong and whether he knew his actions were wrong according to the ordinary standards of reasonable people in the community. He submitted that the omission to give this explanation meant that the direction was not tailored to the circumstances of the case.
	
	
	The appellant contended that in Stapleton v R [1952] HCA 56; 86 CLR 358 the High Court (Dixon CJ, Webb and Kitto JJ) affirmed that the relevant test under the M’Naghten rules was whether the accused knew that his actions wrong according to the ordinary principles of reasonable men, not whether he knew that it was wrong because it was contrary to law. The Court, at 370 and 375, reasoned as follows:
	


“The critical thing in the traditional test was capacity to distinguish right and wrong that is of course in reference to the act committed. In cases of murder the difference between capacity to understand the wrongness and the legality of the act often might not be of much significance. But in a case like Hadfield's it might be decisive. For Hadfield's mania led him to do the very act for the purpose of causing others to take his life by judicial process.

…

The truth perhaps is that, from a practical point of view, it cannot often matter a great deal whether the capacity of the accused person is measured by his ability to understand the difference between right or wrong according to reasonable standards, or to understand what is punishable by law, because in serious things the two ideas are not easily separable. But in certain cases, where the insane motives of the accused arise from complete incapacity to reason as to what is right or wrong (his insane judgment even treating the act as one of inexorable obligation or inescapable necessity) he may yet have at the back of his mind an awareness that the act he proposes to do is punishable by law.”


	
	The appellant submitted that in this case, the jury could not properly apply the test to the evidence without an appreciation of the distinction between capacity to understand wrongfulness and knowledge of illegality. He contended that this issue was raised in that aspect of the evidence that related to him having passed the knife to another person after the stabbing. On the Crown case, this exhibited a consciousness of guilt. It was also the subject of cross-examination of the appellant and of expert psychiatric evidence.
	
	
	The appellant had accepted that he knew that it was illegal to carry a knife in public place, but he did not concede that he knew at the relevant time that the stabbing was morally wrong. His response to this questioning in cross-examination that that he could not say that he knew he had “done something terribly wrong with that knife” or that stabbing was the wrong thing to do.
	
	
	Drs Allnutt, Westmore and Nielssen all accepted that passing a knife to another person could be consistent with the appellant knowing that what he had done was wrong. However, as they each explained, a mentally ill person often committed an act of violence knowing that it was wrong in the legal sense. What was relevant psychiatrically, however, was whether the person understood their act was wrong in the moral sense. Dr Westmore explained:
	


“… paranoid people usually know that if they harm somebody … you know that you’ll get into trouble if you hurt them but because of your perception of them, your misinterpretation and misunderstanding, you don’t actually care … the capacity to think about it morally is compromised …”


	
	The difficulty in this case was that because of the appellant’s amnesia in respect of the incident it was not possible to know what he was thinking.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen was of the opinion that the appellant’s emerging mental illness deprived him of the ability to reason with any composure about the wrongful action. Dr Nielssen was also of the opinion that the appellant had acted under a delusional belief that he was under threat from the victim. However, Dr Nielssen agreed that the fact of passing the knife and of telling the security guard that the victim “started it” was consistent with knowledge that he was in some kind of trouble and one possible explanation for this behaviour was it the appellant knew he had done something wrong and wanted to escape from it.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that given his amnesia, the cross-examination of Dr Nielssen failed to draw the distinction between knowledge of wrongfulness and knowledge of the illegality.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that Stapleton was not authority that a direction had to be given in the terms for which the appellant now contended, but rather was to be understood in the context of the direction that had been given to the jury in that case. That direction had been in the following terms:
	


“… [the appellant] must satisfy them upon a balance of probabilities that he suffered from a disease disorder or disturbance of the mind of such a character as to prevent him from knowing the physical nature of the act he did or knowing that he did was wrong, that is against the law.”

Consideration


	
	In our opinion, Stapleton is not authority for the proposition that a jury is to be directed that the test for whether the person knew his actions were wrong was not concerned with whether the person knew that his actions were legally wrong.
	
	
	As the Crown has explained, the direction that was given in Stapleton suggested that the relevant test was whether the person knew that what had been done was legally wrong. That was a test that had been applied in the English decision R v Windle (1952) 2 QB 826. The High Court in Stapleton, after extensively reviewing the authorities, determined that that decision should not be followed. It was in that context that the Court made the observation at 375 upon which the appellant relied.
	
	
	The High Court had earlier observed, at 367, that:
	


“No doubt there are cases in which it would be no advantage to explain what is meant by knowing that the act was wrong to a jury.”


	
	Their Honours considered, however, at 367, that in the case before them, an explanation of what is meant by knowing the act was wrong might have given the jury a better opportunity of understanding the considerations upon which a conclusion in favour of the prisoner depended. Later, at 375, their Honours further observed:
	


“While as we have said it is not probable that because of this direction alone we would have ordered a new trial, it is desirable to say that if a jury were to lay hold of this point that the accused must be incapable of understanding that he was acting contrary to law as distinguished from appreciating that his act was wrong according to the ordinary standards adopted by reasonable men, the distinction would tell against the appellant.”


	
	In this case, there was no such wrong direction as had been given by the trial judge in Stapleton. Further, as the above passage makes clear, even in Stapleton, that wrong direction would not have been sufficient for the appeal to succeed. There were other grounds in the case that supported the appeal.
	
	
	In our opinion, the trial judge’s directions were adequate. Leave to raise this ground of appeal should be refused.
	


Appeal against sentence


	
	The appellant raised two grounds of appeal should leave be granted to appeal on sentence:
	


1.   That the sentencing judge gave insufficient weight to the evidence concerning his mental condition: ground 3 of the notice of appeal;

2.   That the sentencing judge gave an insufficient discount to the appellant for his offer to plead guilty to reckless wounding: ground 4 of the notice of appeal.


	
	As these grounds were developed in oral argument, the appellant contended that the trial judge erred in the following respects in sentencing him:
	



	
	In her Honour’s understanding of the legal effect of the jury verdict which rejected the defence of mental illness;
	
	
	In considering that the jury verdict meant that her Honour was not herself permitted or required to determine whether the actions were substantially carried out whilst he was substantially impaired by his mental illness;
	
	
	In her Honour’s determination that general deterrence was relevant in sentencing the appellant;
	
	
	In her Honour’s assessment of the extent to which the appellant’s mental illness would impact upon the conditions of custody;
	
	
	In her Honour’s failing to give appropriate effect to the appellant’s offer to plead guilty to the offence of reckless wounding.
	


Ground 3: insufficient weight given to the appellant’s mental illness


	
	By way of overall submission, the appellant submitted that the trial judge, in sentencing him, reduced his mental illness to something of insignificance.
	
	
	In the remarks on sentence, the trial judge observed, at 4, that the offences of the nature of which the appellant was convicted “generally speaking are serious” and that in this case the use of a knife to inflict the wound made the offence “particularly serious” and ordinarily called for a strong measure of general deterrence in the sentencing process. Her Honour, at 5, considered that wounding itself was relatively serious. Her Honour further observed that a person’s mental condition was not relevant to the assessment of the objective circumstances of the purpose of applying standard non-parole period provisions: Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.
	
	
	Her Honour observed, at 7, that by finding the appellant guilty of reckless wounding, the jury were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he realised he might possibly cause actual bodily harm to the victim and yet went ahead and stabbed him. Her Honour commented that evidence of mental illness did not give rise to a reasonable doubt in that regard. Her Honour also observed, at 8, that the paranoia from which the appellant was suffering “was not to the extent that it was a psychosis that negated his capacity to know the wrongfulness of his actions”. No complaint is made in respect of these remarks.
	
	
	Her Honour, however, made four observations which are challenged by the appellant as involving error.
	
	
	First, her Honour considered that, as the jury were not satisfied of the defence of mental illness, it could be concluded that they rejected the reasonable possibility that the appellant was delusional, insofar as he had an inability to reason right from wrong.
	
	
	Her Honour stated that this was because an aspect of the defence of mental illness was that the appellant did not know it was wrong according to the ordinary standards of reasonable people in the community. The appellant challenges the correctness of this observation.
	
	
	Secondly, her Honour stated that the jury verdict rejected the conclusion that the appellant was impaired in appreciating the nature of physical quality of the stabbing or in knowing that it was wrong according to ordinary standards of reasonable people in the community.
	
	
	Thirdly, her Honour stated that the jury verdict rejected the reasonable possibility that the appellant was psychotic in a way that prevented him from knowing the nature or physical quality of the stabbing or from knowing that it was wrong according to the ordinary standards of reasonable people in our community.
	
	
	Fourthly, her Honour stated that the expert evidence regarding mental health, when considered in the context of the jury verdict, gave rise to the conclusion that the appellant was probably paranoid at the time of the offence but not to an extent as to prevent him appreciating the nature of the offence and the fact that it was wrong.
	
	
	We agree with the appellant that the first and second of these comments revealed error. The fact that the jury did not accept the defence of mental illness meant that they were not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the appellant’s thinking was compromised to the point where he did not know the difference between right and wrong.
	
	
	Her Honour, by reference to the decisions of this Court in R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 and R v Z [2006] NSWCCA 342, discussed the principles that govern the sentencing of a person suffering from a mental illness which was not sufficient to constitute a defence. In Israil Spigelman CJ stated, at [23]:
	


“To the extent that mental illness explains the offence – as her Honour found to be the position in the present case – then an offender’s inability to understand the wrongfulness of his actions, or to make reasonable judgments, or to control his or her faculties and emotions, will impact on the level of culpability of the offender, even where the illness does not amount to an excuse at law.”


	
	Her Honour also rejected, consistent with authority, the proposition that intoxication can mitigate the seriousness of an offence or reduce the offender’s culpability: Hassan v R [2010] VSC 352 at [21]; GWM v R [2012] NSWCCA 240 at [82]; and ZZ v R [2013] NSWCCA at [110]. Her Honour remarked that it was difficult to say in this case the extent to which the appellant’s paranoia as opposed to any intoxication contributed to the offending conduct, but considered that it was the only compelling explanation and noted that there was evidence of increasing paranoia in the months prior to the commission of the offence.
	
	
	Her Honour concluded, therefore, that the appellant’s moral culpability was reduced by virtue of his mental health. Her Honour, in observations which are also challenged, continued:
	


“The extent of the reduction, however, is not as great as might have been available if [the appellant] did not fully appreciate his actions were wrong.

Here the surreptitious passing of the knife to another is evidence that [the appellant] well knew that it was wrong. Any impairment in that regard was not great at all, or even significant.”


	
	In my opinion, these last remarks constitute error. If the appellant “did not fully appreciate his actions were wrong”, the defence of mental illness would have been made out. Whilst it is correct that the surreptitious passing of the knife was evidence upon which the jury could have determined that the appellant had some understanding that what he did was wrong and provided a basis in the evidence for rejecting the defence, it was not evidence that his impairment in respect of his ability to know his actions were wrongful was “not great at all, or even significant”. The psychiatric evidence was uniformly to the opposite effect, and the jury verdict left open the possibility that the appellant was impaired in that ability to some degree.
	
	
	The principles that govern the assessment of the impact that a mental illness may have upon the sentence to be imposed upon a particular accused were discussed in depth in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1. In that case, McClellan CJ at CL, at [177], held:
	


“Where an offender is suffering from a mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental problems the courts have developed principles to be applied when sentencing: see, eg, R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67; R v Tsiarias [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400; R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267 at [40] – [48]; Lauritsen v R [2000] WASCA 203; (2000) 114 A Crim R 333 at [43] – [51]; R v Harb [2001] NSWCCA 249 at [35] – [45]; R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255; R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33] – [36]; R v Verdins [2007] VSCA 102 at [32]; Courtney v R [2007] NSWCCA 195 at [14]-[18]; and R v Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90 at [28]. They can be summarised in the following manner:

● Where the state of a person’s mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence: R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at [254]; Miller v R [1999] WASCA 66 at [23]; R v Jiminez [1999] WASCA 7 at [23], [25]; Tsiaras at 400; Lauritsen at [51]; Israil at [23]; R v Pearson [2004] NSWCCA 129 at [43]; Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90 at [28].

● It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed: Engert at 71; R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 50 – 51; Israil at [22]; Pearson at [42]; Henry at [28].

● It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person. Because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced: Tsiaris at 400; Jiminez at [25]; Israil at [26]; Henry at [28].

● It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence: Courtney at [14]; Tsiaras at 400; Israil at [25]; JW at [192].

● Conversely, it may be that because of a person’s mental illness, they present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances, considerations of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence: Israil at [24]; Henry at [28]. Where a person has been diagnosed with an Antisocial Personality Disorder there may be a particular need to give consideration to the protection of the public: R v Lawrence (2005) NSWCCA 91 per Spigelman CJ at [23] - [24].”


	
	As the discussion in De La Rosa makes clear, where a person’s mental health contributes in in a material way to the offending conduct, the person’s moral culpability may be reduced. In our opinion, the effect of the four passages of the remarks on sentence of which complaint is made, and her Honour’s conclusion reproduced at [138], which, in any event, contained a misstatement of the law, demonstrated that she failed to adequately consider the extent of the appellant’s mental condition. This was so, notwithstanding that her Honour accepted that the appellant was probably paranoid at the time that he committed the offence. The appellant’s submissions on this aspect of the appeal against sentence should be accepted.
	


General deterrence


	
	The appellant further complained that her Honour erred in finding that general deterrence was relevant to the sentence that ought to be imposed. The appellant also contended that in determining that general deterrence was applicable to the sentencing process that she was undertaking, the trial judge made three additional errors.
	
	
	First, the appellant contended that her Honour erred in stating that he had picked up the knife and put it in his pocket where he kept it knowing that he was going to the hotel. Her Honour considered that that bore an integral connection with the offence. The appellant submitted, correctly, that that observation was not established by the evidence.
	
	
	Secondly, her Honour repeated the error to which reference has already been made, that the appellant “fully knew that what he was doing was wrong, as evidenced by the attempt to hand the knife to somebody else”.
	
	
	Thirdly, her Honour found that the appellant realised the possibility of causing actual bodily harm to the victim, but nonetheless persisted in stabbing him. Whilst that observation was properly made by her Honour, the appellant submitted that it was not sufficient of itself to make general deterrence an appropriate consideration in the sentencing process.
	
	
	In our opinion, this was a case where, as was observed in De La Rosa, general deterrence had no real role to play in the sentencing process. As was said by Young CJ in R v Mooney (Court of Criminal Appeal (Vic), 21 June 1978, unreported):
	


“General deterrence should often be given very little weight in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or abnormality because such an offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example to others.”

That passage was quoted with approval by the High Court in Muldrock. The appellant was mentally ill at the time of his offending and, indeed, significantly so. We consider that her Honour erred in considering that this matter was “deserving of a message of general deterrence”.


	
	In our opinion, as the trial judge erred in the sentencing process in the respects to which we have thus far referred, the Court is required to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh to determine whether some other sentence which is less severe is warranted and should have been imposed: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 at [42]. Before embarking on that process, it is necessary to consider ground 4. We would only add that having regard to the conclusion at which we have arrived, it has not been necessary to consider the appellant’s further complaints about the sentencing process.
	


Ground 4: discount for offer of an early plea


	
	The appellant had offered to plead guilty to reckless wounding in the Local Court on 4 April 2013, on condition that the matter be finalised in that Court. This offer was rejected and the appellant was committed for trial in the District Court. In July 2013, he made a further offer to plead guilty to reckless wounding, this time in its indictable form before the District Court. That offer was also rejected. A further offer to plead guilty to reckless wounding was made on 17 November 2014, two days before the appellant was arraigned before the jury.
	
	
	Her Honour, in sentencing the appellant, considered that it was not appropriate to give a full discount for the offers of the plea, but considered that fairness dictated that a discount of 15 per cent ought to be allowed.
	
	
	The question is then whether her Honour erred in only allowing a discount of 15 per cent for the offer of pleas of guilty. Her Honour referred, inter alia, to Morton v R [2014] NSWCCA 8; and R v Hamouche [2005] NSWCCA 398; 158 A Crim R 357. Whilst acknowledging that there is no automatic entitlement to a discount of 25 per cent for an early plea, the appellant submitted, however, that her Honour, in relying upon the authorities to which we have referred, failed to recognise that that the question in this case was different from those cases in that here, the case had proceeded to trial on a more serious charge and he had ultimately been found guilty of the alternative offence to which he had offered to plead.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that in R v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310; and R v Cardoso [2003] NSWCCA 15; 137 A Crim R 535 (the latter cited in Morton as her Honour had noted), it had been held that an offender should be given the benefit of the utilitarian value of an offer to plead guilty to the offence of which ultimately convicted. Thus, in Cardoso, Hidden J stated, at [19]:
	


“The applicant had offered to plead guilty to a lesser charge which could fairly be justified on the available evidence and which, in the event, the jury found to be the appropriate measure of his culpability. The Crown chose not to accept that offer, a matter which was beyond the applicant’s control. If the offer had been accepted, the same result would have been achieved without the necessity of a trial.”


	
	We do not consider that much weight (if any) should be attached to the conditional offer to plead to the summary form of the offence. However, greater allowance should have been made for the utilitarian value of the appellant’s offer to plead guilty to the indictable offence. For that reason, we would also allow ground 4 of the appeal. In our opinion, the plea to which full regard ought to be had was that made in July 2013 and that an appropriate discount for the utilitarian value of the plea was in the order of 20 per cent.
	


Resentence


	
	We have not found it necessary to set out the appellant’s personal circumstances or to further refer to his mental health history. Nor have we found it necessary to consider whether her Honour erred in the manner in which she had regard to whether the appellant’s period in custody would be more onerous.
	
	
	Brief reference should be made, however, to the affidavit evidence, tendered at the hearing against the possibility that he should be resentenced by this Court. In an affidavit sworn on 6 November 2015, Bryan Wrench, solicitor, deposed as to difficulties faced by the appellant in receiving treatment in custody, in that he had had difficulties in obtaining his medication and had not been seen by a psychiatrist since his sentencing. Mr Wrench also gave evidence of difficulties in obtaining a mental health report from Justice Health. As at the day on which the appellant was sentenced, no such report was available.
	
	
	Annexed to the affidavit was a copy of the appellant’s Bachelor of Fine Art (Honours) degree, which he completed in custody, and a highly commendatory reference from an academic at the National Art School. Mr Wrench also gave evidence in relation to what the appellant would do on release. He deposed that the appellant’s parents would undertake his care and support as had been the case with previous bail conditions, that he would continue to see his treating psychiatrist, Dr Cassidy, and that he would comply with a management plan outlined by Dr Allnutt, which was annexed to the affidavit.
	
	
	On 30 November 2015, pursuant to orders made at the hearing, the Crown filed an affidavit of Jennifer Ramsay, solicitor with the carriage of the matter in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, sworn on that date, which annexed a copy of the appellant’s Justice Health records. Those records broadly confirmed difficulties the appellant had in obtaining treatment in custody, including difficulties in obtaining medication. In particular, the appellant had seen a mental health nurse practitioner and a general practitioner, but not a psychiatrist, while in custody.
	
	
	In resentencing the appellant, we have had regard to the seriousness of the offence, which was violent and unprovoked and resulted in a wound to the victim which penetrated to the muscle layer of the abdomen, albeit that the wound appears to have had no long-term effects. We have found that the appellant’s moral culpability was reduced by his mental state at the time of the stabbing. Further, we consider that he should be given the benefit of a discount of approximately 20 per cent for his offer to plead guilty. Taking into account those factors, we consider that the appropriate head sentence is 2 years and 6 months.
	
	
	Having regard to the appellant’s subjective circumstances, including his mental health and in particular the fact that the conditions of his imprisonment have been particularly onerous by reason of his mental health, we consider that special circumstances exist such that it is appropriate to vary the statutory ratio between the appellant’s head sentence and the non-parole period pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 44. We would impose a non-parole period of 13 months. In imposing this period, we acknowledge that it involves a substantial departure from the statutory ratio specified by s 44. However, we consider that that is the appropriate period given that the appellant’s mental illness requires more specialised treatment than he is presently receiving.
	
	
	The commencement of the sentence must be backdated to take account of the 119 days that the appellant had spent in custody prior to sentencing by the trial judge. We also make an additional allowance of 12 days to take into account the 21 days that the appellant spent on bail but in rehabilitation: see R v Anderson [2012] NSWCCA 175 per Davies J (Allsop P and Campbell J agreeing) at [41]-[42]. The appellant was sentenced by the trial judge on 31 March 2015. The appropriate date on which the sentence should commence is therefore 21 November 2014. The first day upon which the appellant is eligible to be released to parole is therefore 21 December 2015.
	
	
	We propose the following orders:
	


(1)   Appeal against conviction dismissed;

(2)   Grant leave to appeal against sentence;

(3)   Appeal against sentence allowed;

(4)   Quash the sentence imposed by the trial judge and in lieu thereof sentence the appellant as follows:

The appellant is sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 2 years and 6 months commencing on 21 November 2014, with a non-parole period of 13 months.

(5)   Direct that the appellant is to be released to parole on 21 December 2015.


	
	R S HULME AJ: In this matter I have had the advantage of reading the orders proposed by Beazley P and Davies J and their Honours’ reasons. I agree with their conclusions concerning ground 2 and with their remarks concerning the sentence to be imposed if the appeal against conviction fails. However, I do not agree with their Honours concerning ground 1. In my view the ground is made out and the Appellant’s conviction should be quashed.
	
	
	Leaving aside the issue of intent which the jury found that the Crown had not established, the Appellant’s defence was insanity, a topic on which he bore the onus of proof. The defence was undoubtedly assisted by the evidence of psychiatrists, but very relevant to it was the accuracy of what the Appellant had told them. His case was not assisted by the fact that, as he said, he had no memory for many of the events on the night in which the stabbing occurred, but, be that as it may, his credibility and the jury’s opinion of him was important.
	
	
	Necessarily involved in such issues is the accuracy of what he said but equally important is the impression he created. Any witness, particularly an accused, is liable to be hampered in creating a favourable impression if questions are unfair or indeed if there is any other unfairness, or departures from the dictates of a proper trial, while he is giving evidence.
	
	
	In my view there were such departures in this case. They took a variety of forms.
	
	
	Of course I do not suggest that every error in or departure from proper conduct will make a trial unfair. Furthermore, often a question can be withdrawn or an error corrected in circumstances where the conclusion becomes inevitable that the question or error can have had no effect. Even when that does not occur, one can commonly conclude that in the context of the totality of issues, an error pales into insignificance. However, I feel unable to so conclude that the number and nature of errors in this case can be so regarded.
	
	
	The substance of the complaint in ground 1 was that the cross-examination of the Appellant was unfair and involved:
	


Putting highly controversial and prejudicial assertions based upon inaccurate or inadequate factual foundations which, on occasion, were subsequently withdrawn;

Frequent use of compound or confusing questions;

Combative and aggressive questioning, at times accompanied by sarcastic or derisive comments; and

Unduly repetitive questioning.


	
	The Appellant’s evidence in chief extended for some 45 pages and actual cross-examination for some 60 pages. Those 60 pages occurred in 4 periods spread over 3 days and while some of the interruptions may have been necessary, they cannot have helped the jury or the Appellant. However, as the significance of the interruptions is unknown, I put them aside.
	
	
	It is impossible to refer to all of the errors I see without making these reasons unduly long and I shall content myself with examples. Some of the specific matters to which Beazley P and Davies J have adverted provide further examples of the suggested faults. Albeit at the cost of repetition, passages which lead me to the view that the cross-examination was unfair, and my views of them, are:
	


AB1418

Q.   The position is that you had, in fact, planned to go to this ball with Hugo and Fatty?

A.   I knew that Hugo had bought tickets. I hadn’t made my decision as of – as of that point.

AB1419

Q.   The plain fact of the matter is, isn’t it, that you planned to go to the ball with your two friends?

A.   Yeah. Somewhat-

Q.   There’s no doubt about it is there?

A.   I think there’s a little bit of doubt about it.

Q.   There’s no doubt about it sir, he said you’d planned it and you agree that you planned it, correct?


	
	The remark “There’s no doubt about it sir” is not part of a question but a comment or statement of opinion.
	


AB1422

Q.   Because as Mr Waterstreet’s trying to point out the year before you didn’t want to go?

A.   No I didn’t.

Q.   That’s right, and that’s what Hugo said, “Not usually the sort of person that would attend things like that”?

A.   Correct.

Q.   But on this occasion you were someone who wanted to attend things like that weren’t you?

A.   That’s questionable.

Q.   It’s not questionable sir, you dressed up, you planned it and you went, correct or not?

A.   Yes.

Q.   The reason was that you’d been in therapy, you’d been seeing your psychologist, you’d been on your medication and you were well?

A.   No I wasn’t.


	
	“It’s not questionable sir” is another comment or expression of opinion. The proposition that the Appellant was on medication was contrary to the Appellant’s evidence and there would seem to have been no basis in any other evidence or instructions the Crown could have had to put the proposition. The four psychiatrists who gave evidence at the trial, three of whom had given evidence before the questions were asked, agreed that the Appellant had an underlying disease of the mind at the time.
	


AB1424

Q.   Were you on any medication at all--

A.   No.

Q.   Can I ask the question first?

A.   Yes, you can.

Q.   Were you on any medication at all on 23 September 2013?

A.   No.

Q.   When you said a minute ago that you were –

A.   Yes.

Q.   -- what did you mean by that?

A.   Well, you were quite aggressive and it confuses me a bit when—

Q.   I see, it’s my fault. I’m sorry.

A.   That’s all right.

Q.   You were well on 23 September 2012, weren’t you?

A.   No.


	
	The witness had not, a “minute ago” or shortly before said he was on medication.
	


AB1424

Q.   You went to see Kathi Pauncz on 14 September 2012, a week before, didn’t you?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You had a consultation with her?

A.   Yes.

Q.   She took some notes about how you presented?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You know what she said, don’t you?

A.   Yes, I do.

Q.   You know that she said that you were enjoying your studies, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   That was true, wasn’t it?

A.   Yes.

Q.   She said that you feel like you’ve been maturing and that was true, wasn’t it?

A.   Yes.

Q.   She said you’re much more confident now and that was true, wasn’t it?

A.   Yes.

Q.   She said that given this year has made a difference, correct?

A.   That’s what she said.

Q.   She said and that’s what happened. That’s the truth?

A.   That’s what she said, yes.

Q.   That is what she said.

A.   Yes.

Q.   I’m asking you whether that’s true?

A.   I’m not sure what I said back then.

Q.   I’m suggesting to you that that’s what she said that you said?

A.   Yes.

Q.   I’m asking you whether it is true that given this year has made a big difference to you?

A.   No, that’s not true. That’s not – that’s not what I was actually feeling.

Q.   Do you have any explanation why she would record that?

A.   Yes, when I used to go to Kathi’s, I wasn’t getting gratification in my life from anywhere else, so I’d go there and present a false life that I was living so that she would feel – I’d get support from somebody or someone would—

Q.   You lied to your psychiatrist, did you, your psychologist?

A.   I didn’t lie, I was—

WATERSTREET: I object.


	
	The questioning involved assertions as to what had been recorded by Ms Pauncz and which was not in fact in evidence – c.f. Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), s 44.
	


AB1426

Q.   What about this: she says that you said you’ve seen the impact of drugs on others and you don’t want involvement in that scene?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Did you say that to her?

A.   I can’t say.

Q.   She’s recorded it. Do you accept that you must have?

A.   I could have.

Q.   It was true, wasn’t it?

A.   Possibly.

Q.   What do you mean possibly? Was it or wasn’t it?

A.   It was possibly true.

Q.   You mean you can’t remember whether in September of 2012 you’d decided to vacate the drug scene?

A.   No I can’t.

Q.   Are you serious?

A.   Yes.


	
	“She” in the first question was Ms Pauncz, the Appellant’s psychologist who was not called and from whom no report was in evidence. The questioning again involved assertions as to what had been recorded by Ms Pauncz and which was not in fact in evidence.
	


AB1427

Q.   You were well, healthy and had decided to abandon the drug scene?

A   No.

Q.   You’ve got no explanation why a professional psychologist would record that if it wasn’t what you said?

A.   I – I used to say – but I think this is quite a common thing that happens when people see psychologists is they say something along the lines of my friend is a heavy drug user or my friend is not feeling well and then they say they’re feeling well as a – a kind of way of disguising the – the embarrassment of not being well.

Q.   You went to the ball. You dressed up and you went with your friends?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You had a good time?

A.   No.

Q.   You didn’t have a good time?

A.   No.

Q.    You can remember that, can you?

A.   Well, I’m here.

Q.   Sorry?

A.   I am here so—

Q.   What does that mean?

A.   It didn’t go so well.

Q.   How is it you can’t remember what you said to Kathi Pauncz on 14 September but you can remember you had a good time at the ball?

WATERSTREET: I object to that. …


	
	The second question again involves an assertion of what Ms Pauncz had written and which was not in evidence. The last question misquotes evidence the Appellant had just given.
	


AB1429

Q.   You had been to the Brighton with your mates many times?

A.   Yes.   

Q.   It was one of your favourite drinking spots?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You felt comfortable going there this night?

A.   Yes

Q.   Because your mates were probably going to be there?

A.   Yeah, Fruits was there.

Q.   This wasn’t like the mall was it?

A.   No.

Q.   You didn’t feel uncomfortable in the pub like you say you felt uncomfortable in the mall?

A.   No, they were familiar faces there for me.

Q.   When you went to the Brighton you felt comfortable?

A.   I can’t say.

Q.   Well you must of sir all your friends were there, it wasn’t the mall, and—

A.   No, I can’t remember.

Q.   Page 490 at line 25 you were asked this question, “Do you know the Brighton Up Bar, or the Brighton bar?” Answer, “Yeah, the Brighton bar, I knew a lot of people there so that – that was a place that I was comfortable to go to”?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Do you want to change the answer you gave a minute ago?

A.   Can you re-put that question again?

Q.   I asked you a minute ago whether you felt comfortable going to the Brighton Bar and you said “No”?

A.   I wasn’t sure if you were putting it on that night or previous nights.

Q.   I’m putting to you that when you went there that night you felt comfortable?

A.   I can’t say. I don’t remember—

Q.   You’ve said it already—

WATERSTREET: Why did you ask it again?

CROWN PROSECUTOR

Q   You said it already sir, do you agree with that?


	
	The statement in the third last question “… you said ‘no’” misrepresents the evidence as does the statement “you’ve said it already”. Of course’ the concluding words quoted take a deal of the sting out of the last point and one must accept that Mr Waterstreet’s interruption may have been the cause of those words being uttered twice.
	


AB1445

Q.   Do you agree that that is what you told Dr Nielssen during the consultation on 3 June 2013?

A.   Yes.

Q.   It’s the truth, isn’t it?

A.   I’m not sure. I can’t remember the visit, I just said that at the beginning.

Q.   I hadn’t finished my question, would you like me to finish?

A.   Yes.

Q.   It’s the truth, isn’t it, that they did not continue to this very day?

A.   No that’s not the truth.


	
	Though perhaps not unusual and, if it stood alone, not meriting comment, the question “would you like me to finish” was sarcasm calculated to dominate or oppress the witness.
	


AB1462

Q.   You told him that you hadn’t taken any illicit drugs before the ball. Now do you agree that that’s what you told him or don’t you?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You do agree?

A.   Yes.

Q.   No doubt about it?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Is it correct that when you gave your evidence a couple of days ago, 484, you gave evidence about having smoked 20 or 30 cones on that day?

A.   I think that’s out of context. I think I said I smoked 20 or 30 cones a day like daily not that day. I don’t think that was ever put to me how many I had smoked on that day.

Q.   You were asked these questions, I’ll just pick you up on that, you were asked these questions, 485.

WATERSTREET: 484 I think.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: 485 question:

Q.   “How long have you been participating in the smoking of cones of cannabis?

A.   Since I was about 12, 13.

Q.   I take it this was not something your parents approved of?

A.   No.

Q.   But you did it anyway?

A.   Yes.

Q.   What effect did it have on you and why did—

A.   On that day or?

Q.   No, generally?

A.   It must calmed me down from, yeah.

Q.   Before this day you had been seeing various doctors for various ailments which I will go through later?

A.   Yes.

Q.   But on that day did you partake of cones surreptitiously from your father?

A.   Can you?

Q.   Yes, away from your father?

A.   Yes, I did.”

A.   Yes.

Q.   Now do you want to change the answer that you gave a minute ago?

WATERSTREET: What answer?

CROWN PROSECUTOR

Q.   You said—

A.   I thought you asked me if I had 20 or 30 cones before.

Q.   Before what?

A.   Before the ball on the day.

WATERSTREET: I object to “Do you want to change your answer?” What answer is he referring to, your Honour?

HER HONOUR: Well the witness has sought verification [sic] and I will allow Mr Crown to deal with it because I think it’s clear that the witness is trying to get clarification of that. Thank you, Mr Crown.

CROWN PROSECUTOR

Q.   You gave evidence didn’t you, as I’ve just read to you, that before the ball you smoked 20 or 30 cones.

WATERSTREET: I object.


	
	There followed discussion on the objection which concluded with her Honour remarking that she thought that at page 484 general consumption (as distinct from consumption on the day of the ball) was being talked about and the Crown Prosecutor withdrew his question. The questioning, calculated to pressure the witness, had proceeded on an erroneous premise.
	


AB1465

Q.   And you had been to see the psychologist a week before, hadn’t you?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And you were healthy and well?

A.   No.

Q.   And you were looking forward to the ball?

A.   No.

Q.   And you went to the Brighton Hotel because your friends were there?

A.   Yes.

Q.   The place you felt comfortable.

A.   Yes.

Q.   And you hadn’t had much to drink?

A.   No.

Q.   And you hadn’t smoked illicit drugs?

A.   No.

Q.   And you formed some dislike of Mr Sidhu?

A.   Yes, I had smoked illicit drugs. Look, I’m getting confused again. This constant roll of questioning is just not helping answer questions for me, so, I’m just unable to keep up.

WATERSTREET: It is repetitious, your Honour.


	
	Much of the passage was repetitious of cross examination that had occurred three times before – on pages AB 1429, 1435, and 1436. What followed does not indicate that the repetition was with a view to challenging the evidence or indeed for any apparent legitimate purpose, although her Honour said that she “sense[d] it’s a wrap up”.
	


AB1466

Q.   You didn’t have any symptoms of voices or paranoia before you went to Silverwater, did you?

A.   Before Silverwater?

Q.   Yes.

A.   No.

Q.   Silverwater [Prison] made an impression on you, didn’t it?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You hadn’t been diagnosed with any psychotic disorders before you went to Silverwater, had you?

A.   Bipolar and depression.

Q.   You weren’t diagnosed with that.

WATERSTREET: I object, your Honour.

CROWN PROSECUTOR

Q.   You were diagnosed with depression, not bipolar, were you?

A.   Okay.

…

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I withdraw the question.


	
	Despite the answer, the proposition, the subject of the first two questions, was surprising given that the prosecutor had obtained evidence from Dr Allnutt (AB 1214) that the Appellant’s thinking was becoming more paranoid before the offence. The second proposition was contrary to the evidence of the Appellant and to the common view of Dr Allnut (called by the Crown) and Dr Westmore (called by the Appellant) so it is difficult to see any basis for it. Although the words “You weren’t diagnosed with that” may have been part of a question interrupted by Mr Waterstreet’s objection, they certainly read as an assertion similar in form to those made in earlier cross-examination I have quoted, “There’s no doubt about it sir” (AB 1419), “It’s not questionable sir” (AB 1422), and “She’s recorded it” (AB 1426). Furthermore, during the Crown Prosecutor’s examination-in-chief of Dr Nielssen, the following exchange had occurred:
	


Q.   You were aware that at some stage during the course of his treatment prior to his incident, that he was tentatively diagnosed with bipolar at the Black Dog Institute.

A.   Yes.


	
	The Appellant’s involvement with the Black Dog Institute was prior to the commission of the offence and prior to him being in Silverwater Gaol. Given the evidence that the Prosecutor had adduced, it is impossible to see any justification for his challenge to the Appellant’s evidence just quoted. Certainly the withdrawal of the question removes some, but in my view not all, of the sting in what had earlier been said, as does the form of a further question substantially later:
	


AB1516

Q.   This is the position isn’t it – you can disagree with this if you wish, that you were diagnosed with depression prior to September 2012 but not with bipolar disorder?

A.   I believed I was diagnosed with bipolar as well.


	
	The next example to which I would refer was at AB 1517.
	


AB1517

Q.   What I’m suggesting to you is that you had planned, before you stabbed Mr Sidhu, to make a claim that the victim started it?

A.   I don’t know.

Q.   I’m suggesting to you – and you can disagree with this, that the reason why you went up to Mr Sidhu and I suggest said something to him in his left ear – very close – do you understand?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Was because you wanted him to react, didn’t you?

A.   I disagree. I also can’t say.


	
	There was evidence that shortly before the Appellant stabbed the victim he went close to the victim and whispered something in his ear. There was also evidence that shortly after the stabbing the Appellant had said to a security guard who was trying to remove the Appellant from the premises, “You need to get that other guy away from me or I’m going to stab him again.” While it is of course possible that the Appellant had the intention reflected in the first question just quoted, I am unable to see any basis for the positive suggestion in that question.
	


AB1519-1520

Q.   You knew that it was illegal in 2012 to carry a hunting knife into a hotel?

A.   Yes I just assumed that it was illegal full stop, yeah.

Q.   And you knew when you went into the hotel that you had a hunting knife in your pocket?

A.   No, as I said I can’t remember going into the hotel, so I can’t answer that question with my memory.

   …

Q.   I want to suggest to you that the reason that you took the knife into the pub was because you intended to stab someone with it?

A.   No.

Q.   When you got into the pub you lined up Mr Sidhu and you stabbed him?

A.   I can’t say.


	
	There was no evidence, except for his own statement that he had a habit of picking things up and had picked up the knife and put it in his pocket at the ball he had attended earlier in the evening, as to when, or in what circumstances, or for what purpose the Appellant acquired possession of the knife. There was uncontradicted evidence from the victim that he had never had anything to do with the Appellant previously and a deal of evidence to the effect that before the stabbing the Appellant had looked “a bit crazy in the face, in the eyes”, and had a “crazy weird look about him”, looked “quite scary” and “a bit kooky”. There was no basis for the positive suggestion that the Appellant had, prior to going into the hotel, formed the intention to stab anyone. The fact that, while in the hotel, he did stab the victim was quite insufficient to justify the question about intent.
	


AB1540

Q.   Sir, when I was cross-examining you earlier today I made a mistake which I want to correct, do you understand?

A.   Yes.

Q.   I put to you that before you entered the hotel you had the intention to stab Mr Sidhu, do you remember that?

A.   Yes I do.

Q.   I was wrong about that. What I want to put to you is that when you were in the pub sitting at the table, staring at Mr Sidhu, at that point you formed the intention to stab him?

A.   I can’t say.


	
	There was then an objection and her Honour asked:
	


Q.   Do you understand sir that what was being put to you is that you had not formed any particular intention to stab anyone before you went into the pub but your intention to stab someone, namely Mr Sidhu, arose whilst you were in the pub?

A.   That being the question.

Q.   That was what was put to you, do you agree with that or not?

A.   Yes I do.


	
	There was then further discussion following which the Crown said to the Appellant that he withdrew what he had said “to you earlier in the day”. There was more discussion and the cross-examination resumed.
	


Q.   I’m putting to you that when you were in the pub, shown on the CCTV footage sitting at the table staring at Mr Sidhu – do you understand?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Do you understand where we are at?

A.   Yes.

Q.   I’m putting to you that at that point you formed the intention to stab Mr Sidhu, do you understand what I’m putting to you?

A.   Yes, I do.

Q.   I’m asking you whether you agree with that, or don’t agree with that?

A.   I can’t say.

Q.   A second matter was a question that I asked you on Friday which was this: are you okay – you’re drifting off there, are you listening to me?

A.   Yeah, yeah.

Q.   The question was “You didn’t have any symptoms of voices or paranoia before you went to Silverwater, did you?” And you answered, “Before Silverwater?” And I said “Yes?” And you said “No.”, all right?

A.   Correct.

Q.   In fact you had already told Mr Waterstreet that when you went to the mall you felt that people were watching you?

A.   Yes.

Q.    And Mr Waterstreet said “How long did that feeling of paranoia occur?” And you said “It kind of come over me over the leaving years from about year 12” do you remember that?

A.   Yeah.

Q.   My question to you is, you didn’t have any symptoms of voices or paranoia, was wrong, and I withdraw that – do you understand?

A.   Yes.

Q.   I’ll ask you a different question: I’m suggesting to you that you didn’t’ have any symptoms of voices before you went to Silverwater – do you understand that question?

A.   Yes, I do.

Q.   Can you tell me whether you agree or disagree with that?

A.   I agree.


	
	These questions were calculated to at least minimise the impact of earlier ones that should not have been asked. They of course confirm that the earlier questions were not justified.
	
	
	Relevant also to the conclusion at which I have arrived is the situation of the Appellant. He had a mental illness and was on medication. At AB1345 he said that his head was not as useful in the morning as later on in the day and that he was having trouble, a proposition her Honour seemed to accept when she postponed further cross-examination and said that she would give priority to his evidence being completed at a time of day amenable to his comfort and comprehension. At AB1450 he said he was “getting confused again. This is too quick and too aggressive and it’s confusing me”. Her Honour asked the Appellant if he needed a moment and then again adjourned the cross-examination. In addition to the passages I have quoted, he said on a number of other occasions during the cross-examination that he was confused – AB1434, 1442, 1446, and 1450.
	
	
	Of course, such assertions of confusion are not necessarily true but at least as far as the transcript goes, they appear to be genuine and he was not challenged on the statements. It is however fair to record that after the adjournment of the cross-examination to which reference has just been made her Honour observed that “since Mr Waterstreet raised it I think that there’s been a tempering of demeanour in cross examination and I’ve not been seeing an aggression that is at all uncommon or out of place so I am troubled that the accused at this point of time is perceiving those matters. I don’t say there’s anything disingenuine [sic] about it, but I am troubled that that would be the perception”.
	
	
	Her Honour went on to observe that it was important for the Appellant to comprehend, raised the possibility that mental illness or shyness or nerves could be operating, reiterated that the Crown’s questioning was not out of place and remarked that audible mumbles at the Bar Table, which I infer to have been from defence counsel, were calculated to be distracting.
	
	
	The reference to Mr Waterstreet raising “it” was to an occasion early in the cross-examination when Mr Waterstreet had complained at the speed at which the Crown Prosecutor was reading material. Her Honour had then remarked that she had not discerned a pace that is uncommon in court proceedings.
	
	
	In the main, the questions asked in cross-examination were commendably short and my impression from the printed page is that they followed quickly on one another. However, weight must obviously be given to her Honour’s remarks.
	
	
	It must be accepted that many of the passages I have criticised were not the subject of objection, despite defence counsel objecting frequently, sometimes with justification and sometimes not. This failure is undoubtedly a reason why the Appellant should not be allowed to raise the issue here. However, the Appellant was entitled to a fair trial. Counsel appearing for the Crown was under an obligation when cross-examining to do so in a way that did not infringe the Appellant’s entitlement.
	
	
	As Heydon J endorsed in Libke v R [2007] 230 CLR 559 at [122]:
	


A prosecutor must “conduct himself with restraint and with due regard to the rights and dignity of accused persons. A cross examination must naturally be as full and effective as possible, but it is unbecoming in a legal representative – especially in a prosecutor – to subject a witness, and particularly an accused person who is a witness, to a harassing and badgering cross–examination”.


	
	The cross-examination was combative and aggressive. While such an approach may often not be inappropriate, it was clearly so in this case. The Prosecutor did put, indeed I think make, a number of controversial and prejudicial assertions based upon inaccurate or inadequate factual foundations and although some were subsequently withdrawn - some, days later - the mere putting of them was calculated to suggest, at least inferentially, that there was a basis for them. The Legal Profession Uniform Conduct (Barristers) Rules 2015 Rule 61 quoted by Beazley P and Davies J is not there for no reason.
	
	
	As I indicated at the commencement of these reasons, I do not suggest that all departures from proper questioning make a trial unfair. I am not unconscious of the views of other members of this Court. Nevertheless, my overall impression of the cross-examination of the Appellant is that it was unfair and the accumulation of errors by the cross-examiner and their impact on the Appellant liable to have had an impact on the jury’s view of him.
	
	
	Accordingly, I would uphold ground 1.

2702285,Safe Work New South Wales v Austral Hydroponics P/L; Safe Work New South Wales v Eang Lam [2015] NSWDC 295,"sentence


	
	Austral Hydroponics Pty Ltd (Austral Hydroponics) has pleaded guilty to an offence that as a person who had a health and safety duty under section 19(1) Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (the Act), it failed to comply with that duty and thereby exposed Savoeun Nuon to a risk of death or serious injury contrary to section 32 of the Act.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence committed by Austral Hydroponics is a fine of $1.5 million.
	
	
	Eang Lam, the sole director of Austral Hydroponics, has pleaded guilty to an offence that as an officer of a company that had a health and safety duty he failed to exercise due diligence to ensure that the Austral Hydroponics complied with its duty, and thereby exposed Saveoun Nuon to a risk of death or serious injury contrary to section 32 of the Act.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence committed by Mr Lam is a fine of $300,000.
	


Facts


	
	The parties presented an Agreed Statement of Facts for each offence that can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	Austral Hydroponics conducted a business growing greenhouse truss tomatoes at 165 Gurner Avenue, Austral (the premises). At the date of the incident it had 5 employees. All employees were supervised by Mr Lam. Mr Nuon was employed as a farmhand and had commenced this employment in 2003.
	
	
	On 7 March 2013 Mr Nuon was directed by Mr Lam to remove pliable plastic sheets from the roof of a hot house located at the premises. No instruction on how to perform this task was provided by Mr Lam.
	
	
	The roof was curved forming an arch with a low point of 2.5 m and a high point of 4m.
	
	
	Mr Nuon used a ladder to climb onto the roof of the hot house and stood on the gutter whilst undertaking the task of removing the plastic sheets.
	
	
	At approximately 4:30pm, as Mr Nuon was trying to pull away damaged plastic he lost his balance and fell backwards approximately 2.5 metres.
	
	
	Mr Nuon suffered a fracture to the spine which caused spinal cord damage and tetraplegia. Mr Nuon’s condition was considered catastrophic requiring high care. Mr Nuon remained in hospital until his death in late August 2014 from respiratory failure and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. The prosecution did not allege that Mr Nuon’s death was caused by the injuries he sustained in the fall.
	
	
	In December 2011 Safe Work Australia published a Code of Practice entitled: ‘Managing the Risk of Falls at Workplaces Code of Practice’. The Code of Practice set out the obligations of employers to manage the risk of employees falling including, that risk assessments be conducted, training be provided in respect of tasks where there is a risk of falling, that fall prevention or arrest devices are used where reasonably practicable and that, where possible, such tasks are carried out on a solid construction. This last obligation is also contained in clause 78(3) of the Work Health and Safety Regulation 2011.
	
	
	Mr Lam failed to exercise due diligence by taking reasonable steps to ensure compliance with the Code of Practice. No risk assessment of the task being undertaken by Mr Nuon had been conducted and there was no safe work procedure in place. Mr Nuon was not adequately supervised, or provided with assistance in undertaking the task. Mr Lam did not take reasonable steps to ensure that workers were directed not to work on the roof of a hot house unless a risk assessment had been conducted and control measures to minimise risks to safety were implemented.
	
	
	Mr Nuon had not received training for working at height. Mr Nuon informed WorkCover that he had learned how to perform the task he was performing at the time of the incident from other employees and that it was the normal practice to reach the roof by ladder and walk along the gutter. At the time of the incident no fall prevention or arrest device or work positioning system was being used.
	
	
	Mr Lam told WorkCover that employees had been issued with a pole which had a Stanley knife attached to it to allow them to perform the task whilst on the ground. WorkCover were told by Mr Nuon that he had never been provided with such equipment and that it was not available at the premises.
	
	
	The ladder used by Mr Nuon on the date of the incident was a damaged domestic ladder which should not have been used in an industrial setting. The ladder was extended and unsecured.
	
	
	Following the incident Austral Hydroponics was issued with a Prohibition to discontinue use of domestic ladders and an Improvement Notice to address the risk of falling from height. To comply with these policies Austral Hydroponics obtained industrial fibre glass ladders, step ladders and fall arrest harnesses.
	


Offenders’ Evidence

Eang Lam


	
	Mr Lam gave oral evidence at the sentencing hearing and was cross-examined.
	
	
	Mr Lam grew up in Cambodia. His schooling was disrupted when he was sent to a forced labour camp and imprisoned by the Khmer Rouge. His son was born in Cambodia in 1980. Mr Lam then moved to Thailand with his wife and son where they lived in a refugee camp for two years. At about this time Mr Lam met Mr Nuon and they became close friends.
	
	
	Mr Lam moved to Australia in 1983 and began an industrial sewing business. The business experienced difficulties in around 2002. Mr Nuon, an experienced farmhand, suggested that Mr Lam consider farming. Mr Lam gave evidence that he expressed concerns about the farming idea due to his lack of experience, but that Mr Nuon told him that he had experience and could teach Mr Lam how to farm
	
	
	The farming business is run by Mr Lam in partnership with his wife and Austral Hydroponics was responsible for the marketing of the crops produced. Austral Hydroponics is no longer trading. Following the accident Mr Lam’s son, Hock Lam, incorporated Skyfresh West Pty Ltd (Skyfresh), and this company now markets the crops produced.
	
	
	Mr Lam gave evidence that at approximately 4.30pm on the date of the incident he was working in the packing shed with his wife when they learned that Mr Nuon was lying on the ground. Mr Lam ran to Mr Nuon who told him to call an ambulance. The police attended the premises that afternoon and two Workcover Inspectors attended the following day. WorkCover also attended the premises around one month after the incident. Mr Lam assisted the police and WorkCover with their investigations.
	
	
	Mr Lam visited Mr Nuon in hospital approximately 7 or 8 times. Mr Nuon had a wife and three children. Mr Lam apologised to Mrs Nuon and provided $1,200 to her. Mr Lam gave evidence that he could not give more due to his debts. Mr Lam spoke to Mrs Nuon on the telephone and would see her sometimes, however said it was very sad to see Mr Nuon’s family.
	
	
	Mr Lam gave evidence that Austral Hydroponics had a pole with a knife attached to it, but that it was not used regularly at the time of the incident.
	
	
	Mr Lam accepts responsibility for the accident and expressed deep regret and remorse. Following the accident Mr Lam did not work on the farm for around 6 months. Mr Lam described having changed significantly since the accident becoming withdrawn, not wishing to socialise and having difficulty sleeping. Mr Lam gave evidence that Mr Nuon was a very happy man who was always singing and that he now experiences very unpleasant intrusive memories of hearing his songs and seeing his smiling face. Mr Lam described Mr Nuon as his best friend.
	
	
	Mr Lam and Mrs Lam own a property in Canley Heights that they purchased in 1988 for approximately $100,000. He gave evidence that the equity in the property has been exhausted to support the farming business and to pay off debts. Mr Lam has had to borrow money from relatives and friends to pay $20,000 for the legal costs of these proceedings. Mr Lam deposed that the farming business has faced financial difficulties because sometimes crops fail.
	
	
	Mr Lam gave evidence that the premises were purchased in around 2002 by the superannuation fund of himself and his wife and are currently owned by Golden Star Property Trust.
	
	
	Mr Lam deposed that his son owned a house in Strathfield that he sold approximately 2 years ago. Mr Lam’s son lent him around $65,000 to assist Mr Lam with the farming business.
	
	
	Mr Lam’s tax returns and the company’s tax returns for the financial years 2012-2014 were tendered. The taxable income of each is set out in the table below.

	In cross-examination Mr Lam provided that the partnership remains the grower of the crops and pays Skyfresh for the marketing services provided.
	
	
	Mr Lam gave evidence that the last crop produced was sold for around $700,000, and that he would usually expect to produce and sell one crop per year.
	
	
	Mr Lam estimated that the Canley Heights property would currently be worth approximately $700,000 to $800,000.
	
	
	Mr Lam agreed that he knew he had a safety duty, that he had never approached WorkCover to seek assistance in understanding his responsibilities, and that he had never attended an open safety day.
	
	
	When asked in cross-examination why he had not told WorkCover about the pole with the knife Mr Lam explained that he had been ashamed that the pole had been available but not been used on the date of the accident. Mr Lam had not seen Mr Nuon use the pole, but had seen others use it.
	


Mrs Lam


	
	Mrs Lam gave evidence about the changes that she had seen in Mr Lam, whom she has been married to since 1978. Mrs Lam deposed that Mr Lam did not work for 6 months following the accident, has difficulty sleeping, gets upset easily and blames himself for Mr Nuon’s injuries.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Mrs Lam said that she worked on the farm but leaves the business side of things to Mr Lam. Mrs Lam provided that Mr Lam visited Mr Nuon in hospital around 6 or 7 times without her, and once with her. Mrs Lam said that the pole with the knife attached had been on the premises for around 2 years, and that she did not talk to Mr Lam about this pole following the accident.
	


Hock Lam


	
	Mr Hock Lam (Hock) gave evidence that after the accident Mr Lam became a broken man and lacked the capacity to continue running the business of Austral Hydroponics. Hock gave evidence that his father expressed regret to him almost every day for not having taken steps which would have prevented the accident.
	
	
	Hock deposed that he had seen a pole with the knife attached at the farm and that he had seen it used. The first time he saw it used was around 5 years ago and the most recent time he saw it used was around 3 years ago.
	
	
	Hock gave evidence that he sold his Strathfield property to allow him to provide a $65,000 loan to his parents. This loan was not documented.
	
	
	Hock deposed that the premises are owned by Rawson Superannuation Fund and held on trust for the Golden Star Property Trust.
	
	
	In cross-examination Hock agreed that he there was an element of risk in loaning money to his parents that he did not seek to protect himself from. He agreed that the understanding between himself and his parents was that if/when the business could pay him back, he would be repaid.
	
	
	Hock was an employee of Austral Hydroponics from 2005 until the formation of Skyfresh, and said that he had seen Mr Nuon use the pole with the knife in approximately 2010 after plastic had been damaged by strong winds.
	


Report of Dr Zhen Zhang psychiatrist


	
	A report of Dr Zhen Zhang, psychiatrist, dated 23 September 2015 was tendered on behalf of Mr Lam. The report was prepared for the sentencing proceedings.
	
	
	Mr Lam gave a history to Dr Zhang that he experienced recurrent intrusive images of the accident and that he could not get a picture of the scene out of his mind. He often experienced sweating, chest tightness and palpitations. He would often wake from his sleep screaming and had recurrent nightmares. He had experienced feelings of irritability and poor memory. Mr Lam told Dr Zhang that he had become socially withdrawn did not want to leave the house. He had lost confidence and motivation to go to work and had increasing concerns for the safety of his workers. He stopped working for a period but had to resume work due to financial stress. He had no interest or joy and had been avoiding social events, including weddings. He had a poor appetite, had lost weight and his energy levels were low.
	
	
	Dr Zhang diagnosed Mr Lam as suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Major Depression as well as presenting with significant symptoms of anxiety. Dr Zhang opined that considering the severity of the trauma suffered by Mr Nuon and his subsequent death that the psychological damage to Mr Lam was severe. Dr Zhang believed that of Mr Lam’s prognosis is guarded and his condition is likely to be chronic and enduring. Dr Zhang recommended that Mr Lam engage in psychiatric treatment including psychotherapy and antidepressant medication.
	


Affidavit of Lin Thai sworn 30 October 2015


	
	The offenders relied on an Affidavit of Lin Thai sworn 30 October 2015. Ms Thai is Mr Lam’s accountant. Ms Thai was not required for cross-examination.
	
	
	Ms Thai’s affidavit annexed the Trust Deeds for the Rowson Management Superannuation Fund and the Golden Star Property Trust and the Financial Report for the year ended 30 June 2014 of the Golden Star Property Trust.
	
	
	An analysis of those documents revealed that the Golden Star Property Trust was a unit trust established in about June 2011 to be the legal owner of the premises that were beneficially owned by the superannuation fund. The contemporaneous documents show that the premises are held by Mr and Mrs Lam as trustees for the Golden Star Property Trust.
	
	
	The property of the superannuation fund is held on trust for Mr and Mrs Lam until they reach the age of 65 years or are otherwise entitled to those funds by operation of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994
	


Findings based on the Offenders’ evidence


	
	The prosecution made a number of challenges to the evidence led on behalf of the Offenders and it is therefore necessary for me to make the following findings.
	
	
	First, I was impressed by the candour of Mr Lam’s evidence and the extent of his remorse and contrition. Mr Lam has been deeply affected by the serious injury to his best friend and has accepted responsibility for his failings and the failings of Austral Hydroponics that led to the injury to Mr Nuon. Mr Lam was doing his best to give honest evidence to the Court and I accept his evidence.
	
	
	Second, there was a pole with a Stanley knife attached to it at the premises that could have been used to do at least part of the work Mr Nuon was doing when he fell. In this regard I accept the evidence of Mr and Mrs Lam, and Hock Lam, to this effect. Not much turns on this finding because I cannot be satisfied on the evidence that Mr Nuon was ever instructed to use it or was aware of its existence.
	
	
	Third, neither of the offenders has the capacity to pay a significant fine.
	
	
	Austral Hydroponics has ceased trading and its role has been taken over by Skyfresh. I am satisfied that this occurred because of Mr Lam’s inability to work following the incident and not as a means of avoiding any fine to be imposed in these proceedings.
	
	
	Mr Lam is liable to the bank for all of the borrowings taken out to fund the farming operation and that indebtedness is secured by way of a mortgage on his home. He has no equity available to him at the present time. His future livelihood is dependent on the success of future crops, which are not guaranteed. The imposition of a substantial fine on Mr Lam would be equally borne by his wife. Mr Lam does not have access to the proceeds of the superannuation fund available to him to pay any fine imposed. Mr Lam’s ability to work has been seriously compromised by the psychological effect that the incident and the death of Mr Nuon has had on him.
	


Consideration

Objective seriousness of the offence


	
	The proportionality principle requires that a sentence should neither exceed nor be less than the gravity of the crime having regard to the objective circumstances: Veen v R (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 472, 485-6, 490-1 and 496. At common law, the term “objective circumstances” was used to describe the circumstances of the crime. The gravity of the offence was assessed by reference to its objective seriousness: R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at [15].
	
	
	The task requires the court to consider where in the range of conduct covered by the offence the conduct of the offender falls: Baumer v R (1988) 166 CLR 51 at 57. This assessment will generally indicate the appropriate range of sentences available which will reflect the objective seriousness of the offence committed, and set the limits within which a sentence proportional to the criminality of the offender will lie: BW v R [2011] NSWCCA 176 at [70].
	
	
	The sentencing judge should take into account not only the conduct which actually constitutes the crime, but also such of the surrounding circumstances as are directly related to that crime and are properly regarded as circumstances of aggravation or mitigation: R v Wilkinson (No 5) [2009] NSWSC 432 at [61].
	
	
	The existence of a reasonably foreseeable risk to safety that is likely to result in serious injury or death is a factor relevant to the gravity of the offence: Capral Aluminium Limited v Workcover Authority of New South Wales (2000) 49 NSWLR 610 at [89]. The question of foreseeability of the risk is to be determined objectively.
	
	
	The risk posed by workers falling from the roof of the hot house was foreseeable and obviously so. The ways in which that risk could be minimised were set out in the Code of Practice which was readily available to both offenders if any enquiry had been made.
	
	
	The extent of the injury to Mr Nuon was catastrophic. He remained in high dependency care as a result of his injuries until his death.
	
	
	For Mr Lam’s part he was dependent on Mr Nuon to provide him with the relevant ‘know-how’ to operate the farming business. That resulted in Mr Nuon being fairly independent in undertaking his role at the premises. That did not however alleviate Austral Hydroponics or Mr Lam of their obligations to provide for his health and safety.
	


Deterrence


	
	There is a requirement for the penalty imposed in relation to this offence to provide for general deterrence. The penalty should draw attention to persons operating similar businesses which are inherently dangerous to employees that it is necessary to ensure that they operate without avoidable risk to the health and safety of their employees.
	
	
	There is a requirement to provide for specific deterrence in this case, however it is reduced for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, the offender has taken steps to improve the equipment provided to its employees to undertake the relevant task following the incident.
	
	
	Second, Austral Hydroponics is no longer trading.
	
	
	Third, the incident has had a substantial impact on Mr Lam such that I am satisfied that the safety of workers at the farm will in the future be of paramount concern to him.
	


Aggravating factors

The injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial: section 21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the injuries suffered by Mr Nuon were substantial. The resulting tetraplegia experienced by Mr Nuon puts this case in the worst category of serious injury.

Mitigating factors.


	
	The offenders do not have any prior convictions: section 21A(3)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The farm has been operating since 2003, but Mr Lam operated an industrial sewing business before that without coming under notice of the prosecutor.
	
	
	The offenders were persons of good character: section 21A(3)(f) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Austral Hydroponics had no convictions prior to this offence and employed 5 people. Mr Lam, a director of Austral Hydroponics, provided a gratuitous payment of $1200 to Mr Nuon’s family following the accident, and visited both Mr Nuon and his family on a number of occasions.
	
	
	The offenders are unlikely to re-offend: section 21A(3)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Austral Hydroponics is no longer trading, and I am satisfied that appropriate steps were taken by Austral Hydroponics following the accident to purchase equipment to be used on the farm to ameliorate the risk of employees falling whilst working at height. Mr Lam has experienced Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Major Depression following the incident which diminished his ability to take a leading role in the farming business and heightened his awareness of the need for safety systems. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that both offenders are unlikely to re-offend.
	
	
	The offenders have demonstrated remorse: section 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Mr Lam, the director of Austral Hydroponics, expressed his deep remorse for the offence. Mr Lam has accepted full responsibility for the injury occasioned to Mr Nuon and apologised to Mr Nuon and his family. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offenders have demonstrated genuine remorse and contrition.
	
	
	The offenders entered a plea of guilty to the Amended Summons at the earliest possible opportunity: sections 21A(3)(k) and 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offenders are entitled to a discount on penalty that reflects the utilitarian value of that plea. The extent of the discount should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25%, but that is only a guide. The primary consideration in determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea the greater the discount: R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and R v Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32]. The plea also indicates remorse: Borkowski at [32].
	
	
	The appropriate discount for the plea of guilty is 25%.
	
	
	The offenders co-operated with the investigation: section 21A(3)(m) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	


Other Matters


	
	Section 21A(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 allows the Court to consider other relevant matters. In this case it is appropriate to take into account Mr Lam’s disrupted past by reason of his detention in a forced labour camp and subsequent residence in a refugee camp in Thailand before being relocated to Australia. At the time of his arrival in Australia he had limited skills, but has gone on to operate two businesses that have made a useful contribution to the community.
	


Capacity to pay a fine


	
	Section 6 Fines Act 1996 provides:
	


In the exercise by a court of a discretion to fix the amount of any fine, the court is required to consider:

such information regarding the means of the accused as is reasonably and practicably available to the court for consideration, and

such other matters as, in the opinion of the court, are relevant to the fixing of that amount.


	
	The Court is required to have regard to this provision before imposing a fine. Where an offender seeks to have a fine reduced on the basis of a limited capacity to pay, it bears the evidentiary onus of convincing the Court that it should exercise its discretion to limit the amount of the fine. The offender’s capacity to pay is relevant but not decisive: Jahandideh v R [2014] NSWCCA 178 at [16]. A substantial fine may still be warranted as a result of the seriousness of the offence and the need for general deterrence.
	
	
	On the basis of the findings that I have already made, Austral Hydroponics has very little, if any, capacity to pay a fine, such that any fine imposed is likely to lead to its winding up. However, this is a case that calls for the imposition of a substantial fine as a result of the objective seriousness of the offence and the need for general deterrence.
	
	
	Mr Lam also has very little capacity to pay a fine, but the imposition of a substantial fine on him is likely to lead to financial ruin and to have a significant impact on Mrs Lam, which in my view would be an unjust result. Mr Sweet argued that the fine imposed on Mr Lam should be no more than $50,000 before applying a discount for the plea of guilty.
	
	
	As a result of the precarious position of Austral Hydroponics I have decided that it is appropriate to order that Mr Lam pay all of the prosecution’s costs agreed in the sum of $20,000 so that they may, if necessary, be effectively enforced. I have taken that amount into account in deciding the amount of the fine to be imposed: Environmental Protection Agency v Barnes [2006] NSWCCA 246 at [78]. Based on my assessment of all of the evidence in this case, I have come to a different fine that that contented for on behalf of Mr Lam.
	


Penalty – Austral Hydroponics


	
	The offender is convicted.
	
	
	Taking all of those matters into account the appropriate penalty is $200,000. In recognition of the early plea of guilty that sum is to be discounted by 25%.
	
	
	I impose a fine of $150,000.
	
	
	I order pursuant to section 122(2) Fines Act 1996 that 50% of the fine is to be paid to the prosecutor.
	


Penalty – Eang Lam


	
	The offender is convicted.
	
	
	Taking all of those matters into account the appropriate penalty is $20,000. In recognition of the early plea of guilty that sum is to be discounted by 25%.
	
	
	I impose a fine of $15,000.
	
	
	I order pursuant to section 122(2) Fines Act 1996 that 50% of the fine is to be paid to the prosecutor.
	


Costs


	
	I order that the Mr Lam pay the prosecutor’s costs as agreed in the sum of $20,000.

2702297,Young v Sprague [2015] NSWSC 1874,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	On 1 September 2010 the defendant, who is an RSPCA Inspector, examined a mare on a property near Goulburn at the request of a veterinarian and the owners of the property. The owner of the mare, alleged to be the plaintiff, had agreed that the owners of the property should take the horse and provide veterinary treatment for it. The horse was emaciated and suffering from a number of collateral ailments. The RSPCA took custody of it and made a record of its condition. The horse was ultimately euthanized.
	
	
	On 18 July 2011 five court attendance notices (CANs) were issued alleging that the plaintiff had committed various offences in respect of the horse in contravention of provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1979 (NSW). The CANs were posted to the post office box identified to the defendant as his. He appeared unrepresented in court to deal with preliminary matters a number of times and, on the date set down for the substantive hearing of the charges, was represented by a solicitor who submitted that, because the mode of service was not authorised by the Act, the Court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the CANs. This submission was rejected, the hearing continued and the plaintiff was eventually convicted of all charges. By summons filed in this Court on 5 March 2015, he seeks declarations to the effect that service of the CANs was invalid and that the Local Court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine them or, in the alternative, to appeal against his convictions under s 52 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) on the same grounds. (The validity of the CANs was also challenged but this was not ultimately pressed before me.)
	


Chronology


	
	The plaintiff’s residential address was specified in each of the CANs as “Grangers Close, Gundary”, which was a remote rural property with no mail delivery. On 19 July 2011 the defendant posted the CANs to the plaintiff’s post office box and, on 22 July 2011 each CAN was filed at Goulburn Local Court, the defendant having completed the statement of service of each, attesting to service by post. The first return date of the CANs before the Goulburn Local Court was 24 August 2011. On that date, the plaintiff appeared in person before the presiding Magistrate at Goulburn Local Court. For various reasons the hearing did not proceed. Communications ensued between the defendant’s solicitor and the plaintiff and, on 22 September 2011, the plaintiff obtained subpoenas for production of documents from the Local Court against a number of persons, each returnable on the next mention date, 30 September 2011. Further communications ensued between the defendant’s solicitor and the plaintiff and, on 30 September 2011, the matter came before Magistrate Stoddart at the Goulburn Local Court. The defendant was represented by counsel, the plaintiff appeared in person. He confirmed his plea of not guilty (foreshadowed on 24 August 2011) and indicated that he wished to make certain interlocutory applications. Those proceedings were listed for hearing on 25 October 2011 and the substantive prosecution for 12 and 13 December 2011. On 25 October 2011 the interlocutory applications came before Magistrate Beattie at Goulburn Local Court and, when her Honour declined to accede to the plaintiff’s application that she should disqualify herself from hearing the matter, he left the court room. Her Honour dealt with the outstanding applications, adjourning one to 13 December 2011, confirming the hearing dates of 12 and 13 December 2011 and directing the Registrar to notify the plaintiff of the orders. Those dates were subsequently vacated and the matter fixed for hearing on 27 and 28 February 2012. On 27 February 2012 the matters came on for hearing before Magistrate Beattie. The plaintiff was represented by Mr Doughty, a solicitor, who challenged the validity of the CANs and also contended that the mode of service did not comply with the Local Court Rules, hence, that the court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the CANs. For the defendant, Mr Bodor SC submitted that the modes of service were permissive and that there could be no doubt that the plaintiff had received the notices, since he had appeared at court on the first return date in response to them. The objection to jurisdiction was rejected by the Magistrate and the prosecution case then proceeded on the merits. It was adjourned part heard to 14 May 2012. On the plaintiff’s applications this was changed to 24 and 25 September 2012. The hearing was again adjourned part heard to 9 and 15 November 2012. In his evidence on 15 December 2012, the plaintiff disclosed that he was served with the CANs some time before August 2011. On 11 December 2012 the magistrate convicted the plaintiff of all charges. The plaintiff immediately lodged appeals against his convictions to the District Court. They proceeded in that court on 9, 11 and 12 December 2013, 9 and 14 March 2014, 15 August 2014 and 7 November 2014 and are presently adjourned for mention only, pending the present application.

(2) If service of the notice is effected by post, facsimile or any other electronic means, the notice must be served on the person not less than 21 days before the first listing of the offence.

Findings of fact


	
	In her judgment of 27 February 2012 the Magistrate found that the defendant had posted the CANs to the plaintiff on 19 July 2011. Although the address on them was “Granger’s Close, Gundary”, they had been posted to the post office box, details of which had come to her from the plaintiff by way of an email. The return date was 24 August 2011. The learned Magistrate considered that the methods of service stipulated in Rule 5.9 were optional, sub-rule (1) stating that a CAN “may be served” (emphasis added) in the various specified ways, the key question being whether the CANs came to the notice of a defendant. Her Honour concluded that, by reference to s 76 of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW), the notices would have been delivered to the post office box four working days after they were served. She concluded that there was therefore sufficient time allowed to enable compliance with the Rules.
	


Submissions


	
	Mr Baran, appearing pro bono for the plaintiff, submitted that the service requirements of the rules were a closed list so that, although the word “may” is used, it applied to the specified choices, an interpretation strengthened by the absence of the use of “or” for each method listed. So far as the argument that, in the result the CANs were personally served in the sense that, although they were delivered to the plaintiff’s post office box, he personally obtained them (as distinct from merely having notice of them), Mr Baran submitted that this argument had not been put before the Magistrate.
	
	
	Mr Baran referred to Di Natale & Anor v Kelly [2006] NSWCCA 201; 66 NSWLR 130 where Hall J (Grove J agreeing, Smart AJ dissenting), held that the various kinds of service of summonses prescribed by s 63 of the Justices Act 1902 (NSW) (now repealed), which included service by post, were not merely procedural in nature but conditions precedent, upon which validity of service depended and, in turn, valid proceedings. Section 63(2) permitted the summons in question to be served by post not less than 28 days before the return day. However, it had been posted only 15 days prior to the return date and, accordingly, the requirements of s 63(2) had not been complied with. Although the appellants acknowledged that they received the summonses and signed and lodged a form described as a written “notice of pleading” indicating that they were intending to plead “not guilty”, Hall J considered that this was not a waiver of the requirement under s 63(2) as to service within the specified time, although had they attended court and the hearing proceeded without objection being taken to the validity of service it may be that this would amount to an abandonment of the point (at [63] – [64]). As it happened, when the matter first came on, the appellants did not appear; the court adjourned the proceedings for a defended hearing but the notice of the new date had been sent to the wrong address, so that the appellants failed to appear and suffered convictions against them in their absence. Hall J noted that there was no provision enabling variation of the 28 day minimum period specified in s 63(2) and strict compliance was a precondition to valid action (at [80]). It will be seen that the question of whether, in the circumstances, the summons had been served personally did not arise; indeed, personal service, it may be, could only be effected in the manner specified by s 63(1). Such methods are not mentioned, let alone prescribed, by r 5.9.
	
	
	Mr Baran also took me to Scope Data Systems Pty Ltd v David Goman as Representative of the Partnership BDO Nelson Parkhill [2007] NSWSC 278; 70 NSWLR 176 dealing with service of a statutory demand, crucially as to when the statutory demand had been served. The demand was sent by the defendant to the plaintiff addressed to the latter’s registered office, which was that of its accountant. By arrangement between the accountant and the post office all mail addressed to it at its place of business was placed in a post office box and collected in due course by the accountant. Although the demand had been posted on 25 September 2006, it was not collected by the accountant until 3 October 2006. If this date were regarded as the date of service, the plaintiff’s application to set aside the statutory demand was made in accordance with s 459G of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) but, if it had been served earlier, the application was out of time. The statutory demand was never delivered by Australia Post to the company’s registered office because of the accountant’s arrangements with the post office. White J concluded that the time the demand was actually delivered to the postal address was when it was brought by the accountant after he collected it from the post office. The presumption as to delivery by post did not therefore operate; delivery to the post office box was not the same as delivery to the company’s registered office, differing in this respect from the contrary view expressed by Hodgson JA in Falgat Constructions Pty Ltd v Equity Australia Corporation Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 259 at [56]. Mr Baran argued that, by analogy, delivery to the plaintiff’s post office box could not be delivery to his residence. Mr Baran also referred me to Director-General NSW Department of Primary Industries v Richard Bagnall [2007] NSWSC 1388 where the relevant rule permitted service of a court attendance notice “by sending it by post or facsimile to the person’s residential address not less than 21 days before the first listing date for the offence”. As it happened, the notice was served on the home of the defendant’s mother, where she resided on her own, although he had lived there with his mother from time to time. It was accepted that he was not a permanent resident at his mother’s home at the relevant time and had not been in permanent residence at that address for some considerable period. Nor could he be said to ordinarily or usually reside at his mother’s home. At the relevant time, however, the defendant visited his mother frequently and would stay overnight for one or two nights every alternate weekend. More significantly, he used his mother’s address as his mailing or postal address. Fullerton J was satisfied that the relevant process, addressed to the defendant at his mother’s address, had been given to him. He did not put this in issue and there was no doubt that he used that address as his mailing or postal address. Fullerton J held that the terms “residential address” and “usual place of residence” as used in the rules were to be given their ordinary English meaning and considered in the context of the rules (at [22] – [23]). Her Honour found that the defendant’s “usual place of residence” and his “residential address for service by post” were different and he was effectively served since the notices were sent by post “to the very address he acknowledged was his residential address for such purposes”. It followed that the notices were validly served. Mr Baran makes the point that a post office box, although it might be accepted as an address for service of notices by the plaintiff, could on no count be regarded as the plaintiff’s “residential address” within the meaning of subparagraph (b) of r 5.9(1).
	
	
	Mr Sutherland SC took up this point by submitting that the plaintiff had consistently used in affidavits filed for the purposes of proceedings his post office box as his address and that this was analogous to the mother’s residence in Bagnall. I do not accept this submission. Amongst other things, it seems to me, that the Rule, by specifying a residence in the context of post and not a post office box, implicitly excludes the latter as available for service. Mr Sutherland also pointed out that, in Di Natale, the plaintiffs had never appeared in person in the proceedings and were never effectively given a notice of the hearing date. He submitted that, in effect, the Magistrate had decided that, one way or another there was no doubt that the CANs had been delivered to the plaintiff. At all events, the specified means were not an exclusive list, he had received the notices and the Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine them. If, however, the Magistrate erred in this respect, any irregularity in the manner of providing notice to the plaintiff of the first return date did not go to the jurisdiction of the court to deal with the CANs which were before it. It was submitted that the conduct and appearances of the plaintiff following his first appearance demonstrated that he had appropriate notice of the hearing dates and had actively participated in the court processes on a number of occasions prior to the argument raised concerning validity of service. It was contended that by his conduct and that of his legal representative following rejection of his submissions regarding service and his active participation in a substantive hearing occupying some six days, the plaintiff had waived any entitlement to rely on the procedural irregularities. Reliance was, in particular, placed upon the procedural scheme prescribed by Div 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act, in particular s 190. Subsection (4) provides that the court “may not proceed to hear and determine the matter unless it is satisfied that the accused person had reasonable notice of the first return date or the mention date.” [Emphasis added.] This shows that the only impediment, as it were, involving notice is the absence of reasonable notice. Providing, therefore, that reasonable notice was given by any means, s 190(4) implicitly permits the court to proceed to hear and determine the matter. This demonstrates, it is contended, that the provisions as to service are facultative and not jurisdictional, though they might be decisive in the absence of personal service if the defendant fails to appear. No question could arise here as to the plaintiff having received “reasonable notice” and it followed there was no impediment to the Local Court exercising its jurisdiction to hear and determine the CANs.
	
	
	Mr Sutherland SC referred to Guss v Magistrates’ Court at Victoria [2003] VSC 365 where the court considered the effect of s 34 of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1989 (Vic) which provided for service (amongst other methods) by “delivering a true copy of the summons to the defendant personally”. Service could also be effected by leaving a copy of the summons at the defendant’s last or most usual place of residence or of business with a person over the age of 16 years apparently residing or working there. Service had been effected, it was alleged, by leaving a copy of the summons with a person over the age of 16 at appropriate business premises. The plaintiff deposed that he was not a director of the company which carried on business at that address and the premises were not his most usual place of business, although, at the time of purported service, he would have attended the premises several days a week but not a full day at a time, acting in his capacity as a consultant to the company which carried on business there. He agreed, however, that he had in fact received a copy of the summons within a “couple of days” after it was left for him. When the matter came on for hearing, counsel for the plaintiff announced his appearance “under protest” and contended that the plaintiff had not been properly served. The magistrate concluded that, indeed, the summons had not been served at the plaintiff’s “most usual place of business” but nevertheless, having regard to the fact that no issue had earlier been raised despite attendances at court (of a procedural kind) it was too late now for the objection to be raised as to jurisdiction. Osborn J held that, as the plaintiff himself gave evidence that he had personally received the copy summons left for him, the “evidence of service before the magistrate ultimately did not rest upon the leaving of the document at the premises but upon the fact of personal receipt by the plaintiff” (at [12]). His Honour concluded –
	


“[20] In my opinion the defendant’s evidence established not only that a true copy of the summons had been delivered to him personally within the ordinary meaning of those words but also established that he had been served personally in the sense in which that concept has been articulated by authority [to which his Honour had earlier referred] in this State. Furthermore, there is no underlying purpose which can be identified in the provision which might lead to the conclusion that it should be given other than its ordinary meaning.”


	
	His Honour found it unnecessary to determine whether a defect in service in accordance with the Act could be waived but observed that there is “longstanding authority to suggest that it might”, citing Parisienne Basket Shoes Pty Ltd v Whyte [1938] HCA 7; (1937-8) 59 CLR 369 per Latham CJ.
	


Conclusion


	
	It seems to me that the issues here have been unnecessarily complicated by Procrustean attempts to fit the mode of service of the CANs into the framework of those parts of the Rule which do not describe what happened. The CANs came into the plaintiff’s possession, on his own admission well before the return date. The Magistrate was invited to hold this was an inescapable inference from his attendance on that occasion and his undoubted familiarity with their content. In my view the submission was correct. This is personal service. The Rules do not specify the manner in which it is to be effected. Providing the CANs come into the possession of the defendant or to his notice, personal service has occurred, however it was undertaken, including by posting them to the defendant’s post office box. (Of course, if the defendant did not attend court, the absence of proof of service by the other specified methods would prevent further proceeding with the matter unless there were other evidence that proved his collection of the process from his box – and, hence, personal service.) Since the matter is one of jurisdiction, this Court is entitled to look also at the plaintiff’s admission of receipt, although it came after her Honour’s conclusion that service was effective. It will be noted that the methods of service listed in the rule other than personal service do not assume, let alone require, that the notice actually come to the attention of the defendant; the service is complete upon the (unilateral) acts of the server. This is scarcely surprising, since one of the purposes of the alternative modes is to permit, after further procedures have been undertaken, to permit the matter to be heard or determined in the absence of any response or appearance by a defendant. Here, for the reasons given, those methods are irrelevant. I am satisfied that the plaintiff was personally served with the CANs within the meaning of r 5.9(1)(a) of the Local Court Rules. The mere fact that the learned magistrate rejected the plaintiff’s objection upon different grounds does not affect the fact that the court had jurisdiction to proceed with the hearing.
	
	
	The summons must be dismissed with costs.

2702307,Willoughby City Council v Screnci [2015] NSWLEC 192,"Judgment


	
	Joseph Robert Screnci is charged with two offences against s 125(1) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) (the EPA Act). Those charges relate to building work as well as site works for landscaping undertaken at a residential property known as 57 Minimbah Road, Northbridge (the Property). That Property is jointly owned by Mr Screnci and his wife.
	
	
	Mr Screnci entered a plea of guilty to each offence on 27 March 2015. A sentence hearing took place on 16, 17 and 18 June last, in the course of which several affidavits were read by each party, oral evidence was given and a large number of documents tendered. Mr Screnci was represented by senior and junior counsel while the prosecutor was represented by (then) junior counsel. Following completion of addresses on the third day of hearing, my decision on sentence was reserved.
	
	
	As a result of the decision by a Commissioner of the Court in related proceedings and delivered on 10 July 2015 (Screnci v Willoughby City Council [2015] NSWLEC 1256), the parties were invited to make any further submissions relevant to these proceedings that arose from the Commissioner’s decision. The last of those written submissions was provided to me on 30 July 2015.
	
	
	On 10 August 2015 I was requested by the parties to refrain from delivering my judgment on sentence, the delivery of which I had then foreshadowed. Upon the matter being relisted before me, I was informed that Mr Screnci wished to raise a plea in bar, which, if made good, would necessitate the charge being dismissed and an order of acquittal made, notwithstanding the plea of guilty that had been entered.
	
	
	In order to formalise his application, in effect to re-open the hearing before me, a notice of motion, in identical terms, was filed in each proceeding on 18 September last. Each motion sought an order that Mr Screnci be given leave both to withdraw the plea of guilty that he had entered and instead to enter a plea:
	


“ … that the proceedings are statute-barred by reason of being commenced after the expiration of the relevant limitation period in s 127 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979”.


	
	Those motions have now been heard. For the reasons that follow, I have concluded that the plea in bar has been made out, with the consequence that the charge in each proceeding must be dismissed.
	


Background


	
	The prosecutions against Mr Screnci were commenced by way of summons filed on on 19 September 2014. At that time, each summons charged that Mr Screnci carried out development in breach of s 125(1) of the EPA Act. An amended summons was filed and served in each proceeding on 27 March 2015, charging that the defendant caused development to be carried out in breach of the EPA Act. It is the offence charged in the amended summons filed in each proceeding to which Mr Screnci pleaded guilty.
	
	
	In proceedings 50765 of 2014, Mr Screnci is charged that the offence was committed “between December 2009 and 27 February 2014”. It is alleged that what he did was forbidden to be done by s 76A(1)(b) of the EPA Act in that he:
	


“ … caused development to be carried out on land, being development which required development consent, otherwise than in accordance with a development consent which had been obtained and was in force in respect of the development where an environmental planning instrument applied to the land and provided that the development may not be carried out except with development consent.”


	
	The particulars of the charge, as expressed in the summons, indicate that the breach is directed to the carrying out of building work inside the dwelling on the Property. Relevantly, the manner in which Mr Screnci is alleged to have contravened the EPA Act by carrying out work particularised in the summons is stated as follows:
	


“The Defendant instigated Livbuild Pty Ltd and persons acting on behalf of and under the direction of Livbuild Pty Ltd to carry out the building work particularised in paragraph (b) above.”


	
	The offence that is the subject of those proceedings was described by the parties as “the internal works offence”. It is convenient to use that description when making reference to those proceedings.
	
	
	The second offence, being that charged in proceedings 50766 of 2014, alleges an offence against s 125(1) involving works forbidden to be done by s 76A(1)(a) of the EPA Act. The charge alleges that the offence was committed “between about 2003 and February 2013” in that the defendant:
	


“ … caused development to be carried out on land, being development which required development consent under the provisions of an environmental planning instrument which applied to the land, where a development consent had not been obtained and was not in force with respect to the development.”


	
	The offence so charged relates to work carried out in the grounds of the Property, extending from the rear of the dwelling and adjoining pool structure to the Property boundary with Sailors Bay, an inlet of Middle Harbour. This area of the Property, referred to as the foreshore land, sloped steeply from the rear of the existing dwelling towards Sailors Bay. Although the offending work was compendiously described as “landscaping work”, it involved significant alteration to existing site contours, removal of some vegetation, as well as the construction of a series of sandstone retaining walls, staircases and concrete terraces. The building work that is the subject of this charge also included construction of a room within a structure that supported an elevated spa and pool. As the parties have done, it is convenient to refer to the offence that is the subject of this charge as “the foreshore works offence”.
	
	
	The particulars to the charge relating to the foreshore works offence also identify the manner in which it is alleged Mr Screnci contravened the EPA Act. Those particulars are in identical terms to those included in the summons for the internal works offence, that is, that Mr Screnci “instigated Livbuild Pty Ltd and persons acting on behalf of or under the direction of Livbuild Pty Ltd” to carry out the works for which development consent was required but had not been obtained.
	
	
	Michael Rimac is a licensed builder and managing director of Livbuild Pty Ltd (Livbuild) who, with employees and contractors engaged by him, carried out the work that is the subject of each charge. Affidavits sworn by Mr Rimac for the purpose of these proceedings were read by the prosecutor at the sentence hearing. He was also called to give evidence at the hearing and was cross-examined by Mr Screnci’s counsel. The essential issues between Mr Screnci and Mr Rimac were first, the extent to which Mr Screnci involved himself in and gave directions for the work that he “instigated” Livbuild to carry out and second, whose function it was to obtain the relevant development consents.
	
	
	For present purposes, it is unnecessary to address the controversy between Mr Screnci and Mr Rimac on these issues. It is sufficient to record the evidence of Mr Rimac that he ceased to carry out any work on the Property on 29 March 2012. That fact is not controversial. Indeed, in the Statement of Agreed Facts tendered in respect of the internal works prosecution, it is stated that Livbuild completed works at the Property “in early 2012” (Ex A, para 29). In the Statement of Agreed Facts tendered in respect of the foreshore works offence, it is also stated that Livbuild ceased construction work “in early 2012” (Ex B, para 35).
	
	
	At the sentence hearing, the prosecutor also read the affidavit of Steven Balafas sworn on 9 September 2014. Mr Balafas is a development enforcement officer employed by the prosecutor. He was primarily responsible for investigating the offences. Exhibited to his affidavit was a folder of documents tendered as Exhibit D. Among those documents were various file notes to which were attached photographs taken by him at the time of his inspections of the Property. It will be necessary to refer to these photographs in due course. He was cross-examined on that material.
	
	
	For present purposes, it is also unnecessary to refer to that evidence in any detail. It is sufficient to record the unchallenged evidence of Mr Balafas that evidence of the foreshore works offence first came to his attention on 8 February 2013, while evidence of the internal works offence first came to his attention on 27 February 2014.
	
	
	The parties accept that all of the evidence tendered and received at the sentence hearing in June is, so far as is relevant, before me for the purpose of determining the present notices of motion. The only additional evidence relied upon by Mr Screnci for the purpose of the motions is that found in an affidavit sworn by Paul Jayne on 19 August 2015 to which no objection was taken by the prosecutor. Mr Jayne is the solicitor having carriage of the matter for Mr Screnci. He was not required for cross-examination.
	
	
	Relevantly, Mr Jayne stated that prior to advising Mr Screnci to enter a guilty plea, the possibility of a plea in bar was considered by him and discussed both with the partner in his firm then responsible for the matter and also with counsel who were retained to appear for Mr Screnci. The possibility of raising the plea was not pursued at that time because it was understood, mistakenly as it happens, that Mr Balafas was “an authorised officer” of the Council within the meaning of the relevant provisions of the EPA Act. Mr Jayne states that in early August he was reading material directed to the legislation amending the EPA Act, including amendments made to s 127. It was then that the possibility of raising the plea in bar had again occurred to him. He promptly raised the matter with the prosecutor, resulting in both parties requesting that I refrain from delivering judgment. In so doing, the prosecutor expressly did not concede that the plea would be made good, but accepted that it should allow the plea to be agitated.
	


Statutory provisions


	
	Critical to the determination of the issue raised by Mr Screnci’s motions are the provisions of s 127 of the EPA Act. That section was amended on 31 July 2015. It is accepted by the prosecutor that the amendment has no retrospective operation so that the provisions of s 127, as they were before 31 July, apply to the present proceedings.
	
	
	The unamended section relevantly provided:
	


“127   Proceedings for offences

(1)   Proceedings for an offence against this Act may be taken before the Local Court or before the Court in its summary jurisdiction.

…

(4)   If proceedings in respect of an offence against this Act are brought in the Court in its summary jurisdiction, the Court may impose a penalty not exceeding the maximum penalty provided by this Act in respect of the offence.

(5)   Proceedings for an offence against this Act or the regulations may be commenced not later than 2 years after the offence was alleged to be committed.

(5A)   However, proceedings for any offence may also be commenced within, but not later than, 2 years after the date on which evidence of the alleged offence first came to the attention of an authorised officer within the meaning of Division 2C of Part 6.

(5B)   If subsection (5A) is relied on for the purpose of commencing proceedings for an offence, the information or application must contain particulars of the date on which evidence of the offence first came to the attention of an authorised officer and need not contain particulars of the date on which the offence was committed. The date on which the evidence first came to the attention of an authorised officer is the date specified in the information or application, unless the contrary is established.

(5C)   This section applies despite anything in the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 or any other Act.”


	
	Both the original and the amended summons filed in each proceeding had, in purported compliance with s 127(5B), stated the date upon which evidence of the offence had first come to the attention of Mr Balafas. The statement had also asserted that Mr Balafas was an “authorised officer”. However, it is now acknowledged by the prosecutor that while Mr Balafas was authorised to perform certain functions of the prosecutor, he was not “an authorised officer within the meaning of Division 2C of Part 6”, with the consequence that the provisions of subs (5A) were not engaged. The time within which proceedings were required to be commenced for the charges brought against Mr Screnci was therefore governed by the provisions of subs (5).
	


Expiration of the time period under s 127(5)


	
	As will be apparent from the terms in which the charge in each matter is framed, nominating dates between which the impugned conduct is alleged to have occurred, the offences charged are identified as continuing offences. The limitation period imposed by s 127(5) must therefore be calculated from the date on which the offence was complete or, differently expressed, calculated from the date upon which the offending conduct concluded (Environment Protection Authority v CSR Ltd t/as CSR Woodpanels [2001] NSWLEC 41; 114 LGERA 217 at [35]; Chief Executive, Office of Environment and Heritage v Manchee; Chief Executive, Office of Environment and Heritage v Bogamildi Investments Pty Ltd [2015] NSWLEC 117; 209 LGERA 280 at [44]).
	
	
	If the date from which the limitation period of two years commences to run is the concluding date alleged in each charge, the limitation period for the internal works offence would expire on 27 February 2016 while the limitation period for the foreshore works offence would have expired in February 2015. As the proceedings in respect of each offence were commenced on 19 September 2014, each would appear to satisfy the requirement of s 127(5).
	
	
	Applying the subsection as yielding the result just expressed would, at least superficially, appear to accord with its text. After all, the subsection identifies the time for commencement of proceedings as being not later than two years “after the offence was alleged to be committed” (emphasis added). The charge in each matter did “allege” the commission of the two offences that were each completed in the sense that the offending conduct ceased at a date that was less than two years before the proceedings were instituted.
	
	
	However, upon the proper construction of the section, that result seems unlikely. If subs (5) is construed in the context of s 127 as a whole, reference to the offence “alleged” must surely be the offence alleged by reference to the evidence adduced by the prosecutor. That context is provided by subss (5A) and (5B) where the criterion for any possible extension of the two year period is referable to the date upon which an authorised officer discovers “evidence of the offence”.
	
	
	Importantly, the manner in which a provision such as that expressed in s 127(5) is to be applied has been determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal. In Environment Protection Authority v Bathurst City Council (1995) 89 LGERA 79, that Court was required to determine a case stated from this Court in a prosecution for an offence against the Environmental Offences and Penalties Act 1989 (NSW) (now repealed). A question arose as to whether the proceedings prosecuting the offence had been commenced within the time allowed by s 12 of that Act. That section relevantly provided:
	


“Notwithstanding the provisions of the Justices Act 1902 or any other Act

…

(b)   proceedings for an offence (being proceedings that are to be dealt with summarily) … may be commenced not later than twelve months after the date alleged to be the date on which the offence was committed.”


	
	The leading judgment in that case was delivered by Hunt CJ at CL (Grove and Allen JJ agreeing). His Honour first accepted the concession made by the prosecutor that it must bear the onus of establishing that the proceedings had been commenced within the time allowed by s 12. That concession, as his Honour recorded, was correctly made, having regard to the decision of the High Court in Morgan v Babcock & Wilcox Ltd [1929] HCA 25; 43 CLR 163 at 175. After discussing the relevant legislative provisions and their prior use in other legislation, his Honour expressed this conclusion (at 85):
	


“In my opinion, and despite the reference in s 12 to ‘the date alleged to be the date on which the offence was committed’, the prosecution must establish that the offence was in fact committed within that [limitation] period.” (Original emphasis.)


	
	The textual differences between s 12(b) of the Environmental Offences and Penalties Act and s 127(5) of the EPA Act are not such that the decision in Environment Protection Authority v Bathurst City Council can be distinguished. It follows that in the present case the prosecutor was bound to prove that the proceedings in respect of each offence were commenced not later than two years after the date upon which the evidence establishes that each offence was committed. Being a criminal proceeding, the prosecution was bound to prove that fact beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	It will be recalled that the unchallenged evidence received at the sentence hearing and which I accept is that the offending work had been carried out by Mr Rimac on behalf of Livbuild and that he had ceased all work on the Property on 29 March 2012. Based on that evidence, the last date for commencement of any prosecution against Mr Screnci for the offences with which he was charged was 29 March 2014. As the proceedings were not commenced until September 2014, on their face they were commenced after the limitation period had expired.
	
	
	The prosecutor sought to address this consequence in two ways. First, it submitted that time was not an essential element of the offences charged, with the consequence that any misstatement of dates did not derogate from the validity of the charge. The dates upon which the offences were alleged to have been committed were capable of amendment by invoking the provisions of s 16(1)(g) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW).
	
	
	Secondly, it was submitted that despite the particulars to the charge, there was evidence tendered in the sentence hearing, establishing that the charges were brought within the two year period. It is appropriate to address each of these submissions in turn.
	
	
	I accept, as did counsel for Mr Screnci, that time is not an essential element of an offence against s 125(1) and s 76A(1) of the EPA Act (Kari & Ghossayn Pty Ltd v Sutherland Shire Council [2006] NSWLEC 532; 150 LGERA 231 at [10]). However, the circumstance that time is not an essential element of the offence in no way provides an answer to the operation and effect of a time bar such as is found in s 127(5). While time is not an element of the offence, s 127(5) limits the time within which a prosecution for the offence must be commenced. The subsection imposes a control upon the process for prosecuting an offence rather than identifying any element of the offence itself.
	
	
	The Council’s reliance upon evidence, said to support the charges against Mr Screnci as having been commenced inside the limitation period, needs to be considered in context. Once Mr Screnci gave notice that he wished to raise the present plea in bar, the process by which that plea would be considered and argued before me was the subject of case management. At the initial case management hearing, the parties were asked to consider whether there was any additional evidence upon which they would seek to rely, beyond that tendered at the sentence hearing. At the second mention, when the present notices of motion were fixed for hearing, the parties agreed that apart from the additional affidavit evidence of Mr Jayne to which I have earlier referred, the evidence to be considered for the purpose of determining the motions was that tendered at the sentence hearing.
	
	
	When the hearing of the present motions before me commenced, it was agreed between the parties that Mr Screnci should first present his case. He did so by reading the affidavit of Mr Jayne, otherwise confirming that evidence previously tendered was relied upon for the purpose of the motions. The prosecutor then stated that it did not seek to adduce any further evidence, with the consequence that the case for each party was closed. After senior counsel for Mr Screnci completed his submissions, the prosecutor then commenced to make its submissions.
	
	
	In the course of making those submissions, the prosecutor contended that the evidence before the Court demonstrated that offending work relevant to the foreshore works offence continued in the foreshore area to a date that fell within the two year limitation period. The evidence upon which it sought to rely was found in Exhibit D, being the material exhibited to the affidavit of Mr Balafas sworn 9 September 2014.
	
	
	Relevantly, I was asked to compare photographs included in Exhibit D that were taken by Mr Balafas on 27 February 2013 with photographs also included in the Exhibit and taken by him on 23 July 2014. While it was apparent that the photographs being compared were not taken from exactly the same location in each case, they generally depicted the undercroft area of the pool extension, the decking around the area and the steps commencing the stairway from that area to the waterfront, all within the foreshore area. Based upon that comparison of photographs, I was asked to infer that walls depicted in the photographs taken on 27 February 2013 had, by 23 July 2014 been painted. That fact, so it was submitted, demonstrated that further work had been carried out during the period. As the original work had not been carried out in accordance with any consent, further work, even painting, was work for which consent was required. Contrary to the particulars given for that charge, additional work had been carried out by persons unknown.
	
	
	I declined to draw the inference that the prosecutor sought to have me draw. Although there were several reasons for so doing based upon that photographic evidence, not the least reason for my refusal to draw the inference sought was that the colour of the July 2014 photographs that had been tendered was so obviously distorted that no proper inference could be drawn. The July 2014 photographs are recorded as having been taken at 14.27 hrs, yet the sky behind the buildings and structures depicted is a deep purple or midnight blue with an overall yellow hue to each of the photographs on which reliance was sought to be placed. The prosecutor accepted that those photographs, as tendered, did not appropriately provide an accurate or realistic colour for comparison, assuming it was otherwise appropriate to make that comparison for the purpose intended by the prosecutor.
	
	
	Once I had indicated that I was not prepared to draw the inference sought from the photographs, the prosecutor sought to read a further affidavit sworn by Mr Balafas on 11 September 2015. In that affidavit Mr Balafas sought to describe a difference in appearance of structures in the foreshore area of the Property between what he observed in February 2013 and what he observed in July 2014. A description of any such difference did not appear in the text of the affidavit to which Exhibit D was exhibited, nor in the file note to which the photographs sought to be relied upon were annexed in that Exhibit.
	
	
	Mr Screnci objected to that affidavit being read. Among his objections was the prejudice that he would suffer if the evidence was allowed. Although the affidavit of Mr Balafas sworn on 11 September 2015 had been served in support of a motion by the prosecutor to amend the summons, that motion was not listed for hearing, as its determination depended upon the outcome of the present motions. More significantly, it had been stated on behalf of the prosecutor that the affidavit would not be relied upon for the purpose of the present motions. As a result, Mr Screnci had not investigated the allegations of fact made in that affidavit but would have done so had he been on notice that the affidavit was to be relied upon.
	
	
	From the time Mr Screnci identified his intention to raise the plea in bar and the reasons for it, the prosecutor was on notice that it was required to establish by evidence that conduct constituting the offences was occurring on or after 19 September 2012, being the two year period immediately preceeding commencement of the present proceedings. It was afforded ample opportunity so to do but failed to avail itself of that opportunity. As a consequence of the circumstances I have identified, I did not allow the September 2015 affidavit of Mr Balafas to be read.
	
	
	In the result, the evidence before me does not establish that the proceedings prosecuting the offences with which Mr Screnci was charged were commenced “not later than two years after” the evidence shows those offences to have been committed. That finding then gives rise to the need to consider how the proceedings should be resolved, given the plea of guilty that has been entered.
	


The statutory limitation period: its relevance to the plea of guilty


	
	As a matter of statutory construction, the effect of provisions such as s 127(5) would seem to be that not only is the commencement of proceedings for an offence outside the limitation period proscribed but so also must a conviction for an offence that cannot be prosecuted outside that period. That is the thrust of the decision of the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Cooling [1990] 1 Qd R 376. In that case, the position is succinctly stated by Derrington J where his Honour said (at 380):
	


“If a person cannot be prosecuted for an offence because the [Criminal] Code says so, he cannot upon his own volition choose to disregard the law and agree to a prosecution for such an offence. Nor would it be within the power of the court to accept a plea of guilty in such circumstances.”


	
	In Cooling the appellant was first arrested, charged and subsequently indicted for rape. Upon his trial he pleaded not guilty to rape but guilty to unlawful carnal knowledge. That plea was accepted by the Crown in full discharge of the indictment. He was sentenced to imprisonment for the offence to which he had pleaded guilty. However, a provision of the Criminal Code required that the prosecution for the offence of unlawful carnal knowledge “must be begun within 6 months after the offence is committed”. The arrest of the appellant was accepted as being the commencement of the prosecution, albeit begun with a charge of rape. More than 6 months had elapsed from that time of his arrest until he pleaded guilty to the lesser charge. The time limitation imposed by the Criminal Code had apparently been overlooked by the Crown Prosecutor and certainly had not been brought to the attention of the trial judge. Nonetheless, the limitation imposed by the Code was successfully raised on the appeal, notwithstanding the plea of guilty entered at trial.
	
	
	The leading judgment in Cooling was delivered by Thomas J (Ambrose J concurring). His Honour said (at 378):
	


“Section 215 is an example of a statute of limitation in the context of criminal law. Such provision in no way destroys the jurisdiction of a court to determine whether it applies or not (Parisienne Basket Shoes Pty Ltd v Whyte (1937) 59 CLR 369), or to proceed in accordance with that determination. In short, it is a point ‘not going to jurisdiction but to process’: Parisienne Basket Shoes case at 393 … . Sometimes such provisions are described as ‘a defence against an information which is out of time’ (Adams v Chas S Watson Pty Ltd (1938) 60 CLR 545), although the concept of a defence is not really appropriate … Once it comes to the notice of the court that the prosecution is out of time it would be wrong for it to allow the prosecution to continue, even if defence counsel refused to rely on it.”


	
	His Honour later observed (at 378-379) that once a statutory limitation point is raised “it is the duty of the court to give effect to it”. His Honour also contrasted the position in civil law proceedings, where a limitation may be waived, with the position that pertains in criminal proceedings. He said (at 380):
	


“In civil law a party may, and frequently does, wittingly or unwittingly, waive the benefit of a limitation act. However such an analogue may not safely be drawn in this respect in the criminal law. Here there is an implied prohibition upon prosecution unless begun within six months.”


	
	The decision in Cooling was followed by the Court of Appeal in Victoria in R v Tait [1995] VSC 154; (1996) 1 VR 662. The facts are not dissimilar from those considered in Cooling. In Tait the appellant was committed for trial on charges that included attempted rape and rape. He pleaded guilty to two counts of what amounted to attempted unlawful carnal knowledge and unlawful carnal knowledge. Following his plea, he was sentenced to imprisonment. Initially he appealed against sentence but subsequently was given leave to amend his grounds of appeal to include a ground against conviction. The latter ground of appeal was founded upon the provisions of s 48(6) of the Crimes Act 1958 (Victoria) which provided that no prosecution for an offence against the section committed with or upon a person of or above the age of 12 years “shall be commenced more than 12 months after its commission”. It was accepted that the victim of the crime was above the age of 12 years at the time of each offence to which the plea of guilty was entered. It was also accepted that in respect of each offence, the prosecution was commenced more than 12 months after its commission.
	
	
	The Court upheld the appeal, quashing the convictions and directing the entry of a judgment and verdict of acquittal. The leading judgment was delivered by Callaway JA (Winneke P and Crockett AJA agreeing). Applying the decision in Cooling, his Honour said (at 665) that the section imposing the limitation period for the relevant prosecution “does not provide a defence at all but only a bar to prosecution”. His Honour continued:
	


“If the applicant could not lawfully be prosecuted, which Cooling’s case establishes, he could not lawfully be convicted. The convictions were, in the relevant sense, illegal.”


	
	When addressing the consequence of a plea of guilty having been entered at trial, his Honour said (at 665):
	


“Counsel for the Crown submitted that there was no miscarriage of justice, because the applicant had been represented and had pleaded guilty in the context of a plea negotiation, having been committed for trial but not presented on charges of attempted rape and rape arising from the same acts. I do not think that that weighs against the illegal quality of the convictions or that it is a basis upon which to distinguish the facts from those in Cooling’s case, where, it will be recalled, the appellant was not only committed but indicted on charges of rape arising from the same acts and his pleas of guilty to unlawful carnal knowledge were accepted by the Crown. A statutory bar against prosecution of the kind in s 48(6) cannot be waived, or made the subject of negotiation, as if it were a private privilege.”


	
	In Industrial Registrar v Matters [2007] NSWIRComm 250 a Full Bench of the Industrial Court of New South Wales was required to consider a motion for contempt of the Commission, such contempt being an offence imposed by s 180 of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW). By s 398 of that same Act, proceedings for an offence against the Act were required to be commenced “not later than 12 months after the offence was alleged to have been committed”. The motion for contempt was filed more than 12 months after the contempt relied upon by the Registrar. In that circumstance, the Court determined that the motion for contempt was required to be dismissed.
	
	
	In reaching its decision, the Full Bench applied the decision in Cooling. Having cited passages from the judgment of Thomas J to which I have earlier referred, the Full Bench said at [48]:
	


“48   It follows that the present proceedings, commenced at her Honour’s direction are within the Industrial Court’s jurisdiction to consider, even if commenced outside the limitation period under s 398. However, they are proceedings to which the respondent has available a plea in bar or defence which the Court is obliged to give effect to once it comes to the Court’s attention.”


	
	In the course of providing its reasons in Matters, the Court relied upon an analysis of the cases directed to the present point in WorkCover Authority of NSW (Inspector Keenan) v Lucon (Australia) Pty Ltd [2002] NSWIRComm 68. In the course of delivering their reasons in the latter case, the Full Bench applied the reasoning in both Cooling and Tait, as that reasoning was applied to a statutory time limitation for the commencement of proceedings to prosecute for an offence. By reference to those cases the Full Bench observed at [90]:
	


“90   There appears to be some difference of approach as to the accurate way to characterise limitation provisions in criminal proceedings. One view is that limitation provisions operate as a plea in bar to prosecution: see, for example Tait [citation omitted]; R v Cooling [citation omitted]. The other view is that a limitation provision operates as a defence: Pearce v BHP Steel (AWA) Pty Ltd [citation omitted] and Adams v Chas S Watson Pty Ltd [citation omitted].”


	
	That difference of approach is reflected in the judgment in Matters at [48]. In neither case was it necessary for the court to determine which of the differences of approach was to be preferred.
	
	
	The various decisions to which I have referred seem to me to give rise to the following (perhaps overlapping) principles:
	



	
	where the commencement of the proceedings for the offence charged are the subject of a statutory limitation period, the prosecutor bears the onus of establishing that the proceedings have been commenced within the time limited by that provision;
	
	
	once the court is made aware, by whatever means, that proceedings for an offence may have been commenced after a statutory limitation period had expired, and the facts establish that to be the case, it is not open to the Court to allow the prosecution to continue, even if the accused/defendant does not seek to invoke the statutory provision;
	
	
	that is because the bar upon commencement of proceedings imposed by the statute cannot be waived and the court is bound to give effect to the statute;
	
	
	the need for the court to give effect to a statutory bar applies even if a plea of guilty has been entered to the offence, the prosecution of which has been commenced after the limitation period has expired;
	
	
	as the commencement of proceedings after expiration of the limitation period is proscribed, so also must the entry of a conviction in those proceedings be proscribed as the court lacks power to accept a plea of guilty in such circumstances; and
	
	
	any conviction entered as a result of a plea taken in such circumstances would be “illegal”.
	



	
	Application of those principles to my finding that the evidence does not establish the commencement of proceedings for the offences charged within the two year period limited by s 127(5) of the EPA Act, means that the plea of guilty entered by Mr Screnci cannot be accepted. Further, I favour the view expressed in both Cooling and Tait that s 127(5), once engaged by the facts, operates as a plea in bar rather than as a defence.
	
	
	The latter conclusion is drawn from the observation in those cases, accepted as correct in Matters, that once the limitation provision is raised, the court is bound to give effect to it. That approach, which I accept as a matter of statutory construction, means that the Court lacks any discretion to maintain a guilty plea. On that reasoning, the statutory provision must logically give rise to a plea in bar rather than a defence.
	
	
	Although not conclusively supporting that last proposition, it is nonetheless consistent with it that s 125(4) identifies, in terms, a “defence” to a prosecution for a particular breach of the EPA Act, namely failure to comply with an order given by the appropriate authority under Div 2A of Pt 6 of the EPA Act. By contrast, the language of “defence” is not used in respect of the time limitation imposed by s 127(5).
	
	
	The consequence of this reasoning is that the summons commencing the prosecution for each offence with which Mr Screni was charged ought to be dismissed and a verdict of acquittal entered. This is so, notwithstanding the circumstance that Mr Screnci pleaded guilty to each offence. That plea is an admission of the essential elements of each offence. As the time limitation imposed by s 127(5) is not an essential element of each offence, to the extent relevant to the present motion, the plea does not constitute an admission that the proceedings were commenced within the time limited by the subsection. Upon that reasoning, I have formed the opinion that an order allowing the plea of guilty entered to each charge to be withdrawn is unnecessary.
	
	
	Against the possibility that I am wrong in reaching the opinion last expressed, I will briefly state the reasons why I would grant leave for those pleas to be withdrawn. My reasons respond to Mr Screnci’s notice of motion seeking that leave.
	


Leave to withdraw the pleas of guilty


	
	There are two possible approaches to the grant of leave that Mr Screnci seeks. The first is that directed to the circumstance in which a plea in bar is sought to be raised when a plea, earlier entered, is seen to be inconsistent with the proposed plea in bar. That circumstance was considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Stone [2005] NSWCCA 344; 64 NSWLR 413. There, the appellant had entered a plea of not guilty and then sought to raise a plea of autrefois convict. Hunt AJA (Hislop J agreeing) stated at [20] that the trial court would have been in error had it permitted the defendant to enter the plea in bar while a plea of not guilty remained on the record.
	
	
	In a separate judgment, Smart AJ, while not finally determining the issue, expressed support for the approach that “technically” a plea in bar could not be entertained while a plea of guilty remained on the record. However, at [85]-[95] his Honour suggested that the manner in which that circumstance might be addressed was to give leave to the appellant to withdraw the original plea and enter the plea in bar provided the latter plea “was a good one”; was not highly technical and was not devoid of merit.
	
	
	If the observations of Smart AJ reflect the appropriate approach to be taken when two apparently inconsistent pleas are raised, as I respectfully consider they do having regard to the authorities cited by his Honour, such approach would support the grant of leave to Mr Screnci to withdraw his pleas of guilty. His plea is not technical and for reasons earlier explained, it is both “a good plea” in that it clearly has merit.
	
	
	The second basis upon which to consider granting leave to withdraw the guilty pleas are the general principles applicable to an application for leave of that kind. Those principles were, earlier this year, stated by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Kim v R [2015] NSWCCA 115 and repeated even more recently by the Court of Appeal in Brown Brothers v Pittwater Council [2015] NSWCA 215; 209 LGERA 53. Fundamentally, it is necessary for an applicant seeking leave to withdraw a guilty plea to establish that a miscarriage of justice had or would occur if that plea is allowed to stand. As stated in Kim at [55] and repeated in Brown Brothers at [157], without being exhaustive, a miscarriage of justice may be shown in circumstances where:
	


“●   the applicant did not appreciate the nature of the charge to which the plea was entered: [citation of authority omitted];

●   the applicant was not in possession of all the facts and the plea was not attributable to a genuine consciousness or recognition of guilt: [citation of authority omitted];

●   there was a mistake or other circumstance affecting the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt; [citation of authority omitted]; or where

●   the advice of the applicant’s lawyer(s) was imprudent, inappropriate or incorrect: [citation of authority omitted]”.


	
	It seems to me that at least two of the bases upon which a miscarriage of justice or potential miscarriage of justice may be demonstrated for the purpose of supporting an application for leave to withdraw a guilty plea are present in the proceedings before me. The integrity of the plea entered by Mr Screnci is clearly undermined by the operation of s 127(5). Secondly, the advice received from his legal team prior to entering a plea of guilty was, by later established facts, shown to be incorrect.
	
	
	As the Court of Appeal observed in Brown Brothers at [158], there is no presumption one way or another favouring or weighing against an applicant for leave to have an earlier plea of guilty changed to one of not guilty. Whether such an application should be granted depends entirely on “whether a miscarriage of justice, in the view of the judge, would occur if the leave sought were denied the applicant”.
	
	
	In one sense, these principles may not seem directly applicable to the circumstances here present. Admitting, by plea, the elements of an offence charged is not inconsistent with raising a plea in bar, the effect of which is to contend that the law does not permit the institution of proceedings prosecuting that offence because of the passage of time since the offence is alleged to have been committed. The miscarriage of justice occurs in the present case if, contrary to the holding of the courts in Cooling, Tait and Manners, a plea is allowed to remain and a conviction entered.
	
	
	As those cases hold, once it is established that proceedings were commenced after the limitation period had expired, as I have held to be so in the present proceedings, any conviction and consequent penalty imposed is an exercise that is beyond the power of the court to have imposed. Therein also lies the miscarriage of justice if it is thought that Mr Screnci’s guilty pleas deny him the right to rely upon s 127(5) as a plea in bar.
	
	
	As a result, to the extent necessary, I would uphold Mr Screnci’s motion to set aside the plea of guilty entered in each proceeding on 27 March 2015.

2702313,R v Youkhana [2015] NSWDC 314,"Sentence​


	
	The offender, Linda Youkhana, was found guilty by a jury following a trial on a charge of intentionally causing grievous bodily harm.
	


Between 30 March 2013 and 2 April 2013 at Smithfield in the State of New South Wales caused grievous bodily harm to ‘A’ with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.


	
	The charge was brought pursuant to s 33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The maximum penalty for that offence is 25 years imprisonment. A standard non parole period of 7 years has been established for that offence.
	


Offender’s background 


	
	The offender, Linda Youkhana ('Ms Youkhana') is the mother of the victim, ‘A’. She moved to Australia from Iraq in 2004, at the age of 19.
	
	
	The offender has two other children, JY, now aged 9, and AY, now aged 5. At the time of the alleged incident, the victim, A, was aged two.
	
	
	The offender is 30 years of age (born on 15 September 1985).
	
	
	At the time of the offence, the offender was married to Benyamin Youkhana. He is not the biological father of A or of AY. That was not known to him at the time of the incident. Her marriage to Benyamin Youkhana took place in Australia when she, the offender, was aged 18. It was an arranged marriage. The Pre-Sentence Report simply states that her relationship with Benyamin ceased in 2013 as a result of infidelity and that they subsequently divorced in 2015.
	
	
	Also living in the home at the relevant time was the maternal grandmother (Faha Suleiman) of the child and mother of the offender.
	


Facts


	
	At 3pm on 1 April 2013, the child, A, was driven to Westmead Hospital Emergency Department by the offender. There, the offender presented the child, A, to the medical staff. When A was presented to hospital, the clinical opinion was, at that time, that she was close to death (Dr Marks’ evidence on 16 September 2015).
	
	
	The first person the offender spoke to was Registered Nurse (‘RN’) Julie Austin, the rapid triage assessment nurse. RN Austin noted that A was pale, her lips were a bluey colour, and her body was cool. She asked the offender “what’s wrong with her?” The offender replied “I’m not sure what’s wrong with her, I think she fell, but I didn’t see it.”
	
	
	RN Austin escorted the offender and A through to the resuscitation area of Emergency to be seen immediately. She asked “How long has she been like this for?” The offender paused before answering, “I don’t know”. The offender did not answer RN Austin’s further questions.
	
	
	Immediately, a number of doctors and nurses began treating A. Dr Thosar asked the offender what had happened to A and the offender responded with words to the effect that A “… had a fall while playing about half an hour prior to arrival”, and since then had been turning blue, going in and out of consciousness.
	
	
	The offender told Dr Paul Tait that A was “…playing with her brother AY in the house” while she, the offender, was in the kitchen and “…she heard running and then a thud followed by A crying”. When the offender went to investigate, A was lying on the floor crying. The offender said that she then drove A to the hospital.
	
	
	A had sustained multiple injuries and more than one acute serious injury. In this context, ‘acute’ meant sustained within a maximum of 12-24 hours of her presentation to hospital and very likely within the approximately 1 hour time frame as described by the offender – but not by the mechanism described by the offender.
	
	
	The child had earlier been seen on 26 March 2013. On that occasion, an ambulance took her to the hospital. She, A, was in varying states of consciousness over the journey. When seen by the doctor, she was fully examined and was found to have no apparent bruising other than that which was fully consistent with the history given. That formed the basis of the Crown case that whatever had occurred, occurred after 26 March 2013, and between that date and, most likely, 1 April 2013.
	


Injuries


	
	A summary of A’s injuries included:
	



	
	Acute head injury – bilateral subdural and interhemispheric haematomas resulting in significant residual brain damage and functional impairment.
	
	
	Bilateral retinal haemorrhages resulting in cortical blindness.
	
	
	Subdural bleeding and swelling of the spinal cord.
	
	
	Multiple rib fractures with mature callous formation. These were healed and there was insufficient evidence as to how they were caused.
	
	
	Liver and splenic laceration
	
	
	Fracture of right elbow (old)
	
	
	Fractured right tibia (shin).
	
	
	Bruising: left thigh, 5 circular bruises in a pattern suggestive of fingertip pressure; right thigh: 8x4cm; left chest: 1cm diameter over 5th & 6th rib.
	



	
	As a result of the offence, A underwent an emergency craniotomy to reduce the swelling to her brain. She was at risk of death at the time. She was then intubated for 19 days, followed by being cared for in the intensive nursing care ward, with a complex regime of medication.
	
	
	Of those injuries, the most serious and life threatening injury was a severe traumatic brain injury. Brain imaging showed multiple areas of brain infarction, resulting in severe cognitive and physical disabilities.
	


Long term issues


	
	A has also developed cerebral palsy and has spasticity. She requires full-time care and is unable to feed herself independently. As a result of the offence, she also has significant developmental delay (see Dr Marks’ evidence below).
	
	
	A’s injuries are set out in the Life Without Barriers Reports which became exhibits S 11 and S 12. That is the agency which is responsible for the guardianship of the child. She now has spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy which affects her physical movement, including eating, grasping, and sitting. She requires leg and hip braces and is confined to a wheelchair. She is unable to draw, use a spoon, point, or pick up a toy. She is not toilet trained and is unlikely to ever be able to independently use a toilet. She has severe vision impairment.
	


Issues


	
	The existence and extent of those injuries were essentially not disputed. Similarly, it was not disputed as to whether those injuries constitute grievous bodily harm. The only issue at trial was whether the offender caused those injuries.
	
	
	The matter proceeded to a five week trial in the face of a strong circumstantial Crown case and detailed medical evidence. Since the verdict, the offender has maintained an attitude of total denial towards this offence, and has sought to blame others and has maintained her innocence.
	


Other persons present


	
	At the time of the incident, the offender was staying at the house with her mother, her son, AY (then aged 3 years old) and A (then aged 2 years old). The child was taken to hospital on 1 April 2013, being Easter Monday.
	
	
	The offender’s husband, Benyamin, had stayed at his brother’s house with the couple’s child, JY, on 28 March 2013, being the Thursday preceding the Easter weekend. He was therefore not present at the time and day of the assault on A.
	


2011 assault conviction


	
	The offender pleaded guilty on 22 August 2012 to a charge of assault on 17 December 2011. Two police officers attended that scene. Red marks on A were photographed. The offender admitted causing the marks, but not slapping her body. The prior incident involved the offender “pinching” the child.
	
	
	The agreed facts for that offence were that what was involved was “a pinch”. That is all that was led before the jury at trial in relation to this incident.
	


Prior acts


	
	An amended Tendency Notice relied on during the trial referred to a number of incidents where it was suggested that the offender used to essentially “force feed” A, including holding her mouth open or by pinching her nose to keep her mouth open.
	
	
	In support, the Crown also relied on evidence obtained from witnesses in the extended family that the offender was:
	



	
	Engaged in forced feeding by forcing the child’s mouth open and holding her nose closed;
	
	
	Hitting A across the face with an open hand, hard enough to leave a visible red mark, and;
	
	
	Throwing her onto a tiled floor when frustrated by trying to put on her shoes.
	



	
	On 26 March 2013, the offender was observed to be angry when the child spilt some water on a couch. She hit the child across the face and the child fell and hit her head on the floor, causing the child to lose consciousness. On that occasion, the offender told medical staff that the child had fallen from her cot.
	
	
	Those acts formed the basis of the matters on the s 166 certificate which I have set out later in these remarks.
	


The offender’s account of events 


	
	The history given by Ms Youkhana to medical staff in relation to the incident on 1 April 2013 contained a number of variations. However, all her accounts were essentially a version of an accidental simple fall or the possibility of being pushed by her then three year old son, AY. Those accounts were clearly rejected by the jury.
	
	
	The Defence case was also that there were other alternative scenarios and causes for the injuries which had occurred. Those scenarios put by the Defence before the jury were that the child may have fallen from her cot on the previous occasion of 26 March 2013 or that she had been pushed over onto a concrete floor, albeit a floor covered by lineoleum tiles. The child frequently played on a trampoline which formed the basis of the submission that she could have fallen or on which she could have experienced a knock to the head and body.
	


Defence written submissions


	
	The submissions provided by Defence counsel are in conflict with the clear finding of the jury as to intent as well as the medical evidence which indicates more than one blow or traumatic event.
	


Medical evidence at trial


	
	This is a difficult sentencing exercise in at least one respect, because the offender seems to be incapable of accepting responsibility for her actions and, in particular, the consequences to her daughter.
	
	
	The offender continues to maintain her innocence and blames others for what occurred to A. Her evidence at the trial was unconvincing to say the least, and was clearly rejected by the jury. Mr Watson-Munro (Report dated 11 December 2015 – exhibit S 5) said that the offender is deeply regretful about what has occurred, and the attendant consequences. However, she continues to categorically deny any responsibility for what occurred to A.
	
	
	In those circumstances, it is appropriate for some of the medical and factual evidence given at the trial to be set out so that those responsible for her treatment in the future may be aware of the reality of the relevant medical evidence. It may be important for subsequent treatment and/or parole authorities to determine what is an appropriate course of treatment or supervision for the offender. That evidence may also be relevant in relation to future care proceedings as have been foreshadowed in Mr Watson-Munro’s report.
	
	
	In relation to the medical evidence, there were two doctors called, Dr Donald and Dr Marks and a report by Dr Tait was read and adopted by Dr Marks.
	
	
	There were essentially two issues arising from that evidence:
	



	
	The degree of force causing the injuries; and
	
	
	The causes for the injuries, especially the intra-cranial injuries, the retinal damage and the abdominal injuries.
	


Dr Paul Tait 


	
	In the opinion of Dr Paul Tait, Consultant Paediatrician in Child Protection, there was no adequate explanation as to how A’s injuries occurred, specifically, that the offender’s account of the sequence of events was “not at all plausible”. Dr Tait’s opinion was set out in detail in his report dated 15 July 2013 (exhibit S 10). The report is relied upon in its entirety. Dr Tait’s unavailability meant that his report was essentially adopted in its entirety by Dr Marks (see below), who included in her report the materials she read before giving her opinion.
	
	
	A short summary of Dr Tait’s opinion is set out at paragraph 44 of Dr Marks’ report:
	


“… it was clear she (A) would be left with significant residual brain damage and functional impairment. She was already developing spasticity of her limbs with reduced mobility increasing the risk of contractures, that is, stiffening of the joints in a flexed position. At best it would appear that she was able to recognise that there were people nearby and that she could hear. Clinically, she was blind, probably a cortical blindness. She had no real independent function or purposeful/voluntary movements. She had generalised spasticity. She could not stand independently. She was incontinent and unable to manage oral feeding.”

Dr Terence Donald


	
	In the opinion of Dr Terence Donald, Paediatric Forensic Physician, the incident which led to A’s admission to hospital on 1 April 2013 involved high impact force to both her head and her abdomen. Dr Donald’s opinion is set out in detail in his report dated 9 September 2014 (exhibit S 9). The report annexes Dr Donald’s curriculum vitae. He has also had experience in case review matters – which is essentially what he carried out here.
	
	
	Dr Donald said that the force required to cause the head and abdominal injuries could not be generated by another similarly aged child unless it involved A being pushed from a significant height, much greater than her standing height, and more of the order of 3 or 4 metres. This opinion contradicted the suggested version proffered by the offender, being either an accidental fall or a push by the offender’s older child AY (then aged 3).
	
	
	Further, Dr Donald stated that, in considering whether A’s injuries could have been inflicted by the older child AY, it was first necessary to consider which injuries were likely to have occurred at the same time as the head injury.
	
	
	Dr Donald said the abdominal and head injuries could have been caused by the same incident or, possibly two incidents at the same or similar time. The injuries described in all the medical and hospital reports were quite rare, and were not consistent with minor impact injury. Dr Donald had never seen such injuries nor read of any such injuries being explained by the account given by the offender in this instance. The injuries could have occurred or been caused by a short fall (less than 1.5 metres) but almost always when the fall was onto a hard surface.
	
	
	The medical evidence established, in my view, that A suffered at least two high impact forces, one to the head and one to the abdominal region, within a short period of time prior to her presentation at the hospital. The extent of the force required to cause the injuries was indicative of deliberate force inflicted by an adult, either by direct blows or by impact with a wall or with furniture when thrown with force.
	
	
	The child A’s CT scans showed the force applied to her head was high (strong) rather than low (weak). Dr Donald could not quantify the level of force save in qualitative and comparative terms as being a significant fall with a high velocity impact.
	
	
	In the opinion of both medical specialists, even if A had suffered a head injury on 26th March 2013, such an injury could not have resulted in the acute traumatic brain injury with which she presented on 1 April without an additional high force impact. That is, the hypothesis that an accidental fall in the circumstances described by the offender on 1 April 2013 exacerbated a pre-existing head injury from 5 days earlier, was not adopted as a reasonable possibility by either Dr Marks or Dr Donald.
	
	
	The Crown relied upon the medical opinions to establish that the history given by the offender could not explain the extent and nature of the injuries suffered by A. In turn, the Crown relied upon the false accounts, given by the offender to explain the injuries, as lies, which were told deliberately and with knowledge that the truth would implicate the offender in the offence charged.
	


Dr Susan Marks


	
	Dr Susan Marks is a Staff Specialist in the Child Protection Unit, at the Children’s Hospital at Westmead, as well as in the Emergency Department of that Hospital.
	
	
	Dr Marks provided an amended report dated 13 September 2015 (exhibit S 8). Also annexed to that report are a Brain Injury Clinic Report dated 17 June 2015 and Rehabilitation Team Discharge Report dated 15 July 2013.
	
	
	Dr Tait is now no longer employed at the hospital, nor was he well enough to give evidence at trial. The Crown approach was to ask Dr Marks to read all materials, including hospital and medical records of Dr Tait, as well as his report. Dr Marks’ opinion was based on her own observations of A and the records and the report of Dr Tait – who could not give evidence at the trial.
	
	
	Dr Marks’ opinions were based on the observations of the injuries to A’s head, spinal and abdominal regions, as well as her fractures, including to her right tibia. Some of those bruises were fading.
	
	
	In relation to the abdominal injuries as was detailed in [66], [67] and [69] of her report, Dr Marks said that:
	


“A had evidence of major trauma to her abdomen including lacerations to her liver, her spleen, contusion to her pancreas and contusion and haemorrhage of her left adrenal gland. The raised lipase level was also indicative of trauma to the pancreas. Acute trauma with shock can lead to haemorrhage of the adrenal glands, but the presence of adrenal contusion (bruising) suggests that the cause of the adrenal injury was blunt trauma.

…

The abdominal findings are highly suspicious for one or more severe, forceful blunt impacts (direct blows) to A’s abdomen and, in the absence of any history that could explain these findings, the abdominal injuries are highly suspicious for inflicted injury.”


	
	Dr Marks’ opinion was that there could be no explanation for the nature and location of the injuries being other than due to the application of force. They were not consistent with a child either falling over or being pushed over on to a piece of furniture. Dr Marks’ evidence was that there needed to have been the direct application of force to the areas manifesting the injuries as set out. She did not accept that the injuries could be caused by a short fall, nor were the injuries consistent with being caused by a motor vehicle accident.
	
	
	In relation to the spinal subdural haemorrhage identified, Dr Marks explained the mechanisms which could have given rise to those matters, and the areas where the blood was located, as well as why in this case, the location of the blood was highly suspicious. In particular, an alternative hypothesis was suggested, as to the cause for the bleeding/blood found in the lumbar thoracic region (lower spine) area, namely, that the bleeding could have commenced in the head then flowed down to the lower spine region. However, Dr Marks said (on the voir dire) that she did not consider that explanation to be particularly likely, because, whilst there was bleeding in the head, and then in the lumbar thoracic region, there was no blood found in between, i.e. in the upper thoracic region. That, according to Dr Marks, indicated that the blood found in the lower spine was not caused by a flow of blood from the head.
	
	
	Further, Dr Marks outlined the typical injuries suffered by children who have suffered suspicious injuries as compared with children who have been involved in motor vehicle accidents. Dr Marks said that children involved in road accidents do not typically present with any spinal bleeding, whereas up to 50% of children who have sustained suspicious injuries have presented with spinal bleeding.
	
	
	Details of the head and eye injuries suffered by A were set out at [58], [60] and [61] of Dr Marks’ report. There was no evidence of any predisposing medical condition for the subdural bleeding. The possible explanation was the change in the direction of the forces being applied to the head, and the repetitive application of such forces. A fall or a push would not cause such injuries with those symptoms.
	
	
	According to Dr Marks’ earlier report dated 19 August 2015 (which was since amended), the injury that was sustained by A on 1 April 2013 was highly suspicious. The opinions of Dr Marks were consistent with Dr Tait and Dr Donald, that the injuries involved “high impact force”.
	
	
	A’s presentation with bilateral subdural haemorrhages and profound hypoxic/ischemic brain injury were highly suspicious of a severe head injury including an acceleration-deceleration (shaking) injury, rather than an impact injury, although she said an impact injury could additionally have been inflicted on the head area. Dr Donald’s evidence was that shaking would not have caused sufficient force. However, even if there had been impact injuries to her head, they would not explain the specific subdural haematoma.
	
	
	The injuries to A’s eyes included retinal haemorrhages. Dr Marks’ findings indicated direct forceful impact trauma to A’s right eye but modified her views in cross-examination. In regards to A’s abdominal trauma, Dr Marks referred in her report to the one or more severe forceful blunt impacts to her abdomen, which were highly suspicious of inflicted injury.
	
	
	Furthermore, the bruises on A (rib fractures and other bone injuries) were not consistent with normal activity and play. Dr Marks’ findings were that A’s multiple injuries were not explained by the history provided. The presentation was highly suspicious of severe inflicted injuries including both impact injuries and acceleration-deceleration injuries. Dr Marks confirmed that A’s head injuries were life-threatening.
	
	
	The Crown case was that the injuries were inconsistent with a fall onto a linoleum floor, even when being pushed by another 3 year old child. Further, that those injuries nor the extent of them were not consistent with being caused by long term injuries even from the events of the previous week. The jury verdict indicated that the case put forward by the defence was not accepted.
	


Defence case 


	
	The Defence case at trial was that the evidence of each of the Crown witnesses who were relatives or family connections of the offender, were all concocted and/or contaminated by the witnesses, as a result of being influenced by what they had heard from other witnesses before and over the course of the trial. That was particularly the case given the extended family discussions which had clearly taken place about the offender both generally and in the context of her having had an affair unknown to her husband. That argument was clearly rejected by the jury.
	
	
	In that regard, the offender’s case was that there were other people there at the time including the elder brother of the child, namely, AY, then aged 3 as well as the grandmother of A.
	


Findings on medical evidence


	
	I accept the evidence of the medical experts, Dr Marks, Dr Tait and Dr Donald. To the extent that there were differences and distinctions between the doctors’ evidence, those aspects went towards determining the possible causes of the injuries sustained by A. In that respect, the jury verdict made clear that the injuries were caused by the actions of Ms Youkhana.
	
	
	Defence counsel submits that the Court cannot exclude that the ultimate injuries were the result of other contributing factors such as seizures or raised intra cranial pressure. I do not accept that submission and find, consistently with the jury’s verdict, that the causes of A’s injuries, specifically, the abdominal injuries, the intra-cranial pressure and retinal haemorrhages, were the actions of the offender. It may have been that the subsequent developments, including the intra-cranial pressure flowed on from the initial assault or assaults. In my view, there is no evidence which I would accept sufficiently to establish, or even infer, issues of causation or absence of foreseeable injury by any other factor or factors other than the actions of Ms Youkhana.
	
	
	There is no evidence which I accept to establish that there was any other cause for the injuries as they occurred and subsequently developed.
	
	
	Notwithstanding this, even if the injuries were as a result of such factors, the precipitating cause was the assault by Ms Youkhana on her daughter, A.
	


Evidence on sentencing proceedings


	
	A Pre-Sentence Report was prepared by Oscar Yu, dated 4 December 2015, which was tendered (exhibit S 6).
	
	
	A Report from Mr Watson-Munro, psychologist, dated 11 December 2015, was also tendered (exhibit S 5). He described Ms Youkhana as cooperative, though highly anxious and depressed. In that Report, Ms Youkhana adheres to her view that “… the injuries were the function of an accident.”
	
	
	Mr Watson-Munro considered that there were no indicia of major psychiatric disturbance, such as delusion of reference, formal thought disorder or auditory or visual hallucinations. He thought she was suffering from major depression according to the DSM-5 criteria. He has serious concerns regarding her mental state.
	


Offender’s attitude since verdict


	
	The offender has maintained her view according to the Pre-Sentence Report (exhibit S 6) dated 14 December 2015, that the “… injuries may have been perpetrated by her ex-partner, and maintains it was a result of an accident”. Clearly, no remorse has been expressed.
	


Offender’s treatment


	
	The Pre-Sentence Report sets out that the offender’s general practitioner referred her to a psychologist for her “major depression due to her legal matters and (because) there was reference made to domestic violence”.
	
	
	She saw her psychologist on three occasions in 2013, and on eight occasions in 2015. Apparently, her psychiatrist diagnosed her with “adjustment disorder in response to her complex psycho-social history and ongoing legal matters”.
	


Offender’s mental condition


	
	It becomes relevant in this case to determine to what extent the principles of general and specific deterrence should apply. Submissions have been made by both counsel in general terms.
	
	
	Here, the offender was experiencing some stress, arising from her relatively recent background as a refugee moving from Iraq to Jordan to Australia, as well as the stressful situation of her marriage. But her issues regarding her affair were ongoing and a situation in which she had involved herself voluntarily. Her actions do not appear to have been predicated by any deep seated psychiatric condition.
	
	
	It is submitted by the Crown that the offender took out her frustrations upon her highly vulnerable child. Defence counsel disputes that this should be accepted as fact, and submits that it is only an inference which is not supported by the evidence and denied by the offender. It is not necessary to make a conclusive finding in this regard, nor is it warranted given the absence of sufficient evidence and any disclosure of the facts or background by the offender.
	
	
	There is no evidence of alcohol or of drug dependence, mental illness, or other subjective features which may have impacted upon the offender’s moral culpability for this offence.
	
	
	This offence needs to be considered against the background of matters relating to the incident as set out, her subjective features, and her prior history including the prior assaults which took place by the offender on her baby daughter over an 18 month to two year period.
	


General deterrence


	
	Here, there is a clear need for general deterrence to mark the community’s abhorrence of crimes committed against (particularly) very young and vulnerable children.
	
	
	In R v Pitcher (unrep, NSWCCA, 19 February 1996), his Honour Cole JA said that:
	


“Young children cannot protect themselves from the acts of adults. They cannot lodge complaints about criminal behaviour perpetrated upon them. They are entirely reliant upon their parents or those in custodial situations to care for them and protect them… the only protection which society can give to young children is the protection afforded by the Courts. The Courts must make clear by their sentences that acts of violence on young children, whether within or without a custodial situation, will not be tolerated in our society and the criminal acts of violence against young children will result in appropriately severe sentences. Deterrence through the severity of sentence is the only way in which young children can be protected.”


	
	Those comments are also apposite in this case.
	


Specific deterrence 


	
	In the circumstances, there appears to be a limited need for the application of the principles of specific deterrence. However, what needs to be remembered in this regard are the prior assaults and the other matters as set out in the Tendency Notice, being the s 166 matters dealt with below.
	


Authorities


	
	I accept the Crown submission that the facts upon which an offender comes to be sentenced after trial is a matter for the assessment of the sentencing judge, provided those facts do not controvert the jury’s verdict: Cheung v R (2001) 209 CLR 1; [2001] HCA 67. I have also borne in mind that facts and circumstances that are adverse to the offender to be taken into account must be established beyond reasonable doubt, whereas circumstances favourable to the offender must be established on the balance of probabilities: R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54.
	
	
	This becomes relevant in relation to the issue of intention where, in my view, the jury’s verdict mandates a finding that the offender acted intentionally.
	
	
	Defence counsel submits that the Court is to only have regard to the consequences of an offence that was intended or could have reasonably been foreseen: Josefski v R [2010] NSWCCA 41 at [4] and [39] and that the offender is not to be sentenced for harm which was not intended or could not have reasonably have been intended. In light of the jury’s verdict however, I do not accept that the offender could not have reasonably foreseen that her actions could have resulted in grievous bodily harm occurring. Not only is that an element of the offence, but I also cannot be satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the offender did not foresee that she, a grown adult woman, could have inflicted that force on a child of A’s age, without causing those injuries, or at least injuries of that nature.
	
	
	BW v R (2011) 218 A Crim R 10 was a case of manslaughter whereby the offender, the father of the victim, his seven year old autistic daughter, was sentenced to a head sentence of 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years. This case was not one of manslaughter. However, the actions leading to the grievous bodily harm were of a protracted and continuous nature, and stemmed from an apparent disregard by the offender for her daughter’s health and wellbeing.
	
	
	I have had regard to R v Lolesio [2014] NSWCCA 219 which was a factually similar case and a recent outline by the Court of Criminal Appeal of relevant sentencing principles. There, the offender was convicted of two counts of intentionally causing grievous bodily harm to his six week old child. The first offence (of two) involved him inflicting injuries on the child including fractures to the ankle and other bones in the foot, bruising and swelling. That offence was committed when the offender was alone with the baby and, after inflicting these injuries, the offender did not take any steps to have the baby taken to a hospital or have her examined. The expert evidence in that case determined two possible causes of the injuries – either the pulling and twisting of the lower limbs, causing a shearing at the end of the bone; or the offender flailing the baby in a forceful way, causing a crushing injury, or by holding the baby’s feet and bending them in hyperflexion.
	
	
	The second offence occurred only a week later. That involved injuries to the baby’s arms and wrists, further foot fractures, as well as the fracturing of four of the baby’s ribs, and a subdural haematoma. The expert evidence found that forceful squeezing was involved, resulting in the rib fractures. Further, significant or severe forces involving repetitive rotational movements caused the subdural haematoma.
	
	
	Those offences arose out of the offender’s anger regarding financial stress. He, like this offender, was not forthright with the version he gave others as to how these injuries could have occurred.
	
	
	It was found to have been aggravating in those offences that the offender abused his position of trust, and that the victim was a vulnerable person given her age.
	
	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal held that the initial finding of the sentencing judge of a below mid-range of objective seriousness based on the limited injuries caused was erroneous, and held that it was in the middle range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	In that case the Court of Criminal Appeal imposed sentences of:
	



	
	Head sentence of five years, with a non-parole period of three years;
	
	
	Head sentence of six years and six months, with a non-parole period of three years and six months.
	



	
	While both cases involved cruel and unwarranted violence, I consider the injuries in the current case to be more serious and permanent than those in Lolesio.
	
	
	In assessing the objective criminality of a s 33 offence, the Court is to have significant regard to the extent of the injuries sustained by the victim: Regina v Mitchell, Regina v Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296, although this is not the only factor to take into account. 
	
	
	In Lolesio, the matters which were evaluated to determine criminality were set out at [75]:
	



	
	The injuries caused, including the seriousness and permanency;
	
	
	The vulnerability of the victim;
	
	
	The position of trust which the offender occupied;
	
	
	The physical disparity in size and strength between the offender and the victim;
	
	
	The deliberateness of the conduct which was wholly unrelated to anything which the baby had done, and the intention with which the conduct was engaged in, namely, an intention to cause grievous bodily harm; and
	
	
	The cruelty of the manner in which the injuries were caused, and the force and violence perpetrated by the offender on the baby.
	



	
	Here, the victim A was aged two at the time. She was completely vulnerable by reason of her age, the fact that she was the child of the offender, and the size, weight and strength disparity between the offender and her child, increase the objective seriousness of this offence.
	
	
	Clearly, the offender, as the baby’s mother, was in a position of trust. On the medical evidence – in particular, that of Dr Marks, it is difficult to conclude that the conduct, was anything other than deliberate. The jury’s verdict also mandates the finding that the injuries were caused intentionally. Further, the injuries as detailed earlier were serious, permanent, and far-reaching.
	


Findings


	
	The Crown further submits that the medical evidence given by Dr Marks and Dr Donald concerning the extent of the injuries, the possible mechanisms for each of the injuries, and the force required to cause those injuries, establishes that the assault itself comprised at least a shaking or high force impact to cause the head injuries, and a high force impact to the abdomen. Whilst I accept that, it is not possible to make a precise or definitive finding about how the offender inflicted those injuries upon A, I find that the injuries must have been caused by at least one, if not more, of those actions.
	
	
	I have also been referred to a decision of Judge Ashford of this Court in R v Ross Martin (unrep, 6 May 2011, NSWDC), which is a factually similar case, whereby the offender there inflicted very serious injuries on his twin 4 month old babies resulting in long term and life-threatening injuries and, in the case of at least one twin, injuries and disabilities of the same nature and degree as of A in this case. The twins in that case were left in a vegetative state.
	
	
	That offender did not seek any medical assistance for his victims. Here, the offender did by taking the child to the hospital.
	
	
	The subjective features of the offender in that case, and the frustrations that were expressed by the offender resulting in his actions were of the same type as those that may have caused Ms Youkhana to act in the way that she did. For each offence, her Honour in R v Martin imposed a sentence of 20 years, with a non-parole period of 13 years, to be served almost concurrently (total head sentence 21 years, NPP 14 years).
	


JIRS statistics and comparative sentences


	
	I have had regard to the JIRS statistics following a plea of not guilty for this offence. There is a sample size of 20 for those factors. It is unclear how many of those cases relate to this type of matter, namely, an assault by a mother on her child
	
	
	I am aware of the limited use of these statistics, particularly in respect of the different circumstances and conduct that are covered by s 33.
	


Subjective features


	
	The offender is 30 years old (born on 15 September 1985). She completed her year seven studies in Iraq, and since then and after her arrival in Australia in 2004, has not, according to the Pre-Sentence Report, pursued further education or engaged in employment and has been on government benefits. There is mention in the Psychologist’s Report that she was engaged in employment as a cleaner on a part-time basis some months prior to her incarceration, and hopes to study hairdressing in the future.
	
	
	Ms Youkhana said she felt dissatisfied with her marriage to Benyamin Youkhana from the beginning. She told the Pre-Sentence Report writer that her relationship with him was marred with domestic violence, and claimed that her ex-partner was violent towards her and the children.
	
	
	She had a relationship with another man who became the father of her two youngest children – including the victim.
	
	
	Evidence of this extramarital affair was relied on by the defence to support the offender’s case that the evidence of her in-laws (on her ex-husband’s side) that was unfavourable towards her was concocted, as they had discovered her infidelity and were conspiring against her. That version was also given by her to the Pre-Sentence Report writer. She further told the writer that her son JY was coerced into making the statement by her ex-husband’s family.
	
	
	It appears that the offender’s other two children were removed from her care shortly after the incident.
	


Criminality 


	
	The maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment indicates the seriousness with which an offence under s 33 is regarded: R v Zhang [2004] NSWCCA 358.
	
	
	There is a breadth of conduct and consequences comprehended by s 33: R v Williams (2004) 148 A Crim R 325 at [51]; Heron v R [2006] NSWCCA 215 at [54]. It is important in those circumstances to analyse the facts of each case. Only limited assistance is to be derived from previous cases: R v Luu (unrep, 12/3/98, NSWCCA).
	
	
	The Crown submits that this offence is at the top of the range of objective seriousness. I do not accept that submission but rather find that the criminality involved in this offence is above mid-range based on the extent and effect of the injuries sustained by A, her vulnerability, and the offender’s abuse of her position of trust and authority.
	
	
	The Crown fairly concedes, and I accept, that the offence was borne out of a spontaneous loss of control rather than a planned or pre-meditated assault. I also accept that the offence arose because of the isolated circumstances in which the offender found herself, which needs to be viewed against her personal circumstances as a migrant from Iraq. Further, that the offender brought the child to hospital soon after the incident involving the child to be cared for at that stage.
	
	
	Importantly however, the offender’s criminal history does not assist her in this regard, as it is clear this type of assault was not completely out of character.
	


Criminal history


	
	The offender has previously been dealt with pursuant to s 10(1)(b) for an assault upon A on 17 December 2011. A good behaviour bond was imposed for 12 months commencing 18 October 2012, and was therefore in place at the time of the present offence. That is not in dispute. The offender was also subject to an ADVO with standard conditions. That the offence was committed in breach of both the bond and the ADVO is an aggravating feature of this offence, but is not relevant to the consideration of objective seriousness.
	


Remorse and prospects of rehabilitation


	
	The offender continues to deny her guilt in respect of this offence. The Crown submits, and I accept, that there is an absence of any expression of remorse. Rather, it appears that she did not have any insight into her behaviour at the time nor now. In the absence of any evidence of genuine remorse, it is difficult to assess the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	The Pre-Sentence Report contains an assessment that she is regarded as being a medium risk of re-offending.
	
	
	The Report also recommends that the offender be referred to her psychiatrist and psychologist for ongoing treatment.
	
	
	The injuries to the offender’s daughter were horrific, permanent, and with continuing consequences, not only for the child, but also for the community which will bear the costs of caring for an injured child in those circumstances.
	
	
	While one can feel empathy for a person in the offender’s circumstances, moving from Iraq to Jordan and then to Australia where she had limited, if any, support, and a mother trapped in an isolated and possibly strange environment, and as well a violent relationship (the degree of violence being disputed by her ex-husband in his evidence). Nevertheless, she had her mother living with her at the time of the incident.
	


Special circumstances


	
	Here, this is the first time in custody for this offender. She is unlikely to receive any family or community support given the circumstances of the offence. Her mother is likely to return (or has already returned) to Iraq given the circumstances of the criminal justice visa that she used to come to Australia.
	


Protection


	
	Ms Youkhana is in Protective Custody, and is, because of this offence, classified as a C4 inmate. Her status as a Protected Inmate means that she is in her cell usually all but 3 hours per day over a 24 hour cycle. She has found that to be extremely onerous, which I accept.
	
	
	She cannot access programmes, although that may be related to her current status on remand.
	
	
	I find special circumstances warranting the reduction of the statutory ratio which the non-parole bears to the head sentence. I will vary the ratio to one of 62.5%.
	


Sentencing options


	
	The offender was assessed in the Pre-Sentence Report as being suitable for a Community Service Order. I do not think that is appropriate in the circumstances, and in any event, would not adequately meet the principles of general deterrence.
	


Section 166 certificate matters


	
	The Crown has also sought that the Court take into account the following matters on a s 166 certificate:
	



	
	Contravene AVO (x 2);
	
	
	Common assault (x 6); and
	
	
	Assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
	



	
	Evidence was called in the trial about these matters and accordingly it is necessary to make a finding on the facts relating to each count - R v JCW [2000] NSWCCA 209 at [54] - [56].
	
	
	Here, these matters need to be the subject of a sentence determined as would have been the case if in the Local Court, with the restrictions on maximum penalties available in that jurisdiction to be taken into account.
	


Assault occasioning actual bodily harm 26 March 2013 (H52080612/4)


	
	Defence counsel submits that the evidence of the then six year old JY cannot be accepted to establish a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the assault occurred.
	
	
	While there are some minor inconsistencies, I accept his evidence given in relation to three separate questions, that the offender hit or smacked A on the side of the face.
	
	
	Defence counsel has submitted that there is an alternative finding or explanation, namely, that the injuries arose on that day because of A falling from her cot - submissions [10] - [12], [15].
	
	
	Defence counsel also attacks the credibility of JY's evidence and refers to the comments to, and behaviour of, the offender in the presence of the ambulance officers and treating doctor.
	
	
	In my view, that alternative explanation is not consistent with the injuries said to have been observed. Having observed JY giving his evidence and taking into account the minor inconsistencies in his evidence, I accept JY as a witness of the truth as to the essential elements of this count. It is an aggravating feature of that offence that it was committed in the presence of the child, JY.
	
	
	The offender's behaviour was also similar to her conduct in the hospital when she brought A in on 1 April 2013. I do not accept Ms Youkhana's account denying that incident took place either at all or by minimising her involvement.
	
	
	I accept the evidence of JY and find the charge proved.
	


Contravene AVO charge (H 52080612/2: Offender hitting victim's head onto the ground twice);


	
	I accept the evidence of Ghusson Abdalaziz as to her observations on 31 March 2013. Defence counsel attacks her evidence on the basis that she may have had a motivation to malign the offender.
	
	
	If that was the case, and if Ms Abdalaziz had that motivation, it was not apparent to me during her evidence that her evidence was clouded by that matter.
	
	
	I do not accept Ms Youkhana's account denying that incident took place either at all or by minimising her involvement.
	
	
	I accept Ms Abalaziz’s evidence in relation to the relevant facts and find the charge proved.
	


Common assault charge (H 52080612/3: Offender kicking victim’s stomach);


	
	I accept the evidence of Diana Issu as to her observations on 26 March 2013 at the Smithfield home. Ms Issu said that she told the offender on this occasion that next time, she would call the police. When asked in cross-examination why she did not tell her brother, Benyamin Youkhana, she said she did not want to cause any further problems between the two.
	
	
	I accept the evidence of Ms Issu and do not regard the issues raised by Defence counsel as sufficient to establish doubt on this matter. Rather, I do consider that the absence of any contemporaneous reports arose out of a desire by Ms Issu to keep matters within the family. I do not accept Ms Youkhana's account denying that incident took place either at all or by minimising her involvement.
	
	
	I accept Ms Issu’s evidence in relation to the relevant facts and find the charge proved.
	


Common assault charge (H 52080612/6: Offender slapping the victim; blocking her airways and stuffing nuts into her mouth)


	
	I consider Defence counsel's submissions on this matter (at [24] ff of the written submissions) to be well-founded, in particular the criticisms of Ms Christine Sassine. I do not consider that her evidence and the overall evidence on the count establishes this matter beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	I dismiss this charge.
	


Common assault charge (H 52080612/7: Offender slapping the victim on the beach)


	
	Defence counsel's submissions on this matter (at [26] ff of the written submissions) criticises the evidence of Ms Diana Issu and points out the inconsistencies between that evidence and that of Ms Sassine.
	
	
	I accept the evidence of Ms Issu and do not regard the issues raised by Defence counsel as sufficient to establish doubt on this matter. I do not accept Ms Youkhana's account denying that incident took place either at all or by minimising her involvement.
	
	
	I find this charge proved.
	


Common assault charge (H 52080612/8: Offender force-feeding A)


	
	I consider Defence counsel's submissions on this matter (at [29] ff of the written submissions) and the criticisms of Ms Stella Youkhana's evidence to be well-founded and do not consider that the evidence establishes this matter beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	I dismiss this charge.
	


Common assault charge (H 52080612/9 and 10: Offender hit A while force-feeding her; throwing her on the tiled floor)


	
	I accept the evidence of Ms Issu and Ms Sassine in relation to this incident. I do not accept that those witnesses have concocted their evidence in relation to that incident and the details they have provided.
	
	
	I do not accept Ms Youkhana's account denying that incident took place either at all or by minimising her involvement.
	
	
	I find this charge proved.
	


Effect of convictions


	
	These convictions do not operate to aggravate the principal offence but to deny her the leniency to which she might otherwise have been entitled: R v Hill [2014] NSWSC 1010 at [12].
	


Totality and concurrence


	
	I have considered the facts as I have found them to be on the s 166 matters and the counts/charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and the common assaults.
	
	
	Given the dates of these offences and the fact that they each preceded the substantial charge, the charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (in the presence of the other child) would normally be the subject of a sentence of three months’ imprisonment and each of the common assault matters would be the subject of a suspended sentence of one month imprisonment. I have considered a s 10A option but that needs to be considered against the background of the 2011 conviction for a similar offence on the same child.
	
	
	However, having regard to the dates when these offences occurred, the fact that the person involved was the same victim and the length of the sentence to be imposed on the substantive matter, it is appropriate for reasons of totality that those sentences be wholly concurrent with the sentence imposed on the principal offence.
	


Commencement date


	
	The offender was remanded in custody from 11 April 2014 to 2 May 2014 (21 days) and from 26 October 2015, when she was convicted, to date (53 days).
	
	
	That is a total period of 74 days spent in custody solely referable to this offence. That is not disputed. The sentence will be backdated to reflect that with a commencement date of 5 October 2015.
	


Sentence


	
	The offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of twelve years to be served by way of a non-parole period of seven years and six months commencing on 5 October 2015 and expiring on 4 April 2023, with an additional term of four years and six months, expiring on 4 October 2027.
	
	
	This reflects the finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	For the matters on the s 166 certificate, I indicate the following sentences, commencing on 5 October 2015, to be served wholly concurrently with the sentence on the principal offence:
	



	
	Assault occasioning actual bodily harm 26 March 2013 (H52080612/4) – I find this offence proven and sentence the offender to a fixed term of imprisonment of three months;
	
	
	Contravene AVO (H 52080612/2: Offender hitting victim's head onto the ground twice). I find this offence proven and sentence the offender to a fixed term of imprisonment of one month;
	
	
	Common assault charge (H 52080612/3: Offender kicking victim’s stomach). I find this offence proven and sentence the offender to a fixed term of imprisonment of one month;
	
	
	Common assault charge (H 52080612/7: Offender slapping the victim on the beach). I find this offence proven and convict the offender, but no proceed to sentence, in accordance with s 10A;
	
	
	Common assault charge (H 52080612/9 and 10: Offender force-feeding A). I find this offence proven and sentence the offender to a fixed term of imprisonment of one month.
	



	
	I dismiss the other matters on the s 166 certificate, being the common assault charge (H 52080612/6) and common assault charge (H 52080612/8).
	


Parole


	
	I recommend that on the offender’s release on parole, she be subject to ongoing psychiatric and/or psychological counselling, and that she comply with all treatment and medication prescribed for her.
	


Direction


	
	I direct that a copy of the Pre-Sentence Report and the Psychologist’s Report from Mr Watson-Munro dated 11 December 2015 accompany the offender into her incarceration. The Corrective Services authorities should take particular note of Mr Watson-Munro’s serious concerns about the offender’s mental state.

		04 January 2016",2015-12-10 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2702318,Greer v R [2015] NSWCCA 312,"Judgment


	
	WARD JA: I agree that the orders proposed by R A Hulme J should be made for the reasons that his Honour has given.
	
	
	R A HULME J: Mr George Greer (“the applicant”) was found guilty on 7 May 2013 after a jury trial of two counts of ongoing supply of prohibited drugs. He was sentenced on 27 May 2014 by his Honour Acting Judge Freeman.
	
	
	The ongoing supply of a prohibited drug (that is, on more than three separate occasions supplying a drug for financial or material reward) is an offence contrary to s 25A of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years and/or a fine of $385,000.
	
	
	For the ongoing supply of heroin he was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 1 September 2010. For the ongoing supply of methylamphetamine he was sentenced to 7 years with a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 1 September 2013. The overall sentence is one of 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 years.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of sentence upon the following grounds:
	


1.   The learned judge erred in law in holding that the circumstances surrounding the offences were matters which could be taken into account in properly assessing the overall criminality of the appellant (R v Redfern [2012] NSWCCA 178) [Remarks at pages 6,8].

2.   The learned judge erred in law in the proper consideration of s 25A(1) and the application of R v Yang [sic] and associated cases [Remarks at pages 8,9].

3.   The learned judge erred in not allowing sufficient weight to the subjective case advanced for the appellant, especially his age and health, and the period of time spent in custody on remand, in determining the appropriate punishment for the offences.

4.   That in the whole of the circumstances the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

Facts


	
	The indictment alleged the ongoing supply of heroin (count 1) and methylamphetamine (count 2) between 2 and 31 August 2010 at Five Dock.
	
	
	The learned sentencing judge recorded in his sentencing remarks that the heroin charge was based upon 23 occasions on which the applicant supplied that drug to three persons, one of whom was an undercover police officer. Two of the customers made telephone contact with the applicant. The transactions were carried out by them placing money into the applicant's letterbox and either retrieving the heroin from the letterbox or picking it up after the applicant had thrown it out onto the footpath or grass verge. The amounts involved on each occasion were about a gram.
	
	
	The supplies to the undercover officer also followed telephone contact and the transactions were usually carried out in the same way except that on two occasions he met the officer in a park, received the money and then pointed to a package on the ground nearby.
	
	
	The methylamphetamine charge concerned a single customer who received quantities between one and two grams on nine occasions in a similar fashion to the heroin customers.
	
	
	A search warrant was executed at the applicant's home on 1 September 2010. Police found a number of mobile phones, sets of scales, two tasers or electrical stun devices, a flick knife and a small quantity of methylamphetamine. They also found a total of $666,250 in cash secreted behind the kickboard of a filing cabinet and in a kitchen cupboard. Some of the money used by the undercover officer in purchasing heroin was found in the kitchen cupboard, the applicant's wallet and in his mother's purse. There was some issue about this in the sentence proceedings but the judge was satisfied of it.
	
	
	Police also found a considerable quantity of jewellery, watches and gold items. There was an expert valuation that the jewellery was worth not less than $37,000 as scrap or $116,000 retail.
	


The applicant’s personal circumstances


	
	The applicant was born in 1942 and so was aged 68 at the time of the offending and 72 at the time of sentencing.
	
	
	He has a significant criminal history. He was sentenced in the District Court in 1989 and 1992 for a number of offences of supplying heroin and cocaine. He received terms of imprisonment, the longest being 6 years. In 1993 he was sentenced for a multitude of offences receiving a fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months. There are some further offences in his subsequent criminal history but nothing terribly serious or of present relevance.
	
	
	A Pre-Sentence Report included that the applicant had lived at home with his mother for much of his life except when in custody or during the period of a relatively brief marriage. He had supported his mother financially and physically. He had qualifications as an electrician but had not worked in recent years and was in receipt of the aged pension.
	
	
	Dr Richard Furst, forensic psychiatrist, provided a report for sentencing. He noted that the applicant was single, on an aged pension, and had been living with his mother when arrested. His mother was frail, suffering with a variety of physical health issues. The applicant related a history of being a victim of serious crime in 2005, 2007 and 2008. He had been assaulted, shot in the leg when he could not remember his PIN after being abducted and taken to a bank, and the subject of a home invasion. He also told Dr Furst of having witnessed a suicide in Parklea Correctional Centre in 2011 whilst on remand for the present matter. He was concerned about the possibility of his mother dying whilst he was in custody; his father having died during a previous period of incarceration.
	
	
	The applicant told Dr Furst about various physical health issues including prostate cancer (no evidence of metastases) and macular degeneration.
	
	
	Dr Furst noted that the applicant had a paranoid view of police, the courts and probably Legal Aid NSW (for example, the purpose of the court was “to get a conviction at all costs” and there was a “presumption of guilt”) but Dr Furst did not think the applicant’s beliefs were held with a delusional level of conviction. He found no indications of a major mental illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder. He did, however, make diagnoses of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Paranoid Personality Disorder.
	
	
	Dr Furst recommended the use of antidepressant medication or a low dose of an antipsychotic medication to reduce the applicant’s anxiety and stress. He suggested referral to a psychologist to help him deal with his poor coping skills, chronic PTSD symptoms and his paranoid personality disorder. Drug and alcohol counselling was also indicated. He thought that his prostate cancer would reduce his life expectancy. Prospects of rehabilitation were dependent upon his acceptance of his mental health issues and treatment.
	
	
	It is significant that Dr Furst did not indicate any connection between the applicant’s health issues, mental or physical, with his offending.
	
	
	Medical reports were tendered before the sentencing judge but their effect appears to be adequately summarised in Dr Furst’s report.
	
	
	There was a positive reference by Sister Marcia Cox of the Parklea Correctional Centre Chaplaincy Service before the judge which referred to the applicant’s completion of educational and other courses and his attendance at religious services.
	
	
	The Pre-Sentence Report included an assessment of the applicant having a low to medium risk of re-offending. He denied any offending on his part, both in relation to present and past matters. He was said to have been reluctant to provide information on issues he may need to address on the basis that it may jeopardise appeals. The reporting officer said that as a result “it is difficult to identify factors that may have contributed to his offending behaviour or to develop a case plan with regard to any future supervision orders”.
	
	
	The judge found that the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were “guarded at best and most probably … poor”. Despite the fact that the author of the Pre-Sentence Report was somewhat negative about supervision, the judge was prepared to accept that the applicant would need a prolonged period of supervision and treatment in the community to attempt his rehabilitation and this, together with his age and ill-health, warranted a finding of special circumstances so as to reduce the non-parole component of the sentence.
	


Grounds 1 to 3


	
	At the hearing of the application today, Mr Glissan QC indicated in response to a question from the bench that if Ground 4 was to be upheld, no determination of Grounds 1 to 3 was necessary.  Accordingly I will proceed directly to Ground 4.
	


Ground 4 – manifestly excessive sentence


	
	The applicant acknowledged that to make good a ground asserting that a sentence is manifestly excessive he bore a burden of persuading the Court that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 371 [25].
	
	
	The challenge to the sentences under this ground focussed on the accumulation of the sentence for count 2 by 3 years upon the sentence for count 1; it being contended that there should not have been any accumulation at all.
	
	
	The judge explained why he accumulated the sentences:
	


""There is an argument that these supplies represent just two faces of the one crime. On this basis should the sentences be wholly concurrent? The other argument is of course these different drugs are each different crimes, each objectively serious and each deserving of a significant sentence. I do not think that the criminality of supplying methylamphetamine is wholly contained within the crime of supplying heroin. I have decided therefore even if it is only in the application of the principle of totality that there should be some concurrency.""


	
	The Crown submissions correctly (with respect) identified that the decision as to concurrency and accumulation of sentences is discretionary (R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; 118 A Crim R 66) which is generally circumscribed by a proper application of the principle of totality (MMK v R [2006] NSWCCA 272; 164 A Crim R 481 at [13]). The question is whether the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence (Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at [27]).
	
	
	The Crown argued that the applicant's business in supplying drugs was expanded by his supplying different drugs to different client bases; the heroin being supplied to three purchasers and the methylamphetamine being supplied to a completely different purchaser. Accordingly, accumulation of the sentences was entirely open to the judge in the exercise of his discretion.
	


Determination


	
	The facts and associated circumstances relating to the offence in count 1 established on their own that the applicant was substantially involved in a business of drug dealing. The fact that he also supplied another type of drug added an additional dimension to that business, but the additional criminality was not all that substantial.
	
	
	Putting aside the preceding grounds, there was no complaint raised under this ground about the actual length of the individual sentences. The argument was confined to the degree of partial accumulation; a period of 3 years.
	
	
	In my view the period of accumulation is excessive. There should have been some accumulation, but to a much more modest degree.
	


Re-sentencing


	
	The applicant had very little going for him in terms of mitigation aside from some aspects of his personal circumstances. I have in mind his age and his physical and mental health issues. I am also mindful of the stress arising from his concern about his elderly and frail mother who he has lived with for much of his life which, no doubt, makes his incarceration more stressful. But there cannot be any finding of remorse; prospects of rehabilitation cannot be said to be good; and there cannot be said to be an unlikelihood of reoffending given the age at which the present offences were committed and the applicant’s prior history of similar offending. And, of course, the applicant is not entitled to any reduction of sentence on account of any facilitation of the course of justice.
	
	
	I accept the appropriateness of sentences for each offence of 7 years imprisonment but I would reduce the degree of accumulation from 3 years to 1 year. The finding by the sentencing judge of special circumstances should be maintained. However, due to the degree of accumulation I propose, the non-parole period of the sentence for count 2 will require modification.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1.   Leave to appeal allowed.

2.   Appeal against sentence upheld.

3.   Confirm the sentences imposed in the District Court on 27 May 2014 except insofar as to specify a non-parole period for count 2 (ongoing supply of methylamphetamine) of 4 years and specify that that sentence commence on 1 September 2011. The non-parole period for count 2 expired on 31 August 2015. The applicant is now eligible for release on parole.


	
	For clarity, it should be confirmed that the new overall sentence is one of 8 years (from 1 September 2010 to 31 August 2018) with a non-parole period of 5 years (from 1 September 2010 to 31 August 2015).
	
	
	FAGAN J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

		08 December 2015",2015-12-03 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2702333,Further Application of Richard William Buttrose pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2015] NSWSC 1851,"Judgment


	
	Before the Court for determination is an application pursuant to Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (“the CAR Act”) by Richard William Buttrose for an inquiry into the sentences imposed upon him on 10 March 2011 by the Court of Criminal Appeal with respect to a number of drug related offences. The current application is supplementary to an application dealt with, and refused, by the Court on 19 June 2014: Application by Richard William Buttrose pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 826 (“the first application”).
	
	
	The Court’s determination of the first application was challenged on appeal to the Court of Appeal, in an application for judicial review and declaratory relief. The challenge was upheld in Buttrose v Attorney General of New South Wales [2015] NSWCA 221. A declaration was made by the Court of Appeal, at [29], that,
	


“…an error of law on the part of the original sentencing judge and, on appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal, may have caused a sentence to be imposed of greater severity than would otherwise have been the case, such as may give rise to a doubt or question as to any mitigating circumstance in the plaintiff’s case within the meaning of s 79(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001”.


	
	Following that decision Mr Buttrose makes further application for an inquiry into the sentences imposed upon him by the Court of Criminal Appeal, pursuant to s 78 of the CAR Act. That provision is in the following terms,
	


“78 Applications to Supreme Court

(1)    An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf   of the convicted person.

(2)    The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must cause a copy of any application made under this section to be given to the Minister.”


	
	Specifically, the applicant is seeking a referral of his case to the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to s 79(1)(b) of the CAR Act. Section s 79 relevantly provides,
	


“79 Consideration of applications

(1)    After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion:

(a)    […] or

(b)    the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

(2)    Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.

(3)    The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:

(a)    it appears that the matter:

(i)    has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or

(ii)    has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or

(iii)    has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or

(iv)    has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and

(b)    the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.

(3A)    […]

(3B)    […]

(4)    Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application.

(5)    The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must report to the Minister as to any action taken by the Supreme Court under this section (including a refusal to consider or otherwise deal with an application).”


	
	An application of this nature gives rise to an administrative, rather than a judicial act: see Varley v Attorney General (NSW) (1987) 8 NSWLR 30 at [48]-[50]; Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) [2003] HCA 28; 214 CLR 318 at [362]; Kirk v Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales [2008] NSWCA 156; (2008) 173 IR 465.
	
	
	The statutory provisions provide a mechanism for administrative review where there is a basis to conclude that a conviction or sentence may have been entered contrary to proper principles. In Sinkovich v Attorney General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 383; (2013) 85 NSWLR 783, Basten JA observed, at [52] to [53]:
	


“History and statutory language demonstrate that the overriding purpose of Pt 7 is, consistently with the high value placed on freedom of the individual and the unwillingness to allow that liberty to be infringed because of commission of a criminal offence unless the offence has been established beyond reasonable doubt, to provide a means to address doubts as to compliance with these principles. Historically, the need for a mechanism to resolve doubts or questions as to the soundness of a conviction or sentence, so as to avoid an unremediable miscarriage of justice, called for statutory intervention. When appeals became available, that mechanism was not removed but was, indeed, improved upon and made more readily accessible.

The fact that the gateway to an inquiry is now by seeking to satisfy a Supreme Court judge of a doubt or question as to a conviction or sentence reflects both the importance placed upon the procedure and an appropriate mechanism to ensure that it is exercised responsibly and, no doubt, sparingly. However, this mechanism militates against an unduly narrow construction of the statutory gateway.”


	
	The principles to be applied in determining an application pursuant to s 78 were considered by Johnson J in Application of Peter James Holland under s  78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2008] NSWSC 251 (commencing at [4]) are as follows:
	



	
	The court performs an administrative act in determining such an application (at [5]);
	
	
	Determination of an application under s 78 is not intended to provide an additional avenue of appeal after the usual avenues have been exhausted (at [9]);
	
	
	The jurisdiction exercised under Division 3 of Part 7 of the CAR Act is an administrative function which may be activated when the criminal justice system has run its course, frequently because additional evidence has come to light which may raise a doubt or question as to guilt or sentence (at [10]);
	
	
	The powers available under s 79 are limited to the direction of an inquiry, or referral of the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, there being no power to quash a conviction or sentence (at [10]); and
	
	
	The nature of the jurisdiction under Part 7 allows for flexibility in the material which may be placed before the court relevant to an application (at [11]).
	



	
	Here, the applicant contends that there is a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance in the case. He submits that the sentence imposed upon him by the Court of Criminal Appeal was infected by what is commonly known as “Muldrock error”, that being that the sentencing process miscarried because undue regard was given by the Court to the applicable standard non-parole period (“SNPP”) in determining the sentence to be imposed: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 (“Muldrock”).
	


The History of the Matter


	
	The applicant pleaded guilty to three offences of supplying a prohibited drug. Two of the charges, counts 1 and 2, were brought pursuant to s 25(1) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (“DM&T Act”), with a third count brought pursuant to s 25(2) of that Act, a charge of supplying not less than the large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, the drug being 5.9573 kilograms of cocaine. The former offences carried a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment; the latter a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment specified by Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. There were four additional offences before the sentencing court (two counts of supply prohibited drug and two of goods in custody), to be taken into account on sentence pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. An offence of possessing $1,313,700 suspected of being the proceeds of crime was dealt with pursuant to s 167 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	


The Facts of the Charges before the Sentencing Court


	
	In August 2008 police began an investigation (involving a controlled operation) into the supply of prohibited drugs by the applicant to purchasers in the eastern suburbs of Sydney.
	
	
	The first charge against the applicant reflected the sale by him to an undercover police operative of 8.02 grams of high purity cocaine on 24 December 2008. The two met in Paddington and the undercover officer handed the applicant $2,500 in pre-recorded currency, receiving thirteen small, resealable plastic bags in return. The bags each contained a quantity of white powder that subsequent analysis determined to be cocaine.
	
	
	On 30 December 2008 the first of the Form 1 offences occurred, a supply by the applicant to an undercover operative of high purity cocaine weighing 8.10 grams, for a sum of money.
	
	
	The second offence on the Form 1, another count of supplying a prohibited drug, occurred on 25 February 2009. On that day police commenced surveillance of the applicant and observed an apparent sale of drugs by him to a male person in Woollahra. When the purchaser was stopped and searched soon after the transaction, he was found to have two small resealable plastic bags containing a quantity of white powder secreted in his sock. The powder was determined on subsequent analysis to be cocaine with a total weight of 1.44 grams.
	
	
	The second count on indictment of supplying a prohibited drug, and the third of the offences taken into account on the Form 1 document, an offence of goods in custody, were related to this supply. Soon after the applicant was observed apparently making the sale to the male at Woollahra, the applicant was stopped as he drove along Ocean Street, Woollahra. He was removed from his car, arrested and cautioned.
	
	
	When the applicant got out of the car a tin canister fell onto the roadway and was recovered by police. Located inside the canister were forty-six resealable plastic bags containing a quantity of white powder. Later analysis determined the powder to be cocaine, in an amount of 34 grams. Also found in the car was a spiral notepad containing names and figures, and two Nokia mobile telephones. The applicant also had some $3,740 in cash in his possession.
	
	
	Police obtained a warrant to search the applicant’s home in Sutherland Street at Paddington, which was executed later that day. In a backpack stowed on a shelf was an envelope containing nine bundles of cash totalling $50,000. A second envelope in the same bag contained two vacuum-sealed bags containing numerous smaller resealable plastic bags of white powder. The powder was cocaine with a total weight of 51.15 grams. This amount of prohibited drug, together with the quantity found in the applicant’s car, was reflected by count 2. The applicant’s possession of the cash was reflected by the charge of goods in custody, taken into account on the Form 1 document.
	
	
	The offence contrary to s 25(2) of the DM&T Act arose from a search by police of another property associated with the applicant, on 26 February 2009. Information was received by police that the applicant owned a property in Sutherland Crescent at Darling Point, and kept prohibited drugs there. A search warrant was executed on that day at that address, with various items found and seized.
	
	
	In a bedroom, a cardboard box was found. The box held fifty bundles of $50 notes bundled into amounts of $5,000, and together totalling $250,000. In another wardrobe in the bedroom a second cardboard box containing cash was found. In this box one hundred bundles of $50 notes, separated into amounts of $5,000 were found. A further fifty bundles of $100 notes, in lots of $10,000, were in the same box. The total amount of cash in the boxes was one million dollars.
	
	
	In a kitchen draw two bundles of notes totalling $18,700 were found, and in another drawer in the kitchen police located a Nokia mobile telephone box containing nine bundles of $50 notes bundled into amounts of $5,000, making a total of $45,000. A third drawer held 350 resealable plastic bags and seven packages containing 255 grams of cocaine, whilst forty packages containing 2,000 resealable plastic bags holding 1.47 kilograms of cocaine were found in another drawer.
	
	
	Two compressed blocks of beige substance, found to be cocaine, weighing 992.2 grams and 994.5 grams respectively were also located in another drawer in the kitchen, with 2.2456 kilograms of cocaine in six lots of five plastic bags in a heat-sealed package found in another drawer.
	
	
	Overall, $1,313,700 in cash, and 5.9573 kilograms of high purity cocaine was located on the premises. Indicia of supply activity, such as unused resealable plastic bags similar to those containing the cocaine, and an electronic money counting machine, were also located. The applicant was charged the following day. He refused to be interviewed by police.
	


The Applicant’s Subjective Case as Tendered to the Sentencing Judge


	
	The applicant was born on 25 September 1972. He tendered and relied upon a report from a consultant neuro-psychologist, which noted that the applicant had an ambivalent relationship with his parents, although he enjoyed a good relationship with an aunt and uncle, with the latter (a former police officer) giving evidence on his behalf.
	
	
	The applicant had a solid employment history, which commenced when he was aged 15 and still at school. He worked in the hospitality industry, later opening and operating a successful restaurant. He was also involved in small but successful property development business.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence to the sentencing judge, deposing that he had become involved in the sale of illicit drugs having first been a user of that substance. He claimed that, during 2008, his supplier urged him to purchase larger amounts of cocaine than he had previously and pass some on to friends. The applicant said that he was supplied on credit, but gave most of the drugs away without being paid. Although he was not pressured for payment, the applicant found himself in debt to his supplier, a debt that he contemplated resolving by taking some kilograms of cocaine on consignment from the supplier. The applicant took the drugs and stored them in a vacant apartment that he owned, later repackaging the drug into smaller amounts of 0.75 grams suitable for sale.
	
	
	The author of the neuro-psychological report, Dr Rowe, was of the view that the applicant’s offending was not solely motivated by greed, but was at least in part driven by the satisfaction the applicant derived from the attention and acceptance he received from his wide client base within a section of eastern Sydney society. Although the qualifications of the author to express such a view are unclear, Dr Rowe opined that the circumstances in which the applicant was apprehended were not those of a “seasoned drug dealer”, but rather indicative of “an impulsive, careless and disorganised individual with inattention to detail”. Dr Rowe thought that the applicant was suffering from a hypermanic disorder, together with some psychiatric symptoms.
	
	
	There was evidence of remorse before the sentencing judge, together with evidence of assistance to the authorities. The consequences of the latter included the necessity for the applicant’s wife and children to leave Australia, and for the applicant himself to be held in protective custody, isolated from the prison population, but also from his family, with whom he had only limited telephone contact. A discount of some 20% was allowed on sentence in recognition of his assistance to the authorities.
	
	
	The balance of the overall discount on sentence of 45% allowed to the applicant by the sentencing court reflected the pleas of guilty entered at an early stage to the charges.
	
	
	The applicant had only a minor criminal history, which was not relevant to the exercise of the sentencing discretion
	


The Sentence at First Instance


	
	On 18 March 2007 Sorby DCJ, sitting in the District Court of New South Wales, imposed an overall term of imprisonment of 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years and 6 months upon the applicant. The sentence imported the discount of 45% for an early plea and assistance to the authorities. The sentence imposed with respect to the s 25(2) offence, it being the only offence which attracted a SNPP, and being the offence against which the offences on the Form 1 document were to be taken into account, was a non-parole period (“NPP”) of 10 years 6 months imprisonment, with a balance of term of 3 years and 6 months.
	


The Proceedings before the Court of Criminal Appeal


	
	The applicant subsequently lodged an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal: Buttrose v R [2011] NSWCCA 35. Five grounds of appeal were identified, with the applicant arguing that the sentencing judge had erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending conduct, was in error in concluding that the offences were part of organised criminal conduct, erred in the degree of accumulation of sentence, had given insufficient weight to the applicant’s subjective case, and was in error in the application of the discount. A number of factual errors were highlighted in support of the grounds advanced, factual errors which, for the most part, the Crown conceded had occurred.
	
	
	In his judgment, McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Hall J agreed; Garling J generally agreeing with additional comments) concluded that error had occurred and, although the applicant had been involved in a large scale retail drug supply operation, the sentence imposed upon him for the s 25(2) offence was excessive, due to errors by the sentencing judge in the assessment of the gravity of the offences and in the application of the discount awarded to the applicant.
	
	
	The Court also concluded that error had occurred in the degree of accumulation between the two counts contrary to s 25(1) of the DM&T Act, and reduced the sentence imposed with respect to the second count by six months.
	
	
	Excepting the sentence imposed in relation to the proceeds of crime charge, the sentences imposed at first instance were quashed and, on re-sentence, an overall term of imprisonment of 12 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 9 years and 6 months was imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal. The individual sentences were as follows:
	



	
	Count 1: a period of imprisonment of 12 months to date from 26 February 2009 and conclude on 25 February 2010.
	
	
	Count 2: a period of imprisonment of 2 years to date from 26 August 2009 and conclude on 25 August 2011.
	
	
	Count 3: having regard to the offences on the Form 1, a period of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 9 years commencing on 26 August 2009 and concluding on 25 August 2018 with a balance of term of 3 years commencing on 26 August 2018 and concluding on 25 August 2021.
	



	
	In imposing those sentences, the Court of Criminal Appeal had regard to the objective gravity of the offences, which the Court concluded to be above the mid-range of objective seriousness by a modest degree for the s 25(2) offence. McClellan CJ at CL commented at [39] that:
	


“There can be no doubt that the applicant has committed a number of serious offences each related to his involvement in a ""large scale retail drug supply"" operation. His counsel accepted as much. Irrespective of the numerical outcome from the application of the identified discounts the applicant's offending required a severe sentence.”


	
	(It is noted that Garling J, whilst agreeing with the orders proposed by McClellan CJ at CL, observed that he would not have concluded that there had been error by the sentencing judge in assessing the gravity of the offences as “well-above” the mid-range, had the Crown not conceded during the hearing of the appeal that such an assessment was erroneous.)
	
	
	The Court noted that the applicant was engaged in supplying cocaine of a high degree of purity on a very significant scale, albeit not as an organizer of a supply chain, or through the employment of other individuals as distributors. The applicant’s contention that he supplied only to friends and friends of friends was rejected as inconsistent with the objective evidence (which included evidence of supplies to a previously unknown undercover police operative). The financial reward that the applicant received from his illicit activities was noted to be very significant, and was accompanied by the personal gratification derived from recognition from his wide eastern suburbs clientele. The evidence established the applicant’s involvement in a significant drug supply arrangement that involved large sums of money.
	
	
	The judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal was handed down on 10 March 2011.
	
	
	On 5 October 2011 the High Court delivered its judgment in Muldrock v The Queen. It was on the basis that a Muldrock error had occurred that the applicant filed his first s 78 application. The significant delay between the High Court’s decision being delivered and the applicant making his s 78 application was explained by reference to difficulties with the expeditious determination of an application for legal aid.
	


The First s 78 Application


	
	The applicant’s 2014 application to have his case referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 was determined by Hoeben CJ at CL on the papers on 19 June 2014.
	
	
	The applicant had contended that it was open to conclude that the sentencing judge had given primary or determinative significance to the SNPP applicable to count 3 in imposing sentence upon the applicant, and the Court of Criminal Appeal, in reducing that sentence only to a limited extent, had also relied upon the important role played by the SNPP with respect that charge.
	
	
	In determining the application, Hoeben CJ at CL considered the remarks of the sentencing judge, and the principal judgment in Buttrose v R, and determined that there was no basis upon which to conclude that either the sentence imposed at first instance, or that imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal, were wrongly inflated by giving the SNPP determinative significance, or by approaching the determination of sentence in a two-stage process.
	
	
	His Honour observed that, beyond a reference to the SNPP as applicable to count 3 when setting out the relevant maximum penalties, neither court had referred to that feature of the matter again. The judgments of both courts focused on the scale and seriousness of the offences, and the matters revealed by the case tendered on sentence for the applicant.
	
	
	Hoeben CJ at CL refused the application, having concluded that there did not appear to be a doubt or question as to any mitigating circumstance in the case, pursuant to s 79(2) of the CAR Act.
	


The Appeal to the Court of Appeal


	
	By summons, Mr Buttrose invoked the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal, and sought declaratory relief. In its final form, the contention of the applicant was that there were both errors of law and jurisdictional error in the consideration of the first s 78 application.
	
	
	The Court of Appeal considered whether there was jurisdictional error in the judge failing to be satisfied that there appeared to be a doubt or question as to the existence of a Muldrock error in the sentence imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal. The Court concluded that there was such error: at [20] – [25] per Beazley P and Leeming JA; [34] per Macfarlan JA.
	
	
	It is not necessary for the purposes of determining this further s 78 application to set out the nature of the jurisdictional errors found to have occurred.
	
	
	What is of particular significance in the decision of the Court of Appeal is the Court’s conclusion that it appears that there is a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance: [26] and [34].
	


The Supplementary Application


	
	The applicant relies on asserted Muldrock error in the sentence imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal, arguing that error may be inferentially concluded to be present by reference to the sentence itself, and demonstrated by “the neatness of the arithmetic in the applicant’s sentence for count 3” ([34] of the applicant’s written submissions). The reference to the neatness of the arithmetic is drawn from Bolt v R [2012] NSWCCA 50, and builds upon what was said in the judgment of Beazley P and Leeming JA in Buttrose v Attorney General, at [22] – [23].
	
	
	It is contended that, absent the discount on sentence of 45% that was allowed to the applicant at first instance and by the Court of Criminal Appeal, the notional starting point of the sentence imposed upon the applicant for the s 5(2) offence by the latter Court must have been a little over 16 years. The SNPP specified for the offence is 15 years. Since a starting point of a little over 16 years fits with some exactitude against an assessment of the criminality of that offence, carrying as it does a 15 year SNPP, of above the mid-range to a modest degree, the SNPP must have been given impermissible significance.
	
	
	(Whilst the applicant mounts an argument for reconsideration more broadly of what constitutes Muldrock error, contending that there is a divergence in the manner in which the Court of Criminal Appeal has treated Muldrock error, and asserting that error has occurred where the SNPP is given something less than primary or determinative significance, that contention need not be resolved for the purposes of determining this application. Any divergence, if such divergence exists, cannot, in any event, be resolved by a single justice of this Court.)
	
	
	The Attorney General, in her written submissions in reply (received and considered pursuant to s 79(4) of the CAR Act) concedes at [26] that it “would be open to the Supreme Court to be satisfied of the existence of a doubt or question” and refer the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	The test to be applied in determining an application of this nature is whether it appears there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt or as to any mitigating circumstances in the case: s 79 (2) of the Act.
	
	
	The appearance of a doubt or question is to be distinguished from the reality of such a doubt or question.
	
	
	Having considered the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in resentencing the applicant I, like Hoeben CJ at CL, cannot conclude on the basis of that material that a Muldrock error has occurred.
	
	
	There is certainly a degree of mathematical correlation between the sentence imposed upon the applicant for the s 25(2) DM&T Act offence, and the SNPP specified against an offence of that nature, in a matter where the objective gravity of the crime was assessed as modestly above the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	However, having considered all of the features of the case against the applicant that was presented at sentence, and the subjective case that was before the Court, in my view the apparent correlation amounts to no more than a coincidental similarity between the SNPP and the sentence that was imposed upon proper application of sentencing principles.
	
	
	What does not appear to have been taken into account in the applicant’s submissions arguing for Muldrock error are the four serious offences which were before the sentencing court pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, and which must have had the effect of increasing - probably to a significant degree - the sentence imposed for the s 25(2) offence.
	
	
	When sentence was imposed for the s 25(2) offence, the Court was obliged to take into account four further offences. Although the Form 1 document that was before the sentencing court is not among the material filed in support of the application, it would appear from the factual material that the offences are as follows:
	



	
	Supply prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1) of the DM&T Act, being the supply of thirteen resealable bags containing a total of 8.10 grams of high purity cocaine, to an undercover operative previously unknown to the applicant, for the sum of $2500. On conviction, a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment, and/or a fine, may be imposed.
	
	
	A further offence of supply prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1) of the DM&T Act, being the supply of two resealable bags containing a total of 1.44 grams of high purity cocaine, to a male at Woollahra, for a sum of money. On conviction, a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment, and / or a fine, may be imposed.
	
	
	An offence of having goods in custody contrary to s 527C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, being the applicant’s possession of $3,740 in cash, suspected of being the proceeds of unlawful drug transactions. On conviction, a maximum penalty of 6 months imprisonment, and/or a fine, may be imposed.
	
	
	A further offence of having goods in custody contrary to s 527C(1), being the applicant’s possession of $50,000 in cash, suspected of being the proceeds of unlawful drug transactions. On conviction, a maximum penalty of 6 months imprisonment, and/or a fine, may be imposed.
	



	
	These were all serious offences which materially added to the overall criminality of the applicant’s crimes. It was necessary that the sentence imposed for the s 25(2) DM&T Act offence properly recognise those offences, as a means of ensuring personal deterrence, and to reflect the community’s entitlement to exact retribution from the applicant. Such an approach is consistent with what was said by Spigelman CJ in Attorney-General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No.1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146. At [42] of that decision the then Chief Justice said:
	


“The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The Court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences which there are offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express provision in s33(3) referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle of totality is another.”


	
	The jurisprudence surrounding the approach to be taken by a Court dealing with matters pursuant to Division 3 of Part 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is now well settled. A sentencing court is to impose sentence only for the principal offence and not for the Form 1 offences, but the point of that process is to impose a longer sentence than that which would apply to the principal offence alone. The increase in sentence need not be minor: Dionys v R [2011] NSWCCA 272 at [64] – [65] per Hoeben J (as he then was) and with whom McClellan CJ at CL agreed.
	
	
	The sentence imposed for the principal offence must reflect the totality of the offender’s criminal involvement, as was held in R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 372 per Hunt CJ at CL:
	


“When serious offences are included in a Form 1, the sentence imposed, in respect of the count for which they are taken into account, must reflect the totality of the criminal involvement. It is not the case that Form 1 offences need only be noted in passing, or that little by way of additional penalty should be imposed by reason of their existence”: R v Bavadra (2000) 115 A Crim R 152 at [30] per Wood CJ at CL, with whom Beazley JA and Greg James J agreed.


	
	See also Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23, and Abbas, Bodiotis, Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115.
	
	
	When the upwards adjustment that must have been made to the sentence imposed upon the applicant for the s 25(2) offence is taken into account, any purported correlation between the sentence imposed upon him and the SNPP falls away.
	
	
	However, the question to be resolved by me is not whether there is a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance relevant to sentence, it is whether there appears to be such a doubt or question.
	
	
	There must be the appearance of a doubt or question in light of the declaration made by the Court of Appeal in Buttrose v Attorney General, and having regard to the reasons given by the Court for making the declaration. Indeed, although I do not conclude that his Honour intended to fetter the consideration by this Court of any further s 78 application made by Mr Buttrose, Macfarlan JA went so far as to say, at [41],
	


“If the plaintiff makes such an application armed with a declaration of the type that I have described, his prospects of success will be improved immeasurably. Indeed, the judge hearing the application will have little choice but to make an order under s 79(1)(b) referring the plaintiff’s case to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act.”


	
	The declaration made by the Court of Appeal is of itself, without anything more, sufficient to give rise to an appearance of a doubt or question as contemplated by s 79(2) of the CAR Act.
	
	
	Having regard to the matters raised in Buttrose v Attorney General there must be the appearance of a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance within the case, and I so find: s 79(2) CAR Act. Having reached that conclusion, I am obliged to refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912: s 79(1)(b) CAR Act.
	


orders


	
	Pursuant to s 79(1)(b) of the Criminal (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 the case of R v Richard William Buttrose is referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 79(5) of the Criminal (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 the Registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court is to advise the Minister of Order 1.
	
	
	The Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal is to be advised of these orders, so that a timetable for the hearing of the matter can be fixed.

2702340,Application of Malcolm Potier (No 3) [2015] NSWCCA 306,"Judgment


	
	BY THE COURT: On 3 June 2015, this Court granted Mr Potier leave to appeal from his conviction in October 2006 of an offence of solicit to murder contrary to s 26 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (Potier v R [2015] NSWCCA 130) (“the principal judgment”) and dismissed the appeal. The background to the appeal, and hence to the present application, is set out in the reasons for judgment of Ward JA (with whom Simpson and Wilson JJ agreed) and is not here repeated. What follows assumes a familiarity with the principal judgment
	
	
	On 16 June 2015, Mr Potier applied pursuant to r 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules to re-open the decision and judgment of this Court. He stated the following bases for the application:
	


“a.   Mistake of fact as to the authenticity and importance of the recordings from the 2000 and 2002 police investigations.

b.   Mistake of fact and law over the admissibility and consequences of the Telstra material.

c.   Mistake of fact and law over the grounds of appeal made out alleging judicial bias by the trial judge.

d.   Mistake of law over the admissibility of conviction to the jury by the trial judge.

e.   Mistake of law over what was decided by the High Court of Australia in Potier v The Queen (11th February 2013) and the application of the reasoning of that decision to the Telstra material used in the trial of the appellant and the consequences to and for this appeal.

f.   Certain other [unidentified] mistakes of fact and law.”


	
	The Court made directions for the filing by Mr Potier of short submissions identifying the particular mistakes of fact and law to which reference was made in his r 50C application. Mr Potier sought, and was permitted, various extensions of time in relation to the filing of submissions in support of his application. After a number of such extensions he was informed by the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal, by letter forwarded to him by facsimile transmission dated 30 September 2015, that the Court would not indefinitely extend the time for the filing of submissions and that it proposed to deal with his application with the benefit of such submissions as he provided, in accordance with earlier directions as to the length of those submissions, on or before 19 October 2015.
	
	
	In response, Mr Potier forwarded to the Court of Criminal Appeal Registrar, by facsimile transmission on the same day a document headed “Short Submissions by Applicant”. Although the status of those submissions is moot, since Mr Potier stated in the letter to the Court of Criminal Appeal Registrar attaching those submissions that he did not “file” them at that time, in the absence of anything further from Mr Potier by way of submissions, the Court has had regard to the contents of that document as indicative of the complaints that Mr Potier has in relation to the decision dismissing his conviction appeal and as shedding light on the matters to which reference is made in his application. Having regard to that material, it was not considered necessary to call on any submissions from the Crown in response to the r 50C application.
	


Rule 50C


	
	Rule 50C is framed in the broadest of terms. In sub r (1), it provides:
	


“(1) The Court may set aside or vary an order if an application for the setting aside or variation is made before entry of the order.”


	
	However, it is important at the outset to note the limited operation of the jurisdiction conferred on the Court under r 50C to set aside or vary an order of the Court. This was recently considered in Bruce Edward Gall v R (No 2) [2015] NSWCCA 152 and Miller v R [2015] NSWCCA 205. The principles articulated in those cases were extracted in a decision in September this year, in which a r 50C application brought by Mr Potier in relation to a different decision was dismissed (Application of Malcolm Potier (No. 2) [2015] NSWCCA 249). Hence, Mr Potier is clearly on notice of the ambit of applications under r 50C. Indeed, he has forwarded to the Court, in addition to the “Short submissions” document referred to above, submissions addressing the application of r 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules.
	
	
	Put simply, r 50C does not confer jurisdiction on this Court to re-hear the merits of an appeal once it has been determined. Rather, it enables the Court to reconsider and correct its orders to rectify obvious mistakes and correctly to reflect its intention at the time of making the decision in question. In Miller v R, Adams J (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Hidden J agreed) noted that there is no jurisdiction under r 50C to re-visit orders or reasons where the contended misapprehension is merely an assertion that a conclusion made following consideration of the matter by the Court is wrong (at [39]).
	
	
	The general description of the perceived mistakes that is contained in Mr Potier’s application (extracted at [2] above) raises issues that were the subject of lengthy written submissions by Mr Potier on the hearing of his appeal against conviction. They have already been considered by this Court and were dealt with at some length in the principal judgment. On its face, the r 50C application demonstrates clearly that what Mr Potier is seeking to do is indeed to re-argue matters that have already been considered and dealt with by this Court. Insofar as Mr Potier contends that this Court erred in the conclusions reached on those issues, the appropriate avenue is an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court.
	
	
	That this is so is amply demonstrated when reference is made to the “Short submissions” document forwarded by Mr Potier to the Court of Criminal Appeal Registrar, albeit expressly not filed as such. In those submissions, Mr Potier itemises various complaints, which are summarised and dealt with under the headings used by him, as follows.
	


(a)   Importance of recordings


	
	Mr Potier identifies the authenticity of the recordings as a central issue in the appeal proceedings and refers to his earlier submissions in which he says he detailed the importance of that issue. Mr Potier says that his purpose in tendering the recordings in the appeal proceedings was for the Court to establish for itself the authenticity of the recordings played to the jury at trial. He identifies a number of what he characterises as misapprehensions of fact or law in relation to the Court’s treatment of that issue.
	
	
	First, Mr Potier says that (at [45] of the principal judgment) the Court has misapprehended facts in stating that he denied conversations taking place with “A” (the prison informer). That involves a misreading of what was said at [45], which was that the case that Mr Potier in his submissions on his appeal had summarised as his defence case (in effect that “A” was trying to entrap him or that Mr Potier was playing a joke on A) was a case that was “clearly inconsistent with any denial that the recorded conversations with A took place; rather, it assumes that the conversations took place and seeks to explain away their significance”. It was not there suggested that any such denial had been made by or on behalf of Mr Potier. Rather, the point there being made was that had there been a denial it would have been inconsistent with the defence case that Mr Potier acknowledged had been run. Earlier in the principal judgment ([39]) it was noted that Mr Potier had not himself given evidence in his second trial.
	
	
	It was also noted (at [51]–[52]) that there was some inconsistency as to whether Mr Potier’s statements to the judge in the second trial were disputing the conversations but that his final position appeared to have been that, while the voice on the audio recordings may have been his, there had been some alteration of the recordings so as to produce a manufactured compilation of a conversation that was not in fact the actual conversation that had taken place.
	
	
	The complaint made by Mr Potier as to a misapprehension of fact in this respect is without foundation.
	
	
	Mr Potier next says that it was an impossibility for Ward JA to state (at [525]-[526]) that she had listened to the 2 February 2002 recording and compared it to the transcripts, since the recording was blank.
	
	
	The 2 February 2002 recording, and Mr Potier’s complaint as to this recording, is referred to at [128]-[134] of the principal judgment. There, it is noted that Mr Potier had sought to tender a VHS recording of 2 February 2002 to show that there was no audio contained on that tape (save as to confirmation of date and time). The significance Mr Potier attached to that was that the version played to the jury did have audio on it. At [131], reference is made to the cross-examination Mr Potier had conducted of various police officers as to the provenance and integrity or authenticity of the tape recording of this conversation; the explanation given for this being that, using recognised signal processing techniques, a CD had been able to be produced from the master tape recording.
	
	
	There was no issue at the second trial (or on the appeal) that the VHS recording made of the 2 February 2002 conversation was blank, save for confirmation of date and time. The argument raised by Mr Potier was as to the “enhancement” of the audio from that tape which had led to the version played to the jury.
	
	
	What was referred to at [525]-[526] of the principal judgment was not the 2 February 2002 recording but the different sets of recordings of conversations in 2000. An issue had been raised as to a perceived inconsistency in the evidence of the police officers as to the recording of a conversation between “M” (an undercover police operative) and Mr Potier on 2 May 2000. That conversation was recorded by M on a listening device the details of which were the subject of a claimed public interest immunity. It was also the subject of a recording by other undercover branch operatives at a listening post. The tape produced at the listening post was blank, as noted at [523] of the principal judgment. The subject of the observation made in the first sentence of [525] was clearly the existence of the different sets of the 2000 recordings which were audible and hence able to be compared with the transcripts made of the conversations there recorded. No misapprehension of fact has been demonstrated in relation to this issue.
	
	
	Next, Mr Potier says that there was a misunderstanding of fact in relation to a “highlight tape” of the 2000 recordings. Mr Potier had analysed the stop/start times of some of the recordings and maintained that the version played to the jury had had some 19 minutes added to it. That issue was considered at [524] of the principal judgment, where it was concluded that the analysis carried out by Mr Potier did not raise doubt as to the authenticity of the recordings, there referring to matters in support of that conclusion. Mr Potier’s belief that the conclusion is incorrect does not amount to a misapprehension of the kind falling within the r 50C jurisdiction.
	
	
	Mr Potier next argues that the misunderstanding of fact which he contends has been made (i.e, that the recordings were similar and accurate) led to a misunderstanding of the law, insofar as the recordings were not rejected as unreliable and should have been excluded. He submits that this Court has made a fundamental misapprehension of the law as to the import of the recordings and that this could not have been covered by the proviso contained in s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). No misapprehension of the applicable legal principles is here identified; rather the complaint is as to the application of those principles in the circumstances of this case. Again, the perceived error in this regard is not one that falls within the r 50C jurisdiction.
	
	
	Finally, Mr Potier submits that it was a misapprehension of fact to state (at [421]) that in the trial judge’s summing up the trial judge had not stated an opinion or made a finding of fact that the five “missing calls” were made by the defendant but, rather, was there summarising the defence argument as to those calls and emphasising that those five missing calls from the webtrace were calls said to have been made by the accused. Any error in the way in which the trial judge’s summing up was properly to have been understood in that respect is, again, a matter for complaint on any subsequent appeal from this Court’s decision. Paragraph 421 accurately records the way that this Court understands that part of the trial judge’s summing up.
	


(b)   Telstra material


	
	The reference to the Telstra material is a reference to the Telstra call charge records that were not tendered or disclosed to the defence at Mr Potier’s first trial (for separate offences in 2000 of solicit to murder). At the second trial, evidence was given as to an Optus webtrace carried out in respect of calls to and from a particular telephone number in 2000 (that being the telephone number of Ms Conway, who gave evidence as to various telephone calls with Mr Potier, the recordings of which were in evidence at both trials).
	
	
	Mr Potier says that the Court misapprehended the evidence of Mr Finlay, who gave the relevant evidence as to the Optus webtrace, when it stated (at [57]) that Mr Finlay’s evidence was not that there were only two possible explanations for calls not appearing on the webtrace (as Mr Potier contended); rather that Mr Finlay gave one explanation for this and accepted that there was another possible explanation. Reference to the transcript makes clear that Mr Finlay did not in terms say that there were only two possible explanations. The fact that Mr Potier understood the evidence to have that import does not establish any misapprehension of fact in this regard.
	
	
	Mr Potier says that there was a further misapprehension of fact in relation to the Telstra material, that being that the Court should have deduced, from the fact that the Crown had produced no evidence that another phone had been used on the five occasions of “missing calls”, that no such evidence existed or assisted the Crown’s case and should have accepted that the statement made in a letter to Telstra (that three identified payphones had been used to make the calls) was correct. This is no more than a repetition of the submissions made by Mr Potier at the appeal and amounts to an impermissible attempt to re-argue the point.
	
	
	Finally, in relation to the Telstra material, it is said that there is a misapprehension (at [61] of the principal judgment) of both fact and law, in that it was stated that it might be argued that the Telstra material was constructively available to the defence at the first trial since the defence was aware at that trial that the “missing calls” did not appear on the Optus webtrace and had elicited evidence from Mr Finlay as to alternative ways to investigate whether there was a record of those calls having been made. Mr Potier argues that until Mr Finlay was examined there was no way of knowing how to establish that the calls had not been made. He says that there was no dispute that the Crown withheld the Telstra material from the defence during the first trial and that it was obliged to disclose that material.
	
	
	The observation with which Mr Potier takes issue was not one that played any determinative role in the consideration of his appeal, it being expressly noted (at [61]) that nothing turned on it for present purposes, since the existence of the Telstra material was certainly known to the defence by the time of the second trial. As to the complaint in relation to the Crown’s breach of a duty of disclosure in this regard, this was dealt with elsewhere in the principal judgment’s reasons in considering ground 7 of Mr Potier’s grounds of appeal ([566]-[567]). The conclusion there reached was that even if there was a breach of the obligation of disclosure in respect of the Telstra material at the first trial, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice occasioned to Mr Potier in the second trial in this regard. That remains this Court’s view. No error of principle has been identified in relation to this issue. Rather, Mr Potier’s complaint is as to the conclusion reached by this Court on that issue. That is not a complaint that falls within the r 50C jurisdiction.
	


(c)   Bias


	
	Mr Potier’s complaint under this heading is, in essence, that this Court should have reached a different conclusion in relation to ground 4 of his grounds of appeal, in which it was contended that the trial judge had exhibited a number of instances of bias and had refused to accede to an application to disqualify himself for bias, causing the trial to miscarry. In his submissions on this issue, he reiterates arguments already put to the Court on his appeal and considered in the Court’s judgment.
	
	
	At the outset, it should be noted that Mr Potier does not point to any error in the identification of the legal principles to be applied in the context of applications as to bias (see [165]-[173] of the principal judgment). Rather, it is said that this Court made the following misapprehensions of fact and law.
	
	
	First, a misapprehension of fact over the implications and consequences of Mr Potier having to disclose his defence whilst the prosecution case was ongoing. In Mr Potier’s appeal grounds, such a complaint was raised as an instance of bias in the context of the trial judge requiring Mr Potier to identify why it was that Mr Potier wished to call the ex-wife of “A” to give evidence and as a complaint as to his Honour’s rulings in relation to the requirement that Mr Potier indicate what he anticipated Mr MacKechnie (a solicitor in Scotland from whom he sought to adduce evidence) would say if called to give evidence. Those matters were considered at [312]-[316] and [321]-[335], respectively, of the principal judgment.
	
	
	Mr Potier submits that “as a point of law” it was wrong for the trial judge to require defence disclosure whilst the prosecution case was ongoing and that the Court did not fully consider this issue. The issue was dealt with and reasons were given for this Court’s findings on those grounds. Mr Potier’s complaint does not fall within the r 50C jurisdiction.
	
	
	Next, it is said that there was a misapprehension of law by dismissing the Crown’s statement that a Birks [R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677] point of appeal had arisen. Mr Potier had, on the appeal, complained as to the trial judge’s refusal to accede to his application for the jury to be discharged even after the Crown had raised the issue as to a potential “Birks” ground of appeal. As stated at [289], the fact that the Crown may have thought there might be a potential Birks ground of appeal was irrelevant to the question whether or not the trial judge erred in not discharging the jury at that point.
	
	
	No error was identified in the statement of the principles to be applied in considering an application to discharge the jury (see [290]-[295]). Rather, Mr Potier’s complaint is as to the conclusion reached as to whether error in the exercise of the trial judge’s discretion, or bias, had been identified in this regard. Whether this Court erred in reaching the conclusion it did on that issue is not a matter falling within the ambit of the r 50C jurisdiction.
	
	
	Next, it is said that there was a misapprehension of fact in the statement that there was a forensic decision by defence counsel not to cross-examine A further on the “Carlos matter”, when the trial judge had refused to allow further cross-examination of the witness in front of the jury over the Carlos matter. This is a reference to the issue considered at [304]-[306] of the principal judgment.
	
	
	The complaint by Mr Potier in this regard again involves a misreading of what was there said. The statement (at [306]) that “Mr Potier must be taken to have made a forensic decision not to pursue such questioning at the relevant time, through Counsel” (emphasis added) was a reference to the line of questioning that had been raised on the voir dire as to whether A had referred the “Carlos matter” to the authorities. The relevant time at which that line of questioning (which would have revealed to the jury that A had thought Mr Potier was joking in relation to that matter) was not pursued was at the conclusion of the voir dire, not later when Mr Potier unsuccessfully sought to revive questions over the Carlos matter. No misapprehension of fact is there identified.
	
	
	Mr Potier also complains that this Court fell into error by accepting that a senior counsel of many years’ standing (Mr Healey) would not be able to conduct his defence by further questioning witness A over the “Carlos matter” in such a way as not further to prejudice the defence. That, however, was not the issue. The question being considered in this context was whether there had been an error in the exercise of the trial judge’s discretion, or evidence of bias, in his Honour not permitting further questioning in relation to that matter. The conclusion reached by this Court was that there was not. No misapprehension of fact or law is thereby revealed.
	
	
	Next, it is said that Mr Potier’s complaint as to lack of access to the Crown brief and subpoenaed material (addressed at [277]-[279] of the principal judgment) was not a complaint of denial of access to specific documents; rather, it was the fact that Mr Potier did not know what was there so that until access was given he could not be specific as to what he wanted to see. There was no misapprehension by this Court of the fact that Mr Potier had sought access to all the documents. At [279], it is noted that Mr Potier’s response to the trial judge was that he was going to have to read all of the documents. His Honour’s ruling, however, was based on the need to keep the documents under the control of the Court. The Court remains of the view that there was no appellable error disclosed by his Honour’s ruling.
	
	
	Mr Potier then says that a number of “grounds” of alleged bias were not addressed and this amounts to a “misunderstanding” of law. Presumably, by this, Mr Potier is referring to some of the alleged instances of bias; the relevant ground of appeal (4) referring to a “number of instances of unreasonable bias”. Relevantly, ground 4 was that his Honour declined to excuse (i.e., disqualify), himself, causing the trial to miscarry. Mr Potier’s complaint as to bias, in essence, was that it was the totality of the adverse decisions that demonstrated bias (see [164] of the principal judgment in which his submission to that effect is extracted).
	
	
	Three instances of alleged bias with which it is said the Court did not deal are identified by Mr Potier.
	
	
	First, Mr Potier refers to the complaint made as to the trial judge’s refusal to allow “legitimate” questions of “A” as to his character and how the authorities treated him. This complaint was identified in Mr Potier’s submissions on the appeal as going both to ground 3 and to ground 4. It was dealt with in the principal judgment at [337]-[346].
	
	
	On the present application it is submitted that there was a misapprehension of fact as what was to be put to witness “A”, namely, that a reading of The Sunday Telegraph article showed that “A” was a man who was an experienced liar and fraudster. It is said by Mr Potier that the trial judge’s refusal to allow the jury to establish for themselves the true nature of the witness by cross-examination of such matters was, and is, a misapprehension of law.
	
	
	At [337] of the principal judgment, it is noted that one area of cross-examination identified as the subject of the complaint was that which related to “A”’s fraud conviction. Other areas of cross-examination about which complaint was made were identified at [338]-[345], including (at [343]) the assertion that The Sunday Telegraph article revealed that A was duplicitous in his relationship and in his home life.
	
	
	The Court considered the various matters which were raised in relation to this complaint and concluded that there was no error in the rulings about which complaint was made ([346]). It was not suggested that the making of those rulings, if not affected by error (as the Court concluded), was illustrative of bias but, for the removal of any doubt in that regard, the Court here confirms that it is of the view that none of those rulings demonstrates or gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the trial judge.
	
	
	Second, it is said that the Court misunderstood, and failed to consider, the issue before it as to public interest immunity. The complaints made by Mr Potier on this issue were identified under the heading “Public Interest Immunity” by reference to paragraph [18] of Mr Potier’s written submissions on the appeal. Those were, first, as to the exclusion of questioning of “A” as to whether he had made similar allegations about any other wrongdoing while at Long Bay, and, second, as to the exclusion of questioning of Detective Sipos as to whether he had signed up “A” as a police informant. They were considered at [347] to [359] of the principal judgment.
	
	
	Mr Potier says that public interest immunity was being “unfairly exercised” (presumably meaning that it was unfairly invoked or applied) against him in denying him the opportunity of asking how the authorities considered A as an informant “if he was considered to be a fantasy man who made things up” and that this was relevant to the strength of A’s evidence.
	
	
	The difficulty with Mr Potier’s submission that there was a misunderstanding of, and therefore failure to deal with, his complaint in this regard is that it was expressly noted (at [353] of the principal judgment) that what Mr Potier was seeking to establish by questioning A about meetings with the authorities was “that the authorities deduced that he was making things up and ignored him”. The trial judge rejected that line of questioning not only on the basis of the claimed public interest immunity but also because he considered it to be irrelevant (see [356]). The kind of questioning that Mr Potier now says was not considered in the context of his complaint as to public interest immunity was in fact considered and dealt with by this Court.
	
	
	Finally, Mr Potier complains that this Court did not address his contention that the trial judge exhibited bias when allowing Crown evidence of transcripts of recordings before the jury “which had the effect of promoting them to a level of proof that no directions could cure” (referring to his submissions of 10 September 2014 pp 20-25), which it is said raised the issue as to the fact that contradictory evidence as to the authenticity of the recordings was not allowed before the jury by the trial judge. It is said by Mr Potier that the trial judge was obliged to allow a fair balance between the parties as to the evidence to go before the jury and that unacceptable preference was given to the Crown.
	
	
	Mr Potier made a number of complaints in the appeal proceedings as to the admission of the audio recordings and the statements made by his Honour in relation to those recordings. They were dealt with from [388]-[412] of the principal judgment. As to the transcripts of the recordings, in distinction to the recordings themselves, it was noted (at [411]) that complaint had been raised as to the “refusal to allow contradictory evidence relating to the recordings to be played to the jury despite allowing Crown transcripts to be given to the jury”. That complaint was dealt with as one raising an issue as to the summing up, having regard to the submission by Mr Potier, referred to at [425], to the effect that the trial judge had ‘exceeded his obligation of even-handedness’ by informing the jury that the [so-called “missing”] calls had been made by Mr Potier “ignoring” contradictory Crown evidence of Mr Finlay and passing this on as an opinion of fact. The complaint that this was an opinion of fact had been dealt with earlier. At [425] it was concluded that his Honour had fairly conveyed to the jury the substance of the dispute as to the audio recordings.
	
	
	The “contradictory evidence” to which Mr Potier seems to have referred in his submissions on the appeal was the evidence of Mr Finlay as to the possible explanations for the missing calls not appearing on the webtrace. That evidence was before the jury. The complaint that this Court did not address a complaint made as to bias in the admission of the transcripts of the recordings, by reference to the manner in which the evidence of Mr Finlay was presented to the jury, has no foundation having regard to those parts of the principal judgment to which reference has been made. For completeness, it should be noted that there was a further complaint as to the conduct of the Crown (in ground 7) in the context of which there was also reference to the non-disclosure of the Telstra material. That was dealt with at [566]-[567] and [573].
	
	
	If Mr Potier’s complaint is now that this Court did not, in dealing with the matters raised in his appeal submissions, address a different aspect of his complaint as to the transcripts of the recordings, namely that there was bias in allowing them before the jury because no directions could cure the prejudice of so doing, then the suggestion of bias on the part of the trial judge in that regard must also be rejected. His Honour dealt with the various aspects of the complaints about the recordings and fairly conveyed the substance of the disputes in relation to the recordings and their authenticity to the jury. Admission of the transcripts cannot be said to have elevated the probative force of the recordings themselves.
	


(d)   Admission of recordings


	
	The next complaint by Mr Potier is that there is a misapprehension of fact evident from [388] to [401] of the principal judgment (which dealt with his complaints as to the rulings and statements made in relation to the audio recordings) namely that the Court mistakenly believed that there had been a full debate as to the admission of the recordings and their provenance. It is submitted that this was not the case because the trial judge had cut Mr Potier off in his arguments and had exhibited clear bias against him.
	
	
	The paragraphs to which Mr Potier refers make clear that, in ruling on this aspect of the matter, close regard was paid to the transcript of proceedings before his Honour. The complaint made by Mr Potier is in substance a complaint as to the conclusion this Court reached having regard to the transcript of events as they occurred at the trial. That is not within the r 50C jurisdiction. No misapprehension of fact or law has been identified in this regard.
	


(e)   “Exceeding” the Crown’s submissions over the TV


	
	This complaint relates to the perceived error in the trial judge’s summing up as to the benefit that A had obtained by the fact that a television set had been placed in his cell (the recording device having been placed in the television set). The trial judge said that A did not receive any reward for what he did and refused Mr Potier’s application that he redirect the jury on this aspect of the matter.
	
	
	Mr Potier submits that this Court has made a misapprehension of fact and law by excusing the trial judge’s conduct in refusing to accept that A had received any reward “and thereby promoting the Crown case to a position of strength”. Reliance is placed on the fact that the Crown’s own closing submissions were to the effect that the only reward A received was the TV. Mr Potier had argued on appeal that this was of importance when considering the adequacy of his Honour’s warning to the jury about accepting evidence from prison informants.
	
	
	This issue was considered at [438]-[441] of the principal judgment. Again, the complaint by Mr Potier on the present application goes to the conclusion that was reached by this Court on that issue. It does not fall within the r 50C jurisdiction. There was no misapprehension of fact or law on this issue.
	


(f)   Evidence of defence witness MacKechnie


	
	The same conclusion must be reached in relation to the complaint as to this Court’s assessment of the complaints made by Mr Potier in his appeal in relation to the manner in which the trial judge treated Mr Potier’s application to adduce evidence from Mr MacKechnie.
	
	
	The misapprehension of fact that Mr Potier submits this Court made in this regard has not been clearly identified. In his “Short submissions” on this application Mr Potier again stressed the importance of Mr MacKechnie’s evidence to his defence, that being that it would establish that Mr Potier always knew the crime he was accused of having solicited could never take place because Mr MacKechnie had told Mr Potier that his former de facto wife was not in Scotland at the time. Mr Potier emphasises that Mr MacKechnie had made it clear that he was prepared to come to the country or alternatively he would be prepared to participate by videolink. It is submitted that the defence was materially prejudiced by reason of the fact that the jury was not allowed to hear firsthand “from one of the most senior solicitors in Scotland” what he had told Mr Potier.
	
	
	This issue is dealt with at [321] to [335] of the principal judgment. No misapprehension of fact or law has been demonstrated. Mr Potier simply cavils with the conclusion that was reached. That is not within r 50C jurisdiction.
	


(g)   Rulings on privilege


	
	It is next said by Mr Potier that this Court misapprehended the law in not considering that the trial judge on a number of occasions put Mr Potier in a position where he was “required to waive privilege” before his Honour would consider the applications before him. It is submitted that this severely damaged Mr Potier’s ability to conduct the proceedings in accordance with the law and that this Court made a misapprehension of law in not considering these matters and misapprehensions of fact and law as to how a reasonably minded person would consider such conduct.
	
	
	Reference is made in this context to the submissions made by Mr Potier on the appeal (10/9/14 pp 13-14). Those parts of Mr Potier’s submissions deal with various matters, including denial of access to the subpoenaed material; the trial judge’s refusal to disqualify himself for bias; the complaint that Mr Potier had been asked to indicate what witnesses he intended to call and what evidence they might give (and thus to disclose details of the defence case to the Crown) whilst the Crown case was ongoing; the refusal of bail to allow him to conduct his defence adequately; the refusal to allow him to call all of his defence witnesses; the complaints as to the refusal to allow evidence to be taken in person or by videolink from Mr MacKechnie; and (at the bottom of page 14) a complaint as to the admissibility of tendency and coincidence evidence and evidence of prior conviction.
	
	
	This Court’s decision as to various of those matters is elsewhere the subject of complaint on this application. Although grouped under the heading “rulings on privilege” none of those complaints is tied to any particular ruling on privilege as such. The only privilege that Mr Potier was “required”, and even then only in a practical sense, to waive was legal professional privilege and that was in the context of his adjournment application in the circumstances of Mr Healey’s withdrawal from the proceedings. Mr Potier chose on that occasion to waive privilege in order to seek to persuade the trial judge that he, Mr Potier, had not in effect engineered a situation where his first set of Counsel had withdrawn from the case.
	
	
	No misapprehension as to the legal principles relating to bias or as to the facts is here demonstrated (even if one takes into account the whole of the matters to which reference is made at the nominated pages of Mr Potier’s appeal submissions). Again, this is an example of Mr Potier seeking to challenge the conclusion reached by this Court as to bias and to re-argue his case (using the same arguments as he made, and which were considered by this Court, on the hearing of the appeal itself). This is not within the r 50C jurisdiction.
	


(h)   Admission of previous conviction to jury


	
	Under this heading, Mr Potier points out that the tendency and coincidence notice served by the Crown made no mention of his prior conviction and argues that this Court made a misapprehension of fact in stating that it was inevitable that Mr Potier’s conviction for the earlier offences would be made known to the jury and that there had been no objection to this by defence Counsel.
	
	
	At least in part, this again involves a misreading of the reasons for judgment. That is because [26] of the principal judgment (to which, along with [25], Mr Potier refers) recorded the basis on which the argument before his Honour in March 2006 had proceeded. It did not state any conclusion as to the inevitability of the previous conviction becoming known. The statement that no objection was taken to the fact that Mr Potier’s conviction was not specifically listed in the tendency and coincidence notice is borne out by reference to the transcript of what occurred when Mr Potier was represented by Mr Terracini SC, contrary to the assertions now made by Mr Potier. True it is that Mr Healey subsequently raised issues in relation to the evidence of Mr Potier’s prior conviction but that was not what was being addressed at [25]-[26] of the reasons.
	
	
	As to the statement that it would have been a straightforward matter to excise, from the transcripts of the 2 and 6 February 2002 recordings, reference to the earlier conviction and to instruct Crown witnesses not to make reference to that conviction, that was not the submission made in March 2006 when the trial judge determined the admissibility of the tendency and coincidence evidence. In any event, the challenge made on the appeal by Mr Potier as to the admissibility of the tendency and coincidence evidence, and as to the evidence of the previous solicit to murder conviction, has already been considered by this Court (including a submission to the same effect as now repeated as to the fact that matters could have been excised from the transcripts). Mr Potier’s real complaint now is not as to any misapprehension of fact but as to the outcome of the Court’s consideration of that issue.
	
	
	As to the perceived misapprehensions of law on the part of this Court, Mr Potier argues that they are twofold: first that there was an unfair prejudice against Mr Potier by the trial judge allowing specific conviction evidence and; second, that inadequate warnings were given to the jury as to how such evidence might be used.
	
	
	This raises afresh the issue as to the admissibility of the tendency and coincidence evidence which has already been considered and determined by this Court. Mr Potier argues that the trial judge’s instructions to the jury to satisfy themselves of guilt as to the first offences “does not bear examination at law” (emphasis as per his “Short submissions” on this application) and is a miscarriage of justice as the jury had incomplete facts to reach a conclusion “but did know that the earlier Jury had the full facts to reach their verdict” (again, emphasis as per his “Short submissions”). In essence, this is a repetition of the submissions made and considered when the appeal was determined (see [459]-[461] of the principal judgment). If this Court’s conclusion on that aspect of the matter is incorrect, that is a question for another Court to determine. It is not appropriate on a r 50C application to seek to re-argue the issue.
	
	
	Mr Potier goes on to argue that this issue is complicated by the fact that the first jury were not told of the existence of the Telstra material and its significance to the recordings so as to reach a fair verdict. That appears to raise issues relating to the reliability of the first conviction, a matter not open now to be re-argued in light of the High Court’s refusal of special leave to appeal therefrom and in any event already considered (at [476]-[488] of the principal judgment).
	
	
	Mr Potier also relies on a book written by one of the jurors after the first trial (referred to as a “non-fiction” book - Secrets of the Jury Room (MHP5)) as demonstrating the significance of the fact that the first jury did not know of the existence of the Telstra material. It is said that this Court had a “misapprehension of fact and import of these matters to a true verdict” and had this not been so this Court would have appreciated the errors of admission to the jury of the recordings and consequently the earlier convictions. Again, this simply challenges the conclusion reached by this Court on those matters. No misapprehension of any relevant fact or principle of law has been demonstrated. Mr Potier’s complaint does not fall within the r 50C jurisdiction.
	


(i)   High Court


	
	Mr Potier under this heading takes issue with the reference made at [485]-[487] of the principal judgment to matters relating to the fate of his special leave application in relation to the first convictions.
	
	
	Mr Potier says that the High Court in its decision did not make any conclusions or rulings as to the special leave application; that, rather, it declined to grant leave; and that the High Court could not receive fresh evidence but could only consider an error of law by this Court in an earlier judgment.
	
	
	Paragraph [485] of the principal judgment does no more than set out the Crown’s concession as to the Telstra material and what was argued by the Crown on the special leave application, as emerged from the transcript of that hearing, a copy of which was provided to this Court on the hearing of the appeal. Paragraph [486] records what should be uncontroversial, namely that leave to appeal was refused by the High Court in respect of the first convictions and Mr Potier was in his appeal seeking to argue that the first convictions were no longer sustainable. As to [487], no error of law has been identified in the statement of principle there repeated.
	
	
	Rather, what Mr Potier now says is that there was a misapprehension of law by this Court in believing that the High Court could have quashed the conviction based on the “eventual concessions and disclosures” during the second trial about the Crown prosecutor’s conduct when it could not have considered them; and that this also applied to the two sets of recordings. Reference is made to [72] of the principal judgment in this regard. What was there being considered was a submission made by Mr Potier in effect that the High Court could not have considered certain matters that had not occurred until the course of the second trial. It was noted that the High Court special leave application was in 2013, well after the second trial. No misapprehension of law has there been demonstrated.
	
	
	Mr Potier also says that reference in the judgment to concessions made by Counsel appearing for him before the High Court are factually incorrect and were irrelevant to the High Court as they could not be considered. The concession referred to at [73] of the principal judgment was the concession by Counsel for Mr Potier that the call charge records were available to the defence by the time of the second trial. This was drawn from the transcript of the special leave application that, as already noted, was provided to this Court on the hearing of Mr Potier’s appeal. Whether Mr Potier’s Counsel was in error in the making of those submissions is irrelevant. They were made. As to whether they were capable of being considered by the High Court, it should be noted that the application for special leave was Mr Potier’s application and that the application was one that focussed on the Telstra material being fresh evidence. If that had been considered to be of no relevance to the High Court’s consideration it is difficult to understand how the submission made by Counsel could properly have been made at the time. In any event, nothing turned on this issue for the purposes of the disposition of Mr Potier’s appeal from the second conviction.
	
	
	It is further said that this Court made a misapprehension of law in assessing that the Crown’s non-disclosure related only to the evidence of the second offence and that the obligation of ongoing disclosure must relate to all evidence that the Crown intended to use in its prosecution, which included the tenancy and coincidence evidence. The relevant non-disclosure for the purposes of the submissions that were made at the hearing of Mr Potier’s appeal as to the Crown’s conduct was non-disclosure of the fact that the Telstra material was available to it before the conclusion of the first trial. That material was known by the time of the second trial and cannot have caused the second trial to miscarry. No misapprehension of law has here been demonstrated.
	


(j)   Grounds of appeal not fully considered by the Court in its decision


	
	Under this heading, Mr Potier raises four matters that he contends this Court did not consider or consider fully; and which he characterises as a misapprehension of the law.
	
	
	First, it is submitted that this Court did not consider the first instance of bias set out at [426] of the principal judgment: namely, that the trial judge informed the jury that the Crown case was that there was no evidence of the recordings being untrue (said to be factually incorrect) and refused to correct it. This was relied on as an instance of bias, although the ruling as to particular documents that Mr Potier sought to put before the jury to establish that this was factually incorrect was also identified as an instance of the error raised by ground 3 of the grounds of appeal.
	
	
	What his Honour was clearly doing at p 47 of the summing up was summarising the Crown case. In that context, referring to the 2000 recordings, his Honour said:
	


There is no doubt, the Crown says, that those tapes are genuine. The witnesses have attested to them, and you can use your own ears to see if that is Potier on the other end of those telephone calls. There is in fact no evidence of the contrary that they are not proper telephone calls, the provenance of which has been proved. Any suggestion that what was to be done was not to be illegal was merely a matter, the Crown would say, of Potier giving some alibi to himself lest the conversations with “M” were being overheard.


	
	There was no error in his Honour summarising the Crown case as including the proposition that there was no evidence of the recordings being untrue. As to the complaint that this was factually incorrect, that raises the challenges made by Mr Potier to the provenance and integrity of the audio recordings. His Honour, in summarising the defence case, almost immediately reminded the jury of the challenge made to the provenance and validity of the telephone calls by reference to the five calls that could not be traced on the webtrace (p 48) and did so in terms that the defence case was that if the jury decided that some of the calls were questionable (because they could not be found on a webtrace) then the ripples of that would spread out to the other telephone calls and the jury would be dissatisfied of them too, raising many questions as to the provenance and validity of the calls.
	
	
	After the summing up, his Honour acceded to the submission put by Mr Potier that he should also tell the jury that on the Telstra phone records that were obtained by Detective Laidlaw he could not locate those calls. After submissions by the Crown, Mr Potier added to that a reference to the letter that Detective Laidlaw had written to Telstra and asserted that it had said that the calls were made from the three payphones at the centre and his Honour refused to include reference to that as the letter was not in evidence (and did not, in his Honour’s opinion, say that).
	
	
	His Honour then redirected the jury to the effect that, as to the evidence of Detective Laidlaw, there was not only a search by that webtrace but also a search by Telecom on the three numbers in the Villawood Detention Centre that were available to inmates and the calls could not be found on that search either.
	
	
	In those circumstances, the suggestion that the summing up and re-direction as to this issue provided evidence of bias must be rejected. His Honour drew the jury’s attention both to what the Crown had said as to the recordings and what the defence case was in relation to the questionable provenance and validity of the 2000 recordings having regard not only to the missing calls on the webtrace but also to the fact that those calls could not be located on the Telstra call charge records.
	
	
	Therefore, insofar as Mr Potier’s complaint on the present application that the alleged instance of bias was not dealt with or considered fully at [426], it should be noted that the Court’s view is that this allegation of bias was not made out.
	
	
	The next issue said not to have been addressed in the Court’s reasons was the issue of disclosure that was said to have been “fully ventilated” by Mr Potier in his 10 September 2014 submissions at pp 13-14. The topics addressed at those pages of the submissions have already been summarised above (at [57]). No reference is there made specifically to the issue of disclosure. Insofar as submissions in relation to disclosure were made elsewhere in Mr Potier’s written submissions on the appeal, they related to the fact of disclosure of his earlier conviction (addressed in the Court’s judgment and the subject of complaint concluded elsewhere in relation to the present application) and the ground expressly relating to matters relating to the audio recordings, which were comprehensively dealt with throughout the reasons for judgment.
	
	
	Complaint is next made that the submissions as to the “best evidence” rule contained in Mr Potier’s submissions of 5 January 2015 (p 2) were not considered. The submissions to which Mr Potier refers included the following, in relation to Mr Potier’s application to adduce fresh or new evidence (ground 8 of his appeal):
	


Best Evidence Rule

In any consideration of a matter before a Court the “best evidence” is the original recordings – which were not played to the juries: not the altered versions and their supporting transcripts. This Court should satisfy itself of the truth of the matter, by receiving and hearing both sets of the recordings.


	
	The application to adduce fresh (or new) evidence was considered at [589]-[595] of the principal judgment. The submission made by Mr Potier as to the “original recordings” being the “best evidence”, not the “altered version” or the “supporting transcripts” was premised on there having been an alteration of the recordings and his contention that the recordings played to the jury were not genuine.
	
	
	The classic statement of the “best evidence rule” is that of Lord Hardwicke in Omychund v Barker (1744) 1 Atk 21 at 49: “The judges and sages of the law have laid it down that there is but one general rule of evidence, the best that the nature of the case will admit” (cited in Golden Eagle International Trading Pty Ltd v Zhang [2007] HCA 15; (2007) 229 CLR 498 at [4] where Gummow, Callinan and Crennan JJ stated that the rule “has not fallen completely into desuetude” and that an aspect of the rule is that “courts should act upon the least speculative and most current admissible evidence available.”).
	
	
	The best evidence rule was not of relevance when considering and applying the test for admission of new evidence set out in R v Abou Chabaka [2004] NSWCCA 356; (2004) 149 A Crim R 417. Invocation by Mr Potier of the best evidence rule in support of ground 8 of his appeal grounds was not therefore of assistance to him. If Mr Potier maintains otherwise, then that is a matter for him to take on an appeal from the Court’s decision. Moreover the fact that no reference was made to it in the reasons does not disclose a misapprehension of the law. It is not necessary for a Court in its reasons to mention every fact or argument relied on by the losing party relevant to an issue (see Whisprun Pty Ltd v Dixon [2003] HCA 48; (2003) 200 ALR 447 at [62]).
	
	
	Finally, it is said that Mr Potier’s detailed submissions as to the principles set out in his January 2015 submissions at pp 6-12 relating to the test in R v Abou Chabaka were not fully addressed and that they should have been. The test for the admission of new evidence as set out in that case was noted at [591]. There is no suggestion that the test was wrongly articulated. There was no need to recite all of the submissions made by Mr Potier in relation to that test (see Whisprun Pty Ltd v Dixon at [62]). If Mr Potier maintains that the test was wrongly applied then his course is to seek leave to appeal. This is not an appropriate issue to be determined by way of a r 50C application.
	


   Other matters


	
	Under the final heading of his “Short submissions” document, Mr Potier refers to the so-called “preliminary ground” that he had raised as a preface to his grounds of appeal, namely that he suffered substantially as a result of his inability to access legal precedent and adequate facilities to prepare for his appeal.
	
	
	It is said by Mr Potier that to suggest that he had not suffered any prejudice as a result of those disabilities (Mr Potier there referring to what was said in the principal judgment at [151]) was a misapprehension of fact. Mr Potier maintains that it can reasonably be concluded that had he been given adequate facilities to research and argue his case then the outcome would certainly have been different.
	
	
	In this regard, Mr Potier refers to passages in the principal judgment where reference is made to matters such as: the fact that Mr Potier did not attempt to identify any logical connection, as required on the test in Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63; (2000) 205 CLR 337, between the matter identified as one that might lead the decision-maker to decide a question other than on its merits and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the question on its merits ([174]); his misconception of the rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 (HL) ([363]); the generality of his complaint as to the inadequacy of the summing up ([413]); and his lack of familiarity with the Bar Rules as to conferring with a witness ([579]).
	
	
	None of those matters reveals any prejudice suffered or likely to be suffered by Mr Potier as a result of his lack of legal qualifications or access to facilities that might have affected the outcome of his conviction appeal. Paragraphs 363 and 579 indicate why it is that his complaint based on the rule in Browne v Dunn and as to the Crown conferring with a particular witness prior to commencement of her cross-examination were doomed to fail. Paragraphs 174 and 579 do not demonstrate that Mr Potier’s restrictions as a self-represented litigant in custody at the time caused him any prejudice because the approach taken by the Court as to the first was to examine each of the allegations of bias in order to ascertain whether there was a connection of the kind required by Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy and, as to the second, to examine the adequacy of the summing up as a whole, in order to consider Mr Potier’s grounds of appeal in relation to those matters.
	
	
	Mr Potier complains that the statement made by the Court to the effect that he had not provided any detail as to the denial of access to materials and facilities was incorrect and a misapprehension of fact, by reference to the grounds cited in Mr Potier’s numerous applications to the Supreme Court for writs of habeas corpus and bail (cited and considered in Attorney General in and for the State of New South Wales v Potier [2014] NSWSC 118). The evidence relied upon by Mr Potier in those applications was not strictly before this Court, nor were those applications dealt with by the members of the Court hearing the conviction appeal, though Mr Potier certainly made complaint as to lack of assistance in his oral submissions to the Court. He made reference to the earlier applications in his chronology. On the present application, Mr Potier refers generally to the transcripts and to his supplementary exhibits (MHP5 pages 1 to 2) to his 5 November 2014 submissions as supporting his complaint in this regard.
	
	
	Relevantly, however, nothing has been demonstrated to suggest particular prejudice arose above and beyond that which the Court recognised that any self-represented litigant in Mr Potier’s position would have. There is nothing that leads this Court to conclude that there has been a miscarriage of justice in that respect or that the Court should re-open the conviction appeal proceedings or vary the decision or orders in those proceedings by reference to this issue.
	
	
	Next it is said that the statement (at [362]) that there was no evidence from Mr Potier at the second trial that his earlier convictions were subject to an appeal is contradicted by the statement later in that paragraph that some of the evidence of A touched on the fact that Mr Potier was considering such an appeal. Read together, those statements are not, as suggested, contradictory. One is referring to a lack of evidence from Mr Potier on a particular topic; the other is referring to a third party to the effect that Mr Potier was ‘considering’ an appeal.
	
	
	Mr Potier argues that in accepting that such evidence (i.e., that he was considering an appeal) was before the jury, it was a wrong decision at law by the trial judge not to allow a repeat of such evidence to be put to the jury by Mr Potier in his closing address and goes on to contend that there was a misapprehension of law “by denying that such evidence was not allowable to be put to the jury in Closing”. Apart from the fact that there is a distinction between the bringing of an appeal (or pending appeal) and giving consideration to bringing an appeal, Mr Potier’s complaint is one that goes to this Court’s consideration of the issue. No misapprehension of fact or law falling within the scope of the r 50C jurisdiction has here been demonstrated.
	
	
	Finally, Mr Potier argues that the principles in Kauwenberghs v R (Cth) [2009] NSWCCA 201 should be addressed. It is said that this Court has proceeded according to a number of misapprehensions of fact and law, particularly with reference to the recordings, bias and admission of conviction, and that those misapprehensions have affected consideration of the merits of the appeal. He maintains that had the Court adopted a correct understanding, particularly of the recordings issue, a different outcome would certainly have resulted. However, for the reasons set out above, the Court is not persuaded that there has been any misapprehension of fact or law affecting its consideration of the merits of the conviction appeal. The second question posed in Kauwenberghs (whether any such misapprehension was material to the outcome) therefore cannot arise.
	
	
	The Court declines to make any order varying the judgment and orders made on 3 June 2015 or re-opening the appeal proceedings. Mr Potier’s application under r 50C is dismissed.

2702342,R v Dennis [2015] NSWCCA 297,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with the orders proposed by Beech-Jones J and his Honour's reasons for those orders.
	
	
	I wish to make one additional observation. The Applicant's offence was a most serious example of a crime of violence committed against a citizen who was using the public transport system at night. At the time of this offence, the Applicant was on parole for an offence of violence committed against other citizens who were using public transport.
	
	
	This Court has emphasised that crimes of violence in these circumstances warrant severe punishment, and that “persons who are required to use public transport at night should be considered as vulnerable and protected by the sentences imposed in the courts” (R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 77 NSWLR 7 at 41-42 [207]-[208]).
	
	
	The sentencing Judge applied this principle appropriately in this case, by reference to the objective gravity of this offence and the importance of specific deterrence and general deterrence on sentence.
	
	
	BEECH-JONES J: On 18 March 2104 an indictment was presented in the District Court charging the applicant, Shane Barry Dennis, with an offence contrary to s 98 of the Crimes Act 1900 of committing a robbery whilst armed and at the time of the robbery inflicting grievous bodily harm. The indictment included an alternative count of robbery whilst armed and at the time of the robbery wounding the victim.
	
	
	On 26 March 2014 a jury returned a verdict of guilty to the principal count. The offence carries a maximum sentence of twenty five years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of seven years imprisonment has been prescribed for the offence pursuant to s 54A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the “Sentencing Act”).
	
	
	On 16 May 2014 the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of eleven years with a non-parole period of eight years and three months. The sentence was fixed to commence on 1 May 2013. The applicant will be eligible for release on parole on 1 August 2022.
	
	
	The Applicant now seeks leave to appeal from his sentence. In his notice of appeal he relies on two grounds, namely that the sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence and that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. In submissions filed after the hearing of the appeal leave was sought to add an additional ground, namely that there was a breach of procedural fairness. Leave to raise this ground was not opposed. I propose that leave to raise that ground be granted. I will deal with that ground before the complaint of manifest excess. Nevertheless, for the reasons that follow, I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.
	


The offence


	
	The sentencing judge recorded the facts of the offence as follows:
	


“At about 7pm on 29 August 2012, both the offender and the victim, Mr Zeng Zhang, who I will refer to as Mr Zhang, were seen on CCTV footage at Kingswood Railway Station. The offender entered a carriage in the front section of a train going from Kingswood to Werrington. Mr Zhang had earlier been on the same platform as the offender and had entered another carriage, carriage 3.

Mr Zhang was sitting in an empty carriage, using his mobile phone, looking down on it, when the offender attacked him from behind. The offender held the victim’s hair with one hand. He cut Mr Zhang’s throat with the other hand, through the dermis, epidermis, and platysma muscle levels. The cuts left a linear scar of about 16 centimetres in length. The offender used a device like a scalpel, the handle of which was later found in his possession in a backpack he was carrying.

Mr Zhang, who was using his mobile phone when he was attacked, dropped the phone on the carriage floor. The offender ran out of the carriage. It was possible to move between carriage 3 and carriages 1 and 2. Mr Zhang did not see what happened to the person who attacked him.

At the next station, Werrington, CCTV footage showed Mr Dennis running from the train from carriage 3 or 4, two or three carriages from the carriage where Mr Zhang was. Mr Zhang came out of the end carriage, clutching his throat, and collapsed onto the platform floor. He was in the company of another passenger who assisted him with his injuries. Police and paramedics came and Mr Zhang was taken to hospital.

Mr Dennis ran down the platform, through the station and outside. Mr Zhang was able to tell the police who attended him that his phone was equipped with an application called Find My iPhone, which was activated. Searches were activated of the iPhone application, which led to Mr Dennis being found in land adjacent to nearby St Marys railway line within a short space of time. Also found on him was Mr Zhang’s mobile phone in his left pocket and a scalpel handle in a small compartment of his backpack. He was also carrying clothing in a backpack which was that shown on the CCTV footage of the Werrington and Kingswood stations.” (emphasis added)


	
	The written submissions of the Applicant contended that this part of the sentencing judgment contains factual errors. First it was contended that his Honour erred in stating that the Applicant attacked the victim from behind. This contention is correct. The victim’s evidence was that his attacker was in front of him when he slashed his throat. The materiality of this error is addressed below.
	
	
	Second, the Applicant pointed to the portion of the above passage which referred to the victim dropping his phone on the floor of the carriage and the offender running out. It was contended that this was erroneous as it was the victim’s evidence that he, the victim, ran out of the carriage. I do not accept this complaint. It is correct that it was the victim’s evidence that he ran out of the carriage but, as noted by his Honour, the offender ran out of the carriage as well. The Applicant asserted that the significance of this is that the “applicant did not simply take the mobile phone and run away, leaving the victim alone and without assistance”. However, the Applicant did take the mobile, abscond and leave the victim without assistance.
	


The sentencing judgment


	
	After setting out the facts of the offence, the sentencing judge identified the facts and circumstances relied on by the Crown to identify the applicant as the assailant. Relevantly his Honour described the Crown case as circumstantial but strong and also stated that during the police investigation the applicant lied about his whereabouts at the time of the offence. Otherwise I note nine matters about the sentencing judgment.
	
	
	First, his Honour noted that approximately 3cm of the 16cm span of the cut on the victim’s neck “penetrated the dermis through the platysma muscle” and the “anterior jugular vein was injured and needed suturing”. His Honour noted that as a result of the scarring the victim “still experiences pain some two years later”.
	
	
	Second, his Honour noted the effect of the judgment in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 (“Muldrock”) concerning the significance of the standard non-parole period and the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	Third, his Honour assessed the objective seriousness of this offence. His Honour’s finding is the subject of complaint. His Honour stated:
	


“There is always a degree of gradation of injuries in terms of what constitutes grievous bodily harm. It is submitted here, as I have said, by defence counsel that the injury was relatively minor. I do not agree. Any cutting of somebody’s throat involves a very serious and potentially life-threatening injury.

While I need to confine my consideration to what actually occurred, the criminality of the act includes the fact and the act of cutting a throat while on a moving train, and that becomes relevant, if not to the issue of grievous bodily harm, certainly the issue of general deterrence.

The degree of violence was significant. It was a short but fierce attack accompanied by the victim being grabbed by the hair and shaken. The victim had no warning or knowledge of the offender’s approach until the offender had actually grabbed him. The attack only lasted a matter of seconds. In this regard, the victim himself may not have been under a prolonged apprehension of fear. Nevertheless, it would have been a terrifying experience. Notwithstanding the Crown’s initial submissions that the criminality involved is mid-range, I find the criminality to be above midrange by virtue of all the surrounding circumstances as I have listed them, including the premeditation and planning involved at least from the time when Mr Dennis was observed at the preceding platform, watching Mr Zhang as he used his phone, as well as the modus operandi involved, given the similarities and the matters that I will refer to later in these remarks.” (emphasis added)


	
	Later in the sentencing judgment his Honour returned to the topic of whether the offence was premeditated stating:
	


“… it appears to have been opportunistic.

However, the offence necessitated, as I have found, some planning to carry out regarding not only the carriage of the weapon, the backpack in which the weapon was secreted, the particular entry and exit from the train at the various platforms, the fact that he ran away from the station into vacant land, where he hid.”


	
	Otherwise his Honour noted that the offence was aggravated because it was committed while he was on parole for an offence of aggravated robbery (Sentencing Act, s 21A(2)(j)). However his Honour did not take into account as aggravating factors the fact that the offence involved the use of a weapon or involved violence as they are elements of the offence (Sentencing Act, s 21A(2)).
	
	
	Fourth, his Honour noted that the applicant’s criminal history involved “a number of matters of violence and offences such as escape lawful custody”, assault and “aggravated robbery charges”. Placed before his Honour was the statement of facts concerning the offence in respect of which he was on parole, namely an offence of robbery aggravated by violence committed in 2011 (the “2011 offence”). On that occasion, the applicant assaulted two women on a train and stole one of their handbags. For that offence he was sentenced to two years and three months imprisonment with a non-parole period of nine months and ten days. The sentencing judge otherwise noted that the applicant had received a range of sentencing options but they do not “seem to have had any significant impact on this offender at all”.
	
	
	Fifth, his Honour considered and rejected a submission that a finding of special circumstances should be made. His Honour noted that, in addition to his criminal record, the applicant had a poor record on parole and had a number of disciplinary offences in gaol. His Honour ultimately found that there was “no evidence on which I could base any finding of reasonable prospects for rehabilitation”.
	
	
	Sixth, his Honour noted that the considerations of general deterrence “militate in favour of a condign sentence” in that people using public transport at night should be “free of fear, let alone of violence”.
	
	
	Seventh, his Honour noted the applicant’s subjective circumstances. At the time of the sentencing the Applicant was 38 years of age. He had been married but his wife left him after he went to prison. She has formed a new relationship. The Applicant has three children. The sentencing judge described him as having a “very unfortunate background”. He was raised by his mother and her partners were abusive towards him.  The sentencing judge noted that in prison the applicant had undertaken various vocational courses but noted that “dirty urine tests” indicated that his “drug abuse problems” had continued and there does “not seem to be any real recognition of his criminal past”. His Honour addressed in detail a psychologist’s report that was tendered. His Honour concluded that there “was no evidence of any kind of indication of his acceptance of … responsibility on his part”.
	
	
	Eighth, his Honour addressed the commencing date for the sentence. The Applicant’s parole for the 2011 offence was revoked on 6 September 2012 with effect from 29 August 2012. Apparently this was due to his being arrested for the subject offence and his drug usage. His Honour noted that the applicant had been in custody “solely referable” to the subject offence from 1 May 2013. His Honour commenced the sentence from that day.
	
	
	Ninth the sentencing judge did not accept that the applicant was “remorseful in any way”.
	
	
	After discussing various decisions of this Court involving broadly comparable circumstances his Honour imposed the sentence noted in [7].
	


Ground 1: Error in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence


	
	Ground 1 of the application contends that the sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the applicant’s role in the offending as “above midrange” (see [15]).
	
	
	The approach to be taken to a ground framed in these terms was stated by Spigelman CJ in Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37] as follows:
	


“Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour.”


	
	In his written submissions Counsel for the Applicant, Mr Hunt, submitted that five matters “inappropriately” affected the sentencing judge’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence, namely: (i) the weight given to the gravity of the victim’s injury; (ii) the consideration given to the potential outcome of the assault; (iii) the reliance by the sentencing judge on the degree of planning and premeditation involved; (iv) the reference by the sentencing judge to the applicant’s prior criminal record and (v) certain factual errors in the sentencing judge’s findings concerning the facts of the offence. I will deal with each in turn.
	


The victim’s injury


	
	In his written submissions Mr Hunt pointed to the following parts of the sentencing judgment as being contradictory:
	


“I note the victim’s injuries constitute an element of the offence and the extent of the injury is not to be a factor in the sentence, as was set out in The Queen v. Shezari [2007] NSWCCA 19”

“Here the extent and nature of the injuries were serious and that is a relevant factor in accordance with the decision The Queen v. Mitchell (2007) NSWCCA 177 A Crim R 94 at 27.”


	
	However in its submissions the Crown noted that the reference to “The Queen v Shezari” in the transcript of his Honour’s ex tempore judgment was most likely a typographical error and should have been a reference to R v Chisari [2006] NSWCCA 19 (“Chisari”). In Chisari at [22] Simpson J stated:
	


“It is, obviously, quite correct that the offence was aggravated by the identity of the victim, and by the extent of injury. These were both taken into account by the sentencing judge. Treating the extent of the injury as an aggravating feature requires some caution. An element of an offence against s33 is the infliction of injury amounting to grievous bodily harm. To take that into account as an aggravating feature would contravene the direction contained in the final words of s21A(2). Where, however, as here, the injury significantly exceeds the minimum necessary to qualify as grievous bodily harm, it is relevant to take the extent of the injury into account. This was done and, in my opinion, no error has been shown in this respect.”


	
	The Crown submitted that when the passages in [28] are considered in light of this statement of principle it is clear that, allowing for typographical errors in the transcription of the reasons, the sentencing judge accepted that the infliction of grievous bodily harm could not constitute an aggravating factor, but the extent of the injury could still be taken into account. In the end result Mr Hunt did not dispute that analysis and in any event I accept it. There was nothing “inappropriate” in the sentencing judge’s consideration of the extent of the victim’s injury.
	


Potential outcome


	
	This aspect of ground 1 concerns that portion of the sentencing judgment extracted at [15] above in which his Honour referred to the cutting of a person’s throat as “potentially life-threatening” but also stated consideration needed to be confined to “what actually occurred”. It was contended that it was somehow erroneous to refer to the possible consequences of the wound rather than the actual consequences. I disagree. The life threatening nature of the wound reflects upon the nature and quality of the act that led to it being inflicted. A cut to the throat may inflict the same or similar physical harm as a cut to the leg, however a sentencing judge is entitled to treat the former as far more serious than the latter. Although not specifically referred to by the sentencing judge, s 21A(2)(ib) of the Sentencing Act specifies that it is an aggravating factor that “the offence involved a grave risk of death to another person or persons”.
	


Degree of planning 


	
	It was contended that his Honour erred in determining the objective seriousness of the offence by having regard, inter alia, to the “premeditation and planning involved” in the offence (see [15]). The written submissions noted that before the sentencing judge the Crown did not submit that the aggravating factor specified in s 21A(2)(n) of the Sentencing Act was made out, namely that the “offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity”, yet his Honour relied on premeditation and planning as “an aggravating feature of the applicant’s offending”.
	
	
	Irrespective of whether it might or might not fall within s 21A(2)(n), it is open to a sentencing judge to consider whether a criminal offence was something that arose out of an unforeseen incident or was spontaneous on the one hand or premeditated or planned on the other, or fell somewhere in between. The specification of a particular aggravating factor in s 21A(2) does not preclude the sentencing judge from considering analogous circumstances as bearing upon the relative seriousness of the offending (Sentencing Act; s 21A(1)(c); see R v Ibrahami [2005] NSWCCA 153 at [19] to [24] per Latham J with whom Grove and Barr JJ agreed). In this case, by reference to the circumstances of the offence and bearing in mind the facts of the 2011 offence, the sentencing judge considered that the applicant had a modus operandi of robbing people on public trains which would be put into action if circumstances permitted. It was open to his Honour to consider that in the course of determining the seriousness of the offending.
	


Prior record as an aggravating factor


	
	The written submissions also contended that the sentencing judge erred in assessing the criminality involved in the offence by having regard to the applicant’s prior criminal record. The submissions highlighted the reference to “… the modus operandi involved, given the similarities …” in the passage extracted above (at [15]) and contended that this was a reference to the 2011 offence. It was contended that this was an impermissible use of his prior criminal record and, in particular, was inconsistent with Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465, esp at 477 to 478 (“Veen No 2”).
	
	
	To address this it is not necessary to consider the passage in Veen No 2 concerning the relevance of an applicant’s prior criminal record to the sentencing process other than to restate that it is “a fundamental precept of the criminal law … that a sentence should not be increased beyond that which is proportionate to the crime in order to extend the period of protection of the community” (Muldrock at [60]). For present purposes it can be accepted that an offender’s criminal record is generally irrelevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence, as that is “to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders” (Muldrock at [27]).
	
	
	However, as submitted by the Crown, the sentencing judge did not reason that the objective seriousness of the offence was increased by reason of the applicant’s poor criminal record. Instead, to an extent, the sentencing judge drew on the similarities between this offence and the 2011 offence as supporting a conclusion that the offence was premeditated or planned in the sense discussed above. This aspect of the reasoning is the focus of complaint by the additional ground addressed below, but at this point it suffices to state that it was open to his Honour to reason in that way.
	


Alleged factual errors


	
	In his written submissions Counsel for the Applicant contended that the sentencing judge “made some factual errors which, while not of enormous significance, demonstrate the apparently unfavourable disposition of the sentencing judge towards the applicant in determining the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offending”. This submission should not have been made. No ground of bias was raised or pursued and an allegation of bias should not be introduced as a side wind.
	
	
	The alleged errors have already been addressed. The significance of the error as to whether the victim’s throat was cut from behind or in front was said to be that it affected the sentencing judge’s conclusion about the “degree of planning or the stealth of the attack”. In support of this complaint the applicant’s submissions referred to a finding by the sentencing judge that the “victim had no warning or knowledge of the offender’s approach until the offender had actually grabbed him”. This was said to be erroneous because the attack came from the front and the victim gave evidence that just prior to the attack he saw someone coming down the stairs of the train “in the corner of my eye” but he was concentrating on his iPhone. That evidence does not undermine the sentencing judge’s finding that there was no warning prior to the attack. Robberies of this kind are not usually pre-announced. The error about the victim being attacked from behind as opposed to from the front was immaterial.
	


Conclusion on ground 1


	
	The conclusion that the criminality involved in the offending was “above mid-range” was well open to the sentencing judge. This was a vicious life-threatening and, to an extent, premeditated attack and robbery carried out on public transport.
	
	
	I would reject ground 1.
	


Ground 3: Error in using circumstances of 2011 offence to base finding of premeditation


	
	The additional ground raised by the Applicant following the hearing is as follows:
	


“The sentencing judge erred:

By having regard to the applicant's offence committed in 2011 in determining the issue of premeditation in relation to the index offence, and

Failed to provide the applicant with procedural fairness in [the] manner in which he determined that issue.”


	
	This ground is related to the matters addressed at [32] to [35]. It assumes an acceptance by the Court of the Crown's submission as to the use that was made by the sentencing judge of the facts concerning the 2011 offence and contends that, if his Honour did rely on those facts as material supporting a finding that the offence was premeditated, then his Honour erred in doing so because it was contrary to what his Honour stated during the sentence hearing.
	
	
	The course of the sentencing proceedings reveals that the sentencing judge was concerned about the relevance of the 2011 offence. At the commencement of the hearing his Honour raised with Counsel for the Applicant the fact that “there seems to be a lot of commonality” between the two offences but the sentence imposed for the 2011 offence was “pretty generous” and “that doesn’t seem to have had the slightest impact on him”. Counsel for the offender addressed in response. He accepted that this offence was a “repeat type incident on a train” but submitted that the only relevance of the applicant’s record was that it “depriv[ed] him of leniency”. The following exchange then occurred:
	


“HIS HONOUR: Even if I took the view that when he was sentenced for the earlier matter that involved the use of a fist. He’s a big man. He was bigger then. You attack somebody’s throat on a moving train with a scalpel and that’s the only finding of fact that is consistent with the jury’s verdict that I am entitled to make and you might argue that elsewhere if you want to?

Counsel for the Applicant: No. I’m not arguing that, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: In terms of general deterrence people on trains at night, moving trains, are entitled to be there with their own safety considerations being recognised by everybody else. And in terms of personal deterrence, again, it’s almost on all fours …

Counsel for the Applicant: I accept, your Honour, in this second, must address specific and general deterrence, I accept that, and I think on that basis your Honour could take that into account that similar fact type situation, I accept that. I just wanted to make it clear about in terms of the use of his record, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Yes. I’d only be taking into account as a matter of personal deterrence and general deterrence, and the fact that he was on parole is an aggravating feature.

Counsel for the Applicant: Yes.” (emphasis added)


	
	Later in submissions Counsel for the Applicant submitted that his Honour could not “increase the sentence to take into account [the earlier offence] going to issues of general deterrence”.
	
	
	In submissions in reply before the sentencing judge the Crown repeated its submission that the offence fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness. However, consistent with the ultimate finding in the sentencing judgment, his Honour indicated that he considered it to be “above mid-range”. The following exchange then occurred:
	


“HIS HONOUR: What do you say would make it above mid-range or could make it, and I’m not saying ‘would’, could?

[The Crown]: The offence occurred at night. It did involve unnecessary violence but as my friend pointed out that is an element of the offence. … And I would say that there is a degree of planning involved in this offence in that the offender did get on a different carriage, proceed to the carriage where the robbery took place and then left in a separate carriage …” (emphasis added)


	
	In his further submissions Mr Hunt contended that the use by the sentencing judge of the facts of the 2011 offence to base a finding that the offence the subject of this appeal involved some “premeditation and planning” was inconsistent with the second emphasised portion of the exchange extracted in [43]. It was submitted that this involved procedural unfairness in that a “practical injustice” was occasioned to the applicant (Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6; 214 CLR 1 at [37] per Gleeson CJ) (“Lam”). In particular it was submitted that the applicant lost the opportunity to make a submission that the facts of the 2011 offence could not or should not be used to support a finding that the subject offence was premeditated and planned, and this included the opportunity to argue that a direction be made under s 4(3) of the Evidence Act 1995 that that Act apply to the sentencing proceedings so as to engage the provisions of s 97 and 101 as a basis for the exclusion of that evidence.
	
	
	The relevant principle governing a complaint of this kind was stated by Adamson J (with the concurrence of Simpson and Davies JJ) in Dang v R [2014] NSWCCA 47 at [45]:
	


“[45] The question whether a party has been denied an opportunity to be heard, being a matter of substance, must be determined by reference to the circumstances during the proceedings. The real question is whether there has been actual unfairness, not whether there has been a disappointment because an expectation engendered by the decision-maker has not been fulfilled: Re Minister for Immigration & Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6; 214 CLR 1 … at [34] per Gleeson CJ. Commonly, unfairness will arise where someone has been deprived of the opportunity to make submissions or has failed to make submissions by reason of an indication, which ultimately proves to have been false, from the decision-maker.”


	
	This formulation was cited with approval by R.A. Hulme J in Tweedie v R [2015] NSWCCA 71 at [24] (“Tweedie”). In that case at [54] Basten JA stated:
	


“Procedural unfairness only arises where an offender has been denied an opportunity to pursue a particular submission or to call relevant evidence or in circumstances where some representation has been made to him that would dissuade him from taking a course which had been intended.” (emphasis added)


	
	I accept that a literal reading of the second emphasised statement in [43] is inconsistent with the approach that was taken by the sentencing judge, as explained at [32] to [35]. Nevertheless I am not persuaded that the statement of the sentencing judge produced any unfairness such as to warrant a conclusion that there was a denial of procedural fairness. The question of whether the offence was planned or premeditated and, if so, to what extent, was raised at the sentence hearing yet no submission was made on behalf of the applicant to suggest that it was not. Further, Counsel for the Applicant twice conceded the obvious similarity between the facts of the 2011 offence and the subject offence (see [43]).
	
	
	If the sentencing judge had not made the second emphasised statement set out at [43] then in my view it seems inevitable that nothing further would have been said on this topic by Counsel for the Applicant. He said nothing about the degree of planning when this topic was raised. Further, there is no basis to conclude that, if the sentencing judge had specifically put him on notice that he might use the facts of the 2011 offence in the manner his Honour ultimately did, then Counsel for the Applicant might have sought to dissuade his Honour from that course (cf Lam at [36]). The efforts of Counsel for the Applicant were directed to ensuring that the Applicant’s prior criminal record was only used to deny his client leniency. However I am not satisfied that there is a realistic prospect that he would have sought to persuade his Honour that the facts of the 2011 offence could not have been used in the manner they were in the sentencing judgment. The “representation” by the sentencing judge did not “dissuade [Counsel for the Applicant] from taking a course which had been intended” (cf Tweedie at [54]). In this respect this case can be contrasted with Button v R [2010] NSWCCA 264 and Weir v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 123 where the sentencing judge imposed a longer sentence than that which was indicated during the course of the sentencing hearing in circumstances where it was likely that the indication affected the offender’s opportunity to make submissions in support of a lesser sentence.
	
	
	I reject ground 3.
	


Ground 2: Manifest excess


	
	The remaining ground is that the sentence was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	In Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [59] the plurality stated:
	


“As was said in Dinsdale v The Queen ([2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at 325) …, ‘[m]anifest inadequacy of sentence, like manifest excess, is a conclusion’. And, as the plurality pointed out … in Wong [v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at 605] appellate intervention on the ground that a sentence is manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate ‘is not justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases’. Rather, as the plurality went on to say … in Wong, ‘[i]ntervention is warranted only where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons’. But, by its very nature, that is a conclusion that does not admit of lengthy exposition.


	
	In his written submissions Mr Hunt pointed to four particular matters as indicative of the excessive nature of the sentence that was imposed. First it was contended that the sentencing judge was “inappropriately influenced by what he perceived as a lenient sentence” for the 2011 offence. However, although his Honour referred to the Applicant having received a “lenient sentence” for that offence, it was only in the context of explaining that his criminal record was such that the extension of leniency to him has not “had any significant impact on [the applicant] at all” (see [18]). This was not an inappropriate use.
	
	
	Second it was contended that his Honour overstated the position by finding that in committing the offence the applicant was “motivated by greed, one assumes to fund a drug habit”. It was conceded by Mr Hunt that the offence was committed for financial gain but it was submitted that cannot be equated with “greed” when it is undertaken to fund a drug habit. That may be so, but manifest excess is not established by the inclusion of a loose word. The effect of his Honour’s finding is sufficiently clear.
	
	
	Third, Mr Hunt submitted that in light of the statistics on sentencing provided by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales concerning offences under s 98(1) the sentence imposed on the applicant was “very stern”. His written submissions noted that during the period from October 2007 to September 2014 only two of 48 offenders sentenced for robbery whilst armed and causing wounding or grievous bodily harm were sentenced to a term of imprisonment in excess of the eleven years imposed on the Applicant, and of the eight offenders who went to trial, only one received a sentence that was more severe than that imposed on the Applicant. The position with non-parole periods appears to be similar.
	
	
	There are a number of difficulties with reliance on these statistics which Mr Hunt's submissions acknowledge. It can be accepted that “statistics have a role to play in fostering consistency in sentencing” provided care “is taken to understand the basis upon which they have been compiled” (The Queen v Pham [2015] HCA 39 at [49] per Bell and Gageler JJ). Thus statistics “may well establish a range of sentences which have been imposed” however that range does not “mark the outer bounds of the permissible discretion”, instead the “history stands as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence” (Barbaro v The Queen [2014] HCA 2; 253 CLR 58 at [41]).
	
	
	It is evident from the statistics that there are only a few cases where the offender did not plead guilty. The circumstances of this offence were particularly vicious, the offence was aggravated as it was committed on parole, and the offender's record disentitled him to any leniency. In those circumstances it is not surprising that his sentence is at the upper end of the range of sentences that have been imposed.
	
	
	Fourth, Mr Hunt pointed to the sentence being cumulative upon the expired portion of the Applicant’s parole period for the 2011 offence, and the absence of any finding of special circumstances. The bases for those aspects of the sentence have been explained. Neither are indicative of error or manifest excess.
	
	
	Having regard to the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period for the offence and given the viciousness of the attack, the circumstances in which it was committed, the Applicant’s poor criminal record and lack of prospects of rehabilitation, I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	I would reject ground 2 of the application.
	
	
	The orders I propose are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal be granted; and
	
	
	The appeal be dismissed.
	



	
	R.S. HULME AJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Beech-Jones J and subject to the following remarks, with his Honour's reasons. In my view there was a denial of procedural fairness when his Honour used the Applicant's prior offence for a purpose which his Honour had earlier implicitly disowned.
	
	
	Whether, in the absence of his Honour's remark, Counsel for the Applicant would have made further submissions on the topic of premeditation and planning, will never be known. However, even if he did, it is impossible to believe they would or might have had any impact and led to a finding on the topic of planning and premeditation different from that which his Honour made.
	
	
	I also agree with the additional remarks of Johnson J.

2702343,Dean v R [2015] NSWCCA 307,"Judgment


	
	WARD JA: On 18 November 2011, the applicant, Roger Dean, deliberately lit two fires in the early hours of the morning at a nursing home where he was employed as a registered nurse. The nursing home was an aged care facility catering for a number of high care elderly residents. Eleven of the residents died (two being incinerated in their own beds); a further eight were seriously injured from burns and/or smoke inhalation. It was an horrific conflagration, rightly not disputed by Senior Counsel for Mr Dean, Mr Game SC, to have been catastrophic. On any view, this was a terrible tragedy and it was accepted as such by Mr Game.
	
	
	Mr Dean pleaded guilty on 27 May 2013 to eleven counts of murder and eight counts of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm. On each count of murder he was sentenced to life imprisonment commencing 18 November 2011. On each count of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm he was sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment, with a non-parole period of six years; those sentences commencing and expiring at different dates in relation to two groups of counts (counts 12-15 to date from 18 November 2011; counts 16-19 to date from 18 November 2015).
	
	
	Mr Dean also pleaded guilty in the Local Court to two counts of larceny as a clerk, contrary to s 156 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), those counts relating to the theft of drugs and the drug register from the treatment room at the nursing home. The stolen drugs were “Schedule 8 drugs” (S8 drugs). Being drugs of addiction they were required to be, and were, stored and dispensed in accordance with strict protocols. They were kept in a locked drugs cupboard in the treatment room at the nursing home. The larceny offences carried a maximum penalty of ten years’ imprisonment. Mr Dean was sentenced on each of those counts to a fixed term of five years to date from 18 November 2011, expiring on 17 November 2016.
	
	
	Mr Dean seeks leave to appeal from the sentences imposed on him on the counts of murder. There is no complaint as to the sentences imposed on the grievous bodily harm and larceny counts.
	
	
	In his notice of application for leave to appeal dated 8 May 2015, Mr Dean raised the following two grounds of appeal:
	


1.   The sentencing judge erred in concluding it was not possible to adequately reflect the applicant’s culpability by any lesser sentence than life imprisonment. (ROS [107])

2.   The sentences imposed upon the applicant with regard to each conviction for murder are manifestly excessive.


	
	In the course of the hearing of the application in this Court, Mr Game indicated that he would be seeking leave to amend to include an additional third ground of appeal. That proposed additional ground is that:
	


3.   Her Honour erred in adopting a two-stage approach to sentencing.


	
	After judgment was reserved, submissions in relation to the proposed additional ground of appeal were filed by the respective parties in accordance with directions of the Court. The Crown has adopted the position that it is a matter for the Court as to whether leave is granted to add the proposed additional ground. As it does not point to any prejudice occasioned by the late amendment, and having regard to the fact that Mr Dean is serving life sentences, leave to amend the notice of appeal should be granted.
	


Background


	
	The following summary of the factual background is taken largely from the Crown case summary and the primary judge’s reasons on sentence, with which Mr Dean was in substantial agreement (as is apparent from the recitation of facts in his submissions on this application).
	
	
	Mr Dean is now aged 39. At the time of the offence he was 35 and had no prior convictions. He had commenced employment at the Quakers Hill Nursing Home as a registered nurse in early September 2011. At that time, he was also studying law at Macquarie University and was close to completing his degree. He had been addicted to prescription drugs for some time prior to the offences in question.
	
	
	As at 18 November 2011, there were 89 residents in the nursing home. Many were high care residents. Some were immobile. Some suffered from varying stages of dementia.
	
	
	The nursing home was built in an “H” shaped configuration. It was divided into two main wings (the A and B wings), each of which was again divided into two wings (the A1 and A2; and B1 and B2 wings, respectively). The external doors, including the main entrance into the nursing home, were kept closed, admission being via a keypad entry, the code for which was available to staff and some relatives. At night, the code for entry through those doors was available only to members of staff.
	
	
	There were 16 CCTV cameras installed internally and externally around the nursing home. Mr Dean knew the location of those cameras and, relevantly, knew that there was no security camera inside the treatment room where the S8 drugs and the drug register were kept. The treatment room was kept locked as was the drug cupboard in which the S8 drugs were kept. During the night shift, both the keys to the treatment room and to the drug cupboard were kept by the registered nurse on duty at the relevant time.
	
	
	At about 8.00pm on 16 November 2011, prior to the commencement of Mr Dean’s night shift at 10.30pm, an audit of the S8 drugs was carried out by the nursing staff on duty and all drugs were then accounted for.
	
	
	As the registered nurse in charge of the night shift that night, Mr Dean had possession of the keys to the drug cupboard and treatment room. During the course of that night shift, which ended at 7.00am the following morning, Mr Dean stole 237 Endone tablets and one Kapanol tablet from the treatment room, those being restricted prescription-only S8 drugs. Mr Dean locked himself in the treatment room for substantial periods of time in order to do so, removing the drugs from the “blister packs” in which they were contained and placing sticky tape around the blister packs to mask the theft.
	
	
	At about 7.30pm on 17 November 2011, nursing staff conducting the daily audit of the S8 drugs discovered that medication was missing. The clinical manager, Ms Mateo, was contacted. She attended the nursing home and confirmed, after a re-audit of the S8 drugs, that there were missing drugs. The theft of the drugs was reported to the Quakers Hill Police Station at about 10.00pm that night.
	
	
	Mr Dean commenced his night shift at 10.23pm that night. During the briefing on the handover of the shift, he was told of the missing drugs. He was also told that management and the police had been notified. Shortly after midnight, two police officers attended the nursing home to commence a preliminary investigation into the theft. They were met by Mr Dean, who took them to the manager’s office. The police commenced their investigation of the theft but left after 17 minutes to attend to an urgent unrelated matter. After they left, Ms Mateo viewed the CCTV footage from the previous night shift and noted that Mr Dean had entered the treatment room on a number of occasions.
	
	
	Ms Mateo left the nursing home at 3.43am, leaving her office locked. The audit documents and computer records relating to the theft and the complaints to the police were left inside the locked manager’s office, to which Mr Dean did not have a key.
	
	
	At about 4.35am, Mr Dean requested two assistant nurses in B wing, near the treatment room, to leave the floor. They declined to do so, on the basis that they had already had a break. Mr Dean then approached two other assistant nurses in A wing and insisted that they take a break. They did so, leaving Mr Dean alone on the ward.
	
	
	At 4.51am, Mr Dean walked through the foyer and entered the A2 wing where there were no CCTV cameras. Shortly before 4.53am, he set fire to a bed in room 19 in that wing, using a cigarette lighter that one of the staff members had left in a common area. The room in which this fire was lit was unoccupied.
	
	
	Mr Dean later told a psychiatrist (Dr Diamond) that before this fire was lit he had considered setting a linen bag alight but had decided not to do so because that would not cause enough of a distraction (see Dr Diamond’s report dated 19 May 2013 p 18). However, at the sentencing hearing, Dr Diamond gave evidence that he had been informed by Senior Counsel appearing for Mr Dean at the trial (Mr Ierace SC) that Mr Dean had informed him (Mr Ierace) that he had tried to set the laundry bag alight; that it had not lit properly; that it had left a mark on the wall; and that Mr Dean had then abandoned it and had then proceeded to light the first of the two fires on the bed in the empty room. If so, then strictly speaking there were three fires lit. Nevertheless, in these reasons I will refer to the fire in room 19 in the A2 wing as the first fire, since that was the first that took hold.
	
	
	The fire alarm system at the nursing home was such that within 15 seconds of thermal or smoke detectors being activated, a message would be sent via the telephone lines to a contracted security firm and to emergency services; and, simultaneously, the five fire doors would close separating the nursing home into five zones – the central foyer and the four wings. Those doors did not lock and access through them could be gained to the other areas by pushing the doors.
	
	
	At 4.53am, the fire sensors detected the first fire (in room 19) and activated the fire alarm, causing the fire siren to activate within the nursing home and the automatic message to be sent telephonically to the fire brigade. Had the fire been reported directly to the fire brigade there would apparently have been more fire trucks sent in the initial response to the alarm. All the fire doors closed when the siren was activated. (The Crown points to this as showing that Mr Dean was, or must have been, aware when he left the A2 wing that the first fire was sufficiently serious to have set off the fire alarms and close the fire doors. At the sentencing hearing, the defence maintained that it showed the illogicality of Mr Dean’s actions when lighting the second fire.) The fire alarm panel in the foyer was also activated.
	
	
	As the fire door closed, Mr Dean walked from the A2 wing towards the A1 wing entrance. Between 4.53am and 5.02am, Mr Dean lit another fire (to which I will refer as the second fire) on the sheet of an unoccupied bed in room 3 in A1 wing using the same cigarette lighter. He did so knowing that the fire alarm had already been triggered by the first fire in the A2 wing (although he later told Dr Diamond, incorrectly, that the fire alarms went off when he walked out of the room of the second fire).
	
	
	The rooms in the A1 wing each contained four beds. To Mr Dean’s knowledge two of the elderly residents in room 3 in that wing, Dorothy Sterling and Dorothy Wu, were immobile and incapable of moving from their beds without assistance. The third bed was occupied by Bertha Leonard. The fourth bed was unoccupied. It belonged to Molly Douglas, who had dementia, and was not in the room when the fire was lit. According to the account given by Mr Dean to Dr Diamond, not long before lighting that second fire Mr Dean had seen Molly Douglas walking to the toilet and had at some point gone to assist her.
	
	
	At 4.59am, fire brigade officers arrived at the nursing home and were directed by staff to the fire in room 19 in the A2 wing. They extinguished that fire. They were not aware at that stage of the second fire in the A1 wing.
	
	
	Meanwhile, a resident in room 4 of A1 wing, Helen Perry, had woken just before 5.00am. She heard the fire alarm and walked to the door of her room. She could not see or smell smoke and returned to her bed. Mr Dean came to her and said words to the effect “Come on darling, we’ve got to get out, we’ve got to evacuate”. He started to walk her from the room and up the hallway towards the front door. She looked into room 3, where the second fire lit had taken hold, and ran into the room saying “We’ve got to get them out, we’ve got to get them out”. Mr Dean grabbed her and started moving from the room, saying words to the effect “Don’t worry, Helen, just leave them. We’ve got to get out. People are on their way to get them”.
	
	
	At 5.02am Mr Dean came out of the A1 wing. He then moved between the A wing foyer and B wing. He assisted in the evacuation of some of the residents from the B wing. He did not tell any fire brigade officer, or anyone else, about the fire that he had lit in the A1 wing.
	
	
	At 5.04am, fire brigade officers entered A1 wing but were unable to determine the seat of the fire because of the intensity of the heat and the degree of black smoke. They could hear residents calling for help.
	
	
	At 5.08am, a fire brigade officer outside the front area entrance doors directed Mr Dean to move away from the entrance area. During the next ten minutes, Mr Dean remained outside the nursing home.
	
	
	At 5.15am, fire brigade officers discovered the seat of the second fire in room 3 of A1 wing. By that time the fire was already partially breaching the roof of the nursing home and had been burning for at least 13 minutes.
	
	
	Between 5.49am and 6.10am, Mr Dean made three attempts to enter the nursing home through the fire doors. On the last occasion he said to a fire brigade officer “I need to go inside to get the drug book, I need to get in there”. He was given permission to enter the building and retrieve the drug books. He entered the building with two fire brigade officers and explained to them the location of the drug cupboard and the drug register books. He gave one of the fire brigade officers the keys to the room and initially stayed in the corridor outside the view of the CCTV cameras. When the fire brigade officers were not able to open the door they invited Mr Dean to assist. He appeared reluctant but ultimately approached and unlocked the door, entered the treatment room, and removed the two drug register books which he put in a yellow shoulder bag.
	
	
	Mr Dean then left the building, saying that he needed to get Ventolin and that he lived nearby. As he was leaving the nursing home he was interviewed on film by a reporter. He appeared coherent, alert and responsive. He went home to an apartment he shared with a former partner. There, he tore up the two drug registers and placed the remains in a grey plastic shopping bag. His former partner then drove Mr Dean to a cheesecake shop operated by the former partner. Mr Dean disposed of the plastic shopping bag containing the remains of the drug registers in a dumpster bin near the cheesecake shop and returned to the nursing home.
	
	
	At about noon, Mr Dean was taken by ambulance to hospital where he was noted as being “generally distressed”. At about 2.00pm, Mr Dean was taken to the police station where he made a written statement in which he did not make any incriminating statements. At about 7.15pm, Mr Dean was told by police that he was regarded as a suspect.
	
	
	Between 6.47pm and 8.15pm, Mr Dean made a number of calls and sent some text messages which were intercepted pursuant to a warrant. During this time, Mr Dean admitted privately to two friends, Mr and Mrs Reid, that he had lit the fires. He said nothing about being under the influence of drugs. They later gave evidence that he did not appear to them to be affected by drugs.
	
	
	Shortly after 7.50pm, Mr Dean was arrested and cautioned. At 9.50pm he entered into a record of interview in which he admitted lighting the fires. The primary judge noted (at [37]) that Mr Dean gave lucid and rational responses in the two hour long police interview (that also being the conclusion that Dr Diamond had formed from his review of the electronically recorded interview). Mr Dean informed the police that he had taken an antidepressant, an antacid and a blood pressure tablet just before the interview. The police records did not disclose any evidence of withdrawal symptoms experienced by Mr Dean while in custody.
	
	
	In his interview with the police, Mr Dean’s explanation for lighting the fires was that he had been having quite severe nightmares, had been suffering depression for two years, had attempted suicide and believed that Satan had urged him to light the fires. Asked what medications he had taken, he said Aropax, Lovan and Seroquel. He said that he had only been taking Lovan before the night of the fires. (Mr Dean’s later account to Dr Diamond and to others of what medications he had taken on the day of, and leading up to, the lighting of the fires varied significantly. As noted by Dr Diamond, the forensic pharmacologist who provided an expert certificate in the proceedings, Dr Perl, expressed the opinion that had Mr Dean in fact ingested the drugs in doses he indicated he had over 16 and 17 November 2011, she would have expected a fatal outcome (despite any tolerance he had) and, at the least, profound impairment of his cognitive and motor functions but more likely stupor or coma (see Dr Diamond’s report p 40). Dr Perl was further quoted by Dr Diamond as saying that there were no significant withdrawal symptoms noted in the Justice Health records as one would expect if Mr Dean had ingested the drugs indicated to another doctor, Dr Christie, nor any withdrawal symptoms while in police custody.)
	
	
	In the police interview, Mr Dean said he did not think either of the fires would burn out of control and he made no attempt to extinguish them. He described the cigarette lighter and how he came to take it from the kitchen. He agreed that he knew of the missing drugs. He denied that he had lit the fires in retaliation for dissatisfaction on the part of some staff members over his method of distributing medication. He did not admit the theft of the S8 drugs or the drug registers.
	
	
	Subsequently, as noted by the primary judge (at [41]), Mr Dean admitted that his intention in lighting the fires was to create a distraction to deflect management from further enquiry into the theft of the drugs; and he maintained that he only thought to retrieve the S8 registers from the treatment room after the attendance of the fire brigade officers and that he had destroyed the registers to remove evidence of the missing drugs. Mr Dean told Dr Diamond he decided to set a bed alight because he believed a burnt bed would constitute a priority.
	
	
	Following execution of a search warrant on Mr Dean’s home in the afternoon of 21 November 2011, a quantity of drugs, including some of the stolen Endone tablets and the Kapanol tablet, were found in a large box in a kitchen cupboard. (Mr Dean’s evidence was that he had taken some of the stolen Endone tablets the morning of the fire.)
	
	
	Dr Diamond assessed Mr Dean prior to the sentencing hearing (having examined him on 3 and 17 April 2013). In his 19 May 2013 report, Dr Diamond stated his opinion that Mr Dean did not suffer from a psychiatric illness (p 41) and said there was no evidence of a thought disorder of any type (p 10). Dr Diamond considered that Mr Dean could be seen to be suffering from an adjustment disorder or substance abuse disorder. In Dr Diamond’s opinion, Mr Dean has a personality disorder and that his personality disorder features (as opposed to his substance abuse) were the more likely and more significant explanation for his conduct (p 37).
	


Primary judgment


	
	In her Honour’s judgment on sentence (R v Dean [2013] NSWSC 1027), Latham J noted, as clearly must have been the case, that the pain and terror experienced by all of the victims must have been horrific; that for those who were unable to move independently and who faced the prospect of being burnt alive, or suffocated by smoke, a worse fate was difficult to imagine ([45]) and that those who lived no doubt had a compromised quality of life because of the effects of their injuries ([46]). Her Honour also noted the far reaching and substantial impact of the offences on the families of the victims.
	
	
	Having outlined the circumstances of the offending (from [6]-[42]) and the impact of the offences on the families of the victims (from [43]-[47]), her Honour turned to an assessment of the objective gravity of the offending (commencing at [48]). Her Honour identified three factors as having an important role in that assessment: the number of victims, the offender’s motive in lighting the fires and the mental element of the offences, namely recklessness ([48]). Nevertheless, her Honour also stated that:
	


These are by no means the only objective factors. No single factor or group of factors is necessarily determinative. Many of the objective factors are inter-related. Ultimately, it is the combination of all of them that informs the extent of the offender's criminality. ([48])


	
	Her Honour reiterated the view she had earlier expressed in Subramaniam v R [2013] NSWCCA 159 at [57] (with which Emmett JA and Simpson J, as her Honour then was, agreed), to the effect that attributes personal to the offender (in particular the offender’s mental state at the time of offending) more appropriately belonged to an assessment of moral culpability and ought to be distinguished from the objective features of the offences (those being the acts and the fault element constituting the offences); though acknowledging that the scope of the expression “the nature of the offending” may not be confined to the ingredients of the offence as observed by Price J (Allsop P and Campbell J agreeing) in Williams v R [2012] NSWCCA 172 at [40] to [42] ([49]).
	
	
	Her Honour said (at [51]) that the motive in this case was intimately connected with the commission of the larceny offences, the objective gravity of which arose out of Mr Dean’s abuse of his position of trust in order to satisfy an addiction to prescription drugs that he could no longer afford. Her Honour said that the fact of addiction did not operate to excuse or justify the thefts and concluded that the larceny offences demonstrated objective gravity “of a significant order” ([51]).
	
	
	As to the mental element in the murder offences, having referred to R v Ainsworth (1994) 76 A Crim R 127; R v Grant [2002] NSWCCA 243; (2002) 55 NSWLR 80 at [72]; R v Holton [2004] NSWCCA 214; (2004) 41 MVR 89 and Apps v R [2006] NSWCCA 290, her Honour said (at [58]):
	


All of these authorities, with the possible exception of Grant, support the unsurprising conclusion that the offender’s reckless indifference is objectively less serious than had he formed an intention to kill or inflict serious injury on the residents of the nursing home.  That is one factor among many. The specific circumstances of this case require closer analysis. (my emphasis)


	
	At [59], her Honour said that Mr Dean’s recklessness for the purpose of the s 35(2) offences (of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm) required, at the relevant time, “foresight of the possibility of really serious injury”, referring to Blackwell v R [2011] NSWCCA 93, and noted that this was a lower threshold than the species of recklessness required for murder.
	
	
	Her Honour went on to set out a list of nine objective factors that, subject to the qualification made at [59], she considered relevant to both the murder and the recklessly cause grievous bodily harm offences, those being:
	


(i)   The offender lit two fires in different locations in the nursing home, at night when the residents were asleep.

(ii)   The victims of the murder offences were vulnerable, in that they ranged in age between 73 [sic; this should have been 47] and 97 years of age, and were in the high dependency wing of the nursing home.

(iii)   The victims of the recklessly cause grievous bodily harm offences were vulnerable, in that they ranged in age between 45 and 85 years of age and were in the high dependency wing of the nursing home.

(iv)   All of the victims were under the care and control of the offender as the Registered Nurse in charge of the nursing home at the time.

(v)   The offender lit the second fire after the fire alarm had activated and in a room that he knew to be occupied by elderly, immobile residents.

(vi)   The offender consciously desisted from assisting the immobile residents in room 3 of A1 wing to escape from the fire, despite the protestations of another resident.

(vii)   There was a degree of planning and pre-meditation, commencing after the departure of the manager (approximately 3:45am) and evidenced by the direction to the assistant nurses to leave the wards in both B wing and A wing, obtaining the cigarette lighter from the kitchen, and lighting the first fire in A2 wing where there were no CCTV cameras.

(viii)   The offender allowed, by his silence, the second fire to take hold over a period of approximately 15 minutes, before fire brigade officers could identify the seat of that fire.

(ix)   The offender consciously endangered the lives of the occupants of the nursing home in order to avoid the consequences of his theft of drugs from the treatment room. (at [60])


	
	With respect to the last of the above nine factors, her Honour said (at [61]) that it was common ground that the genesis of the offender’s decision to light the fires was evading detection for the theft of the drugs. Her Honour went on to say that “[w]hether that motive extended to an expectation or hope that the fires would destroy the evidence of the theft, contained within the treatment room, or whether it only extended to the creation of a diversion [was] a matter of some dispute”.
	
	
	Her Honour considered that there was much force in the Crown’s submission that Mr Dean’s assertion to police that he only intended to create a minor fire should be rejected. Her Honour referred to the evidence from Dr Diamond to the effect that Mr Dean had initially considered lighting a laundry bag in an unoccupied area of the nursing home but that he had rejected that course because it would not create enough of a distraction and that he then proceeded to light the fires in the respective wings. Her Honour noted that, had Mr Dean wished to create a small fire, there were at least two avenues open to him on his own admission: to light the laundry bag or to stop after the first fire was lit in A2 wing ([62]).
	
	
	Her Honour also said (at [63]):
	


The offender is not an unintelligent man. He had the benefit of the knowledge he acquired as part of the fire safety training course. He knew that his conviction for the theft of the drugs would spell the end of any career in nursing and law. He knew, by virtue of his legal training, that without evidence of the drugs audit, the theft could not be proved to the requisite standard. He must have known that a minor distraction occasioned by a minor fire would not divert the authorities from ultimately pursuing a matter as serious as the theft of drugs.


	
	The combination of those factors persuaded her Honour beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Dean “meant to start a fire of substantial proportions that would either destroy the incriminating evidence in the treatment room (whether by fire or water damage), or create sufficient chaos to allow him to gain access to the treatment room in order to remove that evidence”. Her Honour rejected Mr Dean’s claim that he did not think to gain access to the treatment room until after the arrival of the fire brigade officers. Her Honour said that the fact that Mr Dean had not used an accelerant did not undermine this finding ([64]).
	
	
	At [66], having noted at [65] a submission from Mr Dean’s then Senior Counsel that his long-term drug use explained the “somewhat illogical account” that he intended to create a small fire to distract or divert management from investigating the theft of the drugs, and observing that this submission assumed the veracity and reliability of Mr Dean’s answers in his police interview, her Honour said that:
	


I am unable to accept that the offender has been entirely honest and reliable in his account of the offences, partly because that account offends common sense in some respects and partly because the offender's personality disorder [i.e., narcissism] predisposes the offender to act in his own interests to the exclusion of all others.


	
	Pausing there, this accords with Dr Diamond’s evidence as to Mr Dean’s “long standing behaviour”; that he simply believed he could “get away with” stealing the drugs; and that he was cleverer than most people that taking expression in what “to you and I would be completely hare-brained”.
	
	
	Relevantly, her Honour also noted (at [67]) that Mr Dean’s narcissism, its causal relationship to the offences and the impact of Mr Dean’s prescription drug addiction on the quality of his decision-making were canvassed further later in her reasons (my emphasis).
	
	
	At [68], her Honour said that in the “rather singular circumstances of this case” there was a degree of artificiality in an assessment of the gravity of each of the murder and s 35(2) offences and said:
	


Where, as here, an offender simultaneously causes the death of many people and recklessly causes serious injury to several others by a discrete act, the objective gravity of each offence is informed by the objective gravity of the combination of offences:  Adanguidi v R [2006] NSWCCA 404 at [32].


	
	Her Honour then expressed the view (at [69]) that the murders and s 35(2) offences fell into the worst case category. Her Honour considered that such an assessment was warranted “notwithstanding that the murders were committed by way of reckless indifference to human life” and went on to say that:
	


… It remains to consider the offender's subjective circumstances and his culpability for the offences in order to determine the appropriate penalty.


	
	Under the heading “The Offender’s Subjective Circumstances”, her Honour summarised the evidence as to Mr Dean’s personal circumstances (from [70]-[82]), concluding that Mr Dean probably attended work on the night of the offences while affected by prescription drugs but that the degree of any impairment to his decision-making processes remained an area of dispute. Her Honour then turned to the import of his addiction to prescription drugs and his personality disorder on Mr Dean’s culpability.
	
	
	At [87], while not cavilling with the diagnosis of poly-substance abuse disorder that applied at the time of the offending, her Honour stated that she did not accept that Mr Dean’s culpability for the offences was attenuated by his ingestion of prescription or non-prescription drugs in the days and hours immediately preceding the commencement of his shift on the evening of the fires. Her Honour said that Mr Dean had clearly not ingested drugs that relevantly affected his capacity to form judgments and make calculated decisions.
	
	
	As to the psychiatric evidence, her Honour noted that Dr Diamond had rejected any diagnosis of a psychiatric illness or personality disorder but had concluded that Mr Dean displayed personal characteristics consistent with a “Mixed Type Personality Disorder with narcissistic traits and histrionic traits” and that Mr Dean’s decision-making was impaired by this underlying personality disorder ([89]-[91]). Her Honour expressly accepted that in that respect, there was a causal connection between the offending and Mr Dean’s psychiatric condition ([91]). Her Honour went on to say that it remained to consider whether and to what extent Mr Dean’s mental disorder affected the exercise of the sentencing discretion; and extracted the summary in DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 at [177] as to the potential impact of mental illness upon sentencing.
	
	
	Her Honour noted that Dr Diamond, in his psychiatric report, had concluded that there was no evidence to substantiate a view that Mr Dean had impaired capacity to foresee the probability of death when he lit the fires. Dr Diamond had concluded that there was no impairment of capacity to think through the intention and consequences of his plan; rather that Mr Dean was preoccupied with his own predicament and there was a failure to balance his immediate needs against those of the vulnerable people he placed at risk ([95]). Dr Diamond said, in a passage quoted by her Honour:
	


The reckless indifference to human life exhibited by the offender by lighting the fires does not, in my opinion, arise because of diminished capacity to make decisions and carry them out. It arises from his personality disorder and not from an impairment of thinking or capacity to think clearly. ([95])


	
	Her Honour said (at [99]-[100]):
	


In the circumstances of this case, there is nothing to support the conclusion that the offender was unable to appreciate, or to appreciate fully, the wrongfulness of his actions, or to make reasonable judgments. The relevant causal connection between the offender’s personality disorder (narcissism) and the deliberate decision to light two fires and leave them unattended is the dominance of his own immediate needs over the needs of anyone else, even if they included vulnerable patients under his charge.

In that sense, it may be said that the offender’s capacity to control his emotions was compromised by his personality disorder and thus, his decision-making gave primacy to his own needs. However, in my view, that relatively limited impairment, particularly when considered against the scale of the offender’s reckless indifference, the enormity of the harm which resulted and the objective criminality of the offender's conduct, carries limited weight in reducing the offender's culpability to any material degree. Similarly, it does not render the offender as an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence.


	
	At [101], her Honour addressed a submission made for Mr Dean that his culpability consisted of the foresight, at the time that he lit the fires, of the “real chance” that residents of the nursing home would die and/or receive serious injuries and that his recklessness in that regard rendered him less culpable than if he had formed an intention to kill or to inflict really serious injury. In that context her Honour expressed the view that there was no relevant distinction between the references to a foresight of the “real chance” of death and the “probability” of death or the “probable result” in Boughey v The Queen [1986] HCA 29; (1986) 161 CLR 10 at [18] and in R v Grant  at [33].
	
	
	Her Honour concluded (at [102]) that:
	


For the reasons that I have already given in relation to the objective gravity of the offences, I do not accept that the offender is less culpable on that basis [i.e., on the basis put in the submissions made for Mr Dean to which reference was made at [101] – see [62] above], either alone or in combination with his personality disorder.


	
	Her Honour then turned to the question whether, pursuant to s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) or at common law, a life sentence for the murder offences was required in the circumstances of the case and said (at [107]-[108]):
	


Whether pursuant to s 61(1) or under the common law, a life sentence for the murder offences is required in the circumstances of this case. It is simply not possible, in my view, to adequately reflect the culpability of the offender for the deaths of eleven vulnerable people, for whose care he was responsible, by any lesser penalty. The features of the offending with respect to the murders warrant the description “heinous”, “atrocious” and “greatly reprehensible”: Harris at [85]. At least three of the criteria, that is the community interest in punishment, retribution, and deterrence, are present in this case.

The number of deaths alone is sufficient to elevate these offences into the worst case category: R v Baker NSWCCA 20 September 1995 (unreported). That is particularly the case where a number of murders occur as part of one episode of criminality: R v Villa [2005] NSWCCA 4. The fact that these murders arise out of the offender’s reckless indifference rather than an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm does not detract from these principles.


	
	Her Honour found the depth of Mr Dean’s expressed remorse to others difficult to gauge, principally because of his lack of insight and gross preoccupation with his own interests, and noted that the evidence of Dr Diamond established that Mr Dean remained deceptive and self-serving in his responses to others even after being taken into custody for the offences and during the preparation of his case for trial ([109]). Though her Honour considered that Mr Dean’s prospect of rehabilitation were speculative having regard to the fact that his underlying personality would not change, she was satisfied that Mr Dean was not at risk of committing serious offences in the future ([110]). It was against that background that her Honour considered the late entry of the pleas of guilty. Her Honour said (at [111]) that, putting to one side the utilitarian value of the pleas (earlier assessed at 15%), the pleas indicated a realisation on Mr Dean’s part that there was “overwhelming and damning evidence of his reckless indifference whilst in a lucid and rational state, rather than any significant degree of remorse”. Her Honour was not persuaded by reference to Mr Dean’s subjective circumstances that the discretion to impose a lesser sentence ought be exercised ([112]).
	


Consideration of appeal grounds


	
	I have outlined above in some detail the structure of her Honour’s reasons, as issue has been taken in the proposed ground 3 of the grounds of appeal with the manner in which her Honour approached the sentencing task. It is convenient to address that ground first, before turning to the original grounds of appeal.
	


Ground 3: Error in adopting a two-stage approach to sentencing


	
	Section 61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides, relevantly, as follows:
	


Mandatory life sentences of certain offences.

(1)   A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.

…

(3)   Nothing in subsection (1) affects section 21(1).


	
	Section 21(1) provides that:
	


21(1)   If by any provision of an Act an offender is made liable to imprisonment for life, a court may nevertheless impose a sentence of imprisonment for a specified term.


	
	In R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19; (2004) 59 NSWLR 557 Wood CJ at CL (Tobias JA and Hidden J agreeing) noted (at [36]) the tension between the apparent mandatory requirement to impose a life sentence where a case falls within s 61(1) and the preservation by s 61(3) of the s 21(1) discretion to impose a lesser sentence. Wood CJ at CL went on to say:
	


That tension was recognised in decisions such as Regina v Petrinovic [1999] NSWSC 1131, and also in Regina v Harris (2000) 50 NSWLR 409. It has been resolved in favour of recognising the continued existence of the discretion, notwithstanding the fact that the s 61(1) criteria are met, where the offender’s subjective circumstances justify a lesser sentence than one of life imprisonment.


	
	At [37], his Honour referred to this as a “two step process, including the discretion, which has been followed in the application of s 61”, which his Honour noted had been recognised in R v Harris [2000] NSWCCA 469; (2000) 50 NSWLR 409 and in R v Miles [2002] NSWCCA 276.
	
	
	In Knight v R [2006] NSWCCA 292; (2006) 164 A Crim R 126, McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Adams and Latham JJ agreed) articulated the following principles in relation to s 61(1) (at [23]):
	


●   the maximum penalty for an offence in the case of murder, life imprisonment, is intended for cases falling within the worst category of case for which that penalty is prescribed: Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451-452.

●   it is not possible to prescribe a list of cases falling within the worst category – ingenuity can always conjure up a case of greater heinousness: Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 478; R v Petroff (unreported 12 November 1991 – Hunt CJ at CL).

●   a life sentence is not reserved only for those cases where the offender is likely to remain a continuing danger to society for the rest of his or her life or for cases where there is no chance of rehabilitation; the maximum may be appropriate where the level of culpability is so extreme that the community interest in retribution and punishment can only be met by a sentence of life imprisonment; R v Kalazich (1997) 94 A Crim R 41 at (50-1); R v Baker (unreported CCA 20 September 1995); R v Garforth (unreported CCA 23 May 1994).

●   in many cases a two stage approach to the consideration of whether the maximum penalty should be imposed is appropriate. Firstly, consideration is given to whether the objective gravity of the offence brings it within the worst class of case and then consideration is given to whether the subjective circumstances of the offender require a lesser sentence: R v Bell (1985) 2 NSWLR 466; R v Valera [2002] NSWCCA 50. (my emphasis)

●   it is the combined effect of the four indicia in s 61(1) which is critical: R v Merritt (2004) 59 NSWLR 557.

●   the absence of any one or more of the indicia of retribution, punishment, community protection or deterrence may make it more difficult for a sentencing judge to reach the conclusion that a life sentence is required although will not be determinative: Merritt at 559.


	
	In the present case, though it is now suggested that Knight was wrongly decided, her Honour’s attention was expressly directed to both of the above authorities (at [77] and [82] of the written submissions on sentence for Mr Dean).
	
	
	The two-stage approach that was said in Knight to be appropriate in many cases was thus one of first assessing the objective gravity of the offence to determine whether it was within the worst category of cases (for which a maximum penalty of life imprisonment is to be imposed in accordance with s 61(1)), followed by consideration (in accordance with s 21(1)) of whether a lesser sentence was required. In Knight it was said that this second stage was by reference to the subjective circumstances of the offender.
	
	
	The approach adopted by her Honour accords with the practice that has been commonly adopted in sentencing for murder in this state since the introduction of s 61(1). The Crown notes, by way of example, that in SW v R [2013] NSWCCA 103, where a life sentence was imposed at first instance for one count of murder by reckless indifference, this Court was unanimous on appeal that the two-stage procedure there adopted by the sentencing judge was in accordance with authority. In the joint judgment of Hall and Davies JJ, their Honours, after quoting s 61(1), stated (at [147]):
	


If it is considered that the case falls within that section there remains a residual discretion under s 21(1) of the Act to impose a determinate sentence where the offender's subjective circumstances justify such a course: R v Merritt at [36].


	
	Similarly, in Barton v R [2009] NSWCCA 164, Giles JA (with whom Howie and Latham JJ agreed), took no issue with such an approach, saying at [13]:
	


The judge carefully considered the principles material to satisfaction as to the level of culpability in the commission of the offence required by s 61(1) and their application to the circumstances of the offence. He noted that, notwithstanding the mandatory terms of s 61(1), s 21 of the Act preserves the discretion to impose a determinate sentence: R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19; (2004) 59 NSWLR 557. He considered that, on the two-stage approach found in the authorities, on the objective facts the level of culpability was so extreme that it warranted the maximum penalty. But at the second stage of whether the subjective factors displaced the prima facie need for the maximum penalty, he concluded that “the highly unusual combination of matters upon which [counsel for the applicant] relied, are sufficient to justify the imposition of a sentence other than one of life imprisonment”.


	
	More recently, in El-Zeyat v R [2015] NSWCCA 196 (at [43]), Simpson J, as her Honour then was, (with whom Leeming JA and Button J agreed), having affirmed the view that her Honour had previously expressed in Ngo v R [2013] NSWCCA 142; (2013) 233 A Crim R 121 at [27]-[30] that s 61(1) is little (if at all) more than a statement of the obvious, noted that s 61(1) depends, first, upon an evaluation of “the level of culpability [of the offender] in the commission of the offence” and that, where that level of culpability is found to be “so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of [a sentence of imprisonment for life]”, then the sentencing judge is obliged to impose that sentence. Her Honour there noted that even in the absence of s 61(1), a court that arrived at an evaluation of “the level of culpability” of an offender in terms of the balance of the sub-section would be obliged to impose such a sentence.
	
	
	At [44], Her Honour went on to say:
	


Section 61(1) is not the only route to a decision to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life. Indeed, s 61(1) is not a penalty prescribing provision (Ngo at [64]). The penalty for the crime of murder is prescribed by s 19A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). What s 61(1) does (at most) is to identify one set of circumstances in which a sentence of life imprisonment is mandated. That is not necessarily the only set of circumstances in which a sentence of life imprisonment may be imposed, although it is the only one relevant to the present proceedings. It may be accepted that sentences of imprisonment for life are reserved (as are maximum sentences prescribed in respect of other, lesser, offences) for cases in the worst category of their kind.


	
	The essence of ground 3 in the present case is the submission first made in the course of the hearing of Mr Dean’s application in this Court that Knight (and related cases that contemplated a two-stage approach to the application of s 61) was wrongly decided.
	
	
	The late stage at which this issue was raised necessarily precluded any consideration of whether an expanded bench should sit to determine whether Knight (or other Court of Criminal Appeal cases that were accepting of that approach) had been wrongly decided. Furthermore, no such submission was put to the sentencing judge.
	
	
	The criticism now made of her Honour’s process in this regard is twofold: first that her Honour carried out the two-stage approach at all and, second, that even if the two-stage approach recognised in Knight remains permissible (after the decisions of the High Court in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 and Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120), her Honour’s assessment at the first stage was made erroneously, as her Honour did not take into account all the matters relevant to that assessment.
	
	
	Before turning to each of those two aspects, I note that in oral submissions Mr Game submitted that what her Honour was (incorrectly) doing at the first stage of the sentencing exercise was determining the “objective seriousness” of the offences and that “objective seriousness” was “absolutely” the same thing as “moral culpability”. His submission was in effect that in assessing objective seriousness it was necessary to take into account subjective matters that went to the issue of moral culpability because those were the same thing.
	
	
	In his subsequent written submissions, Mr Game contrasted “objective seriousness” (which, by reference to Muldrock was said, in the context and for the purposes of s 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, to be something required to be assessed or determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending) with the objective gravity of particular offending (the assessment of which it was submitted involved much wider considerations consistent with the approach referred to in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 and R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168).
	


Is a two stage approach permissible?


	
	As noted, the principal complaint now made in this Court is that her Honour applied a two-stage process to sentencing in that she first determined that the murder offences fell into the “worst case” category and then proceeded to consider whether there were considerations that warranted the conclusion that a sentence of less than life imprisonment was appropriate. It is said such an approach involves an undue focus on considerations of retribution and general deterrence at the first stage of the process.
	
	
	Mr Game submits that such an approach to sentencing has been impermissible since Markarian and has been impermissible when sentencing an offender for a standard non-parole period offence since Muldrock. Mr Game thus submits that the conclusion that “only” a sentence of life imprisonment was appropriate could not be made until all the relevant sentencing considerations were taken into account by a process of instinctive synthesis, as that process was explained in Markarian at [73].
	
	
	Markarian was decided by the High Court in 2005. It involved an appeal from a decision of this Court on a Crown sentence appeal in relation to a drug offence. Relevantly, the plurality said (at [27]) that:
	


Express legislative provisions apart, neither principle, nor any of the grounds of appellate review, dictates the particular path that a sentencer passing sentence in a case where the penalty is not fixed by statute, must follow in reasoning to the conclusion that the sentence to be imposed should be fixed as it is. The judgment is a discretionary judgment and, as the bases for appellate review reveal, what is required is that the sentencer must take into account all relevant considerations (and only relevant considerations) in forming the conclusion reached. As has now been pointed out more than once, there is no single correct sentence. And judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies.


	
	Their Honours had earlier cautioned (at [24]) that:
	


It is not useful to begin by asking a general question like was a “staged sentencing process” followed. That is not useful because the expression “staged sentencing process” may mean no more than that the reasoning adopted by the sentencer can be seen to have proceeded sequentially. Or it may mean only that some specific numerical or proportional allowance has been made by the sentencer in arriving at an ultimate sentence on some account such as assistance to authorities or a plea of guilty. Neither the conclusion that a sentencer has reasoned sequentially, nor the observation that a sentencer has quantified the allowance made, for example, on account of the offender’s plea of guilty, or the offender’s assistance to authorities, of itself, reveals error. …(my emphasis)


	
	The plurality rejected the proposition that there could be a universal rule stated to the effect that, to the extent that legislation did not otherwise dictate, a process of instinctive synthesis was one that sentencing courts should adopt ([36]); affirmed the statement in Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 534, to the effect that a “mathematical” or two-stage approach to sentencing in which there are to be increments to, or decrements from, a predetermined range of sentences, was apt to give rise to error and departed from principle ([37]); and emphasised that sentencing courts could not “add and subtract item by item from some apparently subliminally derived figure, passages of time in order to fix the time which an offender must serve in prison” ([39]).
	
	
	McHugh J (at [64]) considered that the two-tier approach (which his Honour had earlier described as where a sentence was first determined by reference to the “objective circumstances” of the case and then this hypothetical sentence is increased or reduced by reference to other factors usually personal to the accused (at [51]) was inherently susceptible to error; acknowledging (at [65]) that discretionary sentencing is not capable of mathematical precision or approximation. His Honour considered that the principle of proportionality was difficult, and perhaps impossible, to reconcile with the two-tier approach to sentencing ([69]) and that instinctive synthesis was likely to lead to better sentencing outcomes ([84]).
	
	
	Kirby J, concurring in the orders proposed in the plurality’s reasons, nevertheless expressed discomfort with the instinctive synthesis approach and pointed to the irony that had the two-stage approach not been followed in the Court of Criminal Appeal the errors that had occasioned Mr Markarian’s success in the High Court would probably not have been revealed ([98]).
	
	
	In Muldrock, the appellant had pleaded guilty to a sexual offence concerning a minor. The High Court considered the operation of s 54B(2) and (3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in relation to the setting of standard non-parole periods. In that context, the High Court held that the “objective seriousness” of the offence (for the purpose of determining the standard non-parole period) was to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders; rather, it was to be determined wholly by reference to the “nature of the offending” ([27]). The High Court went on to say (at [28]):
	


Nothing in the amendments introduced by the Amending Act requires or permits the court to engage in a two-stage approach to the sentencing of offenders for Div 1A offences [i.e., those to which standard non-parole periods apply], commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls within the middle range of objective seriousness by comparison with an hypothesised offence answering that description and, in the event that it does, by inquiring if there are matters justifying a longer or shorter period.


	
	The High Court considered that s 54B(2), read with ss 54B(3) and 21A, required an approach to sentencing for Div 1A offences that was consistent with the approach to sentencing described by McHugh J in Markarian at [51] ([26]).
	
	
	In the present case, her Honour did not start with the maximum penalty for murder (i.e., life imprisonment) and then add to or subtract from that figure as various aspects of the sentencing process were considered. Nor did her Honour reason from an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence to fix a non-parole period and then extrapolate from that a head sentence.
	
	
	It is clear from the transcript of the sentencing proceedings that her Honour was alive to the requirement for an instinctive synthesis in sentencing that was affirmed in Muldrock. Her Honour, having queried with Mr Ierace the extent to which motive was relevant in determining the objective gravity of the offence, raised what she referred to as the controversy whether or not questions of a compromised mental state went to an assessment of the objective gravity of the matter personal to the offender. Her Honour there said:
	


I should tell you that in my view, if you’re not talking about a state of mind that would at least amount to partial defence under the substantial impairment or provocation, anything less than that which does not [a]ffect the requisite intent required for the offence properly belongs to the subjective features. As I said, it may not make a whole lot of difference from your perspective but it does pose this question if you like: If I disregard that factor for the purposes of determining the objective gravity of the offence, of course I might get to the position where I think a life sentence is warranted, but then one has to have regard to the subjective factors in order to, the two stage process.


	
	Her Honour indicated that she regarded this area as a rather uncertain area of authority in the Court. Mr Ierace’s response, in effect, was not to argue that the two-stage process offended Muldrock but to raise what is raised by the second aspect of this third ground of appeal, namely that a drug addiction could be relevant both in an objective and subjective way. Mr Ierace, having said that the stated reason for lighting the fires went also to what Mr Dean anticipated would be the consequence of lighting the fires, said that even if substantial impairment or mental illness could not be made out as a defence it could still have a relationship with the commission of the offence. He identified that relationship as being that the drug addiction was both tied with the offence (in an attempt to cover up the theft) and contributed to the making of “abhorrently poor choices” (namely choosing to light the two fires when aware of a real chance of death).
	
	
	There is force in the Crown’s submission that sentencing for murder mandates a two-stage sentencing approach of the kind adopted by her Honour. Certainly, the tension recognised in the authorities as existing between s 61(1) and s 61(3) can only readily be reconciled by assuming that that there has been a determination that a life sentence is required to be imposed and then asking whether, in the circumstances, nevertheless a lesser (fixed term) sentence is appropriate. In other words, there must first be an assessment that the level of culpability is such that a life sentence is required, having regard to the four indicia specified in s 61(1), before one can sensibly apply s 21(1).
	
	
	Muldrock does not, in my opinion, render impermissible such an exercise. Nor does Markarian. For the exercise contemplated by s 21(1) to arise, there must first be a situation where, by a statutory provision, an offender is made liable to imprisonment for life. Although s 61(1) is not a penalty provision per se (as has been noted by Simpson JA in the authorities referred to above) it mandates that a sentence of life imprisonment be imposed on a person convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is as there stipulated. Logically, a determination of the level of culpability for the purposes of s 61(1) must take place before consideration of whether a lesser sentence than life imprisonment should be imposed. This involves no departure from the conventional approach to instinctive synthesis sentencing where an assessment is made as to the objective seriousness or gravity of the offence, taking into account all relevant factors that inform that assessment, and then there is a consideration (having regard to subjective factors) as to what sentence is appropriate.
	
	
	Her Honour did not err in adopting the two-stage approach that she did. I am not persuaded that anything in Markarian or Muldrock renders Knight plainly wrong. Pausing there, I also note that Knight did not in terms suggest that the so-called two stage approach was required to be applied in all cases; simply observing that in many cases such an approach is appropriate.
	


Was there error in the application of the two-stage approach?


	
	Mr Game submits that even if the two-stage process summarised in Knight remains viable post- Markarian and Muldrock it was erroneous for her Honour not to determine the extent of Mr Dean’s moral culpability when assessing the objective gravity of the offences since an offender’s moral culpability is intrinsically part of an assessment of the objective gravity of the offending.
	
	
	Reference is made to R v Henry where Wood CJ at CL considered (at [273]) that the fact that an offence was motivated by the need to acquire funds to support a drug habit may be taken into account as a factor relevant to the objective criminality of the offence insofar as it may throw light on matters such as the impulsivity of the offence and extent of planning; the existence or non-existence of any alternative reason that may have operated in aggravation of the offence; and the state of mind or capacity of the offender to exercise judgment such as whether the offender was in the grips of an extreme state of withdrawal of the kind that might have led to a frank disorder of thought processes or to the act being other than a wilful act.
	
	
	Reference is also made to consideration of what is meant by “objective seriousness” in R v Way (that decision in other respects being overturned in Muldrock on the two stage sentencing approach). At [79], this Court said:
	


While it may not be the case that particular attention has been given to the precise process of reasoning involved in this kind of assessment, it would appear to us to depend upon a combination of sentencing experience, which is based upon the range of instances which go to make up cases of the relevant kind that come before the courts, combined with an understanding of the facts which are necessary elements of the offence, as well as those which are concerned with its consequences, and the reasons for its commission.


	
	Mr Game notes that (at [85]-[86]) the Court considered that included within the objective matters impacting on the seriousness of the offence were matters of motivation, mental state and mental illness or intellectual disability where those matters were causally connected to the conduct and impacted upon an offender’s capacity to reason or fully to appreciate the rights and wrongs of a situation or to exercise appropriate powers of self-control.
	
	
	It is submitted that an assessment of the objective gravity of Mr Dean’s offending had to include consideration of the causes of the offending, including Mr Dean’s motive and those characteristics of Mr Dean that were causally connected with the commission of the offence, namely his poly-substance disorder and his personality disorder. The theft of the medication the night before the fire is identified as the catalyst of the events that followed; the “callous” and “illogical” decision-making on the night of the fire being causally linked both to Mr Dean’s personality disorder and to his poly-substance abuse disorder.
	
	
	The Crown maintains that in any event Mr Dean’s moral culpability was brought to bear such that no error has been exposed in her Honour’s instinctive synthesis of all the relevant matters. In that regard, the Crown notes that her Honour accorded little weight to the impact of Mr Dean’s personality disorder and drug usage and submits that those findings were clearly open to her Honour. Those matters are considered in the context of ground 1 of the grounds of appeal.
	
	
	The Crown also emphasises that it was only after her Honour had considered those matters, that her Honour came, under the heading ‘Worst Case and Section 61(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999” to her determination that only 11 life sentences would be appropriate. The Crown refers, in this context, to [104]-[107] of her Honour’s reasons. At [104] – [105], her Honour stated:
	


The legislature has preserved by the operation of s 21(1) of the same Act a discretion to impose a determinate sentence notwithstanding s 61(1). Such a discretion may operate where an offender's subjective circumstances justify a lesser sentence, notwithstanding that the criteria under s 61(1) are met. This approach has been described as a ""two step"" one, in that an assessment of the culpability of an offender is first undertaken having regard to ""the circumstances surrounding or causally connected with the offence, leaving aside matters such as remorse, pleas of guilty, prospects of rehabilitation and the like."" : R v Harris [2000] NSWCCA 469 ; 121 A Crim R 342 at [60]. Then and only then does a consideration of the offender's subjective case arise.

However, an alternative avenue for the imposition of a life sentence is available under the common law: Harris at [79] to [87]. Whatever the legitimacy of a two step approach under s 61(1) since Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 ; 244 CLR 120, the imposition of a life sentence for a worst case under the common law is still the product of an instinctive synthesis of all the relevant sentencing factors.


	
	For present purposes, it is relevant to note again the caution expressed by the plurality in Markarian (at [24]) against approaching the question whether error has been revealed in the sentencing process by asking whether a “staged” process was followed.
	
	
	The vice in such an approach, it seems to me, is that it assumes that a finding or conclusion at one stage of the process of reasoning is not informed by an assessment of matters that may be considered under other headings later in the reasons, even though the later passages may primarily be addressing other issues. Indeed, it is conceded by Mr Game (at [37] of his submissions) that her Honour’s reasoning could not be said to have involved an (on his submission incorrect) two-stage sentencing process or otherwise to have been inappropriate had her Honour commenced with an assessment of the objective gravity (including the level of moral culpability) of the offending and then enquired into matters personal to Mr Dean, provided this did not involve a determination of an appropriate sentence until all relevant considerations had been taken into account. In other words, had her Honour concluded (at [69]) not that the offences fell into the worst case category, but rather that the offences were objectively of a very serious kind, and left the conclusion that these offences were in the worst case category to later in her Honour’s reasons (say at [102]), Mr Game accepts that he would have no basis for complaint. That places too much weight in my opinion on the structure and sequence of the reasons. The reasons should be read as a whole.
	
	
	The Crown submits that there is no authority for the proposition that a sentencing judge must consider moral culpability as part of a consideration of the objective gravity of the offence noting that in the passage in R v Henry quoted above, Wood CJ at CL said that the fact that an offence is motivated by a need of the kind there referred to “may” be taken into account. It is submitted that the ultimate question is whether each of the relevant matters is ultimately brought to bear in the instinctive synthesis of sentencing and that her Honour did bring those matters to bear in her reasoning process.
	
	
	The two matters that Mr Game argues were not, and should have been, brought to bear in the assessment of the objective gravity of the offences of murder were the causal impact of Mr Dean’s drug use and personality disorder. He notes that during the submissions on sentence between the primary judge and Mr Ierace it was submitted that the evidence established that Mr Dean’s drug abuse, in conjunction with his personality disorder, had affected his ability to make sensible decisions and that this was a relevant factor to take into account on sentence in relation to his culpability for the offences.
	
	
	However, it is clear from her Honour’s reasons (see [67]) that her Honour had in mind before stating the conclusion that the offences fell within the worst case category (at [69]) both the issue of the causal relationship between Mr Dean’s personality disorder and the offences and the impact of the drug addiction on the quality of his decision-making. Those matters were dealt with in detail later in the reasons. It may be inferred, from the reference made to this at [67] that had those matters affected the assessment by her Honour of the objective gravity of the offences, or the level of Mr Dean’s culpability in the commission of the offences, to use the language in s  61(1), in a material way those matters would have been dealt with at an earlier point in her Honour’s reasons but it should not be inferred that they were not brought to bear in the instinctive synthesis simply because they were dealt with later and after a conclusion had been expressed that the case fell within the worst category of offences of this kind.
	
	
	Her Honour’s reasons should in this sense be understood as being that, due to the limited weight her Honour placed on the contribution of Mr Dean’s personality and drug addiction disorders to the objective gravity of the offending, they were left to be dealt with later in her Honour’s reasons together with other matters personal to Mr Dean that were taken into account in deciding whether a lesser term was appropriate in the circumstances.
	
	
	Neither aspect of ground 3 is made out in my opinion.
	
	
	I turn then to the remaining two grounds of appeal.
	


Ground 1: Error in concluding it was not possible adequately to reflect the applicant’s culpability by any lesser penalty than life imprisonment


	
	Mr Dean makes the submission that her Honour erred in this conclusion (at [107]) by reference to four matters.
	
	
	First, it is said that her Honour failed properly to consider the extent that Mr Dean foresaw the probable consequences of his actions in lighting the fires; second, that Mr Dean had not intended to occasion death or harm to any resident of the nursing home; third, the significance of his personality disorder and his substance abuse disorder to the assessment of his moral culpability; and, fourth, that her Honour failed properly to consider certain matters that provided further reasons for the conclusion that his culpability was not at a level warranting a sentence of life imprisonment.
	
	
	As to the fourth of those matters, Mr Dean points to the following: his pleas of guilty and facilitation of the course of justice by, among other things, waiving committal proceedings; his prior good character; his difficult background; the strong likelihood that he will find custody more onerous than is usually the case because of the nature of the offence, his homosexuality and effeminate personality; the unlikelihood that he will re-offend by committing serious offences in the future; and that there was some evidence of remorse.
	
	
	The Crown submits that each of the above matters was properly taken into account by her Honour and that the complaints now made about those matters implicitly acknowledge that some consideration or weight was given to them as part of the sentencing exercise. The Crown emphasises that in R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 (at [11]) Spigelman CJ said that questions of weight in the exercise of a discretion are matters for the first instance judge and that circumstances in which matters of weight will justify intervention by an appellate court are narrowly confined.
	
	
	I consider each of the four matters identified by Mr Dean in turn.
	


(i)   Failure properly to consider the extent that Mr Dean foresaw the probable consequences of his actions in lighting fires


	
	It is submitted for Mr Dean that her Honour was in error in concluding (at [101]) that there was no relevant distinction between foresight of a “real chance” of death and foresight of “the probability of death” or the “probable result” in terms of the test for murder by reason of reckless indifference to human life.
	
	
	The Crown’s submissions as to the basis of liability were to the effect that, in order to constitute reckless indifference to human life, the Crown had to prove that the accused foresaw, anticipated or realised the probability of death. In written submissions for the defence the relevant foresight was put as adverting to the “real chance” that a person would die as a consequence of the fires, in language taken from Boughey v The Queen per Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ at [18].
	
	
	However, Mr Game notes that what was put to her Honour was that even within the concept of murder by reckless indifference to human life there were gradations of blameworthiness or culpability contingent upon an assessment of the offender’s foresight of the likelihood that his actions could occasion death. He submits that implicit in that submission was the contention that Mr Dean’s foresight of death being occasioned by his actions was at a lower level than in many other cases of murder by reason of reckless indifference to human life.
	
	
	The statement by her Honour at [101], to which issue is taken by Mr Game, was made in the context that her Honour was addressing a submission by Mr Ierace as to the basis on which Mr Dean’s plea of guilty should be understood. Mr Ierace had informed her Honour that this was on the basis that Mr Dean accepted that, given his experience as a registered nurse and his awareness of the state of health of the nursing home residents, he must have averted at the time he started the fires “to the real chance, possibility, that a person would die as a consequence”. Mr Game notes that this submission was incorrect insofar as it suggested that adverting to a “possibility” of death would amount to recklessness for the offence of murder. However, the reference to foresight of a “possibility” of death seems to have been corrected both in later submissions and in a written note to her Honour sent with the consent of the Crown.
	
	
	Mr Ierace confirmed that the plea was on the basis that Mr Dean acknowledged that there was a “real chance” of death as a result of lighting the fires and that he accepted “effectively in retrospect, having regard to his experience, knowledge and awareness, the conditions of the patients, all those factors being in his mind at the relevant time”.
	
	
	In the memorandum forwarded with the Crown’s consent to her Honour on 19 June 2013, Mr Ierace drew her Honour’s attention, in relation to the question whether for reckless indifference to murder foresight of a real chance of death could be equated with the foresight of a probability of death, to what was said in R v Grant by Woods CJ at CL (with whom Spigelman CJ and Kirby J agreed) namely (at [33]):
	


In order for an accused to be convicted of murder by reckless indifference to human life, the Crown needs to show that he or she knew that the probable result of his or her act (or omission), in this case the act of firing the gun, was to cause the death of another, and knowing of that likelihood (which has to be a substantial or real chance as distinct from a mere possibility) he or she went ahead and did the act regardless: Crabbe v The Queen (1985) 156 CLR 464; and Royall v The Queen (1991) 172 CLR 378; Boughey v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 10 (my emphasis).


	
	Mr Game argues that it was wrong for the Crown to suggest that the level of foresight required was that death was more probable than not. He notes that in Crabbe v The Queen [1985] HCA 22; (1985) 156 CLR 464, the High Court held, in a case involving murder by reckless indifference, that the contrast was between “probable” and “likely” on one hand and “possible” on the other. At [15], it was held that “likely” could mean “a substantial, real (not remote) chance”; at [101], it was said there was no relevant distinction between foresight of a “real chance” of death, the “probability” of death or the “probable result” of death.
	
	
	Mr Game also points to Darkan v The Queen [2006] HCA 34; (2006) 227 CLR 373, where the High Court, when considering the definition of reckless murder in the relevant provision of the Queensland Criminal Code (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Heydon and Crennan JJ) considered that “probable” could be of differing degrees of strength. In that case it was accepted that before it the appropriate meaning was a probability of less than 50/50 but more than a substantial or real and not remote possibility. Their Honours considered that “a probable consequence” was not the same as “a real or substantial possibility or chance”, observing that the expression “a probable consequence” meant that the occurrence of the consequence need not be more probable than not, but must be probable (in the sense that it could well happen) as distinct from possible ([79]).
	
	
	In that regard, the complaint now made for Mr Dean is not, in essence, that her Honour considered (at [101]) that there was no relevant distinction between references to foresight of the “real chance” of death and the “probability of death” or “probable” result but seems rather to be that her Honour did not find that Mr Dean’s foresight as to the probability of death was affected by his intention only to light a “small fire” and to cause a distraction. Mr Games points to her Honour’s use of the indefinite article “the” as opposed to “a” when speaking of probable result at [101] and argues that her Honour was there meaning “more probable than not”, which was incorrect. What her Honour was there doing was distinguishing between culpability involved in foresight of the real chance or probability of death with forming an intention to kill. In that context, the significances sought to be attributed to use of the definite article “the” before the expression “probable result” does not in my opinion do justice to the manner in which her Honour was approaching the submissions that had been made as to what was foreseen by Mr Dean.
	
	
	Mr Game accepts that Mr Dean’s pleas of guilty to the offences of murder involved acceptance that he must have adverted to the “real chance” that a person would die as a consequence of lighting the fires. He submits that what her Honour did was to treat this as meaning he foresaw that death would be more probable than not as a consequence.
	
	
	That to my mind puts a gloss on what her Honour there said. What I read her Honour as saying is that she accepts that Mr Dean foresaw that there was a “real chance” that residents of the nursing home would die (the reference to receipt of serious injuries presumably referring to the grievous bodily harm offences) and that her Honour proceeded on the basis that this meant he foresaw the probability (rather than the mere possibility) of death. Her Honour’s conclusion at [102] was his moral culpability (whether the test of reckless indifference be expressed as foresight of a “real chance” of death or of the “probability” of death), having regard to the reasons earlier given in relation to the objective gravity of the offences is no less than had he had an intention to kill. I do not read the use of the definite article (i.e., “the probable result” in the alternative way in which “probability of death” was expressed) as meaning that her Honour posed a higher test by treating Mr Dean as having foreseen that death would be the more probable than not consequence of the fires.
	
	
	Mr Game also argues that insofar as her Honour concluded (at [64]) that Mr Dean meant to start “a fire of substantial proportions” that would either destroy the incriminating evidence in the treatment room or create sufficient chaos to allow him to gain access to the treatment room in order to remove that evidence, the second alternative (creation of chaos to allow him to gain access to the drug register) was manifestly less serious than creating a fire to destroy the evidence. That, however, appears to conflate motive with foresight as to the likely or probable consequences of his actions. Mr Dean may have intended only to create a fire to cause sufficient chaos to enable him to remove the drug register or evidence of theft, in the hope of evading detection. However, when he lit the fires he must have foreseen (and accepts that he did foresee) that there was a real chance that the death of one or more residents would result from his actions.
	
	
	In this regard, the Crown emphasises the finding, to which there has been no challenge, that Mr Dean’s intention was to start a fire “of substantial proportions”; that Mr Dean lit or attempted to light ‘three’ fires (reference there being to the lighting or attempted lighting of the laundry bag); that Mr Dean deliberately lit the second fire at a time when he was aware that the fire alarms had already been set off and the fire doors had closed, from which it is said it must be inferred that he knew the first fire was substantial enough to have had that result; and that he positively prevented Ms Perry from helping the elderly and immobile residents who were in the room in which the second fire was lit and did nothing thereafter to alert anyone to the existence or seat of the second fire.
	
	
	Her Honour did not in my opinion err in assessing Mr Dean’s level of culpability by reference to his having foreseen that there was a real chance of a number of deaths when he lit the fires.
	


(ii)   That Mr Dean had not intended to occasion death or harm to any resident of the retirement home


	
	Second, Mr Game emphasises that in the present case there was no suggestion that Mr Dean intended to harm or kill anyone and submits that this sets Mr Dean’s conduct apart from all other cases in New South Wales where a natural life sentence has been imposed on conviction of murder by reason of reckless indifference to human life.
	
	
	Her Honour’s attention was drawn by Mr Ierace to R v Reginald Lyttle (Supreme Court (NSW), Newman J, 6 March 1996, unrep), where there was a re-determination of four life sentences for murder that had been imposed in 1976. Mr Lyttle, who had maintained his innocence, but who was found to have lit a fire in a hotel in Kings Cross as a consequence of which 15 residents had died and 22 had suffered burns or smoke inhalation, was re-sentenced (on the basis of felony murder, not murder by reckless indifference to human life) to penal servitude for a minimum term of 28 years and an additional term of life. Mr Lyttle had a history of arson offences, had not intended to harm anyone in the hotel but was not previously of good character. His Honour expressed concern as to his capacity to reoffend.
	
	
	As to the reliance placed on R v Lyttle, the Crown emphasises that that was a felony murder case and that the re-determination of four life sentences which had pre-dated the introduction of the truth in sentencing (“life means life”) terms as well as the standard non-parole period of 20 years for murder.
	
	
	No error is shown in this regard. Her Honour took into account that Mr Dean did not intend to cause death. His level of culpability was assessed by reference to his foresight that there was a real chance of deaths as a result of his actions.
	


(iii)   Significance of the personality disorder/substance abuse


	
	Third, it is submitted that in combination Mr Dean’s personality disorder and poly-substance abuse disorder warranted the conclusion that a lesser sentence than life imprisonment should have been imposed. It is submitted that the personality disorder suffered by Mr Dean was a product of his early life experiences and something outside his control; that the causal link between his conduct and his personality disorder went some way to providing an explanation for his “bizarre decision” to act as he did; and that his substance abuse disorder to some extent impacted on the quality of his decision-making.
	
	
	As to the import of Mr Dean’s personality disorder, reference is made to Dr Diamond’s opinion that the early causation of a personality disorder of that nature is “largely about early life experiences” and that, when asked as to whether the early impact on his personality development was that those traits became entrenched in his personality, Dr Diamond said that:
	


a personality disorder is really a diagnosis that one makes because it is entrenched. It is a long term, non-shifting set of characteristics that emanate from long term experiences and they are not reactive to a set of circumstances. They are pervasive and they accompany the person throughout their life experience as a prevailing and present state of their nature.


	
	As to the causal link between his personality disorder and the decision-making, Dr Diamond gave evidence to the effect that: an adjustment disorder such as narcissistic personality disorder is a reactive state to an external event which might make a person miserable or upset or anxious but that it is usually a time limited reaction; there was no impairment to Mr Dean’s capacity to foresee the probability of death when he lit the fires - rather, it was to do with putting his needs above others; that Mr Dean had been conducting himself towards others with a belief that he could carry out his behaviours with impunity, including an elaborate system of “doctor shopping”, and that his behaviour in the offences continued that process of him deceiving people in the strong expectation that he would “get away with it”.
	
	
	Dr Diamond was not convinced there was any psychiatric illness or significant lack of capacity. Rather, he considered there was a terrible focus by Mr Dean on Mr Dean’s own needs at that time and that Mr Dean took this further by lighting the second fire. Dr Diamond’s initial understanding (based on what Mr Dean had told him) was that the second fire was lit because the first fire was believed not to have been significant. Dr Diamond said that if the alarm and the smoke were happening at the time the second fire was lit (which was the case) then to light a second fire made his view of Mr Dean’s behaviour worse in terms of his “potentially fatal effect and the people who were in that room”.
	
	
	Mr Game also refers to the evidence from Dr Diamond that the substance abuse disorder to some extent impacted on the quality of his decision-making. In cross-examination, Dr Diamond agreed with the proposition that the quality of Mr Dean’s decision-making on the night of the fire might have been affected by his drug use, not in a sense as to deprive him of an awareness of the consequences but, rather, so as to impair the quality of his decision-making. Nevertheless, I note that Dr Diamond went on to say that he could not give a firm opinion as to the extent to which the choices Mr Dean had made could be a consequence of his drug use.
	
	
	Her Honour accepted (at [91]) that there was a causal connection between the offending and Mr Dean’s psychiatric condition (that being the underlying personality disorder that Dr Diamond concluded had impaired his decision-making). Her Honour expressly considered whether and to what extent that disorder affected the exercise of the sentencing discretion.
	
	
	At [99], her Honour identified the relevant causal connection as being the dominance of Mr Dean’s own immediate needs over the needs of anyone else, even if they included vulnerable patients under his charge. Her Honour concluded that the “relatively limited impairment, particularly when considered against the scale of the offender’s reckless indifference, the enormity of the harm which resulted and the objective criminality of the offender’s conduct” carried limited weight in reducing Mr Dean’s culpability to any material degree and did not render him an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence ([100]).
	
	
	As to the poly-substance abuse, her Honour was clearly cognisant of the fact that Mr Dean’s motive in lighting the fires was to evade detection of the theft of the drugs. Her Honour accepted the diagnosis of poly-substance abuse disorder. Her Honour nevertheless concluded that Mr Dean had not ingested drugs that relevantly affected his capacity to form judgments and make calculated decisions. The evidence supported those conclusions. The complaint now made is in effect that her Honour should have concluded that Mr Dean’s culpability was reduced by reference to the impact of the poly-substance drug abuse on the quality or logicality of the decisions that he made on that night. Dr Diamond was not, however, able to quantify any such impact. Dr Diamond in effect concluded, and it was open to her Honour to accept, that the most relevant impact on Mr Dean’s decision-making was his narcissistic personality and belief that he could get away with stealing the drugs.
	
	
	Her Honour took into consideration the matters the subject of this aspect of the appeal. No error is revealed in her Honour’s treatment of the evidence in relation to those matters.
	


(iv)   Other reasons for the conclusion that culpability was not at a level warranting life imprisonment


	
	In this context, Mr Dean refers to the matters I have noted above (at [115]).
	
	
	Her Honour referred to the late entry of the pleas of guilty (at [111]). It cannot be (and was not) suggested that her Honour did not have in mind the fact that Mr Dean had pleaded guilty and that this had had utilitarian value. Her Honour nevertheless observed that the pleas indicated a realisation on Mr Dean’s part that there was overwhelming and damning evidence of his reckless indifference whilst in a lucid and rational state, rather than any significant degree of remorse. Her Honour’s comments must be read as indicating that little weight was put on this in circumstances where the plea of guilty did not evince any significant degree of remorse. It was a matter for her Honour what weight should be put on the value of the guilty plea in circumstances where her Honour’s conclusion was that the level of culpability in Mr Dean’s offending was one that could not be reflected in a lesser sentence than life imprisonment.
	
	
	As to the other matters relevant to the facilitation of justice, her Honour had noted, when referring to the police interview and ERISP (the electronically recorded police interview), that Mr Dean had (albeit not when first questioned by the police) ultimately acknowledged responsibility for the fires. Similarly, although her Honour did not expressly refer to the facts that: Mr Dean had waived the right to a committal proceeding, had acknowledged responsibility for the deaths of the eleven residents on arraignment when he offered to plead guilty to manslaughter and had ultimately not contested any of the alleged offences; those were matters leading to the entry of the guilty pleas and, consistent with her Honour’s view on that aspect of the matter, can be assumed to have been accorded little weight by her Honour. There is no error there revealed.
	
	
	Her Honour expressly had regard to the fact that Mr Dean lacked a criminal history ([74]; [112]) and to his difficult background ([70]-[71]). Her Honour accepted that his treatment in custody, principally at the hands of other inmates, had been degrading and distressing to Mr Dean ([112]), though her Honour anticipated that there would be some improvement in his custodial conditions following his classification and by the passage of time. Thus her Honour took into account that Mr Dean had faced (and implicitly might continue to face) difficulty in custody. Although her Honour did not directly attribute this to Mr Dean’s homosexuality and effeminate personality, she had earlier recognised the difficulty that Mr Dean’s homosexuality had caused in his relationship with his mother and with others during his schooling ([71]) and it may be inferred that this was one of the matters that may have led to the treatment in custody of which her Honour was made aware.
	
	
	Her Honour, having noted that Mr Dean’s rehabilitation prospects were speculative (in the sense that his underlying personality would not change), and having noted Dr Diamond’s evidence that persons with a personality disorder do not do so well in an uncontrolled environment where they are free to manipulate others, was nevertheless satisfied that Mr Dean was not at risk of committing serious offences in the future ([110]) and hence took that factor into account.
	
	
	Finally, her Honour expressly addressed the question of the depth of Mr Dean’s remorse (at [109]), which she considered was difficult to gauge principally because Mr Dean’s capacity for insight into his offending was compromised by his personality disorder. Her Honour did not suggest that there was no evidence of remorse; rather she appears to have concluded that there was no significant degree of remorse. That conclusion was not shown to have been in error.
	
	
	The fourth of the “reasons” relied upon for ground 1 is therefore not made good.
	


Ground 2 - the sentences imposed are manifestly excessive


	
	The same submissions are relied upon in support of this ground as were relied upon in support of ground 1.
	
	
	To demonstrate that a sentence is manifestly excessive, it must be shown that it was unreasonable or plainly unjust (Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325; affirmed in Vuni v R [2006] NSWCCA 171 at [33]). As the Crown notes, the task of an applicant relying upon such ground has recently been recognised as being a difficult one (Tuivaga v R [2015] NSWCCA 145 at [44]).
	
	
	It is submitted for Mr Dean that if this ground succeeds it would be open to the Court to impose a total term of very great length that falls short of a natural life sentence and that in such circumstances a non-parole period also of very substantial length would provide Mr Dean with some hope of release.
	
	
	The submission for the Crown on sentencing as to the objective seriousness of this case emphasised the number of murder convictions, the number of grievous bodily harm convictions, the vulnerability of the deceased residents and the grievous bodily harm victims, the position of trust of Mr Dean (who was in a position of professional responsibility) and his motive (to cover up the commission of another serious crime).
	
	
	Having regard to those matters, and particularly the position of vulnerability in which the elderly high care residents were placed, the abuse by Mr Dean of the position of trust that he occupied, and his deliberate actions in not taking steps to alert fire brigade officers to the second fire or to assist in any way at all the immobile residents in the room in which that fire was lit to escape, it cannot be said that the life sentences imposed on him were unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	


Conclusion


	
	For the above reasons I would grant leave to appeal and dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	ADAMS J: I agree with Ward JA.
	
	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Ward JA.

		04 December 2015",2015-12-03 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2702345,Isika v R [2015] NSWCCA 304,"Judgment


	
	MACFARLAN JA: Following a trial in June 2014 in the District Court before a judge and jury, the appellant was convicted of an offence, contrary to s 61L of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), of one count of assaulting the complainant (and at the time also committing an act of indecency) and of one count of an offence, contrary to s 61N(2) of the Crimes Act, of committing an act of indecency towards the same complainant. The Indictment alleged that those offences occurred between 25 and 26 January 2010. The appellant was acquitted of three other charges which concerned acts of a sexual nature alleged to have been committed on 16 January 2010 in relation to the same complainant.
	
	
	The appellant’s first ground of appeal asserts that “[a] miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the trial judge’s direction to the jury in response to a question from the jury” whilst it was considering its verdict. The question was what would happen if the jury members could not agree.
	
	
	The second ground of appeal asserts that “[t]he convictions were unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence” as they were “inconsistent with the verdicts returned in relation to the remaining counts.”
	
	
	At the hearing in this Court, the appellant’s senior counsel conceded that the appellant’s success on the second ground would entitle him to a new trial but not to an acquittal (see R v TK [2009] NSWCCA 151; 74 NSWLR 299 at [137]). As a result, she accepted that if the appellant succeeded on the first ground (and thereby obtained an order for a new trial), it would be unnecessary for this Court to deal with the second ground.
	
	
	For the reasons given below, the appellant succeeds on his first ground of appeal. As a result, his convictions should be quashed and a new trial ordered. To address the second ground, it would be necessary to examine the evidence given at the trial in some detail. As there is to be a new trial by reason of the success of the first ground, it would be undesirable for this Court to express any view about that evidence unless it was necessary for it to do so. As that is not necessary, I shall not address the second ground.
	


The jury’s question and the trial judge’s response


	
	The jury retired to consider its verdict at 12:22pm on 17 June 2014. At 4:10pm it sent a note to the trial judge asking six questions, the first five of which are presently irrelevant. The sixth question was: “[w]hat happens if we cannot agree?”. The trial judge’s response to the jury was:
	


“Now finally you ask ‘What happens if we cannot agree?” Well the answer to that is that I will tell you to go away and try harder, so take it from me that you will be encouraged to go away and think more deeply and consider each other’s views more deeply if you believe that you are deadlocked because these trials are very costly to run and very time consuming and if I had to discharge you it would mean we would all have to go through the whole process again” (Summing-Up p 32).


	
	The trial judge then excused the jury for the day. It reconvened at 9:55am the next day and continued deliberations until 11:42am, at which time it returned verdicts of not guilty on three of the counts in the Indictment and guilty on two counts (see [1] above).
	


DETERMINATION OF THE APPEAL

Whether the judge’s response placed undue pressure on the jury


	
	The appellant’s oral argument on the appeal focused on the question of whether the judge’s response to the jury placed undue pressure on it to reach verdicts and was therefore apt to encourage its members to compromise their views in order to achieve agreed verdicts, contrary to the principles stated in Black v R [1993] HCA 71; 179 CLR 44.
	
	
	In Black v R  the trial judge’s directions to the jury included the following:
	


“…Each of you has individually taken an oath to return a true verdict according to the evidence. As I told you in my summing-up, you are equal in your task, but nevertheless you have a duty, not only as individuals but also collectively. No one of you should be false to the oath you took but in order to return a collective verdict, a verdict of you all, there must necessarily be discussion and argument and a certain amount of give and take and adjustment within the scope of that oath.

It makes for considerable public inconvenience and expense if a jury cannot agree and it is most unfortunate indeed if such a failure to agree is due to some unwillingness on the part of one or more members of the jury to listen to and consider the arguments of the rest of the jury. It is very desirable that you should come to a conclusion one way or the other, because if you don’t, it will mean that some jury will have to later seek to do what you have been chosen to do. That would be a considerable hardship on all concerned with the case, including the accused and the various witnesses and if possible, should be avoided” (at 47).


	
	The plurality in that case referred to a form of direction approved by the English Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Walhein (1952) 36 Cr App R 167 which spoke of the need for “a certain amount of give and take and adjustment of views within the scope of the oath [the jury members] have taken” and the “great public inconvenience and expense if jurors cannot agree” (at 168). The plurality in Black v R agreed with Cooke P’s criticism in R v Accused (1988) 2 NZLR 46; 3 CRNZ 301 of the reference in R v Walhein to “great public inconvenience and expense”, Cooke P having said that “[i]nconvenience and expense should not be measured against justice” (at 58). The plurality continued:
	


“We agree with this criticism of the Walhein direction, and the criticism has equal application to the instructions given by the trial judge in the present case. More importantly, the reference to ‘considerable public inconvenience’ is apt to impose pressure upon individual jurors to join in the view taken by a majority, thereby violating the fundamental principle that the jury must be free to deliberate without any pressure being brought to bear upon them. The statement that ‘there must necessarily be … a certain amount of give and take and adjustment’ might be taken to suggest, wrongly in our view, that a juror is to compromise with other jurors in reaching a verdict.

Moreover, the earlier reference to the jury having a ‘duty, not only as individuals but also collectively’ may well have had the effect of reinforcing the impression that the jury were under some obligation to reach a result to which all the members of the jury subscribed. Jurors do have a responsibility to act collectively but only in the sense that individual jurors should participate in the collective consideration and discussion of issues in the jury room. There is a risk that references to a collective responsibility or duty may be understood more broadly by the jury and as an invitation to an individual juror to subordinate his or her views to those of a majority of jurors. Consequently references to ‘give and take and adjustment’ and collective duty or responsibility should be avoided” (at 50 and 51, citation omitted).


	
	Their Honours held that the direction in the case before them was erroneous and “may well have resulted in the jury failing to give the issues that free deliberation to which both the accused and the Crown were entitled” (at 51). Their Honours then set forth a form of direction which has since been adopted as the standard direction to be given when juries indicate that their members cannot agree (see 51).
	
	
	Deane J agreed with the plurality and added that there was:
	


“ … a real danger that [the directions] might have been misunderstood by a minority juror, particularly one who had been under pressure in the jury room from a majority, as inviting a democratic submission to the views of the majority in order ‘to return a collective verdict’” (at 56).


	
	Later, his Honour said that “[a]ny suggestion that a minority juror should democratically submit to the view of the majority is antithetical to the jury process under the common law of this country” and that it is essential that:
	


“… a direction requiring the jury to continue its deliberations carefully avoids anything at all that might be misunderstood as encouraging a minority juror to join in returning a ‘collective verdict’ which does not completely accord with his or her own genuine views” (ibid).


	
	Arguably, the time had not yet arrived in the present case for the trial judge to give a Black direction to the jury as the jury had not indicated that it could not agree, although there was an obvious implication in its question that there was a prospect of that occurring. Nevertheless, a response to the jury’s question along the lines of the standard Black direction would have been appropriate and of assistance to the jury in progressing its deliberations.
	
	
	The first part of the response that the judge in fact gave (that is up to the word “deadlocked”) was unobjectionable but what followed was objectionable. As I have indicated, the High Court in Black v R specifically disapproved of the reference by the trial judge in that case to “public inconvenience and expense” as likely to put undue pressure upon the jury to reach a verdict. The trial judge’s statement in the present case that “we would all have to go through the whole process again” compounded his Honour’s error as it increased the pressure on the jury and arguably implied that jury members would not be performing their duties if they did not agree on verdicts. This was “apt to impose pressure upon individual jurors to join in the view taken by a majority” (Black v R, at 50).
	


Whether leave is required


	
	The trial judge’s response to the relevant question from the jury in my view amounted to at least an implicit “direction” within the meaning of that word in r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW). As the appellant did not object to the “direction” at the trial, the appellant requires leave to rely upon his ground of appeal challenging it. Notwithstanding this Court’s reluctance to allow new points to be raised on appeal (see for example ARS v R [2011] NSWCCA 266 at [148]), leave should be granted because in my view the error was of such a fundamental character and occurred at such a critical stage in the jury’s deliberations that the appellant has established that he “lost a real chance” of being acquitted (ibid). As stated in Timbery v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 355; 180 A Crim R 232, “[d]irections as to how a verdict is to be reached are of the essence of a fair trial” (at [123]). Accordingly, the Court concluded in that case that a miscarriage of justice had occurred as a result of directions being given in contravention of the principles stated in Black v R and a new trial was warranted.
	
	
	The significance of the error in the present case is accentuated by the fact that here, in contrast to the position in Black v R, the jury had to consider multiple counts and returned verdicts of guilty on some and verdicts of not guilty on others. Although there are arguably explanations for the different verdicts to be found in the evidence, the possibility that, in response to the trial judge’s direction, some jurors compromised their views in order to reach collective verdicts is a real one.
	
	
	The same reasoning leads to the conclusion that the “proviso” to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) is inapplicable: the Court is unable to conclude that “no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred”.
	


ORDERS


	
	For the reasons I have given above, the following orders should be made:
	



	
	That the appellant’s convictions on counts four and five charged in the Indictment issued in June 2014 by the Director of Public Prosecutions be quashed.
	
	
	That there be a new trial on those counts.
	



	
	HALL J: I agree with Macfarlan JA.
	
	
	BELLEW J: I agree with Macfarlan JA.

2702352,DPP (Cth) v CHENG [2015] NSWDC 326,"Judgment

ON ‘NO CASE TO ANSWER’ APPLICATION

Introduction


	
	Benny Zhong Cheng (‘the accused’) is on trial in relation to one offence against s (or ss) 400.3 Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (‘the Code’).He was arraigned on Wednesday 2 December 2015 and the prosecution’s case formally closed on Friday 4 December. Application has been made by the accused for a verdict of not guilty by direction at the conclusion of the Crown case. The accused submits that on the evidence the Crown cannot establish the guilt of the accused. The prosecution opposes the application. The Court has been favoured with written submissions by both defence and prosecution, supplemented by oral submissions.
	


The charge brought against the accused


	
	The accused has been charged that he:
	


Between about 27 May 2012 and 17 July 2012 at Sydney did deal with money or other property intending that the money or other property will become an instrument of crime and at the time of the dealing the value of the money or other property was $1,000,000 or more.


	
	The Crown, applying the requirements of the Code and the definitions, submits that the elements of an offence brought pursuant to s 400.3 (1) (b) (ii) Commonwealth Criminal Code, identifying ‘conduct’ and ‘fault’ elements, in this matter are as follows:
	


(a)   The accused dealt with money in that he possessed it, (conduct)

Fault:   intending that the money will become an instrument of crime (ss 400.3 (1)(b)(ii))

(b)   At the time of the dealing the value of the money was $1,000,000 or more (circumstance)

Fault: Absolute liability: Sub-s 400.3(4)

(c)   The money or property could become an instrument of crime in relation to a Commonwealth offence (circumstance) (s 400.2A(3))

Fault:   Absolute liability (s 400.2A(5))


	
	The prosecution submits that the only fault element the jury has to consider is that which applies to the first element of the offence as outlined in 1(a) above. The accused does not dispute the above analysis of the ‘structure’ of the count.
	


The character of the Crown case


	
	The prosecution case is essentially set out in a statement of ‘Agreed Facts’ (Exhibit A) supplemented by some oral evidence from investigators and an employee of a registered money remitter and reporting entity as defined in the Anti- Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Act 2006.
	
	
	It is not disputed in the Agreed Facts that the accused on 11 separate occasions between 28 May 2012 and 16 July 2012 the accused approached 3 ‘money remitters’ at Ashfield (Sun Capital), Eastwood and Haymarket (DS Finance – different branches of the same corporation or business). On each occasion he produced a quantity of cash ranging from AU$60,000 to AU$159,800, usually (on 8 occasions) producing the sum of AU$100,000, requesting an employee of the relevant ‘remitter’ to remit the particular amount to an account in China. On 4 different dates 2 transactions were conducted. A total of AU$1,098,066 was remitted to accounts in China.
	
	
	On the first occasion he approached each business location he produced a NSW driver licence in the name of ‘Nick Wang’, with an address in Miranda and a birthdate of 2 September 1965. The licence had the photograph of the accused on it. The accused did not reside at the Miranda address and his birthdate is not 2 September 1965. According to NSW records his date of birth is 5 August 1964. The licence is a ‘forgery’ or a ‘fake’. Its ‘customer number’ is that of another person altogether living in Wentworthville and no person called Nick Wang exists on Transport Department records with the same birthdate and address as on the licence the accused produced on a number of occasions. The accused on each of these 3 occasions supplied a mobile phone number registered in another person’s name.
	
	
	On 5 out of 6 occasions the accused went to the Ashfield business he was asked to produce a form of identification (the driver licence) and he was compared in appearance with the photo on the licence. On the 6th occasion having recognized the accused from previous transactions ‘the employee was satisfied that the accused was the holder of a NSW driver licence in the name of Nick Wang bearing the image of the accused. At Eastwood he produced the licence the first time which was then photocopied. Thereinafter he was compared to the copy of the licence on file the following 2 occasions he attended that location. At Haymarket on the first occasion he produced the licence and it was matched to his physical appearance and the copy of the licence on ‘file’ (apparently from the Eastwood branch) and on the second occasion the same process was undertaken. On each occasion the relevant business’ paperwork was completed, the sum converted to Chinese currency (RMB) for deposit in the Chinese account number supplied by the accused. The accused signed in the name ‘Nick Wang’ either a ‘Remittance Application Form’, referred to in the Crown submissions as an ‘invoice’, (for the Ashfield transactions) or an ‘RMB TT Form’ or a ‘Foreign Exchange Record’ record ( sic) at the Eastwood and Haymarket locations.
	
	
	The respective businesses were “reporting entities” and “registered money remitters” pursuant to relevant legislation referred to later.
	
	
	The ‘Nick Wang’ licence was recovered by police from a residence occupied by the accused’s ex-wife and his children that the accused regularly attended and where he was arrested on 27 September. His passport was found by police in that residence during a search of it in July 2012.
	
	
	Section 400.3(1) of the Code provides (and provided at the relevant time):
	



	
	A person is guilty of an offence if:
	



	
	the person deals with money or other property; and
	
	
	either:
	



	
	the money or property is, and the person believes it to be, proceeds of crime; or
	
	
	the person intends that the money or property will become an instrument of crime; and
	



	
	at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $1,000,000 or more.
	



	
	Penalty: Imprisonment for 25 years, or 1500 penalty units, or both.
	
	
	Section 400.2 provides a definition of “deals with money or other property” in the following terms:
	


A person deals with money or other property if the person does any of the following:


	
	receives, possesses, conceals or disposes of money or other property;
	
	
	imports money or other property into Australia;
	
	
	exports money or other property from Australia;
	
	
	engages in a banking transaction relating to money or other property.
	



	
	The prosecution particularise the dealing in this case as the ‘possession’ of the money used for the currency transactions and the remittal of those amounts to the accounts in China.
	
	
	An “instrument of crime” is (and was at the relevant time) defined by s 400.1 as follows:
	


“money or other property is an instrument of crime if it is used in the commission of, or used to facilitate the commission of, an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or a foreign country that may be dealt with as an indictable offence (even if it may, in some circumstances, be dealt with as a summary offence).”


	
	The particular ‘offence’ alleged here that the money was ‘used’ in the commission of, or ‘used to facilitate’ the commission of, is an offence contrary to s 140 Anti-Money and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth), the ‘AML Act’.
	


That section provides that


	
	A person commits an offence if:
	



	
	The person commences to receive a designated service; and
	
	
	The person does so using a false customer name; and
	
	
	at least one provision of Division 2, 3, or 4 of Part 2 (of the Act) applies to the provision of the designated service.
	



	
	Strict liability applies to the paragraph(1)(c) of the offence (see section 6.1 of the Criminal Code)
	



	
	The relevant ‘provision of a designated service’ for the purposes of s 140(1)(c) is that of ‘a non-financier carrying on a business of giving effect to remittance arrangements accepting an instruction from a transferor entity (‘the customer’/ accused) for the transfer of money under a designated remittance arrangement’ (s 6, “Item 31” AML Act). For the definition of ‘designated remittance arrangement’ and ‘transferor entity’ see s 10 AML Act. For the definition of ‘commence‘ and ‘receive’ a ‘designated service’ see s 5 AML Act.
	


The accused’s submissions


	
	It is submitted on behalf of the accused that the definition of “ instrument of crime” requires the money in the possession of the accused to be used in the commission of, or used to facilitate the commission of some other offence (‘the postulated future offence’ or ‘intended offence’).
	
	
	It is submitted that it is not alleged that the money the subject of the charge was (and was believed to be) the proceeds of crime; rather, it is alleged that the accused dealt with (possessed) the money, and at the time of the dealing he intended the money would become an instrument of crime.
	
	
	Further, it is submitted that it is not the prosecution case that the accused intended that the money the subject of the charge would be used in the commission of a future offence by the person or persons who were to receive the money, such as tax evasion, drug trafficking or terrorism. As far as is known, the recipient(s) could have used the money transmitted for completely legitimate purposes.
	
	
	The accused understands, as the Crown made clear in its submissions, that the prosecution relies on an intention on the part of the accused to use the money “in the commission of” the offence against s 140(1), or in the alternative an intention to use the money “to facilitate the commission of” the offence against s 140(1) of the AML Act.
	
	
	Reference was made to the second reading speech of the then Attorney-General The Hon Daryl Williams MP who said:
	


“The bill will amend the Criminal Code to insert new money laundering offences replacing those in the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 with updated provisions based on the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission. The bill proposes a series of new offences graded according both to the level of knowledge required of the offender and the value of the property involved in the dealing constituting the laundering. These new offences will permit prosecutors to more accurately reflect the level of culpability of the offender in the charges they prefer and courts will be provided with a greater degree of guidance in their sentencing. The regime includes alternative verdict provisions so that where a court is satisfied that the person is not guilty of the offence charged but is guilty of another money laundering offence which carries a lesser penalty the person can be convicted of that lesser offence consistent with the rules of procedural fairness. The upper limit of the penalties will be increased from 20 to 25 years imprisonment. The scope of the offence has been expanded to include exports as well as imports of money and other property, money laundering in relation to some state and territory offences which have relevance to the Commonwealth, and where the money or property is an instrument of crime used to facilitate criminal activity, such as occurred in the lead-up to the recent terrorist attacks.”


	
	Counsel for the accused provided relevant portions of the revised Explanatory Memorandum referred to in the Second Reading Speech referred to in Milne v The Queen, (2014) 252 CLR 149.
	
	
	It is submitted that the construction of the scope of s 400.3 contended for by the prosecution rendered an accused liable to imprisonment for twenty-five years, despite an absence of any intention that the intended recipient make use of the transmitted funds for any criminal purpose. Reference was made to Milne where the scope of section 400.3 was considered at [38] – [40]. At [38] the Court rejected the proposition that a broad construction of the provision allowed the facts of that case to fall within the scope of the provision:
	


“Section 400.3(1) creates a serious offence. It is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 25 years. In the end the ""broad construction"" proffered by the respondent seemed to involve little more than the proposition that, however construed, it fits the facts of this case. As a matter of textual analysis, it does not. Purposive construction does not justify expanding the scope of a criminal offence beyond its textual limits. In this case, those limits are not narrowly defined. The language of s 400.3(1)(b)(ii), and its associated definitions, is capable of application to a range of circumstances which fall within their ordinary meanings. Its construction according to the ordinary meaning of its words is sufficient to provide a broad coverage consistent with its purpose and without resort to ""extended"" meanings of those words.”


	
	It is submitted that the structure of ss 400.1–400.16 Criminal Code Act reveals an intention of the Commonwealth Parliament to criminalise conduct involving the transmission of more than $1,000,000 in various ways. S 400.3 (1)–(3) identifies various mental states on the part of an accused: intention, recklessness and negligence as to whether the money to be transmitted is the proceeds of crime or will (or may) become an instrument of crime.
	
	
	It is submitted that the penalties are tied to the conclusion as to the sender’s mental state and vary enormously: from twenty-five years when the sender intends the money will become an instrument of crime down to five years when the sender is negligent about the issue.
	
	
	It is submitted in this case that the Crown does not assert that the accused had any belief at all as to the use to be made of the transmitted funds. Instead, a technical and unsatisfactory legal construct is relied on, in circumstances where the Commonwealth Parliament has enacted other offences that carry far lower maximum penalties that address and punish the criminal conduct allegedly engaged in by the accused. A variety of other offences were created to address circumstances where an offender’s culpability was at a lower level. S 400.9 entirely encompasses the accused’s alleged conduct, yet the maximum penalty for a breach of s 400.9 is three years imprisonment (Shi v R [2014] NSWCCA 276 (at [41]-[46]).
	
	
	It is conceded that “there can be no doubt that the prosecution case is capable of establishing that the accused repeatedly transmitted money overseas using a false identity”. Sections 136, 137 and 140 of the AML Act all address aspects of the accused’s alleged criminal conduct. The existence of these more appropriate penalty provisions also does not support the prosecution contention that the scope of s 400.3 extends to the alleged conduct of the accused (Chen v DPP (Cth) [2011] NSWCCA 205, per Garling J, at [80]-[87].
	
	
	The breach of s 140 of the AML Act carries a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment. The terms of the provision encapsulate the actual conduct of the accused on at least a number of the occasions when he caused the money to be transmitted overseas.
	
	
	It is submitted that the central issue in this trial is that of the accused’s intention: did he intend that the money would become an instrument of crime? In the circumstances of this case it is submitted that question can only answered by a consideration of the accused’s understanding of why the money was being transmitted to China and what the money was to be used for by the person or persons who were to receive it. There is no evidence at all that when the accused sent the money overseas he intended that the money would become an instrument of crime. The evidence in the case cannot establish this element in s 400.3 Criminal Code Act 1995. It is for this reason that it is submitted that a directed verdict is the appropriate disposition of the proceedings.
	
	
	Connected to the primary submission it is also submitted that the prosecution case must fail because there was no relevant intended “use” of the money with respect to the offence against s 140(1) so as to make the money an instrument of crime.
	
	
	In the event that the Court concluded that the scope of s 400.3 does extend to a circumstance where the Crown neither asserts that the money transmitted overseas was the proceeds of crime, nor that the money transmitted overseas was to be used to commit a crime in the future, it is submitted that the evidence in the prosecution case still does not establish that the accused intended that the money would “become an instrument of crime”. It is submitted that the offence against s 400.3(1)(b)(ii) requires proof that the accused intended that the money “will become an instrument of crime”. Applying the definition of “instrument of crime” in s 400.1, proof is required that, at the time of the dealing the accused intended that the money will be “used in the commission of, or used to facilitate the commission of” a particular type of offence.
	
	
	It is not accepted by the accused that there is evidence of an intention to “use” the money in the commission of the s 140 offence, or to facilitate the commission of a s 140 offence. Reference is made to the importance of the word “use” in the definition of “instrument of crime” was central to the High Court’s decision in Milne v The Queen [2014] HCA 4; 252 CLR 149. The High Court said, at [33]:
	


“For property to become an instrument of crime within the meaning of s 400.3(1) it must be ""used"". An ordinary meaning of the verb ""use"" is ""[t]o make use of (some immaterial thing) as a means or instrument; to employ for a certain end or purpose."" That is the relevant ordinary meaning for the definition of ""become an instrument of crime"" which involves the ""use"" of property to serve a purpose, namely the ""commission of an offence"" or ""to facilitate the commission of an offence"". The relevant ordinary meaning of ""facilitate"" in this case is ""[t]o render easier the performance of (an action), the attainment of (a result); to afford facilities for, promote, help forward (an action or process).""


	
	The prosecution case is that the “use” must be “in the commission of” or “to facilitate the commission of”, in this case, the offence against s 140(1) of the AML Act.
	
	
	Counsel for the accused referred to submissions made by the Crown at the committal proceedings that attempted to set out the relationship between the offence against s 140(1) and the “use” of the money in the commission of the offence.
	


“In this instance the Crown submits there was an instrumental connection between the money and the intended offence because the Accused in each of the thirteen remittances intended to physically give the money to a member of the business staff with a request that the money be transferred. In order to receive the designated service, in the way in which he intended, the Accused had to provide the money to the remittance service. Had the Accused not been able to provide the money to the remittance service on his attendance, the designated service would not have been able to have been provided.”


	
	It can be seen from the above that the culmination of the reasoning is no more than a statement that the relevant dealing (the possession of the money) was simply a “necessary condition of the commission of [the] subsequent offence”.
	
	
	It is submitted that to more fully understand the problem, is necessary to return to the definition of “use” as discussed in Milne, at [33]. There, their Honours observed, the relevant use, “involves the ‘use’ of property to serve a purpose, namely the ""commission of an offence"" (emphasis added). The accused’s purpose, or objective, on the Crown case was not to operate an account in a false name. Rather it was to transfer the money. Put another way, it can be said the accused used an account in a false name to transfer the money. He did not, however, “use” the money to serve the purpose of operating an account in a false name. In the former case, the use of the account has an instrumental connection with the transfer of the money – it served the relevant purpose. In the latter case, the money did not serve the purpose of operating the account in a false name. Rather it was no more than a necessary condition of the commission of that offence.
	
	
	The evidence of Mr Ge was that the process of ascertaining the identity of the prospective customer preceded the steps that related to the transmission of the money.
	
	
	The conduct involved in an offence contrary to s 140(1) is not the handing over or payment of the money to be transferred. It is the acceptance of an instruction to transfer money. The offence may be committed whether or not a person giving an instruction to transfer money actually has any money in their possession. Being in possession of the money is not even a necessary condition of the commission of any offence under s 140(1) since no money need be handed over for the conduct element of the offence to be complete.
	
	
	The present situation is submitted to be relevantly indistinguishable from that in Milne. There, the dealing was the disposal of shares. The intention in disposing of the shares was to make a gain. Mr Milne also had, at the time he disposed of the shares, an intention to not declare the capital gain in the relevant tax return. The future offence (the capital gains tax offence) was therefore predicated on, and motivated by, the relevant dealing (the sale). The capital gains tax offence could not be committed without the sale of the shares. This however, was not a “use” of the shares to commit the capital gains tax offence (despite the necessary connection between the two). The sale of the shares served the purpose of realising a gain. It did not serve any purpose with respect to the commission of the capital gains tax offence. In relation to that offence it was no more than a necessary condition.
	
	
	Thus, while the desire to transfer the money in a false name may have required the accused to utilise a document (the fake drivers licence) (contrary to s 137 of the AML Act) to obtain a service in a false name (contrary to s 140(1) of the AML Act) this was not a use of the money for the purposes of s 400.3.
	
	
	The possession of money which it is intended to transfer under a false name was no more than ""a necessary condition of the commission of [the] subsequent offence” and “does not on that account amount to the use of the property in or to facilitate the commission of that offence” (Milne at [37]). Thus, the money in the present case was not “used in the commission of” or “render(ed) easier” the commission of the relevant offence.
	
	
	An intention for money to become an instrument of a particular crime involves an intention that someone use the money in, or to facilitate the engaging in, conduct (including requisite mental elements) which amounts to the crime. If money cannot be an instrument of a particular crime, there can be no intention for money to become an instrument of it. If money is incapable of becoming an instrument of an offence against s 140(1) of the AML Act then the Crown case alleging a breach of s 400.3(1) is deficient, as it cannot prove an element of that offence.
	
	
	Ultimately, as it was submitted orally, the accused did not have to use the money to commit an offence contrary to s 140(1) AML Act , the use of money was not necessary to commit the offence. The accused’s use of his false identification ie. driver licence (or use of a false name) was the nub of the offence, which is more consistent with the legislative purpose of the Division of the Commonwealth Criminal Code. Thus, there was not the relevant ‘instrumental connection‘ required to be established.
	
	
	An alternative submission was that there was no offence against s 140(1) of the AML Act, as particularised, capable of being established by the evidence other than in incidents 1, 2 and 6 as set out in the Agreed Facts, and thus the total of the transactions do not exceed AU$1 million.
	
	
	It is submitted that the prosecution case proceeds on an assumption that the evidence establishes an offence against s 140(1) of the AML Act with respect to each incident. On that basis, each part of the money (totalling more than the $1,000,000 required for the offence against s 400.3 of the Code), is on the Crown argument, involved in the offences against s 140(1) of the AML Act.
	
	
	The assumption that the evidence is capable of establishing an offence against s 140(1) in each case is ‘flawed’ it is submitted by counsel for the accused.
	
	
	It is understood by the defence that so far as the issue of ‘commencing to receive a designated service’ is concerned the prosecution particularises the relevant provision applying as s 32 of the AML Act (which is in Division 4 of Part 2 of the Act). Section 32 provides:
	



	
	A reporting entity must not commence to provide a designated service to a customer if:
	



	
	there are no special circumstances that justify carrying out the applicable customer identification procedure in respect of the customer after the commencement of the provision of the service (see s 33); and
	
	
	the reporting entity has not previously carried out the applicable customer identification procedure in respect of the customer; and
	
	
	neither s 28 nor s  30 applies to the provision of the service.
	



	
	Reference is made to the definition of commence to provide a designated service in s 5 and s 38 of the Act (when applicable customer identification procedure deemed to be carried out by a reporting entity).
	
	
	It is submitted that putting to one side, for present purposes, (1)(a) and (1)(c), “it is apparent that s 32(1)(b) of the Act has no application in the majority of the incidents relied upon”.
	
	
	Section 32(1)(b) of the AML Act is directed to the reporting entity. That entity is required to carry out “the applicable customer identification procedure” unless s 32(1)(a) or (c) applies, or it has previously carried out the applicable customer identification procedure (s 32(1)(c)). In each case, other than incidents 1, 2 and 6, there is evidence that the reporting entity had previously carried out the applicable procedure. The reporting entities in those instances were not required to carry out the customer identification procedure again (and would have committed no offence against s 32 of the AML Act had they not done so). The requirement in s 140 (1) that, as particularised here, s 32 of the AML Act applied is, therefore, not satisfied. Thus, even if one were to accept that s 140(1) was satisfied with respect to instances 1, 2 and 6, the amount of money dealt with on those occasions was less than $1 million and that particular element in s 400.3(1) cannot be established on the evidence.
	


Crown’s submissions


	
	After referring to the Criminal Code ( Cth) provisions in s 400, it is submitted that the authorities are clear that in circumstances where the Crown seeks to rely upon s 403(1)(b)(ii) of the Code as the offence provision, the Crown must nominate an intended offence which it is alleged gives rise to the charge. Section 400.13 of the Code permits the Crown to identify an indictable offence in the commission of which, or the facilitation of the commission of which, the money is constituted as an instrument of the offence (Chen v DPP [2011] NSWCCA 205).
	
	
	Here the Crown particularises the intended offence as being that the accused possessed money intending that it would be used in the commission of offences against s 140 Anti-Money and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth) - namely the receipt of a designated service on a number of occasions using a false customer name or details and that the total amount involved was more than $1 million. The Crown says the accused had possession of money or other property with the intention it would become an instrument of an offence.
	
	
	By reference to its ‘construction’ of the provision creating the offence and the relevant elements the prosecution submits that an offence against s 400.3 can apply if a person deals with money or property, intending that, at some time in the future, the property will become an instrument of crime.
	
	
	Reference is also made to Milne v R (at [37[ and [38]) where the High Court stated:
	


[37] The definition of ‘instrument of crime’ and the deployment of that term in s 400.3(1)(b)(ii) require a temporal separation between the requisite dealing and the intended use of the property. They also require an instrumental connection between the intended use of property and the commission or facilitation of the commission of an offence. Conduct involving property which is no more than a necessary condition of the commission of a subsequent offence does not on that account amount to the use of the property in or to facilitate the commission of that offence. Nor is the instrumental connection demonstrated merely by an intention to take advantage of circumstances arising after and as a result of the requisite dealing. A fortiori, that is the case where that property has been put beyond the reach of the accused by sale to a third party.

[38] The language of s 400.3(1)(b)(ii), and its associated definitions, is capable of application to a range of circumstances which fall within their ordinary meanings. Its construction according to the ordinary meaning of its words is sufficient to provide a broad coverage consistent with its purpose and without resort to ‘extended’ meanings of those words.


	
	It is argued that it is “sufficient” for the Crown to rely on possession (the first physical element) immediately before the engagement in the offending pursuant to s 140 of the AML Act (see Arora v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2011] NSWSC 552, which would also satisfy the temporal separation referred to by the High Court in Milne v R).
	
	
	The Crown submits that the accused concedes possession of the money. Further, the temporal separation required by the High Court is also conceded by the accused.
	
	
	The only question the Court needs to consider is that posed by the High Court in Milne v R, at [14]:-
	


‘…. Relevant to the physical element in s 400.3 (1) (a) and the element of intention in s 400.3 (1) (b) (ii), [is] whether on the Crown case, the money could be said to have been intended to become ‘an instrument of crime’ within the meaning of section 400.2 (1) (b) (?).


	
	The Crown submits that an analysis of s 140 of the AML Act shows that money (in the accused’s possession) is instrumental in the commission of the offence, (in other words ‘has an instrumental connection’) or it facilitates the commission of the offence. It was submitted that the accused could not receive a ‘designated service’ without seeking to transfer money, or seek a designated service for the transfer of the money, without having money available to transfer.
	
	
	It is the Crown’s submission that it is not necessary to explore the elements of the offence for the purpose of determining whether the money could be said to have been intended to become ‘an instrument of crime’.
	
	
	Alternatively, if the Court is against that submission the Crown submits that the elements of the s 140 AML Act offence are:
	



	
		
			
			Physical element
			
			
			Accused commences to receive a designated service (conduct)
			
		
		
			
			Fault element
			
			
			intention
			
		
		
			
			Physical element
			
			
			Using a false customer name (circumstance)
			
		
		
			
			Fault element
			
			
			recklessness
			
		
		
			
			Physical element
			
			
			At least one provision of Division 2, 3 or 4 of Part 2 applies to the provision of the designated service (circumstance)
			
		
		
			
			Fault element
			
			
			strict liability (s 140(2) of the AML & CTF Act 2006)”
			
		
	



	
	As to the first element of commencing to receive a designated service, s 6 of the AML Act sets out the activities which constitute a designated service for the purposes of the AML Act.
	
	
	Item 31 of section 6 relevantly provides:
	



	
		
			
			Item No
			
			
			Provision of a designated service
			
			
			Customer of designated service
			
		
		
			
			31
			
			
			in the capacity of a non-financier carrying on a business of giving effect to remittance arrangements, accepting an instruction from a transferor entity for the transfer of money or property under a designated remittance arrangement
			
			
			the transfer entity
			
		
	



	
	A designated remittance arrangement is defined by s 10(1) of the AML Act as follows:
	



	
	A reference in this Act to a designated remittance arrangement is a reference to a remittance arrangement, where: 
	



	
	at least one of the persons described in the following subparagraphs is a non-financier [1] : 
	



	
	a person who accepts an instruction from the transferor entity for the transfer of money or property under the remittance arrangement; 
	
	
	a person who makes money or property available, or arranges for it to be made available, to an ultimate transferee entity as a result of a transfer under the remittance arrangement; and 
	



	
	[repealed] 
	
	
	the remittance arrangement satisfies such other conditions (if any) as are specified in the AML/CTF Rules.
	



	
	A remittance arrangement is defined by s 10(2) of the AML Act as follows:
	


A reference in this Act to a remittance arrangement is a reference to an arrangement that is for the transfer of money or property, and includes a reference to an arrangement that, under the regulations, is taken to be a remittance arrangement for the purposes of this Act.


	
	Transferor entity is defined by s10(3)(a) of the AML Act as follows:
	



	
	(3)   For the purposes of the application of this Act to a remittance arrangement: 
	



	
	the transferor entity is the person from whom an instruction is accepted for the transfer of money or property under the arrangement; and 
	
	
	the ultimate transferee entity is the person to whom money or property is ultimately transferred under the arrangement.
	



	
	Section 5 of the AML Act contains the following definitions of commencing to provide and receiving a designated service:
	


(a)   Commence to provide a designated service means: 


	
	if the designated service is provided at an instant of time—provide the service; or 
	
	
	if the designated service is provided over a period of time—begin to provide the service.
	


(b)   receives a designated service: if a reporting entity provides a designated service to a customer, the customer receives the designated service from the reporting entity.


	
	It is submitted that it is clear that the use of money, or the transfer of money, is instrumental for the commission of an offence or it facilitates the commission of an offence under s 140 of the AML Act. On that basis ‘money’ can be an instrument of crime as envisaged by s 400.2 of the Code.
	
	
	The accused intended to receive a designated service for the purposes of s 140 of the AML Act each time he conducted a transfer, and money is instrumental in that process.
	
	
	In its analysis of s 140 of the AML Act, the Crown submits that the second physical element of using a false customer name has a ‘fault’ element of ‘recklessness’.
	
	
	False customer name is defined by section 5 of the AML Act as follows:
	


false customer name means a name other than a name by which the customer is commonly known.


	
	Recklessness is defined by s 5.4 of the Code as follows:
	



	
	A person is reckless with respect to a circumstance if: 
	



	
	he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the circumstance exists or will exist; and 
	
	
	having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk. 
	



	
	… 
	
	
	The question whether taking a risk is unjustifiable is one of fact. 
	
	
	If recklessness is a fault element for a physical element of an offence, proof of intention, knowledge or recklessness will satisfy that fault element. 
	



	
	Recklessness can be proved by knowledge (s 5.4 (4) of the Code). The Crown submits that it does not seem to be in dispute that a false name was used on multiple occasions.
	
	
	The accused was not known by the name Nick Wang. The accused knew that this name was false. Accordingly, the physical and fault elements could be established.
	
	
	There is a the third physical element of s 140 AML Act, which has a fault element of absolute liability: ss 28 to 34 of the AML Act comprise Divisions 2 to 4 of Part 2 of the AML Act. These provisions create a requirement for a reporting entity to carry out a procedure to verify a customer’s identity before providing a designated service to the customer. Given the question posed by the High Court and submitted by the Crown to be the relevant question is ‘whether on the Crown case, the money could be said to have been intended to become ‘an instrument of crime’ within the meaning of s 400.2(1)(b)’, further analysis of the third physical element does not advance the argument further.
	
	
	Section 400.3(1)(b)(ii) refers to the accused’s intention. Repeating the relevant subsection, it states:-
	


(ii)   the person intends that the money or property will become an instrument of crime


	
	Focusing on the accused’s state of mind, the issue to be addressed is: did the accused intend to receive a designated service in the terms of s 140 of the AML Act? The answer to that question it is submitted must be ‘yes’.
	
	
	Section 4 of the AML Act, contains a simplified outline of the Act, it provides amongst other matters:
	


A reporting entity must carry out a procedure to verify a customer’s identity before providing a designated service to the customer. However, in special cases, the procedure may be carried out after the provision of the designated service.


	
	Section 32 of the AML Act requires that, in this context, a reporting entity (a person who provides a designated service: s 5 AML Act) must carry out an applicable customer identification procedure on a customer before the commencement of the provision of a designated service, unless:
	



	
	there are special circumstances that justify carrying out the procedure after commencing to provide the service; and
	
	
	the reporting entity has not previously carried out the procedure; and
	
	
	neither section 28 nor 30 applies to the provision of the service.
	



	
	The prosecution referred to s 32 and submitted that it is directed at the money remitter, or the provider of the designated service, not in these instances at the accused. Section 32 places no obligation upon the accused. The accused’s intention is not affected.
	
	
	There are exemptions for special circumstances, which provide that the procedure may be carried out after the provision of the designated service. Chapter 46 of the AML Rules provides for what constitutes special circumstances, they do not apply in the context of this service.
	
	
	Subsection 32(1)(c) concerns ss 28 and 30 of the AML Act. Section 28 concerns pre-commencement customers. Section 30 is concerned with low-risk designated services. The accused was not a pre-commencement customer. The designated service provided was not a low-risk designated service.
	
	
	Applying these matters to the facts of this case it is submitted that over a period between 27 May 2012 and 17 July 2012, the accused Cheng conducted 11 transactions which resulted in a total of AU$1,098,066 in cash being converted into Chinese currency and transferred to bank accounts held in China. In each transaction he provided the money remitter with a false customer name.
	
	
	Section 400.12 of the Code provides that:
	



	
	A single charge of an offence against a provision of this Division may be about 2 or more instances of the accused engaging in conduct (at the same time or different times) that constitutes an offence against a provision of this Division. 
	
	
	If: 
	



	
	a single charge is about 2 or more such instances; and 
	
	
	the value of the money and other property dealt with is an element of the offence in question; 
	


that value is taken to be the sum of the values of the money and other property dealt with in respect of each of those instances.


	
	The Crown submits that on each of the 11 occasions that the accused attended the money remitter he intended to remit funds overseas in a false name using that money remitter, that is he was intending to commit an offence, intending the money in his possession would become an instrument of the offence, each time a separate offence against s 140(1) of the AML Act.
	
	
	These submissions are said to be sufficient answer to the argument of the accused.
	
	
	If the Court is against the Crown on that aspect the following submissions are made.
	
	
	Section 140 of the AML Act is an equivalent provision to s 24 Financial Transactions Reports Act 1988 (the FTRA), which criminalises the opening and operating [a bank account] in a false name [2] . Whereas s 24 deals of the FTRA with ‘cash dealers’, s 140 deals with the provision of all designated services.
	
	
	On each and every occasion the money remitter remitted funds overseas, the money remitter was required to comply with at least one provision of Division 2, 3 or 4 of Part 2 of the AML Act. The relevant provision in this case being s 32 of the AML Act - Carrying out the applicable customer identification procedure before the commencement of the provision of a designated service. The money remitter could not commence to provide the designated service unless he complied with s 32 on each instance he remitted money overseas.
	
	
	Section 32(1) (being part of Division 4) requires a reporting entity not to provide a designated service unless certain criteria are satisfied. The reporting entity needs to be satisfied, on each occasion that a designated service is to be provided, that those criteria have been complied with.
	
	
	On the first occasion that the accused remitted money, the money remitter could not commence to provide the designated service until the money remitter carried out the applicable customer identification procedure in regards the accused. However, on each and subsequent occasion the accused remitted funds with the same money remitter the money remitter still had to comply with s 32 . That is the money remitter could not remit the funds unless all the conditions in s 32 were satisfied.
	
	
	Each subsections 32(1)(a) to (c) are conjunctive. This is made clear by the use of ""and"" [3]  in the section.
	
	
	Section 32(1)(b) of the AML Act therefore has application in all 11 incidents, because although the money remitter may not have been required to carry out the customer identification procedure in all instances, the money remitter still had to comply with s 32(1)(b) in all instances itself – that is, the money remitter could not have commenced to provide the designated service unless he had previously carried out the applicable customer identification (emphasis added by thee prosecutor).
	
	
	The accused had never given his true identity, he was dealt with by the money remitter as another person. He was required to give proper identification. The accused failed to do this on every occasion. He had never been identified by the money remitter in his true name, so on each occasion s 32 had to be carried out.
	
	
	Giving the section this interpretation gives due regard to the objects of the legislation.
	
	
	Therefore on each of the 11 occasions where the accused remitted money overseas, that is, received a designated service using a false customer name, he committed an offence against s 140 (1) of the AML Act. The Crown relies on the commission of this offence as evidence of the accused’s intention when dealing with money prior to each of the remittances.
	


Consideration


	
	There is no dispute as to the relevant test to applied as to whether there has been a prima facie case has been established or not (see R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74, at 77C, per Gleeson CJ). Is there evidence upon which the jury properly directed could properly convict, or is there evidence upon which the accused could lawfully be convicted? I have set out in considerable detail the submissions of both parties because the matter is to be decided in the context of the detail and the skill of the contentions of the parties. The matter is not without complexity, as the course of the litigation in Milne makes clear, with four Supreme Court Judges being at odds with by five High Court Judges as to the application of the law to the facts of that case. What was ultimately obvious to the High Court, was not obvious to the Court of Criminal appeal.
	
	
	From the judgment of the High Court, particularly focusing upon the Court’s findings at [37]-[38], I have concluded, taking into account the submissions of the accused’s counsel concerning legislative purpose, that an offence pursuant to s 140(1) AML Act is a relevant ‘indictable offence’ for the purposes of s 400.3 of the code. In the context of the ‘facts’ of this case the ‘possession of the money’ in respect of each incident is relevantly capable of establishing an ‘instrument of crime’, in that handing over of the money by the accused on each of the 11 occasions particularised is capable of establishing a relevant ‘use’ in the commission of, or ‘use to facilitate’ the commission of, an offence against ‘a law of the Commonwealth’, to wit s 140(1) AML Act .For the purposes of the conclusions I have reached I accept the Crown’s analysis of s 400 of the Code and its relationship with s 140 AML Act , as well as the Crown’s analysis of the structure of that later Act as it informs the character of the offence created under s 140 of that Act.
	
	
	Given the character of each transaction there is both the ‘temporal separation’ (which has not been seriously challenged) and the ’instrumental connection’ which are required as a matter of law to constitute the offence. The situation is not analogous to the situation in Milne because the ‘use’ of 'the property’ there was not necessarily connected to the criminal offence that would permit it at law to be portrayed as ‘an instrument of crime’. It was a condition precedent to the commission of the relevant crime, but the impugned transaction was not of itself, a ‘use’ in the commission of a crime or a ‘use to facilitate a crime’. Here, the possession of the money was integral to the commission of the crime. The intended use of the money was “instrumentally connected” to the commission of or the facilitation of the commission of the offence.
	
	
	I accept the Crown’s central contention that the use of a false identification, by itself, is not the essence of the conduct of the accused required to establish the relevant indictable offence with no regard to the accused’s possession of the money used to affect the remittal transaction which caused the accused to ‘ commence to receive a designated service’. The purpose of receiving the relevant ‘designated service’ is to transfer the money in the accused’s possession.
	
	
	I do not accept the submission of the accused that in addressing the question of whether (I take it, ‘prima facie’ the evidence can establish) the accused intended that the money in his possession become an ‘instrument of crime’,that question can only be answered by consideration of the accused’s explanation of why the money was being transmitted to China (and how) the money was to be used by (the recipients).
	
	
	The purpose of the transfer and the intentions of the recipients are irrelevant in establishing the relevant indictable offence (for the purposes of establishing the money was relevantly an ‘instrument of crime’) for which the money is to be ‘used’ or the money is ‘used to facilitate’.
	
	
	I do not accept the related argument that there is no evidence that on each occasion that the accused ‘sent money overseas ‘he intended that the money become an instrument of crime’. The relevant intent is concerned with commencing to receive a designated service by using a false customer name. It is not concerned with an intent on the part of the accused that the sending of the money would have any particular purpose.
	
	
	It has not been submitted that the ‘indictable offence’ particularised by the prosecution cannot at law satisfy what constitutes a relevant offence for the purposes of s 400.3 of the Code.
	
	
	I understand, in the context of what was raised in the Second Reading speech of the Honourable Attorney (as he then was) and the Memorandum, that the particular offence relied upon here is removed from the types of financial activity contemplated in the wider contemporary setting referred to in submission. But to my mind although the legislative purpose is relevant to understanding the provision that establishes the offence, it does not displace the ordinary meaning of that provision and the related provisions with which I am concerned, particularly relevant provisions in the AML Act. That argument by the accused falls away when it is understood that the provision (s 400.3) does not preclude consideration of offences that are of themselves far less serious, seen individually, than the offence created by the primary offence with which we are concerned here.
	
	
	A number of the complaints or arguments put by the accused are in essence directed at the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in this matter having regard of the choice of the appropriate charge to be laid given the hierarchy of charges available to the prosecution within s 400 of the Criminal Code. The issues thrown up by those matters are not germane to determining whether there is a prima facie case made out by the prosecution on the evidence available.
	
	
	As for the alternative submission that the only incidents here particularised that prima facie satisfy s 140(1) AML Act are not sufficient to establish that more than $1 million was relevantly ‘dealt’ with (ss 400.3(4)) I do not consider that the matters raised by the accused are relevantly questions( or a question) of law. Noting the respective submissions of the parties, the critical issue of whether there were sufficient ‘incidents’ that constituted ‘commencement(s)’ of receipt of a ‘designated service ‘in order to satisfy s 140(1), having to the terms of s 140(1)(c) and whether the related provisions identified in that sub-paragraph are satisfied are issues of ‘fact’ for the jury to decide.
	
	
	The issue of how these matters are to be left to the jury, particularly the terms of s 140 AML Act and related provisions, and the extent to which they are to be explained will need to be a matter for discussion or submission from the parties before the jury returns.
	


Conclusion


	
	I decline to direct a verdict of ‘not guilty’.

2702357,NSW Police Force v Sullivan [2015] NSWLC 28,"Judgment


	
	On 26 July 2013 Mr Sullivan was convicted of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage by deception. The offence occurred in 2012.
	
	
	He seeks to have that conviction annulled. Mr Brady SC appeared for Mr Sullivan and Sergeant Schmidt represented the prosecution. The application came before me not by way of section 4 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 but by way of a referral from the Attorney General by operation of section 5 of the Act.
	


Background and Chronology


	
	It is useful to detail the history of the proceedings as it seems to me it has some significance when considering the interests of justice, as I am required to do in this application.
	
	
	The allegation arose in 2012 and the matter was first listed on 26 July 2012 at the Downing Centre Local Court.
	
	
	The hearing was fixed for 7 December 2012. The efendant seems to have appeared but then subsequently left, and at 12.20pm the matter was dealt with pursuant to section 196 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. He was convicted and fined $1,000.
	
	
	On 16 April 2013, a section 4 application was made to annul the conviction. This application was granted and the matter was relisted for hearing.
	
	
	On 27 July 2013, the matter was before Magistrate Huntsman. The defendant was self-represented and was convicted after a hearing. Consequently he was fined and placed on a good behaviour bond under section 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for a period of 12 months.
	
	
	On 9 July 2014, breach of bond proceedings were finalised at Manly Local Court. No action was taken on the breach and the proceedings that enlivened the breach proceedings were dealt with under section 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.
	
	
	Approximately one year later, Mr Sullivan lodged an application for leave to appeal against the conviction and sentence he received from Magistrate Huntsman in the District Court.
	
	
	The matter was first listed at the Sydney District Court on 25 September 2014. Its second listing was on 29 October 2014. On 19 November 2014, Mr Sullivan appeared and sought leave to withdraw the appeal. The appeal was withdrawn and the orders of the Local court were confirmed.
	
	
	In March 2015, Mr Sullivan submitted an application to the Attorney General pursuant to section 5 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act.
	
	
	On 21 July 2015, the Registrar of this Court was advised of the section 5 application and the Minister’s determination that he was satisfied that a question or doubt existed as to Mr Sullivan’s guilt pursuant to the section.
	
	
	On 20 August 2015, this application was listed. It was then just over three years since the institution of proceedings.
	
	
	The matter came before me on 5 November 2015. Mr Brady SC indicated that if the application for annulment was granted then the applicant did not intend to contest the facts but merely sought to have an opportunity to have the discretion provided for in section 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act applied to his client. This would result in his client being discharged without conviction and in effect diverted to appropriate treatment rather than be dealt with according to law, so avoiding the consequence of any finding of guilt.
	


Section 5 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act


	
	Section 5 is in these terms:
	


Applications to Minister

(1)     An application for annulment of a conviction or sentence made or imposed by the Local Court may be made to the Minister by any person.

(1A)  An application under this section may be made at any time after the relevant conviction or sentence is made or imposed.

(2)     If satisfied that a question or doubt exists:

(a)  as to the defendant’s guilt, or

(b)  as to the defendant’s liability for a penalty,

   the Minister may refer the application to the Local Court sitting at the place at which the original Local Court proceedings were held.


	
	The Attorney General by his delegate, the Solicitor General, determined that a question of doubt had arisen as to the guilt of Mr Sullivan and so referred the matter to this Court.
	
	
	Although the matter was referred because of the Minister’s determination that there was doubt as to Mr Sullivan’s guilt, the defendant presses the application on the basis that there is a question as to his liability for a penalty.
	
	
	Section 4 of the Act is regularly utilised in the Local Court. It is enlivened when a defendant has been convicted or sentenced in his or her absence but only if the application is made within 2 years of the date of the conviction or order.
	
	
	An application pursuant to section 5 does not have a time limitation in when it can be brought. It can be made at any time, including any time after the two year period stipulated in section 4, if the Minister so determines. Section 5 makes no mention of the pre-condition contained in section 4, that the conviction or sentence to be reviewed occurred in the absence of the defendant.
	
	
	Whether the application comes before the court by operation of section 4 or section 5, the matters the court is to consider on the application are governed by section 8. That section provides that an application must be granted if the court is satisfied that:
	


(a)     that the defendant was not aware of the original Local Court proceedings until after the proceedings were completed, or

(b)     that the defendant was otherwise hindered by accident, illness, misadventure or other cause from taking action in relation to the original Local Court proceedings, or

(c)     that, having regard to the circumstances of the case, it is in the interests of justice to do so.


	
	Mr Sullivan was present in court when his matter was heard; he then pursued his avenue of appeal to the District Court albeit out of time, but subsequently withdrew it; by a process of elimination, he therefore now appears to be arguing that it is in the interests of justice that his conviction be annulled.
	


History of Part 2 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act


	
	Sections 4, 5 and 8 are now contained in Part 2 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. The provisions in this Part were originally inserted into the Justices Act 1902 in 1997. Their purpose was to allow a less restrictive procedure for matters to be dealt with when the defendant failed to appear, in particular the amendments allowed for a matter to be determined without an ex parte hearing which had previously been the case. Previously when a defendant had entered a plea of not guilty and then failed to appear, a hearing was required with witnesses both civilian and police in attendance to give their evidence even though the defendant was not in attendance. The resultant cost to the community in terms of court time, witness time and the removal of police officers from their policing duties was noted by the then Attorney General, the Hon J. W. Shaw, in the second reading speech of the amending bill.
	
	
	The amendments permitted the Local Court to consider the charges brought against the defendant “on the papers” without the requirement for oral evidence.
	
	
	Along with this less restrictive arrangement in circumstances where the defendant did not appear, the previous avenues for review of a sentence or conviction obtained in these circumstances were amended so that they were also less restrictive. Whereas previously they provided for a review of the conviction or sentence only when the defendant could satisfy the court that he or she had not received the summons or Court Attendance Notice or was otherwise unaware of the Court hearing, the amendments widened the avenues of review to those that are currently provided for by section 8.
	
	
	Mr Shaw commented in the second reading speech (Parliamentary Debates, Justices Amendment (Procedure) Bill 1997, Legislative Council, 19 November 1997, p 2004) that:
	


The new provisions provide for an order of the local Court to be annulled in situations where a person was not aware of the court proceedings before they were completed; the defendant was hindered by accident, misadventure, illness or other reason from taking action in relation to the proceedings; or where there is any other just cause why the order should be annulled.

He went on to comment that the bill demonstrated the government’s commitment to building a more efficient court system which reflects the needs of the community it serves.


	
	The Court of Appeal in Shorten v David Hurst Constructions Pty Ltd [2008] NSWCA 134 considered whether it was appropriate to construe a specific provision by reference to a statement of its intended operation, contained within the second reading speech of the Minister in respect of a bill. The Court held that extrinsic material may be considered if it can illuminate the meaning of statutory language (at [20]).
	
	
	At [13], the Court referred to the principle as expressed by Mason J in Wacando v Commonwealth [1981] HCA 60, in which his Honour said at [20]:
	


In construing s. 1 it is permissible to have regard to the mischief to which the Act was directed. Generally speaking, reference cannot be made to what is said in Parliament for the purpose of interpreting a statute. But in my opinion there are grounds for making an exception for the case where a bill is introduced to remedy a mischief. Then, to have regard to the purpose for which the legislation was enacted as stated by the Minister in charge of the bill would conform to the rule that extrinsic material is admissible to show the mischief which the statute is designed to remedy.


	
	His Honour Justice Young in Miller v Director of Public Prosecutions [2004] NSWCA 90 considered section 4 and section 9 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, and said at [30] that:
	


The Second Reading Speech gives the clear impression that the aim of the amendments was to liberalise the circumstances in which convictions before magistrates where the accused had not appeared, could be annulled.


	
	Accordingly this would suggest that to widen the section’s application beyond circumstances where the defendant was not present, to include circumstances where he was present and had a hearing on the merits, would appear to go beyond the purpose of the amendments.
	


Mr Sullivan’s circumstances


	
	Mr Sullivan’s matter was determined after a hearing at which witnesses, both civilian and police, attended and were cross examined. Mr Sullivan was present at the hearing. Although he was unrepresented the transcript reveals that he appeared to be an articulate advocate for his cause. His particular circumstances, including that he worked in the banking and finance sector and had no previous criminal history, but not including that he suffered from any mental condition because that was not yet known, were put before the magistrate. These relevant matters together with the circumstances of the offence were considered by the magistrate before she passed sentence.
	
	
	This application comes about because some time after his conviction he was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety as well as an alcohol abuse disorder by a psychologist, Mr Watson Munro. Mr Watson Munro provided his diagnosis in July 2014 and later opined that, on the information provided to him by the defendant with no corroborative evidence, that the defendant was suffering from a depressive illness not only at the time of the hearing in 2013 but also at the time of his criminal conduct in 2012. He said in his report of 24 February 2015 that in those circumstances and in the context of his experience as a psychologist, it was “highly probable that a section 32 disposition may well have been imposed had the appropriate evidence been produced at the time and had he been legally represented” (at p 3).
	
	
	Mr Sullivan asserted in his representations to the Minister that subsequent opportunities to appeal the decision of the Local Court were missed due to his suffering from an undiagnosed depressive illness. He did not provide any further explanation for this assertion, however it is noted that he subsequently lodged an appeal to the District Court. This appeal was well out of time and required leave to be granted for it to be considered. It is not clear if leave was granted but court records on JusticeLink reveal that leave was granted to withdraw the appeal. The inference available is that leave to appeal was granted. Unfortunately this cannot be confirmed as the District Court file cannot be located.
	
	
	It is also noted that on an earlier occasion when the proceedings were still before the Local Court, Mr Sullivan had pursued a section 4 application in April 2013 against the conviction recorded in his absence when he failed to appear in December 2012.
	
	
	Mr Sullivan also went on to say that:
	


Given the balancing act performed by the Magistrate whether to apply the Criminal Act or the Mental Health Act, if additional evidence was available to the magistrate relating to my illness at the time of sentencing, the decision may have erred on helping through the mental Health Act rather than punishment via the Crimes Act.


	
	I take this to mean that Mr Sullivan is of the belief that the magistrate, if she had had the information about his mental condition before her, would have exercised her discretion to divert him from the criminal justice system to receive appropriate treatment for his condition rather than deal with him according to law in the way that she did.
	
	
	Under section 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, if it appears to the magistrate at the commencement or at any time during the course of the proceedings that a person is suffering from a mental condition or developmental disability, the magistrate has the discretion to divert the person into treatment. However, that discretion was not enlivened at either the commencement or at any time during the course of the proceedings before the magistrate dealing with the matter because there was no information before the magistrate of any mental condition or developmental disability.
	
	
	There was no evidence on which to exercise the discretion under section 32 and Mr Sullivan was dealt with according to law.
	
	
	The one year bond that was imposed, according to law, has now expired.
	
	
	Mr Sullivan has, I accept, conscientiously adhered to a treatment plan devised by his psychologist at the time of his diagnosis and his mental condition has much improved. However, he notes in his representations to the Minister, and it is often the case, that “the conviction carries with it not only the stigma associated with bad character which weighs heavily” on himself and his partner, but also impedes him “legally, socially and economically”. It is in these circumstances that Mr Sullivan seeks to satisfy the Court that “it is in the interests of justice” to annul his conviction and allow the Court to consider dealing with him pursuant to section 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act rather than in according to law.
	


The interests of justice


	
	Superior courts have had many occasions to consider the meaning of the phrase “the interests of justice” and have generally held that it should be construed widely and that it is a “phrase… which comprehends many factors”.
	
	
	In the context of the calling of witnesses in a committal hearing in the case of O'Hare v DPP [2000] NSWSC 430 his Honour Justice O’Keefe said at [49]:
	


… there will be a myriad of factual circumstances to which the phrase may be applied… they involve considerations relating not only to the interest of the defendant in the committal proceedings but also to those of the complainant and perhaps others as well.


	
	Magistrate Buscombe in the case of NSW Police Force v Gavrilov [2015] NSWLC 6 made similar observations in relation to the same provisions I am considering in this matter.
	
	
	In Gavrilov, the defendant had been charged with a domestic violence offence, and Magistrate Buscombe commented that the phrase “interests of justice” should be construed widely and is not only concerned with the interest of an accused. His Honour said at [45]:
	


There are the interests of the complainant and the prosecution to consider, as well as the interest of the community generally having the allegation of domestic violence heard at the earliest opportunity. Delays in the hearing of cases can impact adversely on all interested parties to the proceedings.

Determination


	
	I was not referred to any case law by either party that could assist me in my determination but it seems to me that there may be some analogy drawn to the principles applicable to the consideration of fresh evidence.
	
	
	The general principle is that parties to litigation, including criminal litigation, are bound by the manner in which their cases are presented at first instance and will not be permitted to enhance their cases on appeal by producing fresh, or new, evidence: R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677; R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359 at 377. That applies no less to applications for leave to appeal against sentence than it does to conviction appeals (Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118 at [104]).
	
	
	Her Honour Justice Simpson discussed this issue in Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118 and said:
	


105 The rule is far from absolute, and has been diluted over the years. In criminal cases it has long been recognised that the rigour with which it is applied must be tempered in order to accommodate the interests of justice: Green v The King [1939] HCA 4; 61 CLR 167, per Latham CJ; Ratten v The Queen [1974] HCA 35; 131 CLR 510 per Barwick CJ. In criminal cases, two important but competing policy considerations collide:

(1)    that the administration of justice requires finality in litigation; in general, parties to litigation (including criminal litigation) have one, and one only, opportunity to present their cases in the best light they can, and are bound by the conduct of their cases at first instance;

(2) that error in the sentencing process, however caused, that is the occasion of injustice, ought to be remedied.

….

110 A fundamental pre-condition to the exercise of the power of the Court to quash a sentence and pass another sentence is the formation of the ion that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. In other words, this Court, as a matter of law, cannot interfere with a sentence passed at first instance unless it has identified some error, either in the sentencing process or in the outcome of the sentencing process. That has this additional implication: axiomatically, evidence of events or circumstances or facts that have arisen entirely since sentencing cannot be taken into account, no matter how compelling they may be. If the facts did not exist at the time of sentencing, it cannot have been an error for the sentencing judge not to have taken them into account. In those circumstances, the impact on the sentence is a matter for the executive government: R v Munday [1981] 2 NSWLR 177.

….

118 One question which has arisen, but not, so far as I am aware, finally decided, concerns the proper identification of the evidence that is said to have been unavailable, or not presented, at the time of sentencing. That was expressed by Basten JA in Einfeld in the following way: (in relation to psychological/psychiatric evidence)

“45 Whether the relevant ‘event or circumstance’ is the psychological condition, or the diagnosis, is one of the matters which has not been definitively resolved. There are fine distinctions to be drawn, in a practical way, between susceptibility to and suffering from a particular condition, different degrees of a known condition and the development of a syndrome (such as AIDS) from an infection (with HIV).

...

50 ... there is a fine line between a psychiatric condition which existed at the relevant time and a diagnosis which occurred subsequently”

119 In Fordham, Howie AJ (as he then was) referred to a psychological report that had been prepared after sentencing. He held, accordingly, that the report was either fresh or new evidence (and admissible only if proper grounds were established).

120 For myself, I would question the too ready acceptance that a psychological report post dating sentencing, is, because it is prepared after sentencing, fresh or new evidence. The substance of the evidence is not the existence of the report, but the history and opinions expressed in the report concerning the applicant's psychological condition. That may or may not be something of which the offender was (or his legal representative were) aware at the time of sentencing, but it is almost certainly evidence that, in the ordinary course, could with reasonable diligence have been obtained prior to sentencing.

[emphasis in original]


	
	It is not difficult to envisage a number of scenarios where, but for the existence of section 5, justice would not be served simply because the defendant was out of time to pursue an annulment by operation of section 4. For example, a defendant could have left the jurisdiction without being aware of the court date or may have left the jurisdiction involuntarily. Alternatively a defendant may have been hospitalised and remained so either in relation to a serious mental illness or physical illness and the review date may have lapsed.
	
	
	However, it is difficult to envisage how the interests of justice are served by allowing an annulment in circumstances where:
	



	
	there has been a hearing on the merits in the presence of the defendant;
	
	
	there has been some considerable delay without any real explanation for the failure to seek advice about the availability of any review or for the withdrawal of the District Court appeal; and
	
	
	an apparent justification is offered for the application before the court on this occasion on the basis that the defendant was denied the benefit of the exercise of a discretion that exists under s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, in circumstances where that discretion could not have been exercised by the magistrate at the time of Mr Sullivan’s hearing (in other words, when that discretion could not be enlivened and did not exist at the time for the magistrate who dealt with his matter).
	



	
	In summary, what are the interests of justice that are served when there has been no denial of natural justice or denial of procedural fairness and the exercise of a discretion being sought (if in fact the defendant adheres to the indication given that there would be no challenge to the evidence before the court) is in fact a redundant exercise because the defendant has not only been dealt with according to law but that lawful penalty, a 12 month bond, has now expired? Indeed it would seem to me that it may bring the justice system into disrepute.
	
	
	In Francuziak v Minister for Justice [2015] FCAFC 162, a recent determination by the Federal Court in relation to an extradition, it was said that:
	


It ill befits an appellant to seek to argue that a hearing has miscarried by reason of a failure on the part of a primary Judge to discharge a duty imposed on the Court where the appellant remains silent during the course of the hearing; awaits the decision of the Court; and (being dissatisfied with the result) then seeks to rely upon the alleged breach of duty for the first time on appeal. Moreover, as the High Court said in Metwally v University of Wollongong (1985) 59 ALJR 481 at 483:

It is elementary that a party is bound by the conduct of his case. Except in the most exceptional circumstances, it would be contrary to all principle to allow a party, after a case had been decided against him, to raise a new argument which, whether deliberately or by inadvertence, he failed to put during the hearing when he had an opportunity to do so. 


	
	Admittedly in this case the contention is that the defendant did not deliberately or inadvertently fail to put his case because he himself was not aware of what he could put. However, it must be noted that he was aware of his diagnosis when he withdrew his appeal at the District Court.
	
	
	Be that as it may, even if it were accepted that there may be circumstances where a defendant was present at his or her hearing and may then be able to satisfy the court that it is in the interests of justice to annul a conviction or sentence, I suggest that would require exceptional circumstances. These circumstances are not exceptional.
	
	
	It is not this Court’s function to define in advance a possible scenario that may come within section 8; rather the court must determine the matter on the circumstances of this particular case.
	
	
	In the circumstances of this case I am not satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that the application be granted.

2702358,Police Integrity Commission v Battal [2015] NSWSC 1798,"Judgment (EX PARTE – REVISED)

Introduction

The present application


	
	The Police Integrity Commission moves, by notice of motion filed 21 October 2015, for an order that the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian (the respondent) pay the moneys in its possession and control, as described in the motion, to the New South Wales Treasurer (the Treasurer) in partial discharge of the proceeds assessment order made in these proceedings on 10 October 2012.
	


The position of the NSW Trustee and Guardian


	
	I note that an order has been sought because the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian considered it to be more appropriate for the plaintiff to seek a court order to require the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian to pay the monies to the Treasurer. However, the NSW Trustee and Guardian does not oppose the orders, on condition that its costs are paid. I note that provision for costs to be deducted from the monies held is made in the orders proposed by the plaintiff.
	


The evidence


	
	In support of the notice of motion, Mr Tumeth, who appears on behalf of the plaintiff, reads an affidavit of Michelle O'Brien of 21 October 2015; and two affidavits sworn by himself on 25 November 2015. The plaintiff also relies on a travel movement record supplied by the Department of Immigration in respect of the defendant (Exhibit A) (which indicates that the defendant left Australia on 20 October 2013 and has not returned); and correspondence with the New South Wales Trustee (Exhibit B) (which indicates that the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian has no objection to the proposed orders which are sought).
	


Summary of the relevant facts

The making of a restraining order against the defendant


	
	The background to this matter is rather lengthy. For present purposes, a brief summary will suffice. The plaintiff commenced proceedings against the defendant, Nasser Battal, on 27 January 2009 pursuant to the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (the Act), seeking, in part, to restrain the defendant's interest in certain property at Leumeah in the State of New South Wales (the Leumeah Property). At that time, the defendant was a serving New South Wales Police Force officer who was being investigated by the plaintiff for corrupt conduct. On 27 January 2009, the Court made orders, including an order pursuant to s 10 of the Act, restraining the defendant's interest in the Leumeah Property.
	


The proceeds assessment order


	
	On 29 January 2009, the plaintiff filed a summons seeking an assets recovery order under s 22 of the Act; and a proceeds assessment order pursuant to s 27 of the Act.
	
	
	On 22 July 2011, the defendant pleaded guilty to numerous criminal charges in the District Court of New South Wales.
	
	
	On 10 October 2012, the Court made orders, by consent of the parties, including an order pursuant to s 27(1) of the Act that the defendant pay to the NSW Treasurer the sum of $50,000 in satisfaction of a proceeds assessment order.
	


The family law proceedings in the Federal Circuit Court


	
	On 12 September 2013, consent orders were made in the Federal Circuit Court of Australia in family law proceedings between the defendant and his wife, May Battal. As part of the arrangement reflected in the consent orders, the defendant agreed to transfer to his wife his interest in the Leumeah Property in return for her promise to pay the sum of $25,000 to the defendant. On 20 November 2013, orders were made, by consent, in this Court which included an order that the sum of $25,000 payable by May Battal to the defendant pursuant to the Federal Circuit Court orders be paid instead to the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian. In compliance with that order, Mrs Battal paid the sum of $25,000 to the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian who has held the sum on trust ever since.
	


The defendant’s legal representation in the proceedings


	
	Mr Walsh, solicitor, filed an appearance on behalf of the defendant in these proceedings on 30 July 2009. No notice of ceasing to act; no notice of change of solicitor; and no fresh notice of appearance appear to have been filed. However, for several years Nicholas Paneras has purported to act on behalf of the defendant in the proceedings as his solicitor. I note from a number of the court’s records of proceedings that Mr Paneras (or someone instructed by him) has appeared on behalf of the defendant in these proceedings at various hearing dates and dates for directions. Moreover, Mr Paneras has corresponded with the plaintiff on behalf of the defendant in relation to these proceedings. In recent times, the plaintiff has corresponded with Mr Paneras relating to the question of the moneys held on trust by the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian; the plaintiff’s claim to be entitled to those moneys; and the plaintiff’s proposed application to this Court for an order that the moneys be paid to the Treasurer.
	


The present dispute


	
	There is a dispute between the defendant and the plaintiff as to what should happen to the amount paid to the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian. Mr Paneras has claimed in correspondence with the plaintiff that his client still had some entitlement to the moneys paid to the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian. Thus the defendant has refused to consent to an order that the monies held by the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian be paid to the Treasurer.
	
	
	Correspondence between the plaintiff and the defendant's solicitor ensued, in the course of which the defendant's solicitor, most recently by letter dated 28 August 2015 to the plaintiff, informed the plaintiff that he was instructed that the defendant did not consent to the proposed order for payment out by the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian. However, Mr Paneras informed the plaintiff in the same letter that he was instructed to accept service of any documents. I am satisfied that, by that date, the defendant's solicitor (and through him, the defendant) was well and truly aware of the orders which would be sought by the plaintiff in these proceedings for payment to the Treasurer, although, as at that date, the notice of motion had not yet been filed.
	
	
	On 2 September 2015, Mr Paneras told Mr Tumeth for the first time that the defendant was ""on the run overseas and there is a contract out on him because of information he previously supplied to the authorities"". Mr Paneras informed Mr Tumeth that he no longer had instructions and that he would not be appearing in Court in relation to the proceedings. He also informed Mr Tumeth that he did not think that Mr Battal would be appearing in relation to these proceedings.
	


Application to dispense with service


	
	The plaintiff also seeks an order dispensing with the requirement for service of the notice of motion and affidavits on the defendant. This order is sought under s 14 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and r 18.2(2)(c) of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW). I am satisfied that, in the circumstances of this case, it is appropriate to dispense with the requirement for service on the defendant. The evidence establishes that he left Australia on 20 October 2013. His present whereabouts are not revealed by the evidence, except that he is outside Australia. Although Mr Paneras did not see fit to file a notice of appearance in this Court, his participation in these proceedings and his representation, as recently as 28 August 2015, that he had instructions from the defendant is sufficient to satisfy me that the defendant has had notice of the application by the plaintiff. I infer that the defendant has chosen not to play any part in these proceeding and has decided neither to appear in opposition to the orders sought nor to instruct a solicitor to resist such orders on his behalf.
	


Summary and conclusion


	
	I am satisfied, in all the circumstances, that it is appropriate to make the orders sought by the plaintiff in the minute of order handed up by Mr Tumeth.
	


Orders


	
	In these circumstances, I make the following orders:
	



	
	The requirement for service of the plaintiff's notice of motion filed on 21 October 2015 upon the defendant be dispensed with.
	
	
	The respondent, being the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian, pay the sum of $24,635.63 to the New South Wales Treasurer in partial discharge of the proceeds assessment order made against the defendant by the Court on 10 October 2012.
	
	
	The respondent is to retain the balance of the moneys in its possession and control, $605, in payment of its fees and expenses incurred in or in connection with the performance of the duties imposed on the respondent under the restraining order made on 27 January 2009, as varied by the Court on 20 November 2013.

2702362,Phanekham v R [2015] NSWCCA 295,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: On 20 November 2013 Viengsavanh Phanekham (“the applicant”) pleaded not guilty to an indictment alleging that on 20 June 2012, at Ambarvale in the State of NSW, he murdered Mark William Puffett (“the deceased”).
	
	
	On 29 November 2013 the jury found the applicant not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter.
	
	
	On 2 May 2014 the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 6 years imprisonment commencing on 20 June 2012, with a balance of term of 2 years imprisonment commencing on 20 June 2018: R v Phanekham (No 3) [2014] NSWSC 508.
	
	
	By notice dated 7 August 2015 the applicant seeks leave to appeal against that sentence upon a single ground, namely that the sentencing judge erred by failing to have proper regard to the applicant’s mental health in a principled fashion.
	


THE FACTS


	
	The sentencing judge found the facts to be as follows (commencing at [4]):
	


[4] As at 20 June 2012 the victim's de facto partner, Ms Calleja, her son aged 17, and her two youngest children lived at a house in Martha Way, Ambarvale. The victim, Mr Puffett, was the father of her two youngest children. He had previously lived in the house but had recently left. The offender lived next door.

[5] During 20 June 2012 Mr Puffett consumed alcohol continuously. He arrived at Ms Calleja's home at 2:30pm. He was drunk. Ms Calleja left the house and collected her two youngest children from school. She returned to the house. Mr Puffett played and talked with the children until around 4:30pm when he left. Mr Puffett returned to the house at around 7:00pm. He had been drinking in the meantime.

[6] By this stage he was very intoxicated. He was described by some of the witnesses as being ""paralytic drunk"", staggering and stumbling. A blood alcohol sample taken after his death revealed a blood alcohol reading of 0.268 grams per 100 ml.

[7] There is no doubt that in the immediate hour or so before his death at around 9.20pm Mr Puffett's behaviour was erratic. Ms Calleja recalled that he was at times telling her that he loved her, and at other times stating that he hated her. In cross examination she agreed that he was verbally aggressive. At one point he smashed a picture and cut his hand. He wiped blood on the front and back of Ms Calleja's blouse. Later he left the house, went downstairs and banged on the door to the garage which Ms Calleja's son used as a bedroom. He went inside, abused Ms Calleja's son and accidentally smashed a coffee table. Ms Calleja was able to manoeuvre him out of the garage. She also said that at one point he had his hands around her throat. She told him to leave. She went back into the house and closed both doors, but Mr Puffett kicked the door open. Ms Calleja said that he went back out of the house, back down the stairs and banged on the door of the garage using both his hands and his fists.

[8] When she gave evidence it appeared that Ms Calleja was being protective of Mr Puffett's memory. She sought to deflect the suggestion that he was aggressive. Instead she sought to portray him as highly intoxicated and loud, but otherwise relatively harmless. However, I am satisfied that in the period immediately preceding his death Mr Puffett acted aggressively and at times was violent.

[9] Later that evening, the offender participated in an ""electronically recorded interview with a suspected person"" with the police (the ""first ERISP""). The offender stated that he had been at home playing an on-line video game for a number of hours when he heard Mr Puffett next door. He said that he yelled out ""Shut the fuck up"" twice. He said that Mr Puffett yelled out something to the effect of ""[c]ome out to the fuckin' front yard, I'll fucking kill you"". In his first ERISP the offender said he took a knife from his home and went into the street. In another ERISP conducted early on the morning of 21 June 2012 (the ""second ERISP""), he said he took two knives.

[10] Sometime between 9.10pm and 9.22pm on 20 June 2012 there was a confrontation between the offender and Mr Puffett in Martha Way. However, other than the participants, it was not directly observed by anyone. One of the neighbours was observing the two men, but her view of the spot where they came into contact with each other was obstructed. She did observe Mr Puffett ""shadow boxing"" and performing karate-like moves just prior to the confrontation. She also recalled Mr Puffett yelling out ""[c]ome on, come out and have a go. I'll fucking fight you"".

[11] The next observation of Mr Puffett was of him running back to Ms Calleja's house. He was heard by Ms Calleja's son to be screaming out ""I've been stabbed, I've been stabbed"" and ""someone is trying to kill me"" as he ran past the garage door and up the stairs of Ms Calleja's house. In his first ERISP Mr Phanekham told the police that he followed the deceased at this time ""yelling crap out at him"" and he stood ""just where his front porch is"", ie on the lawn, yelling at him. Ms Calleja also saw the victim running across the lawn and a person she later found out was the offender following him. She said the offender ran up the steps to her house. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he ran that far.

[12] Ms Calleja let Mr Puffett into her home. He had one stab wound to his lower abdomen. It must have been a horrendous scene. Parts of his digestive system had fallen out of the stab wound. He died very soon afterwards. The stab wound had an approximate depth of 10.5cm and length of 5.9cm. The wound was crescent shaped with a maximum width of 2.3cm. The forensic pathologist called at the trial, Dr Irvine, stated that the cause of death was the effects of the stab wound.

[13] The offender returned to his house. He cleaned blood from the knife and his hands. He called his brother. He sent a message to a friend with whom he had been playing the on-line video game. At around 9:22pm he phoned '000' and told the operator that he had ""just stabbed someone"" and that the other person ""ran at me and I just pulled out a knife"".

[14] The police and ambulance arrived at the scene very soon afterwards. Mr Puffett died either prior to or shortly after their arrival. The police found the offender in his house. They recovered a knife from his kitchen. The knife's dimensions matched those of Mr Puffett's stab wound.

[15] At 11:34pm on 20 June 2012 the offender participated in the first ERISP. I have already referred to parts of it. Early in the morning of 21 June 2012 the offender participated in the second ERISP. As noted, during that ERISP he disclosed that he had taken a second knife to the confrontation. Another knife was seized from his kitchen, but the dimensions of this knife were such that ultimately it was not alleged that it was used to stab Mr Puffett.

THE GROUND OF APPEAL – THE SENTENCING JUDGE ERRED BY FAILING TO HAVE PROPER REGARD TO THE APPLICANT’S METAL HEALTH IN A PRINCIPLED FASHION

The evidence


	
	Exhibit 1 in the sentence proceedings was a report of Dr Olav Nielssen, Psychiatrist, of 28 March 2014. The applicant told Dr Nielssen that he was first diagnosed with depression in his late teenage years. He said that he believed that this diagnosis was secondary to the effects of a head injury which he sustained at the age of 12 which had left him with visual and learning impairments. Dr Nielssen noted that the applicant had reported contemplating suicide from that time, and that on one occasion he had been admitted to the Psychiatric Emergency Centre of Campbelltown Hospital after reporting suicidal thoughts.
	
	
	The applicant reported to Dr Nielssen that he had suffered “really bad” episodes of depression during his twenties and early thirties, following which he was prescribed anti-depressant medication. Dr Nielssen noted that the applicant did not report experiencing typical symptoms of psychotic illness, such as hallucinations or persecutory beliefs.
	
	
	When asked about his current symptoms, the applicant told Dr Nielssen (inter alia) that he felt low and unmotivated. He said that he had always felt anxious in social settings around people and that these feelings had been exacerbated by the crowded conditions in custody. Those things said, the applicant denied any plans to commit suicide. The applicant also told Dr Nielssen that when he was taken into custody arrangements were made for the continued prescription of Escitalopram (an anti-depressant) and Quetiapine (an anti-psychotic drug). He said that the dosage had recently been increased, but that it was “not working very well”.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen diagnosed the applicant as suffering from:
	



	
	a dysthymic disorder, namely chronic depression;
	
	
	a substance abuse disorder (in remission); and
	
	
	a traumatic brain injury.
	



	
	Dr Nielssen acknowledged that these diagnoses were based largely upon the history provided by the applicant, in the absence of an opportunity to view any documentation regarding his past or recent treatment. However Dr Nielssen said that he had no reason to doubt the history with which he had been provided. He assessed the applicant as being significantly depressed, and expressed the opinion that in the event that his mood did not improve he would require “more assertive treatment”. He also expressed the opinion that the applicant would require long term psychiatric care following his release from custody.
	


The proceedings before the sentencing judge


	
	The applicant was represented by senior counsel, both at his trial and on sentence. For the purposes of the sentence proceedings, senior counsel provided written submissions to the sentencing judge. These were supplemented by short oral submissions. The principal thrust of the submissions put on behalf of the applicant was that the opinions of Dr Nielssen should be reflected in a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s. 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. No submission was put to the sentencing judge that:
	



	
	there was a causal connection between the applicant’s mental state and his offending;
	
	
	the applicant’s moral culpability was lessened as a consequence of his mental state;
	
	
	the applicant was an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence;
	
	
	the applicant’s mental state was such as to render his conditions of custody more onerous.
	


The findings of the sentencing judge


	
	The sentencing judge (commencing at [40]) outlined the applicant’s personal circumstances, before turning to the evidence of Dr Nielssen and the prospects of the applicant’s rehabilitation (commencing at [51]):
	


Dr Nielssen's diagnosis and prospects of rehabilitation

[51] Dr Nielssen diagnosed the offender as suffering from chronic depression, a substance use disorder which was said to be in remission, and traumatic brain injury. The diagnosis of chronic depression was made on the basis of a history of his suffering long term symptoms of depression commencing in his late teenage years, including chronic low mood, lack of energy and anxiety. He considered that the factors contributing to his present depression included the effects of the head injury noted above, his frustration with disability, the effects of chronic substance abuse and, of course, his current circumstances.

[52] Dr Nielssen's diagnosis of substance use disorder was made on the basis of the account of several years of opioid dependence and abuse, a period of abuse of methylamphetamine, as well as abuse of sedative medication and the offender's account of his alcohol intake. Dr Nielssen described this disorder as being in remission on the basis of his detention in the ""relatively drug-free environment"" of gaol.

[53] Dr Nielssen's diagnosis of a traumatic brain injury was made on the basis of the offender's account of suffering a head injury resulting in a fractured skull. Dr Nielssen considered this to be a limitation on the reliability of his diagnosis. He did not rely on any documents relating to his past or recent treatment, although he noted that the offender was able to provide a reasonably detailed history. As noted, the suggestion that he suffered a traumatic brain injury is supported by the evidence of his sister.

[54] I accept the first two diagnoses of Dr Nielssen. As I have stated, the evidence at trial about the offender's lifestyle was consistent with someone who is effectively a recluse and who suffered a long term chronic depression. Similarly, the evidence as to his abuse of alcohol on the day of the offence was consistent with someone who has been abusing drugs and alcohol for a long period.

[55] I also accept Dr Nielssen's diagnosis of traumatic brain injury, although its effects were not described in any detail. In particular, there was no evidence that the offender's cognitive functioning was impaired and, in particular, that he was impeded in his ability to appreciate the potential consequences of his actions.

[56] Generally I am not satisfied that there was any causal connection between any of these conditions and the commission of the offence. It follows from that and the other findings I have made that considerations of both general and specific deterrence are of real significance in assessing the appropriate sentence for the offender.

[57] Dr Nielssen also stated as follows:

""The main factors contributing to Mr Phanekham's behaviour appear to have been his intoxication with alcohol and his coincidental confrontation with another intoxicated person. He has reached his late thirties without having been in prison, and hence would have a relatively low risk of further offences of a similar nature, although I note the history of a previous incident involving a knife some years ago. His risk of reoffending is further reduced by sustained abstinence from alcohol and other illegal drugs.""

[58] I have already made findings concerning the significance of the offender's intoxication to the commission of this offence. I agree with Dr Nielssen that one significant matter affecting his risk of reoffending will be whether he can sustain his abstinence from alcohol and illegal drugs. However, notwithstanding that he will now have an enforced sustained period of abstinence in gaol and presumably supervision upon his release, in the medium to longer term there is still an appreciable risk that he would return to a lifestyle that involved the abuse of alcohol and illegal drugs.

[59] Overall I consider the prospects that the offender will ever commit an offence as serious as this one in the future to be relatively low. Despite his limitations, the evidence suggested that the offender is a person with a reasonable level of intelligence who is capable of making the basic choices to enable him to avoid committing a serious offence. I am less optimistic, however, that in the medium to longer term he would not reoffend at some level. The risk of his return to using drugs and alcohol carries with it a concomitant risk that he may revert to some level of violence in response to a perceived slight.

[60] Overall I consider that the offender has a moderate risk of re-offending, although there is a relatively low risk of his committing an offence as serious as this one.

Submissions of the applicant


	
	In written submissions, counsel for the applicant asserted two errors on the part of the sentencing judge namely:
	



	
	failing to consider whether the principles of general or specific deterrence should have had less weight in light of the applicant’s mental condition, regardless of the lack of any causal connection to the offence; and
	
	
	impliedly finding that any consideration of the impact of the applicant’s mental health on the questions of general and specific deterrence was not open because of the absence of such causal connection.
	



	
	Those submissions were prepared without counsel being aware of the content of the written submissions which had been provided to the sentencing judge by senior counsel who then appeared for the applicant.
	
	
	In oral argument, having had the benefit of reading the written submissions provided on sentence, counsel for the applicant candidly conceded that it had not been put to the sentencing judge that the applicant’s moral culpability was lessened by reason of his mental state, or that principles of general and specific deterrence were of less weight. With equal candour, counsel conceded that it had not been put to the sentencing judge that the applicant’s mental state was such that a custodial sentence would weigh more onerously upon him.
	
	
	However counsel submitted that the general issue of the applicant’s mental state had been raised on sentence, in the context of urging the sentencing judge to make a finding of special circumstances. It was submitted that if this Court found error and proceeded to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh, any re-sentence should be reflected in an adjustment of the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that the applicant faced a fundamental difficulty before this Court, arising from the fact that the position he now sought to advance was at odds with the basis on which the case was conducted before the sentencing judge. It was submitted that in these circumstances it was incumbent upon the applicant to establish that a miscarriage of justice had occurred arising from the failure of senior counsel to put various submissions to the sentencing judge. In this respect, for the purposes of determining whether any such injustice was made out, the Crown effectively invited the Court to consider the affidavit material which had been filed on the applicant’s behalf.
	
	
	The Crown further submitted that on a proper reading of what the sentencing judge had said at [56] of his reasons, it was apparent that his Honour had concluded that because of the absence of any causal connection between the applicant’s mental state and his offending, and because of the factual findings made in respect of that offending, the circumstances of this case were such that considerations of general and specific deterrence remained of significance. It was submitted that the factual findings to which the sentencing judge had regard in coming to that conclusion included that:
	



	
	the applicant had deliberately inserted a knife into the deceased (at [17]);
	
	
	the applicant had, on his own admission, consumed approximately half a bottle of bourbon in the period leading up to the killing (at [18]);
	
	
	the applicant had committed the offence of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act (at [28]);
	
	
	the applicant’s level of intoxication did not impair his ability to appreciate the consequences of his actions (at [30]);
	
	
	although alcohol consumption may have loosened the applicant’s inhibitions and perhaps made him more aggressive, it did not impair his ability to control his actions, make decisions or appreciate the consequences of his actions (at [30]);
	
	
	the applicant realised that by his act, the deceased was exposed an appreciable risk of injury (at [31]); and
	
	
	the applicant had deliberately inflicted a single stab wound to the deceased in circumstances where he did not intend to inflict death or grievous bodily harm upon him (at [32]).
	


The affidavit material


	
	As noted at [17] above, the Crown invited this Court to have regard to two affidavits filed by the applicant in order to determine whether any injustice had arisen as a consequence of the failure to put submissions to the sentencing judge regarding the applicant’s mental state.
	
	
	The first affidavit was that of the applicant’s solicitor, Pip Hill, annexed to which were case note reports and clinical notes covering the period between 7 April 2014 and 21 July 2015. We do not propose to set out the entirety of the contents of that material. It is sufficient, for present purposes, to note the following:
	



	
	on 5 May 2014 the applicant presented in a stable mental state and reported that he was coping, and accepting of his custodial sentence;
	
	
	on 22 May 2014 he was noted to have a blunt affect and teary mood and reported suffering “adjustment issues” arising from his placement;
	
	
	on 17 September 2014 he reported a recurrence of anxiety arising from the effect of the behaviour of another inmate;
	
	
	on 1 October 2014 he was referred for psychiatric review on the basis that his mood/affect had declined;
	
	
	On 7 October 2014 his dosage of Escitalopram was reduced and he was prescribed Effexor. Although he was assessed as being depressed, there were no other active symptoms detected;
	
	
	on 4 November 2014 he reported anxiety arising from issues with another cell mate;
	
	
	on 16 January 2015 it was noted that he was working as a packer in the rations workshop. He was described as a “friendly person who is respectful and polite to staff, appears to Get on well with other inmates”;
	
	
	on 27 February 2015 he reported difficulty coping in custody, but denied any thoughts of self-harm, or any suicidal ideation. It was noted that he did not require direct psychological intervention at that time;
	
	
	on 25 June 2015 it was noted that he was “coping well” and that he had been “working well with no problems from other inmates”. It was also noted that he had reported that his health was “good”;
	
	
	on 15 July 2015 it was reported that he “works very well and is allways (sic) at his bench completing his work” and that he “caused nil issues or problems within the workshop”.
	



	
	The second affidavit filed was that of the applicant himself of 4 November, 2015. He stated (inter alia) that he found it difficult being forced to live in crowded conditions in custody, and that he continued to feel anxiety arising from interacting with other inmates.
	


Consideration


	
	The sentencing judge found (at [56]) that there was no causal connection between the applicant’s mental state and his offending. Contrary to the submission advanced on behalf of the applicant before this Court, the sentencing judge did not impliedly find that because of the absence of such connection it was not open to consider the impact of the applicant’s mental health on questions of general and specific deterrence. Such a submission overlooks the express reference, by the sentencing judge, to the “other findings (he had) made”. On a fair reading, what his Honour found was that in the particular circumstances of this case, and in light of the findings that he had reached regarding aspects of the applicant’s offending, general (and specific) deterrence remained significant considerations.
	
	
	In R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 Allen J observed (at 72) that even in a case where there is no causal connection between an offender’s mental state and the relevant offending, the offender may nevertheless be an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence. However as Gleeson CJ pointed out in the same case (at 68) it is erroneous to approach the law of sentencing on the basis that once the mental illness of an offender is established, it will automatically follow that general deterrence will assume less importance in determining the appropriate sentence. In doing so, his Honour emphasised that what is called for is the making of a discretionary decision in the light of the circumstances of the individual case, and in the light of the purposes to be served by the sentencing exercise.
	
	
	The relevance of general deterrence where there is no causal connection between the offender’s mental state and the offending will therefore depend upon the particular circumstances: Iskandar v R [2013] NSWCCA 235 at [27]-[32] per the Court (Beazley P, R A Hulme and Bellew JJ). In the present case, the sentencing judge concluded that general (and specific) deterrence remained significant. That conclusion stemmed, at least in part, from the various factual findings made by the sentencing judge regarding the offending. No challenge is made to any of those factual findings. No error is disclosed, either in the approach adopted, or the conclusion reached.
	
	
	Moreover, and as we have noted, no submission was made to the sentencing judge that the applicant was an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence on account of his mental illness, nor was any submission made that such illness would render his period of custody more onerous. As was properly accepted, those circumstances present the applicant with a difficulty in seeking to argue before this Court that the sentencing judge erred in failing to consider such matters, or otherwise erred in failing to have regard to the principles governing the sentencing of mentally ill offenders.
	
	
	In Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 Johnson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreed) said (commencing at [79], citations omitted):
	


“[79]   This court is a court of error. The jurisdiction of the court to interfere with a sentencing decision is exercisable only where there can be seen to have been an error of principle, or some other mistake of fact or law. If material error is demonstrated, before the court would proceed to resentence the Applicant, the court must form a positive opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. It is, of course, a basic principle that, absent error, the Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing Judge merely because (if it be the case) the court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing Judge exercised his or her discretion.

[80]   There is a practical expectation that an offender’s legal representative will make submissions to the sentencing Judge at first instance, by reference to the particular factors which are sought to be taken into account in mitigation of sentence in the case at hand. … ”


	
	Similar observations had previously been made by Redlich JA in Romero v R [2011] VSCA 45 where his Honour said (at [11]):
	


“In sentencing appeals, this court is reviewing the exercise of a discretionary judgment. It is not a rehearing of the plea in mitigation. It is not the occasion for the revision and reformulation of the case presented below. Given the nature of its supervisory role, this court will not lightly entertain arguments that could have been, but were not advanced on the plea. …”.


	
	More recently in Dicianni v R; Pintabona v R [2015] NSWCCA 201 Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom Price and Davies JJ agreed) said (at [282]):
	


“It is difficult to see how there can be said to be error by the Sentencing Judge’s failing to take matters into account when no submissions about those matters were made. This court has made clear in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; 223 A Crim R 460 at [75] to [81] that, ordinarily, if a matter has not been put to the Sentencing Judge, this court will be unlikely to find error by reason of the matter not being referred to in the remarks on sentence unless some serious injustice can be shown from the failure to raise the matter in the court below”.


	
	There is nothing in the affidavit material filed by the applicant in the present case which would support a conclusion that an injustice of the kind referred to by Hoeben CJ at CL has occurred. The applicant’s difficulties in custody appear to originate, in large measure, from the actions of other inmates. Such a difficulty is not uncommon. Importantly, there is nothing to suggest that the applicant’s mental condition is impacting upon his period in custody in a materially adverse way. On the contrary, the condition is apparently being appropriately treated, and the assessments of the applicant are generally positive.
	
	
	For all of these reasons the ground of appeal is not made out.
	


ORDERS


	
	For the reasons expressed above, the orders of the Court are as follows:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.

2702365,Hall v R [2015] NSWCCA 298,"Judgment


	
	SIMPSON JA: I agree with Johnson J.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Jason Daniel Hall, seeks leave to appeal under s.5F Criminal Appeal Act 1912 with respect to a decision by a Magistrate to grant leave to the prosecutor, under s.263(2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986, to elect out of time to have certain offences dealt with on indictment.
	
	
	The Applicant brings the application under s.5F Criminal Appeal Act 1912, which, by reference to s.5F(1)(a), permits an appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order in “proceedings (including committal proceedings) for the prosecution of offenders on indictment in the Supreme Court or in the District Court”.
	
	
	The Applicant contends that the decision of the Magistrate falls within s.5F(1)(a) as it constitutes the preliminary step in committal proceedings and forms part of committal proceedings which the Crown seeks to pursue.
	
	
	The Crown submits that this application falls outside the terms of s.5F so that the application for leave to appeal is incompetent.
	


Factual Background

History of Proceedings


	
	The proceedings involving the Applicant have had a somewhat protracted history before various courts.
	
	
	The decision under challenge in this Court is that of Magistrate Crompton made at the Downing Centre Local Court on 5 August 2015: Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Hall [2015] NSWLC 12. His Honour granted leave under s.263(2) for the prosecution to elect to have certain offences dealt with on indictment after the time fixed by the Local Court for such an election had expired.
	
	
	The decision made on 5 August 2015 followed an earlier purported s.263(2) grant of leave which was challenged on appeal under the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001.
	
	
	On 29 June 2015, in circumstances where both parties acknowledged that error had occurred at first instance, Campbell J allowed the appeal and remitted the matter to the Local Court for determination according to law: Hall v Director of Public Prosecutions [2015] NSWSC 839.
	
	
	It was that remitted proceeding which was determined by Magistrate Crompton on 5 August 2015.
	
	
	On 2 September 2015, the Applicant filed in this Court an application for leave to appeal under s.5F against the Local Court decision on 5 August 2015.
	


The Charges and s.263 Elections


	
	The following appears to be the procedural history of the matters relevant to the present application.
	
	
	Sequence No. H55095540 involved an allegation of take and drive conveyance without consent (a Table 2 offence). The offence is alleged to have been committed on 13 February 2014. The first mention of the matter was on 5 August 2014. The brief was to be served by 13 September 2014. As will be seen, the election was to be made by that date. A s.263 election was made on 28 September 2014. The Local Court was informed of the election on either 14 or 21 October 2014.
	
	
	Sequence No. H55458321 included the following offences allegedly committed in June and July 2014:
	



	
	take and drive conveyance without consent (two counts) (Table 2);
	
	
	drive whilst disqualified (two counts);
	
	
	not stopping a vehicle and driving the vehicle dangerously during a police pursuit (Table 2);
	
	
	dishonestly obtain property by deception (Table 1);
	
	
	attempted take and drive conveyance without consent (Table 2).
	



	
	These charges were first mentioned on 8 August 2014. Brief service orders appear to have been made on 13 August 2014 with a reply on 26 September 2014. A s.263 election was to be made by that date. On 28 September 2014, a s.263 election was directed by the Director’s delegate. On 21 October 2014, the election was noted in Court.
	
	
	Sequence No. H55121852 included the following offences allegedly committed on 1 August 2014:
	



	
	Take and drive conveyance without consent (Table 2);
	
	
	not stopping a vehicle and driving the vehicle dangerously during a police pursuit (Table 2);
	
	
	drive while disqualified.
	



	
	These matters came before the Local Court on 2 August 2014. A brief service order was made on 13 August 2014 with a reply date of 26 September 2014. An election under s.263(1) was to be made by that date. An election was made on 1 October 2014 and the election was noted in Court on 17 October 2014.
	
	
	The first s.263(2) application was heard in the Local Court on 3 November 2014, this being the decision quashed by Campbell J on 29 June 2015.
	
	
	The proceedings against the Applicant have not reached the District Court as yet.
	
	
	It will be seen from material placed before the Local Court that the Applicant has a substantial criminal history, and was on parole and subject to a s.9 good behaviour bond at the time of the offences which have attracted s.263 election.
	


Is the Application for Leave to Appeal Competent?


	
	Section 5F(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides:
	


“(3)    Any other party to proceedings to which this section applies may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in the proceedings:

(a)    if the Court of Criminal Appeal gives leave to appeal, or

(b)    if the judge or magistrate of the court of trial certifies that the judgment or order is a proper one for determination on appeal.”


	
	Section 5F(1)(a) provides:
	


“(1)    This section applies to:

(a)    proceedings (including committal proceedings) for the prosecution of offenders on indictment in the Supreme Court or in the District Court, and 

…”


	
	Section 5F(7) provides:
	


“(7)    A person may not appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal under this section against an interlocutory judgment or order if the person has instituted an appeal against the interlocutory judgment or order to the Supreme Court under Part 5 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001.”


	
	The earlier appeal brought by the Applicant, which was determined by Campbell J on 29 June 2015, was brought under s.53(3)(b) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, with an alternative claim for judicial review under s.69 Supreme Court Act 1970. Section 53(3) of that Act provides:
	


“(3)    Any person against whom:

(a)    an order has been made by a Magistrate in relation to the person in any committal proceedings, or

(b)    an interlocutory order has been made by the Local Court in relation to the person in summary proceedings,

may appeal to the Supreme Court against the order, but only on a ground that involves a question of law alone, and only by leave of the Supreme Court.”


	
	Campbell J accepted that a grant of leave under s.263(2) was an interlocutory order for the purpose of s.53(3)(b): Hall v Director of Public Prosecutions at [15]. In these circumstances, his Honour did not determine the Applicant’s alternative claim for relief in the nature of certiorari under s.69 Supreme Court Act 1970.
	
	
	Contrary to the approach taken by the Applicant with respect to the earlier grant of leave (where complaint was made about a suggested interlocutory order in summary proceedings), the Applicant now seeks leave to appeal to this Court under s.5F (where complaint is made about a suggested interlocutory order in committal proceedings).
	
	
	Section 5F(1)(a) permits an application for leave to appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order in committal proceedings. “Committal proceedings” is not defined in the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. It is plain, however, that the expression as used in that Act is intended to refer to committal proceedings under the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, where the term is defined in s.3(1) as follows:
	


“committal proceedings means a hearing before a Magistrate for the purpose of deciding whether a person charged with an indictable offence should be committed for trial or sentence.”


	
	Committal proceedings are provided for in the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 in Chapter 3, Part 2 (ss.47-120). Chapter 3 is headed “Indictable Procedure” and Part 2 is headed “Committal Proceedings”.
	
	
	Section 263 lies within Chapter 5 of the Act which is entitled “Summary Disposal of Indictable Offences by Local Court” (ss.258-273).
	
	
	Sections 258-264 provide as follows:
	


“258    Objects of this Chapter

The objects of this Chapter are:

(a)    to require the indictable offences listed in Table 1 to Schedule 1 to be dealt with summarily unless the prosecutor or the person charged with the offence concerned elects to have the offence dealt with on indictment, and

(b)    to require the indictable offences listed in Table 2 to Schedule 1 to be dealt with summarily unless the prosecutor elects to have the offence concerned dealt with on indictment.

259    Offences to which this Chapter applies

(1)    This Chapter applies to the offences listed in Tables 1 and 2 to Schedule 1.

(2)    All the offences listed in Tables 1 and 2 to Schedule 1 are indictable offences, subject to the provisions of this Chapter.

260    Offences to be dealt with summarily unless election made to proceed on indictment

(1)    An indictable offence listed in Table 1 to Schedule 1 is to be dealt with summarily by the Local Court unless the prosecutor or the person charged with the offence elects in accordance with this Chapter to have the offence dealt with on indictment.

(2)    An indictable offence listed in Table 2 to Schedule 1 is to be dealt with summarily by the Local Court unless the prosecutor elects in accordance with this Chapter to have the offence dealt with on indictment.

261    Procedure for dealing with offences summarily if no election made

An indictable offence listed in Table 1 or 2 to Schedule 1 is, if no election is made in accordance with this Chapter, to be dealt with summarily in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Act and any other relevant law as if it were a summary offence.

262    Procedure for dealing with offences if election made

(1)    An indictable offence listed in Table 1 or 2 to Schedule 1 is, if an election is made in accordance with this Chapter, to be dealt with on indictment in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Act and any other relevant law.

(2)    If an election is made in accordance with this Chapter and the person charged with the offence pleads guilty to the offence before the Local Court and the Court accepts the plea, the offence is to be dealt with in accordance with Division 5 of Part 2 of Chapter 3 as if the person charged had pleaded guilty under that Division to the offence.

263    Time for making election

(1)    An election to have an offence dealt with on indictment must be made within the time fixed by the Local Court.

(2)    An election may, with the leave of the Local Court, be made after the time so fixed if the Court is satisfied that special circumstances exist.

(3)    However, an election may not be made after the following events:

(a)    in the case of a plea of not guilty - the commencement of the taking of evidence for the prosecution in the summary trial,

(b)    in the case of a plea of guilty - the presentation of the facts relied on by the prosecution to prove the offence.

(4)    An election may be made on behalf of a corporation by a person appearing as a representative of the corporation.

(5)    The jurisdiction of the Local Court under this section may be exercised by a registrar.

264    Election may be withdrawn

(1)    An election for an offence to be dealt with on indictment may be withdrawn by the party who made the election.

(2)    However, an election may not be withdrawn after the following events:

(a)    in the case of a plea of not guilty - the commencement of the taking of evidence for the prosecution in the committal for trial proceedings,

(b)    in the case of a plea of guilty - the committal of the person charged for sentence.

(3)    An offence is to be dealt with summarily in accordance with this Chapter if an election is withdrawn in accordance with this section.”


	
	Here, the Magistrate made a procedural ruling granting the prosecutor leave to make an election out of time under s.263(2) of the Act. Prior to any election being made, all matters were to be dealt with summarily. No charge was strictly indictable.
	
	
	Appeals under s.5F from committal proceedings have usually involved subpoenas: Attorney General (NSW) v Stuart (1994) 34 NSWLR 667; Attorney General (NSW) v Chidgey [2008] NSWCCA 66; 182 A Crim R 536. A ruling or decision by a Magistrate as to whether a prosecution witness should be required to attend for cross-examination at committal proceedings was held not to be an interlocutory judgment or order under s.5F in R v Colby; R v Kennedy (1995) 84 A Crim R 125. In R v O’Meara [2001] NSWCCA 340, it was said at [11] that a committal order is not an interlocutory order, but is a decision of an administrative character.
	
	
	The jurisdictional problem confronting the Applicant is illustrated by considering the nature of an order which he seeks if the appeal was allowed. He seeks an order setting aside the s.263(2) decision and a ruling by this Court, refusing the extension of time, so that the prosecutions will be determined summarily.
	
	
	This feature reinforces a conclusion that no committal proceedings have commenced against the Applicant with respect to these matters, and that the Magistrate’s ruling itself was not made in committal proceedings: s.5F(1)(a). In these circumstances, s.5F(3) is not an available avenue for appellate review of the decision.
	
	
	A further difficulty for the Applicant is whether the grant of leave under s.263(2) constitutes an “interlocutory judgment or order” for the purpose of s.5F(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Campbell J concluded that, whilst “the matter is not free from doubt … a grant of leave under s 263(2) is an operative judicial act and is accordingly an interlocutory order for the purpose of s 53(3)(b)”: Hall v Director of Public Prosecutions at [15].
	
	
	The Crown submits here that the relevant decision was not an “interlocutory judgment or order” for the purpose of s.5F, relying upon AF v R [2015] NSWCCA 35 at [30]-[31]. The Crown submitted that the grant of leave to elect out of time under s.263(2) was not an order of the requisite character. It was submitted that it was not an operative judicial act, but rather the Magistrate did no more than answer a preliminary question without commanding anything more to be done: Salter v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2009] NSWCA 357; 75 NSWLR 392 at 394-395 [12]-[15].
	
	
	If it was necessary to resolve the question in this case, I would conclude that the decision under challenge is not an “interlocutory order”. However, I am satisfied that there is a more fundamental difficulty confronting the Applicant. He cannot bring himself within the terms of s.5F as the decision under challenge, whether an interlocutory order or not, was not made in committal proceedings.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the Applicant’s application for leave to appeal to this Court is incompetent.
	


Proper Construction and Application of s.263(2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986


	
	Although it is not necessary to say more for the purpose of disposing of this application, there is utility in making some observations concerning the proper construction and application of s.263(2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986. There is an absence of authority concerning this practical provision which is exercised with some regularity.
	
	
	Section 263 appears at [30] above. It is noteworthy that the jurisdiction under s.263 may be exercised by a registrar: s.263(5). The present case suggests that a Magistrate will often exercise the s.263(2) jurisdiction, although this is not required by statute.
	
	
	Section 263(1) provides that an election to have an offence dealt with on indictment must be made within the time fixed by the Local Court. Practice Notes issued by the Chief Magistrate under s.27 Local Court Act 2007 make provision for s.263 election. Clause 5.3 of Local Court Practice Note Crim 1 states:
	


“5.3    Table matters

(a)    On the first mention, if there is no decision as to whether or not an election is to be made in a Table matter:

(i)    If the accused enters a plea of not guilty - orders will be made for the service of the brief in accordance with paragraph 5.4;

(ii)    If the accused enters a plea of guilty -

*    the prosecution will be entitled to an adjournment for 2 weeks to consider whether or not to make an election; and

*    the facts are not to be tendered.

(b)    Pursuant to s 263(1) CPA, an election must be made on or by the first return date after an order is made for service of the brief of evidence (ordinarily, the second mention). The proceedings are to be dealt with summarily in accordance with this Chapter unless an election is made.

(c)    If an election is made, the matter is to proceed in accordance with Practice Note Comm 1.”


	
	Clause 4 of Local Court Practice Note Comm 1 provides as well for s.263 election:
	


4.   Election in Table matters

4.1.   A brief of evidence will not be ordered in a Table matter unless the Court is informed that a plea of not guilty is entered.

4.2.   A Table matter will proceed summarily pursuant to Chapter 5 of Practice Note Crim 1 unless an election is made to proceed on indictment in accordance with section 260 of the CPA within the timeframes set out in paragraph 4.3.

4.3.   Pursuant to section 263(1) of the CPA, an election must be made on or by the first return date after an order is made for service of the brief of evidence.

4.4.   Where a plea of guilty is entered at the first mention, the prosecution is entitled to an adjournment for 2 weeks to consider whether or not an election is to be made and facts are not to be tendered. 

4.5.   Committal proceedings are to proceed in accordance with the following timetable unless the Court is satisfied that departure from the timetable is in the interests of justice.


	
	Clause 5.3 of Local Court Practice Note Crim 1 and Clause 4.3 of Local Court Practice Note Comm 1 appear to nominate the time fixed by the Local Court for the purpose of s.263(1) of the Act. This is done by reference to a date fixed for a different purpose (the first return date after an order is made for service of the brief of evidence, ordinarily the second mention). In practice, at this early stage of proceedings, a police prosecutor will be appearing with a process of contact with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions expected to be underway in cases where s.263 election is under consideration.
	
	
	The statute does not state what is required for s.263 “election”. There is no statement that an election is not made until it is communicated to the Local Court and/or the defendant. At the least, however, there is an implied requirement that an election will be communicated promptly to the defendant and the Local Court, to allow it to be noted that compliance with s.263(1) has occurred.
	
	
	The Local Court (including a registrar) is authorised by s.263(1) to fix a time for the making of a s.263 election. It may be taken that there is power to extend that time upon a proper basis, as long as the extension is granted before the expiration of the time provided for initially under s.263(1): s.48 Interpretation Act 1987. This scenario may arise in practice, given that the time fixed by way of Practice Note is a by-product of a date selected for another purpose related to service of the brief. In a particular case, the prosecutor may ask legitimately for further time to consider the election issue. Of course, s.263(2) has application only after the expiration of the time fixed by the Local Court. It is only then that the “special circumstances” requirement must be satisfied.
	
	
	The s.263 procedure was referred to in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; 223 A Crim R 460 at 480 [95]-[96]:
	


“95   Section 263 provides for the time for making an election. That a charged person’s criminal record is relevant to the process of election is reinforced by s.265 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, which requires the prosecution to serve upon the person charged with a Table 1 offence, a copy of his or her criminal record.

96   It might be thought that the provision of the criminal record to a person charged with a Table 1 offence is intended to assist that person to consider whether indictable election should be sought, and to be in a position to make submissions to the prosecution on the question whether the prosecution should elect for indictable disposal of the matter.” 


	
	Reference was made, as well, in Zreika v R at 480-481 [100] to matters which the prosecutor may take into account in determining whether an election is to be made:
	


“Paragraph 8 of the Prosecution Guidelines of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for New South Wales lays down guidelines for election by the prosecution for an offence to be dealt with on indictment. The guidelines are furnished pursuant to s.13 Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986. Paragraph 8 of the Guidelines includes the following:

‘… 

An election should not be made unless:

(i)     the accused person's criminality (taking into account the objective seriousness and his or her subjective considerations) could not be adequately addressed within the sentencing limits of the Local Court; and/or

(ii)    for some other reason, consistently with these guidelines, it is in the interests of justice that the matter not be dealt with summarily (eg. a comparable co-offender is to be dealt with on indictment; or the accused person also faces a strictly indictable charge to which the instant charge is not a back-up).

… .’.”


	
	It may be accepted that factors which contributed to the election in the Applicant’s case related to his criminal history and current sentences, and the question whether the sentencing jurisdictional limit of the Local Court was appropriate in this case.
	
	
	It should be emphasised that the issue for consideration under s.263(2), where the prosecution seeks the leave of the Local Court to elect to proceed on indictment out of time, is whether the Court is satisfied that “special circumstances exist” to allow that extension of time. The focus of attention is not directed to the appropriateness of an election in the particular case, but to the reasons why the decision was not made within the time allowed by the Local Court.
	
	
	The term “special circumstances” is used in a variety of different statutory contexts. In R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704, in considering the term “special circumstances” in s.44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, Spigelman CJ said at [59]-[60]:
	


“59    The words ‘special circumstances’ appear in numerous statutory provisions. They are words of indeterminate reference and will always take their colour from their surroundings. …

60    Statutory words of such generality usually lead courts to refuse to identify in advance a list of matters capable of satisfying the statutory formulation. While certain considerations might not often be sufficiently ‘special’, so that an exceptional justification is required for them to attain the requisite statutory quality, nevertheless there may always be circumstances in which such a factor is of sufficient strength, either alone or in combination with other factors, to justify a conclusion that ‘special circumstances’ are made out on the facts of a particular case. It will be comparatively rare for an issue to arise in terms of a proposition that a particular circumstance is incapable, as a matter of law, of ever constituting a ‘special circumstance’.”.


	
	In applying the term, it is necessary to keep in mind the nature of the decision for which a finding of special circumstances is required. The phrase has a purposive element and should be interpreted in relation to the objective to be served: D (A Child) v White (1988) VR 87 at 91.
	
	
	In Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services v Chamberlain [2002] FCA 67, Kiefel J said at [19]:
	


“The words ‘special circumstances’ are not so imprecise as to require judicial gloss: Beadle v Director-General of Social Security (1985) 60 ALR 225, 228. In Groth v Secretary, Department of Social Security (1995) 40 ALD 541, 545 I expressed the view that the words require something which distinguishes a person’s case from others, something that sets it apart from the usual or ordinary case.”


	
	In Expile Pty Limited v Jabb’s Excavation Pty Limited [2002] NSWSC 851; 194 ALR 138 at 139-140 [5], Hamilton J said:
	


“5    The word ‘special’ is an ordinary English word. The relevant definition of it as used in the present context appears to me to be that given in the Macquarie Dictionary (3rd ed, 1997) as follows: 

‘6 Distinguished or different from what is ordinary or usual: a special occasion ‘ 

The thrust of that definition is that ‘special’ is used in contradistinction to ‘ordinary’ or ‘common’. ‘Special circumstances’ is an expression that has been used in other statutes. One must always bear in mind in an exercise of statutory interpretation that one is interpreting the particular words in the context of the particular statute. However, cases decided on other statutes, whilst they cannot govern the situation, indicate that, where ‘special circumstances’ is used in contexts like the present, it is used in the sense of the definition which I have quoted from the Macquarie Dictionary. Its essential meaning is that it denotes a particular situation which can be regarded as distinguished from the ordinary or common runs of situations. It has been found to bear this meaning in a number of other statutory contexts of a widely varying nature: eg Re Norman (1886) 16 QBD 673 per Lopes LJ at 677; Re Hunter (A Bankrupt), Ex Parte Exclusive English Imports Limited (In Liquidation) [1954] NZLR 747 per F B Adams J at 754; Clarks of Hove Ltd v Bankers’ Union [1978] 1 WLR 1207 per Geoffrey Lane LJ at 1215; Springfield Nominees Pty Limited v Bridgelands Securities Limited (1992) 38 FCR 217 per Wilcox J at 225; Lyon v Wilcox [1994] 3 NZLR 422 CA per Casey J at 431; Peninsula Watchdog Group (Inc) v Minister of Energy [1996] 2 NZLR 529 CA per Richardson P at 536.”


	
	Counsel for the Applicant referred Magistrate Crompton to decisions where the term “special reasons” was considered in the context of a decision whether to direct the attendance of a witness at committal proceedings under s.93 Criminal Procedure Act 1986: B v Gould (1993) 67 A Crim R 297; Tez v Longley [2004] NSWSC 74; 142 A Crim R 122. Although general statements in these cases concerning the term “special reasons” may have provided some general assistance, it is important to keep in mind the different statutory context surrounding s.263(2).
	
	
	Where a s.263(2) application is made, it is necessary to consider the reasons why election was not made by the prosecution within the relevant time period, for the purpose of determining whether the Court can be satisfied that special circumstances exist for granting leave for an election to be made out of time. To this end, something is required which distinguishes the case from others - that sets it apart from the usual or ordinary case: Kiefel J in Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services v Chamberlain at [19] (see [52] above).
	
	
	A primary focus of the decision under s.263(2) will be any explanation as to why the prosecution did not make the election in time. The length of time since expiration of the s.263(1) time limit will be significant. In a particular case, it may be that the circumstances of the offences, and the dates upon which they were allegedly committed, will bear upon this issue as well. It may be that there are groups of charges which will need to be considered together by the prosecution, to decide whether a s.263 election ought be made. This appears to be the case here, where groups of charges were considered at about the same time, to allow a decision to be made about s.263 election.
	
	
	The overall administration of justice is also important, being justice as it affects the community as well as the individual: D (A Child) v White at 93. This aspect may arise if a s.263(2) refusal left the Local Court with inadequate sentencing powers to deal with the offences at hand, or where refusal may see a co-accused being dealt with separately in the District Court.
	
	
	Magistrate Crompton set out, in Director of Public Prosecutions v Hall at [16], the suggested special circumstances relied upon by the Crown in this case:
	


“The special circumstances relied upon by the Director in making the election out of time are these:

(1)   That at the time of the commission of the offences the defendant was subject to parole and to a s 9 good behaviour bond;

(2)   That the offences are serious, one of which having a maximum penalty of 10 years of imprisonment;

(3)   That the defendant has an extensive criminal history;

(4)   That the defendant has had other matters before the Court for which he is currently serving a custodial sentence; and

(5)   That, if the election were not allowed out of time, the Local Court would not have sufficient sentencing scope to appropriately deal with all matters should the defendant be convicted.”


	
	In the course of determining to grant leave under s.263(2), his Honour referred to these features of the case and concluded at [18]-[24]:
	


“18   When the two other sets of sequences, H 55095540 and H 55458321, came before Central Local Court on 21 October 2014 the Director made the election to proceed on indictment pursuant to s 263 of the Act. The offences the subject of this application are alleged to have been committed last in time of all of the offences. It is submitted that the prosecution intention was at all times that all matters, including sequence H 55121852, should proceed on indictment and not be dealt with by the Local Court.

19   The defendant is currently in custody serving a number of sentences of imprisonment, as evidenced by his criminal history (Annexure A to the Affidavit of Helen Langley sworn 3 June 2015). His earliest release date is 30 January 2016. Following his arrest on 1 August 2014 his parole was revoked in respect of sentences imposed by her Honour Judge Ainslie-Wallace (as her Honour then was) on 27 March 2006 for 27 offences, principally robberies and thefts, with a further 65 offences taken into account by way of Form 1. The aggregate sentence imposed was 10 years and 9 months commencing 27 February 2005, the effective non-parole period being 8 years.

20   In addition to that sentence, the defendant is serving a sentence of 12 months imprisonment imposed on 17 September 2014 at Central Local Court, dating from 17 July 2014 with a non-parole period of six months.

21   The defendant also remains subject to a s 9 good behaviour bond imposed on 18 June 2014 at Balmain Local Court.

22   I find that these facts are special in relation to this particular case, that they are substantial in nature, that they are not common or usual, they are out of the ordinary, unusual or atypical and clearly distinguishable from the general run of cases.

23   Moreover, if the defendant is ultimately convicted of the H55121852 offences the Local Court would have no scope to impose any penalty referrable to the offending conduct involved in those offences. This, in and of itself, is substantial and clearly distinguishable from other cases.

24   I am satisfied that there are special circumstances for the purposes of s 263(2) of the Act which warrant the grant of leave for an election to be made after the time fixed by s 263(1).”


	
	It may be seen that the matters relied upon by the prosecution concerned the nature and gravity of the Applicant’s criminal history and of the present charges, together with the inappropriateness of the Local Court (with its jurisdictional limits) sentencing the Applicant. His Honour’s reasons focused upon similar considerations. It does not appear that an argument was advanced by the prosecutor as to why the elections were not made in time. His Honour’s reasons did not advert to any explanation for the delay.
	
	
	Although the matters advanced by the prosecutor, and relied upon by his Honour, were not extraneous to the decision to be made under s.263(2), there ought to have been some explanation provided as to why any relevant election was not made within the time laid down under s.263(1). The statutory need for “special circumstances” requires some explanation for the relevant delay so as to justify a favourable decision by the Court under s.263(2).
	
	
	As mentioned earlier, these observations have been made given the absence of authority concerning the construction and operation of s.263 Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	


Conclusion


	
	It is the position, however, that the present application for leave to appeal is incompetent. It is not open to this Court to take any step given the absence of authority under s.5F Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to do so.
	
	
	In any event, there is a further difficulty confronting the Applicant. This Court has determined that a refusal of leave under s.263(2) Criminal Appeal Act 1986 is not an impediment to the Crown bringing an ex officio indictment in the District Court charging the offences which were the subject of the s.263(2) refusal: Iqbal v R [2012] NSWCCA 72 at [15]-[24]. In these circumstances, the utility in a challenge to a s.263(2) decision is questionable.
	
	
	I propose that leave to appeal should be refused upon the basis that the application for leave to appeal under s.5F Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is incompetent.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I agree with Johnson J.

2702368,Alawadi v Widad Kamel Farhan trading as The Australian Arabic Panorama Newspaper [2015] NSWDC 279,"Judgment

The application before the court


	
	The defendant brings an application for summary dismissal of the plaintiff’s claim for defamation pursuant to s 61 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and r 12.7 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”).
	
	
	The circumstances leading to the commencement of proceedings were as follows. The plaintiff carries on business as “Al-Awadi Spiritual Therapist” (ABN 79 714 561 471) and provides services including, but not limited to, horoscope readings, spiritual healing, dream interpretation, “spiritual cleansing” and parapsychology services. Between February 2008 and October 2013, he advertised his parapsychology services in the Australian Arabic Panorama Newspaper (ABN 59 969 303 449) (“Panorama”). The plaintiff had also, over the same period, sponsored Panorama dinners.
	
	
	The defendant is the Editor-in-Chief of Panorama and an occasional contributor to this Arabic-language publication.
	
	
	Between 12 June 2014 and 21 May 2015, Panorama published eight articles which are the matters complained of in these proceedings, which were commenced on 25 June 2015. These articles cover stories ranging from what is called a “brawl” in the Iraqi embassy to a complaint about the services of an unnamed spiritual healer. The plaintiff is not named in any of these articles, but he asserts he is identifiable in each of them by reason of the particulars of identification set out in the statement of claim.
	
	
	Although these proceedings have been listed on five occasions prior to the date of hearing this motion, they have not proceeded beyond objections to the statement of claim. The deficiencies of the statement of claim and the conduct of these proceedings by the plaintiff (including failing to take advantage of orders granting leave to amend) have led to the application which is before me to determine.
	
	
	Where a pleading is acknowledged to be inadequate, leave to replead is generally given unless the court is satisfied “either that there was no reasonable cause of action available or that there was some other reason (such as the history of the proceedings) why leave to replead should not be granted”: Tanious v South Eastern Sydney Local Health District [2015] NSWCA 356 at [15].
	
	
	However, the application before me is not whether the plaintiff should be granted leave to amend. No application for leave to amend the existing statement of claim is before the court (as Ms Amato, for the defendant, regularly reminded me). The issue before the court is whether, given the procedural history of these proceedings, they should be struck out pursuant to s 61 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and/or r 12.7 UCPR.
	
	
	Both parties relied upon affidavits from their legal representatives, consisting largely of exchanges of acrimonious correspondence. Neither the plaintiff nor the defendant provided any affidavit material.
	
	
	Although not attached to any of the affidavits relied upon by the plaintiff, there is a draft amended statement of claim in existence. In the course of the hearing, in response to a call, the plaintiff produced the draft Amended Statement of Claim which had been (at paragraph 35 of the affidavit of Ms Natalie Audisho of 17 November 2015) described as being “ready to be filed”.
	
	
	Unfortunately, production of this document revealed that this was not the case. This draft amended statement of claim does not address many of the defects complained of by the defendant. Additionally, it includes new claims for publications on the website of Panorama (including the four publications for which the limitation period has now expired), but without particulars as to who downloaded them, or where, or whether they were viewed within the limitation period (cf Ahmed v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd [2010] NSWSC 676).
	


The parties’ submissions in brief


	
	The defendant’s submissions may be summarised as follows:
	



	
	Failure to comply: The plaintiff has acknowledged deficiencies in the statement of claim but has failed to use the occasion of orders granting leave to amend to correct these deficiencies (orders dated 13 August and 7 October 2015) or to provide the missing documents requested (order dated10 September 2015), or indeed to provide any proposed amended statement of claim until it was called for during this application. The draft produced in answer to that call does not cure those acknowledged deficiencies. It creates new pleading problems, in that it adds website claims for an unspecified period, part of which would be out of time, and fails to provide particulars of downloading or even a proper link to the alleged electronic publications.
	
	
	Explanations for delay: The plaintiff’s explanations for the delay are submitted to be inconsistent and implausible. This includes evidence that the documents necessary to establish identification was complex and required weeks to translate, when these documents were 4 advertisements totalling 132 words of the most simple kind. The plaintiff’s legal advisers’ explanation that their own “honest mistakes” should not be accepted, as the plaintiff should have been able to provide the missing documents and information promptly.
	
	
	The nature of the delay: Four aspects of this are asserted to be of significance. First, the documents which have not been provided included not only the documents to establish the extrinsic facts relied upon for identification but also copies of the matters complained of. The particulars provided were inadequate and irrelevant, and did not name (contrary to the usual practice) the persons who identified the plaintiff. Failure to establish identification can lead to the proceedings being dismissed: Lazarus v Deutsche Lufthansa AG (1985) 1 NSWLR 188 at 191-192 per Hunt J (“Lazarus”). Second, the plaintiff allowed the limitation period to expire for the first two publications and commenced on the last day for the third publication, without providing an explanation. Third, the plaintiff did not provide an affidavit in relation to the delay. Fourth, this delay is likely to continue, as the plaintiff still does not seek leave to amend, or provide a draft pleading capable of curing the pleading failures. The defendant complains of prejudice in the form of legal costs accruing from the additional time spent relisting the matter and drawing these problems to the attention of the plaintiff’s solicitors.
	



	
	The plaintiff’s submissions may be summarised as follows:
	



	
	No failure to comply: The plaintiff has not actually failed to comply with any orders to amend because the orders concerning amendment were mere invitations to amend. The statement of claim is conceded to require substantial amendment but this can be cured in the future, and the statement of claim should not be struck out now. The plaintiff has now provided most if not all of the missing documents and given explanations for the problems in obtaining them.
	
	
	Reasonable explanations for delay: The failure to provide documents and particulars arose from a series of misunderstanding between counsel, the solicitors, the plaintiff and the translator, and these explanations should be accepted.
	
	
	The nature of the delay: Any delay is minimal in time, and the failure to provide the relevant particulars and documents arose from a lack of experience in defamation by the plaintiff’s legal representatives.
	


Matters no longer in dispute


	
	The following points are no longer in issue:
	



	
	The first and second matters complained of are out of time and, no application for extension of time having been brought, should be struck out and dismissed pursuant to s 14B Limitation Act 1969 (NSW); and,
	
	
	The plaintiff has now provided to the court particulars of the advertisement in the missing “Schedule @@@ [sic]” in the statement of claim and the missing copies of the matters complained of.
	



	
	The particulars of identification refer to a schedule of advertisements (called “Schedule @@@” in the statement of claim) which are the central basis for the plaintiff’s case on identification. The plaintiff’s position is that this schedule, once produced, cures all the defendant’s complaints about the inadequacy of the pleading of extrinsic facts and identification, so I shall set this document out before listing the publications the subject of this claim and the imputations and particulars of publication for each of them.
	


The advertisements in the missing schedule


	
	The four advertisements which were intended to comprise the missing schedule of identification material as set out in paragraph 5 of the statement of claim are as follows:

	There are two features to note:
	



	
	While I am prepared to accept that “Alaa El Deen” is the plaintiff, none of these advertisements is dated. They could have appeared at any time between 2008 – 2013 (one refers to the year 2011). How these advertisements could relate the identity of the plaintiff to publications made between June 2014 and May 2015 is unexplained both in the particulars and the plaintiff’s solicitors’ affidavits.
	
	
	The information contained in these advertisements is brief, consisting of a bare statement of specialty and relevant contact details such as telephone numbers. The first and fourth advertisements refer to the plaintiff providing treatment by “magic”. No reference to fees is made, although charging fees of $3,000 is set out as a particular. How the readers of these advertisements could relate the identity of the plaintiff to the contents of the six remaining matters complained of is similarly unexplained.
	



	
	These newspaper advertisements are referred to in the particulars of identification for all publications except the seventh matter complained of (for which no particulars are given). Examination of each matter complained of reveals the tenuous nature of the identification link sought to be drawn.
	


The first and second matters complained of


	
	Although the claims for the first and second matters complained of were abandoned during the hearing by reason of the expiry of the limitation period, it is still important to consider the relationship between the contents of these publications and the particulars of identification because the plaintiff did not abandon these claims until well into the hearing.
	
	
	The defendant contends that, while the particulars for these publications are deficient, they are no more deficient than the particulars for the remaining publications, and that the court should draw an inference that the plaintiff deliberately allowed the limitation period to expire in relation to these two publications, a relevant factor to the success of the defendant’s application: Itek Graphix Pty Ltd v Elliott (2002) 54 NSWLR 207 (“Itek Graphix”).
	
	
	The first matter complained of is as follows:
	


“Published soon

Panorama wrote [sic]:

“We are going to publish real stories related by the sons of the Iraqi and Arab communities who fell victims to the swindle of an imposter who claims to undo magic and decode ambiguities…Thousands of dollars were stolen from them in the [sic] broad daylight.”


	
	This two-sentence article appeared in the same edition of Panorama (under the heading “Published soon”) as the second matter complained of.
	
	
	The imputations pleaded to arise from this matter complained of are (paragraph 8 of the Statement of Claim):
	



	
	The plaintiff is a thief.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a swindler.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a fraudster.
	



	
	Paragraph 7 of the statement of claim asserts that the plaintiff is identifiable because this brief notice refers to a person “who claims to undo magic and decode ambiguities”, for the following reasons:
	


“The class of persons who understood the First Matter Complained Of to refer to the plaintiff was such persons who read the First Matter Complained Of and knew the nature of the services offered by the Plaintiff through his business; and/or has seen/heard the Plaintiff’s advertisements”.


	
	The second matter complained of is also published on 12 June 2014, but under a different heading, namely “What was Hidden: and “The Fortune of a Magician and an Outgoing Office””. The author is Wedad Al-Farhan. The contents are a generalised smear of an unnamed person who uses the Internet to slander others with his “hypocritical lies”, is guilty of “swindle [sic] and charlatanism” and is “staggering in a loud boisterous laughter”. There is a reference to his being able to “decode the ambiguity with $3,000 and undo magic with $5,000” in the opening paragraph of the publication but there is otherwise no reference to anyone carrying on any kind of business of the kind advertised by the plaintiff.
	
	
	The imputations pleaded to arise are (paragraph 10 of the Statement of Claim):
	



	
	The plaintiff deals in black magic.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a con man.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a swindler.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a fraudster.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a liar who spreads his lies via the internet.
	
	
	The plaintiff lives lavishly on the profits from people he has conned and exploited.
	
	
	The plaintiff deserves hatred because of his behaviour.
	



	
	There could be a link between the first matter’s reference to “an imposter who claims to undo magic and decode ambiguities” and the use of a similar phrase in the opening paragraph of the second matter complained of, but this is not referred to in the particulars of identification, which are as follows.
	


“The Second Matter Complained Of was read by a class of persons who understood the Second Matter Complained Of to refer to the Plaintiff by reason of their knowledge of the following extrinsic facts:

(1) The Second Matter Complained Of refers to decoding ambiguity, undoing magic and the sums of $3,000 and $5,000.

(2) The class of persons who understood the Second Matter Complained of to refer to the Plaintiff was such persons who read the Second Matter Complained Of and knew the nature of the services offered by the Plaintiff through his business and/or the prices charged by the Plaintiff for his services from time to time and/or had seen or heard the Plaintiff’s advertisements.”


	
	As is evident from the text of the advertisements set out above, this information is not contained in the four advertisements produced by the plaintiff during this application as the missing schedule.
	
	
	The similarity of the particulars of identification for all of the matters complained of means that there is substance in the defendant’s submission that the plaintiff allowed the limitation period for the first two matters complained of to expire without commencing proceedings. In addition, the plaintiff sued on them despite knowing that the proceedings were commenced out of time.
	


The third matter complained of


	
	The third matter complained of, written by Wedad Al-Farhan, was published on 26 June 2014 in Panorama under the heading “Starkly Evident”. The text of the matter complained of does not refer to a person carrying on a business as a caster or horoscopes or spiritual healer, let alone charging money for it. The sole reference to “witchcraft” in this publication is to a person who owns “books of sorcery and witchcraft” which he employed when he “directed his Jinni and demonic soldiers to protect Mosul”. This mission failed because the books of sorcery and witchcraft got him “nowhere” and he remained “a stark sorcerer”.
	
	
	The imputations pleaded to arise are (paragraph 12 of the Statement of Claim):
	



	
	The plaintiff deals in black magic and witchcraft.
	
	
	The plaintiff controls demons.
	
	
	The plaintiff exploits innocent people. [Note: this imputation has been deleted in the drafted Amended Statement of Claim.]
	



	
	The particulars of identification are that the third matter complained of refers to a person who has “books of sorcery and witchcraft and is a sorcerer”, but it is not suggested in the particulars that this is a fact true of the plaintiff, or that this fact is known to others. All that is asserted is that the plaintiff is known to an unspecified class of persons to offer services “involving astrology and the removal of negative spells” (paragraph 11 of the statement of claim).
	
	
	Not only is this the weakest of the claims in relation to identification, but proceedings for this publication were commenced one day prior to the expiry of the limitation period. As is set out in more detail below, the failure to prosecute this claim with diligence puts it into a different class to the remaining five matters complained of.
	


The fourth matter complained of


	
	The fourth matter complained of was published in Panorama on 10 July 2015 under the heading “Real Stories: The Hidden was greater”.
	
	
	The fourth matter complained of repeats the words of the first matter complained of about exposing “those who falsely claim that they are versed in the heavenly sciences and humanities” (as the text acknowledges) by giving an example of a person who consulted a “charlatan and imposter” residing in “one of [Sydney’s] classiest residential quarters”. This publication is a lively and sarcastic account of a visit by a customer to a “charlatan”’s office. The unnamed customer recites that he made an appointment after hearing radio advertisements and having “read the advertisements in the newspapers”. The description of the unnamed visitor’s treatment includes a careful description of the office, the treatment offered and a demand for payment of services in the sum $3,000 (reduced to $220 when the customer refused to pay this), and the ultimate acceptance by the provider of the treatments of “$180 in cash”.
	
	
	The imputations pleaded to arise are (paragraph 14 of the Statement of Claim):
	



	
	The plaintiff is a fraudster.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a con man.
	
	
	The plaintiff cheats his customers.
	
	
	The plaintiff is an imposter. [This imputation was deleted in the drafted Amended Statement of Claim.]
	
	
	The plaintiff is a destructive force in society. [This imputation has been amended in the drafted Amended Statement of Claim to read “The plaintiff’s actions have a harmful effect on society”.]
	
	
	The plaintiff lies to his clients.
	
	
	The plaintiff is grotesque. [This imputation has been amended in the drafted Amended Statement of Claim to read “The plaintiff is unpleasant to look at”.]
	
	
	The plaintiff is inept at his work.
	
	
	The plaintiff appears ridiculous when he works.
	
	
	The plaintiff charges excessive fees for his work.
	



	
	The plaintiff asserts he is identifiable because the article refers to:
	



	
	A person who claims “that they are versed in the heavenly sciences and humanities”;
	
	
	A “magician” who advertises on radio and in newspapers;
	
	
	A client’s visit [sic] to a practitioner who reads zodiacs, has a modern office, a treatment bed and a stereo;
	
	
	The practitioner describes himself as a therapist and gets the client to lie on the treatment bed while he moves his hands over the client and speaks verses from the Koran;
	
	
	The practitioner claims that the client is “haunted and possessed” and offers an amulet to “dismantle the possession”; and,
	
	
	The practitioner charges $3,000.
	



	
	These facts are asserted to be known to persons who knew the office layout, nature and costs of the plaintiff’s business, or had seen or heard his advertisements in the newspapers or on radio.
	


The fifth matter complained of


	
	The fifth matter complained of was published in Panorama on 2 October 2014 under the heading “Consul General in Sydney Refutes the Allegations recently propagated and prejudicing the Consulate General in Sydney”.
	
	
	The fifth matter complained of refers to a claim by an unknown person that Mr Dawood, the Iraqi Consul-General, “personally backs him and supports his activities”. It then quotes Mr Dawood as denying that he supports this person. There is no mention of witchcraft or sorcery.
	
	
	The imputations pleaded to arise are (paragraph 16 of the Statement of Claim):
	



	
	The plaintiff is a liar.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a social climber. [This imputation was deleted in the drafted Amended Statement of Claim.]
	
	
	The plaintiff is a hypocrite. [This imputation has been amended in the drafted Amended Statement of Claim to read “The plaintiff exploits people and situations for his own gain”.]
	
	
	The plaintiff lied about his relationship with the Iraqi Consul General.
	
	
	The Iraqi Consul General rejected the plaintiff because the plaintiff has agendas that are in conflict with Iraq and the Iraqi people. [This imputation has been amended in the drafted Amended Statement of Claim to read “The Iraqi Consul General rejected the plaintiff socially because the plaintiff has agendas that are in conflict with Iraq and the Iraqi people”.]
	



	
	The particulars of extrinsic facts assert that persons who saw the plaintiff’s photograph on his Facebook page with the Iraqi Consul-General would know that the plaintiff was identified in the matter complained of.
	
	
	I was not provided with these entries. It would not be enough to demonstrate that there were hits on this Facebook page; it would be necessary to show that there was some specific connection, including a time connection, given the uniquely short-term and high-volume nature of publications placed on social media. Again, proper particulars in the form required in Lazarus would be required; without them, this claim is so weak as to face being struck out.
	


The sixth and eighth matters complained of


	
	The sixth matter complained of is an article headed “The Iraqi Ambassador in Australia seeks the help of a juggler to decode the talismans of the Embassy’s scandals in Canberra”. This refers to another Iraqi ambassador, Mr Saleh, having a meeting in Sydney with a group of persons, one of whom is described (using inverted commas) as a “magician” and a “juggler”. The scandal in question is a “brawl” between Mr Saleh and a Ms Khadim, the First Secretary at the Embassy. This magician is described as having been intended “to silence and muzzle the information media or perhaps to help in securing one [sic] to defend him in case of need or necessity”. The magician had failed in this regard, as the conduct of Mr Saleh had been discovered by the media. This is accompanied by a cartoon of a magician waving his arms, apparently weaving a spell.
	
	
	The imputations pleaded to arise are (paragraph 18 of the Statement of Claim):
	



	
	The plaintiff performs black magic. [This imputation was deleted in the drafted Amended Statement of Claim.]
	
	
	The plaintiff conjures demons in an attempt to silence the media.
	
	
	The plaintiff is arrogant and pompous.
	
	
	The plaintiff assisted the ambassador of Iraq in attempting to inappropriately cover up information that was being investigated.
	



	
	One of the particulars of identification is that this cartoon depicts the plaintiff. If so, it should explain how this is so. The fact that Mr Saleh consults a “magician” or “juggler” to help him resolve problems arising from his “brawl” with Ms Khadim is not sufficient, without proper particularisation, to identify the plaintiff.
	
	
	The sixth matter complained of appears to be the article referred to in the eighth matter complained of, also written by Tareq Al-Haris, which refers to “intruders on the information and the media field, including the sorcerers, the magicians, the swindlers and the illiterates”. He thanks the members of the public who wrote to him about “my previous article” which concerned “a sorcerer and swindler” who gave advice to Mr Saleh, the Iraqi ambassador referred to in the sixth matter complained of.
	
	
	The eighth matter complained of was published in Panorama on 21 May 2015 (not 21 March 2015, as stated in paragraph 23(a) of the statement of claim) under the heading “The Moaning of the People’s Playground. Any threat I receive increases my determination, insistence… even madness”.
	
	
	The imputations pleaded to arise from this final publication are (paragraph 24 of the Statement of Claim):
	



	
	The plaintiff is a sorcerer.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a magician. [This imputation was deleted in the drafted Amended Statement of Claim.]
	
	
	The plaintiff is a swindler. [This imputation has been amended in the drafted Amended Statement of Claim to read “The plaintiff is a con-man”.]
	
	
	The plaintiff is illiterate.
	
	
	The plaintiff is an intruder. [This imputation was deleted in the drafted Amended Statement of Claim.]
	
	
	The plaintiff is unintelligent.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s line of work in the radio media industry is questionable. [This imputation has been amended in the drafted Amended Statement of Claim to read “The plaintiff’s work in the radio media industry is worthless”.]
	
	
	The plaintiff and the Iraqi Ambassador are socially connected. [This imputation was deleted in the drafted Amended Statement of Claim.]
	
	
	The plaintiff issued a threatening letter to the Newspaper. [This imputation was deleted in the drafted Amended Statement of Claim.]
	



	
	The only particulars of identification provided (paragraph 23) are that the matter complained of refers to “sorcerers”, “magicians” and “swindlers” and that anyone who had read one or more of the previous publications would know that these referred to the plaintiff. That is not a proper particular, since the matter complained of is clearly referring to the incident involving Mr Saleh; the plaintiff appears to have assumed that the mere reference to “magician” means that he is entitled to sue, but the mere reference to an occupation, without more, does not entitle all members of that occupation (whether they have advertised in the defendant’s newspaper or not) to sue. As is the case with all other particulars of identification, there is no compliance with the requirements set out in Lazarus.
	


The seventh matter complained of


	
	The seventh matter complained of was published in Panorama on 5 March 2015 under the heading “What great difference between the two nomenclatures”. The imputations pleaded to arise are (paragraph 21 of the Statement of Claim):
	



	
	The plaintiff is a coward.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a heretic. [This imputation was deleted in the drafted Amended Statement of Claim.]
	
	
	The plaintiff is a criminal. [This imputation was deleted in the drafted Amended Statement of Claim.]
	
	
	The plaintiff is a thief who preys on innocent people. [This imputation has been amended in the drafted Amended Statement of Claim to read “The plaintiff steals from innocent people”.]
	
	
	The plaintiff is a fraudster and con-man. [This imputation has been repleaded in the drafted Amended Statement of Claim to read “The plaintiff is a fraudster”, with an additional imputation (imputation (f)) “The plaintiff is a con-man” added.]
	



	
	The seventh matter complained of, also written by Tareq Al-Haris, refers to receiving a “threatening letter” which the author advises now “rests at the bottom of the garbage bin”. The person who sent the letter is described as “a charlatan and confidence trickster” but there is no reference to his being a magician.
	
	
	No particulars of identification are pleaded for this publication. Paragraph 19 of the statement of claim states that the plaintiff’s solicitors sent a Concerns Letter on or about 27 February 2015, but does not set out how readers of the 5 March 2015 matter complained of would have identified the (unnamed) plaintiff or name the person (or groups of persons) who did so. Clearly publication can only be established for readers who identified the plaintiff through knowledge of those extrinsic facts, and this should be pleaded with precision. No attempt to do so was made in the draft statement of claim produced during the hearing.
	


The defendant’s objections to the pleadings


	
	The defendant’s principal objection is to the failure to particularise proper facts and matters giving rise to identification. Rule 15.19 UCPR provides:
	


“(1) The particulars required by rule 15.1 in relation to a statement of claim seeking relief in relation to the publication of defamatory matter must include the following:

(a) particulars of any publication on which the plaintiff relies to establish the cause of action, sufficient to enable the publication to be identified,

(b) particulars of any publication, circulation or distribution of the matter complained of or copy of the matter complained of on which the plaintiff relies on the question of damages, sufficient to enable the publication, circulation or distribution to be identified,

(c) if the plaintiff alleges that the matter complained of had a defamatory meaning other than its ordinary meaning-particulars of the facts and matters on which the plaintiff relies to establish that defamatory meaning, including:

(i) full and complete particulars of the facts and matters relied on to establish a true innuendo, and

(ii) by reference to name or class, the identity of those to whom those facts and matters were known,

(d) if the plaintiff is not named in the matter complained of-particulars of identification of the plaintiff together with the identity, by reference to names and addresses or class of persons, of those to whom any such particulars were known, and

(e) particulars of the part or parts of the matter complained of relied on by the plaintiff in support of each pleaded imputation.

(2) Such of the following as is applicable must be filed and served with a statement of claim seeking relief in relation to the publication of defamatory matter (or any amended statement of claim) and be referred to in the statement of claim or amended statement of claim:

(a) a legible photocopy of the original publication or, in the case of an internet, e-mail or other computer displayed publication, a printed copy,

(b) a typescript, with numbered lines, of:

(i) if the original publication is in English-the text of the original publication, or

(ii) otherwise-a translation of the text of the original publication.

(3) Subrule (2)(b) must be complied with in respect of radio and television publications.” (Italics added)


	
	The main complaint is the plaintiff’s failure to provide proper extrinsic facts and particulars of identification.
	


The identification issue


	
	In Lazarus (at 191-192), Hunt J stated:
	


“The plaintiff should also have given in his Statement of Claim particulars of the identity of the persons to whom the publication is alleged to have been made. The identity of those persons (either general or precise) is of vital importance to a defendant in almost every defamation action, whether the publication was oral or in writing. In both cases, the defence of qualified privilege will depend upon the defendant being able to establish that those persons to whom he is alleged to have published the matter complained of had a legitimate interest in the matter so published. The difference between substantial or trivial damages (Fullam v Newcastle Chronicle & Journal Ltd (supra), at 659), and the application of the defence of unlikelihood of harm afforded by s 13 of the Defamation Act (Chappell v Mirror Newspapers Ltd (Court of Appeal, 14.6.1984, unreported), at 13), will depend in both cases upon the identity (general or precise) of those to whom the matter complained of was published.”


	
	These principles extend to publication in newspapers (Lazarus at 193). They also extend to publications on the Internet, because of the concurrent obligation to provide particulars of publication in the form of the date and place of downloading: Dow Jones & Co Inc v Gutnick (2002) 210 CLR 575.
	
	
	These principles are the basis of r 15.19 UCPR. The statement of claim does refer to a “class” of persons, but calling a group of persons a “class” does not make them a class, or satisfy the requirements of the test set out and discussed by the Court of Appeal in Younan v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCA 335. The first step is to identify, with some precision, the extrinsic facts which the readers needed to possess. The second step is to identify that the matter complained of was published to a person or persons who had such knowledge at the time of reading the article:
	


“[14] As the plaintiffs’ Amended Statement of Claim recognised, it is an essential element of a claim in defamation that the plaintiff prove that the published statements were made “of and concerning the plaintiff” (Steele v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1974] 2 NSWLR 348 at 371). If, as here, the matter complained of did not expressly mention the plaintiff and the identity of the plaintiff as a person referred to would only be known to readers who had knowledge of special circumstances, it is necessary for the plaintiff to prove, first, that the matter complained of was published to a person or persons who had such knowledge and believed that the plaintiff was referred to (Steele at 373 - 4).”


	
	That is something of a problem here, given the gap in time between the advertisements and the publications. That brings me to the next aspect of the test, which the NSW Court of Appeal explains as follows:
	


“[17] Secondly, for a plaintiff to succeed he or she is required to prove that not only were there readers of the article who, on the basis of the extrinsic facts of which they had knowledge, believed it to be referring to the plaintiffs, but also that those persons were “ordinary sensible readers” who could reasonably have come to that conclusion (Steele at 374).

[18] Whether identification has been established at trial is a question of fact, in the case of a jury trial, for the jury. Whether the evidence is capable of establishing it is a question of law (Knupffer v London Express Newspaper Ltd [1944] AC 116 at 121). Thus it is a question of law for the judge “to decide whether on the evidence an ordinary sensible man could draw an inference that the article referred to the plaintiff” (Universal Communication Network v Chinese Media Group (Aust) Pty Ltd [2008] NSWCA 1; Aust Torts Reports 81-932; at [43] quoting Morgan v Odhams Press Ltd [1971] 1 WLR 1239 at 1245). Unless an affirmative answer can be given to the question of law, the case should not, in the case of a jury trial, be left to the jury (Steele at 364 - 5).

[19] On the assumption that the present plaintiffs’ pleading and particulars defined the ambit of the evidence that they would be able to lead at the trial, the analogous question of law of whether the plaintiffs’ allegations were, if proved by evidence, capable of proving the identification element of the plaintiffs’ cause of action was able to be determined prior to the trial, with a view to dismissal of the proceedings if the answer was in the negative. This was the course taken by the primary judge, utilising the provisions of UCPR Pt 28 allowing for separate determination of questions arising in proceedings. As explained by Hunt J in Love v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1980] 2 NSWLR 112 at 122 and following, in the defamation context, as in others, this procedure is distinct from the court’s jurisdiction to strike out proceedings as manifestly groundless (or indeed to give summary judgment) where the principles stated in General Steel Industries Inc v Cmr for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69; 112 CLR 125 (and more recently in Spencer v Commonwealth [2010] HCA 28; 241 CLR 118) are applicable. That jurisdiction is presently to be found in UCPR Pt 13, concerned with summary disposal, and UCPR r 14.28, concerning the striking out of pleadings.

[20] Unlike the summary disposal or strike out jurisdiction, where the question for the court is, in effect, whether the opponent’s point is unarguably bad, determination of a point as a separate question simply requires its consideration as on a final hearing, that is, whether it has been established on the balance of probabilities. The circumstances in which it is appropriate to order under Pt 28 that a separate question be determined need not be discussed here as there was no challenge to the primary judge’s decision to take that course. It is sufficient to note that that course will often be appropriate where, as here, the determination of a question of law in one way will dispose of the proceedings.

[21] Notwithstanding that the General Steel Industries approach was inapplicable in the present case, the parties proceeded before the primary judge upon the basis that it did apply. Nevertheless, that is not of significance because the question separately determined here itself involved, as does the General Steel Industries approach, a consideration of possibilities. That is, the question required consideration of whether an ordinary sensible reader (with the particularised extrinsic knowledge) could reasonably have come to the conclusion that the article referred to the plaintiffs. The parties, and the primary judge, treated this as the question for determination and did not suggest, based on the General Steel Industries principles, that it was necessary to consider whether it was unarguable that ordinary sensible readers could not have come to that conclusion.”


	
	The role played by particulars of extrinsic facts and identification in this exercise is vital. A party cannot say, as the plaintiff does here, that these are particulars which can be added to after discovery (a course unlikely to be productive of such information in any event), or at the trial. The particulars which are provided need to be sufficient when pleaded, as the court went on to stress at [22]:
	


“[22] Returning to the assumption I made earlier concerning the role of the particulars in the present case (see [19] above), I note that before this Court the plaintiffs contended that their particulars would not have confined the evidence that they could have led at the trial. I do not accept this to be the case. Pleadings and particulars “enable the relevance and admissibility of evidence to be determined at the trial” (Dare v Pulham [1982] HCA 70; 148 CLR 658 at 664). A plaintiff will not be restricted by his or her particulars if evidence extending beyond the particulars is led without objection and a broader issue than particularised is litigated, but the particulars should subsequently be amended to conform with the evidence (ibid; Water Board v Moustakas [1988] HCA 12; 180 CLR 491 at 497). That a defendant may choose not to object at a trial to evidence going beyond the plaintiff’s particulars or that the court may at a trial give a plaintiff leave to amend his or her particulars, does not derogate from the principle that the plaintiff’s pleadings and particulars define the ambit of his or her case and thus provide a proper basis for assessing whether the plaintiff’s case should be permitted to go to trial.”


	
	Evidence of publication to a person or a class of persons knowing the extrinsic facts is essential for the following reasons:
	



	
	The cause of action is not complete without evidence of publication to a third party.
	
	
	The extent of publication may be relevant to the defences to be pleaded (for example, the very nature of the class may indicate duty and interest features relevant for qualified privilege at common law).
	
	
	The particulars of identification may be relevant to limitation issues: Emmerton v University of Sydney (1970) 2 NSWR 633.
	



	
	It is for all these reasons that Hunt J warned (in Lazarus at 194) that the plaintiff must “name those persons, or suffer the loss of his action“.
	
	
	The problem with the generalised references to advertisements is that the subject matter and the references to the person(s) the subject of the matters complained of vary greatly from one article to the next. The mere fact that the plaintiff advertised his services as a fortune teller or faith healer on radio and in the defendant’s newspaper in the years prior to publication of one or more of the matters complained of is not sufficient, without more, to be capable of identifying him in each of the publications. Only the fourth matter complained of even refers to these advertisements, or to the plaintiff carrying on the kind of business that he advertises.
	
	
	There are statements of fact in the matters complained of suggesting that they are referring to each other, such as the sixth and eighth publications. Where identification is asserted to arise by reference to another publication (for example, the reference to the sixth matter complained of in the eighth matter complained of), that should be particularised, with careful attention to the identities of the persons who identified the plaintiff by reason of that reference.
	
	
	The particulars of identification for all of the matters complained of fail the identification test to be exercised by the judge hearing the challenge (Younan v Nationwide News Pty Ltd at [22]). Who are the readers who know the facts in question, and when and where did they read the relevant matter complained of? How did the fact that the plaintiff advertised his horoscope and faith healing skills, on unknown occasions between 2008 and 2013, lead to his being identified by those persons in each publication? On the particulars as they currently stand, all particulars, except possibly those for the fourth matter complained of, are “unarguably bad” (Younan v Nationwide News Pty Ltd at [20]).
	
	
	The plaintiff’s failure to identify himself with precision by reason of the details in the matters complained of is difficult to understand. For example, if he was present at the meeting with Mr Saleh and/or took steps to prevent media coverage of his “brawl” with the Ms Khadim, those are matters which it would be easy to particularise. Similarly, the plaintiff should identify with precision the advertising or other promotional material in which he stated that he had the backing of Mr Dawood and set out how those who read that material identified him as the person referred to in the fifth matter complained of.
	
	
	These problems are only added to by the proposal to enlarge the six remaining publications by a claim that they were published on the Internet. A pleading that publication was made on the Internet is insufficient, without more, in establishing publication: Creative Resins International Ltd v Glassam Europe Ltd [2006] All ER (D) 178; Jenman v McIntyre [2013] NSWSC 1100. However, that issue is not yet before the court.
	
	
	The particulars as they currently stand do not sufficiently explain how the plaintiff is identified. Failure to provide proper particulars of identification was for many years regarded as an insufficient basis for the dismissal of proceedings: John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd v Farley (Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, Gallop, Burchett, Gummow JJ, 2 May 1994, unreported). That is no longer the case, given the approach taken by the Court of Appeal in Younan v Nationwide News Ltd, at [20] – [22].
	
	
	This brings me to the other bases upon which Ms Amato submits that the claim should be struck out.
	


Want of prosecution and delay in defamation litigation


	
	How should the issue of delay in litigation be approached? The parties each relied upon different approaches to this issue over the past 15 years. Mr Walton relies upon the principles enunciated in Hoser v Hartcher [1999] NSWSC 17. Ms Amato relies upon Kang v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2015] NSWSC 893, which in turn endorses the principles set out in Bi v Mourad [2010] NSWCA 17.
	
	
	Mr Walton submits that the Hoser v Hartcher checklist has not been made out here. In particular, a delay of three years was considered acceptable. In the present case, there has only been delay since August 2015, a matter of a few months.
	
	
	Hoser v Hartcher has been cited with approval by the New South Wales Court of Appeal (Dank v Cronulla Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club Ltd [2014] NSWCA 288 at [103]), Supreme Court (Templar v Watt [2014] NSWSC 937) and Administrative Decisions Tribunal (Fei v Director-General, Department of Commerce (State of NSW) (No 2) [2009] NSWADT 109 at [58], cited most recently in Whiteoak v State of New South Wales [2012] NSWADT 135).
	
	
	In Bi v Mourad Sackville AJA stated at [41]:
	


“[41] The Judicial Registrar stated the principles governing the application in terms which recognise that the ultimate question is whether, having balanced the prejudice to each party, justice demands that the application be dismissed. On one view, the statement of principle derived from the judgment of Simpson J in Hoser v Hartcher [1999] NSWSC 527 may be somewhat too generous to the claimants: cf Hans Pet Constructions Pty Ltd v Cassar [2009] NSWCA 230; Aon Risk Services Pty Ltd v Australia National University [2009] HCA 27; 239 CLR 175; Civil Procedure Act, ss 56–60. In any event, her Honour’s statement of the relevant principles reveals no error.”


	
	Allsop P concurred at [46] with Sackville AJA’s additional comments and went on to state at [49]:
	


“[49] In particular, I would like to add that careful attention to the Civil Procedure Act and ss 56–60 is what is required in each case. While I in no way criticise the terms of Hoser v Hartcher as laid down at the time that decision was made and without wishing to be critical in any way of it, I would say that the surest guide to be employed in any exercise of the discretion of this kind is a careful attention to the terms of the Civil Procedure Act, in particular ss 56–60.”


	
	Young JA disagreed, and restated the principles of Hoser v Hartcher, and it remains a decision to be followed.
	
	
	However, there are some reasons for care in relation to its application:
	



	
	The subsequent enactment of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), especially ss 56-60; see the comments to this effect of Allsop P and Sackville A-JA in Bi v Mourad as set out above.
	
	
	Hoser v Hartcher was handed down before major legislative changes were made to defamation legislation and also to defamation case management in New South Wales (such as the reduction of the limitation period to one year) and the adoption of Practice Notes in the Supreme and District Courts. Although the uniform defamation legislation means that interstate practice decisions are often cited with approval, Hoser v Hartcher has never even been referred to outside New South Wales.
	
	
	Where Hoser v Hartcher has been applied, this has been only in a general sense, with modifications, as was the case in Fei v Director-General, Department of Commerce (State of NSW) (No 2).
	
	
	The checklist in Hoser v Hartcher is limited to the facts of that case, namely a simple delay of 3 years in prosecuting a claim, and does not refer to other delay issues such as commencing on or shortly before expiry of the limitation period, deliberately allowing the limitation period to expire before commencing proceedings, inadequate pleadings, or failure to comply with timetables. Those kinds of delays may require examination of other principles. In particular, the decision should not be read as endorsing delays of three or more years in litigation.
	



	
	Ms Amato referred to the approach taken by McCallum J in Kang v Australian Broadcasting Corporation, where a similarly short period of time was involved, and the plaintiff was for part of that time a litigant in person. I commend the approach taken by McCallum J, but consider that each case must turn on its facts.
	
	
	I formally note submissions made by Mr Walton to the effect that greater importance should be placed on the impact of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) than was the case in Kang v Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In addition to his reliance upon Hoser v Hartcher, Mr Walton submitted that the circumstances in which parties should relist matters needs to be considered in the context of the overriding principles of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW). He argued that Kang v Australian Broadcasting Corporation had a limited application because it turned on its own facts, and that a better explanation of these principles was to be found in Kunc J’s judgment in Tugrul v Tarrants Financial Consultants Pty Limited ACN 086 674 179 (No 5) [2014] NSWSC 437:
	


“[69] First, it must be emphasised that s 56 of the CP Act and its related provisions are not just pious exhortations to be acknowledged and then ignored. They have real consequences for the clients and lawyers in this court and are to be applied rigorously in the conduct of all litigation, great or small.

[70] Second, solicitors and barristers are members of a profession. It is of the essence of a profession that relations between its members are characterised by civility, trust and mutual respect. The court sees far too much correspondence between lawyers that bears none of those qualities. They must never be abandoned at the behest of clients or in the misguided belief that that is what successful representation of a client requires.

[71] Third, many interlocutory issues can be solved or at least better understood by a simple telephone call. It has been suggested that some lawyers no longer speak to their opponents on the telephone for fear of being “verballed“ in an affidavit. If that is true, then it is a retrograde development which the CP Act gives legislative authority to the profession to reverse.

[72] Fourth, if one party requires information or an explanation from another, then the request should be reasonable and focused. A clear justification for the request should be given.

[73] Fifth, faced with a reasonable request, the recipient should not automatically respond with an unthinking denial of legal entitlement to the information. The obligation to facilitate the overriding purpose will sometimes require information or an explanation to be given to which the party may not be “legally“ entitled. Furthermore, if it is information which would be required to be produced in response to a subpoena or notice to produce then it is contrary to the s 56 obligations of a party and that party‘s lawyers to resist providing it unless and until the court‘s process is invoked. If there is concern for the confidence of such material then an undertaking of the kind considered in Hearne v Street [2008] HCA 36 ; (2008) 235 CLR 125 (which would apply if the information were provided under compulsion) should be sought and given.

[74] Sixth, the filing of a motion should be regarded as a last resort. It will inevitably add to costs, and delay the progress of the matter to hearing.

[75] Seventh, no motion should be filed without the putative respondent being given final, written notice of the relief to be sought, the reason for it and a reasonable opportunity to respond. The court sees far too many examples of deadlines of a day or less being set in correspondence. My own view, as a rule of thumb, is that three clear business days is reasonable to allow for a response on any matter of substance. If the recipient requires more time to obtain instructions, then they should send a prompt request with an explanation to that effect and an indication of when a proper reply will be provided. In relation to challenges to pleadings it was once the practice for opposing counsel to confer before a strike out motion was filed. To the extent that practice has been lost, it should resurrected.

[76] Eighth, once a motion is filed, the parties are obliged to ensure that only the real or essential issues are litigated. This calls for discrimination in both the preparation of evidence and argument. As to the former, real thought must be given to the precise evidence required. The practice of exhibiting “everything“ or “the file“ to provide an evidentiary cornucopia from which only a few morsels are ultimately selected to be referred to in argument is completely unacceptable. Where it becomes apparent that an application or argument is unsustainable, it should be abandoned, and that abandonment notified to the other parties, at the earliest opportunity.

[77] Ninth, where delay or unnecessary expense has been caused by conduct which is contrary to the obligations of parties and their lawyers under s 56 and its related provisions, parties and lawyers should not be in any doubt that in appropriate cases the court will exercise its power in relation to costs (see s 56(5) of the CP Act) to provide some measure of justice in response to such conduct.”


	
	Mr Walton stated that none of these steps had been embarked upon by the defendant, who had brought this application hastily, in circumstances where they themselves had started the ball rolling by seeking an adjournment of four weeks.
	
	
	These submissions are of no assistance. First, the defendant has in fact taken precisely the approach recommended by Kunc J, in that, rather than bringing a summary dismissal claim or lengthy interlocutory arguments, the plaintiff was given two opportunities to replead, a third opportunity to provide documents, and plenty of notice of this application. The reluctance of the plaintiff’s legal advisers even to provide the amended statement of claim that was supposedly “ready to be filed” is indicative of the plaintiff’s unexplained reluctance to proceed.
	
	
	Second, the situation in these proceedings has gone beyond the problems outlined by Kunc J.
	
	
	Third, the observations of Kunc J did not relate to defamation proceedings, and the approach of McCallum J in Kang v Australian Broadcasting Corporation should be preferred.
	
	
	This brings me to a consideration of r 12.7 UCPR and s 61(3)(a) Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW).
	


Defamation litigation and the “reluctant gladiator”


	
	As noted above, the defendant’s application is brought on two bases:
	



	
	Rule 12.7 UCPR, namely dismissal for want of due dispatch; or
	
	
	Section 61(3)(a) Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), namely dismissal for failure to comply with court directions.
	



	
	The relevant considerations for r 12.7 and s 61 generally (which are usually dealt with interchangeably where, as is the case here, both kinds of delay are involved) were most recently considered by Macfarlan JA in Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd [2015] NSWCA 334 at [37]-[44], and may be summarised as follows:
	



	
	Where there is delay, the explanation or excuse which is offered is relevant, as is the satisfactoriness (or otherwise) of that explanation or excuse;
	
	
	Evidence of particular prejudice to the opposing party by reason of the delay may be relevant (at [40]);
	
	
	The principles underlying ss 56-60 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) are of fundamental importance when determining applications for dismissal for want of due dispatch.
	



	
	Although not referred to explicitly in any of the judgments set out above, I consider it relevant to note that there are different types of delay in defamation litigation. These are as follows:
	



	
	In Itek Graphix there was only one cause of action, unlike defamation claims, where there may be a number. Although there is no statement directly to this effect in decisions concerning delay, where a plaintiff has deliberately allowed a limitation period to expire without commencing proceedings, that should be viewed as a significant handicap to indulgences granted where there is delay in the litigation concerning proceedings which are commenced within time.
	
	
	It has long been recognised that a plaintiff who commences an action at the very end of the limitation period and thereafter conducts the proceedings in a dilatory fashion does so at his or her peril. This is particularly the case in relation to the third matter complained of in these proceedings. In Campbell v Regional Publishers Pty Ltd (Supreme Court of NSW, 30 October 1998), Levine J stated:
	


“Where the plaintiff has been ""late"" in the initiation of proceedings, first, the quality of the remedy sought in defamation will or could be, severely affected both in terms of quantum and costs; and secondly, the requirement in a plaintiff diligently to prosecute the action will be one that demands strict adherence to the Rules of Court or directions given”.


	
	Delay in litigation may be a deliberate tactic, or may be due to incompetence, or to some very good reason, such as ill health. Failure to differentiate between these reasons and to deal with the reason for delay can lead to unfairness or injustice: Facer v Wolfe (2013) 17 DCLR 391. These issues are relevant when considering a range of delaying behaviours, such as failure to comply with orders, overuse of the court system or action which is not constructive.
	


Lack of constructive action


	
	Ms Amato submits that no constructive action has been taken since the Statement of Claim was filed in circumstances of some haste by reason of the looming limitation period for the third matter complained. Ms Amato particularly points to the following:
	



	
	The failure to provide the matters complained of in full and proper form;
	
	
	The failure to provide the schedule referred to in the pleading as “schedule @@@” despite being directed to do so on two occasions (13 August and 10 September 2015), which are the essence of the plaintiff’s case on identification;
	
	
	The failure to serve the foreshadowed proposed Amended Statement of Claim despite consenting on three occasions to orders that they do so (13 August, 10 September and 7 October 2015). Additionally, although Ms Audisho confirms “that the advertisements have all been translated and the Amended Statement of Claim is ready to be filed” (affidavit of Ms Natalie Audisho sworn 17 November 2015, paragraph 35), it was only produced in answer to a call by Ms Amato for this document during the course of this application, on the basis that it was referred to in an affidavit. Ms Amato, having read that document, submits that it is just as deficient as its predecessor.
	



	
	Ms Amato particularly relies upon what she calls the unsatisfactory nature of the explanation for the delay. There is no affidavit by the plaintiff or the translator, but the explanations of problems with translations set out at paragraphs 26 and 29 of Ms Audisho’s affidavit of 17 November 2015 are difficult to accept. Those conversations are (paragraphs 26 and 29 of Ms Audisho’s affidavit):
	


“26. On or around 18 October 2015, the plaintiff and I had a conversation to the following effect:”

Plaintiff: I have found some old articles dated from 2008 which include advertisements in the Panorama newspaper. I have spoken to the translator Mike Nasir. He told me it will take about four (4) weeks to complete the translations and that they will be extremely costly, even though Mike provides these services to me at a reduced cost.

Me: I understand but we need to have them.

…

29. I contacted the translator, Mike Nasir and we had a conversation to the following effect:

Me: We need the translations as soon as possible.

Nasir: These articles are extremely complex. They will take at least a month.

Me: It’s a matter of urgency. Can you do them any faster please?

Nasir: I can’t make promises but I will try to complete all the translations within two (2) weeks. The words are extremely difficult and hard to translate into the English language.

Me: Thank you, I appreciate it. I will get advice on what is the minimum we need so maybe you can just do those.”


	
	Ms Amato’s criticisms of the inconsistency and unreliability of this evidence are well-founded. The conduct of all the plaintiff’s legal advisers was incompetent, and is acknowledged to be so, and Ms Audisho’s attempt to blame the translator does not put her in a good light. However, courts should be cautious about visiting the consequences of such incompetence on the litigant (Dijakovic v Perez [2015] NSWCA 174), particularly where the cause of action is complex and the client entirely reliant upon expert advice.
	


Conclusions


	
	The plaintiff has an inadequately drafted statement of claim for which he does not seek leave to amend. The amount of delay is small in terms of time, and the principal problem is want of constructive action, rather than failure to comply with an order to amend to correct an error the subject of court rulings. The prejudice to the defendant is the costs of the proceedings, a prejudice which can be readily resolved by appropriate costs orders.
	
	
	The deficiencies in the plaintiff’s statement of claim have not yet been the subject of argument. Some are frankly shameful, such as the commencing of proceedings for two claims which are out of time; others may be capable of rectification, although the degree to which one or more of the causes of action can be rescued is unclear. What course should the court take – strike out the proceedings now, or order the plaintiff to provide the missing information?
	
	
	In the course of the hearing, much of the missing information – the missing matters complained of and the advertisements – was provided. The real difficulty is that, until the plaintiff provides proper particulars of identification and of extrinsic facts (these being largely unchanged in the proposed amended statement of claim provided during the hearing), there seems little point in these proceedings continuing.
	


Should the plaintiff be permitted to continue the proceedings and, if so, on what terms?


	
	The current statement of claim would not survive an application for it to be struck out, and the draft amended statement of claim is no better. The plaintiff’s unwillingness to amend to correct obvious pleading errors is hard to understand. Whether it is in the hope of going to trial without disclosing weaknesses in the case, or due to the same incompetence that has been admitted to in Ms Audisho’s affidavit, it certainly puts the plaintiff in a difficult position.
	
	
	Ms Amato submits that the plaintiff should not be permitted to amend because his legal representatives have not sought leave, and that I am not able to make orders which include requiring the plaintiff to amend because his legal advisers have not sought such an order. That would certainly be the case if I were the trial judge, but the role of the case management judge (particularly in a specialist list) is different, as the Queensland Court of Appeal explained in Bidner v Queensland [2000] QCA 368. Nevertheless, Ms Amato would need to be heard on any such application, so I cannot take this step, particularly given the likelihood that claims for publication on the website appear to be foreshadowed if leave to amend is granted.
	
	
	In the course of the hearing, I suggested the adjournment of the argument in order to permit the plaintiff to make a final attempt at either redrafting his particulars, or the whole of the statement of claim, and Mr Walton suggested that this would be possible if he were given 14 days. While I continued to hear the defendant’s application at Ms Amato’s request, I have now come to the view that the appropriate procedure is to consider giving the plaintiff this final opportunity rather than taking the drastic step of striking out the whole claim.
	
	
	My reasons for this are as follows. First, defamation proceedings are complex, and the pleading of extrinsic facts and identification need to be approached with particular care. Mr Walton stated that this was the first time he had drafted a statement of claim for defamation and, while Ms Amato was critical (and indeed suspicious) of this claim, a degree of latitude should be given to relatively inexperienced practitioners, especially where there is a language barrier with the client. Second, while the likelihood of the plaintiff being identifiable in relation to some of the remaining claims is hard to understand, the advertisements and other material set out in the particulars of identification (such as the description of the office and the reference to radio advertising) go some way to suggest that the plaintiff might be the “charlatan and imposter” who attempted to charge a client $3,000 for performing an exorcism (the fourth matter complained of).
	
	
	Although the delays in the present case closely resemble those of Kang v Australian Broadcasting Corporation, I consider the plaintiff should be given a last chance to articulate identification and extrinsic facts. This is not a grant of leave to replead, but an order to provide particulars of extrinsic facts and identification for the remaining five claims for defamation on the statement of claim as currently pleaded (namely in relation to the print publication only). If those particulars are adequate, the issue of what leave to replead the plaintiff may seek, and should be granted, may then be clarified.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s legal representatives have had plenty of opportunity, since the hearing of this motion, to reflect on the inadequacies of their pleadings, having had the benefit of Ms Amato’s insightful analysis of the failure to provide proper particulars of identification and extrinsic facts. They should therefore be able to provide these particulars in the period of time I have allotted.
	
	
	However, the manner in which those particulars should be provided should be not only prompt, but with verification and in affidavit form. This was the course adopted by Levine J in Campbell v Regional Publishers Pty Ltd, where proceedings were commenced late and conducted in a dilatory fashion by a plaintiff who provided inadequate particulars of identification. Levine J stated:
	


“Complaint has been made, as I have noted, as to the form and adequacy of the particulars of extrinsic facts and identification. I consider it appropriate that when redrafted, these particulars be verified, not only conformably with the statements of Hunt J in Lazarus v Deutsche Luftansa AG (1985) 1 NSWLR 189 at 192-196 and Brown & Anor v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1973-98) A Def R 40,061 at 40,063, but also at this late stage to present a clear case to the defendant on those issues and to that extent on the ambit or extent of publication it will have to meet.”


	
	The particulars of extrinsic facts and identification for each remaining publication should be made with verification by the plaintiff who, if those particulars are inadequate, may then be cross-examined about them. There must be a separate set of particulars for each publication, including the publication on 5 March 2015, for which there are currently no particulars of identification, and those particulars should name the person or persons who identified the plaintiff.
	
	
	I have accordingly made a self-executing order that the particulars for the five remaining publications be provided, in this form, by Wednesday 9 December 2015 at 4 pm, and these proceedings will be listed on Thursday 10 December 2015 at 9 am for directions so that the defendant can then consider its position.
	


Costs


	
	Proceedings should never have been commenced in relation to the publications which are the first and second matters complained of, as they were known to the plaintiff’s legal representatives to be out of time. Ms Audisho acknowledged the first and second matters complained of were out of time in her affidavit:
	


“3. The Statement of Claim was filed on 25 June 2015. There was some urgency to file the Statement of Claim because the limitation period on the First and Second matters complained of had expired and the limitation period on the Third Matter Complained Of was due to expire on 26 June 2015.

4. It was intended that an application would be made to extend the limitation period on the First and Second Matters Complained of on the basis that the Concerns Letter had been served prior to the expiry of limitation. However, this plan was later abandoned.” (Affidvait of Natalie Audisho sworn 17 November 2015)


	
	The plaintiff’s failure to amend to exclude these claims (despite being granted leave on 13 August or 7 October 2015) and his persistence with them until part way through this hearing may be the subject of an application for an order for costs other than on the usual basis. I shall, however, wait for the parties to address me on this issue before determining it, as well as the issue of what costs order should be made in relation to the costs of the third matter complained of. Proceedings are at an end for these three causes of action, and the parties should address s 67 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) in this regard.
	
	
	As I have taken the precaution of leaving the defendant’s application on foot, I propose to determine all costs issues after the defendant has had an opportunity to consider her position following production of the revised particulars of identification. This will also enable the plaintiff’s legal advisers, given their acknowledgement of mistakes and oversights, to consider whether they should offer to bear the burden of any costs order that is made.
	
	
	Costs are accordingly reserved, with liberty to apply.
	


Orders


	
	The plaintiff’s claims for defamation for publication of the first and second matters complained of on 12 June 2014 are struck out and dismissed pursuant to s 14B Limitation Act 1969 (NSW).
	
	
	The plaintiff’s claim for defamation for publication of the third matter complained of on 26 June 2014 is struck out and dismissed pursuant to s 61 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and r 12.7 UCPR.
	
	
	A self-executing order that the plaintiff is to serve particulars of extrinsic facts and identification for each of the five remaining matters complained of (published 10 July 2014, 2 October 2014, 6 November 2014, 5 March 2015 and 21 May 2015) by 4pm Wednesday 9 December 2015, such particulars to be provided with verification.
	
	
	The defendant’s application for summary dismissal of the five remaining causes of action is stood over for further hearing after compliance with the steps set out above, and listed for directions on Thursday 10 December 2015 at 9am.
	
	
	Costs reserved with liberty to apply.

		30 November 2015",2015-11-29 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2702377,Application by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police [2015] NSWSC 1799,"Judgment (EX TEMPORE – REVISED)

Introduction


	
	By summons filed in Court today, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (the Commissioner), seeks orders pursuant to s 19 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) (the Act). In support of the summons, the Commissioner relies on the affidavit of Scott Michael Mathews affirmed 30 November 2015. Federal Agent Mathews deposes in paragraph 1 of his affidavit that he is a member of the Australian Federal Police (AFP).
	


Legislative requirements

Section 19 of the Act


	
	Section 19 of the Act provides that a Court with proceeds jurisdiction (which includes this Court) must, if certain conditions are fulfilled, make an order that property not be deposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person. The Court’s obligation to make an order with respect to serious offences is subject to its satisfaction that an appropriate undertaking has been given: s 21 (addressed below).
	
	
	Section 19 provides:
	


“Restraining orders—property suspected of being proceeds of indictable offences etc.

When a restraining order must be made

(1) A court with *proceeds jurisdiction must order that:

(a) property must not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person; or

(b) property must not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person except in the manner and circumstances specified in the order;

if:

(c) a *proceeds of crime authority applies for the order; and

(d) there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is:

(i) the *proceeds of a *terrorism offence or any other *indictable offence, a *foreign indictable offence or an *indictable offence of Commonwealth concern (whether or not the identity of the person who committed the offence is known); or

(ii) an *instrument of a *serious offence; and

(e) the application for the order is supported by an affidavit of an *authorised officer stating that the authorised officer suspects that:

(i) in any case—the property is proceeds of the offence; or

(ii) if the offence to which the order relates is a serious offence—the property is an *instrument of the offence;

and including the grounds on which the authorised officer holds the suspicion; and

(f) the court is satisfied that the *authorised officer who made the affidavit holds the suspicion stated in the affidavit on reasonable grounds.

Property that a restraining order may cover

(2) The order must specify, as property that must not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with, the property specified in the application for the order, to the extent that the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that that property is:

(a) in any case—*proceeds of the offence; or

(b) if the offence to which the order relates is a *serious offence—an *instrument of the offence.

Refusal to make a restraining order

(3) Despite subsection (1), the court may refuse to make a *restraining order in relation to an *indictable offence that is not a *serious offence if the court is satisfied that it is not in the public interest to make the order.

Note: A court can also refuse to make a restraining order if the Commonwealth refuses to give an undertaking: see section 21.

Restraining order need not be based on commission of a particular offence

(4) The reasonable grounds referred to in paragraph (1)(d) need not be based on a finding as to the commission of a particular offence.

Risk of property being disposed of etc.

(5) The court must make a *restraining order even if there is no risk of the property being disposed of or otherwise dealt with.”


	
	The conditions, the fulfilment of which entitle the Commission to an order under s 19(1)(a) or (b) are set out in s 19(1)(c) – (f) of the Act. These will be considered in turn.
	


Section 19(1)(c): application made by a proceeds of crime authority


	
	The Commissioner is a proceeds of crime authority by reason of the definition under s 338 of the Act. Accordingly s 19(1)(c) is fulfilled.
	


Section 19(1)(d): reasonable grounds for suspicion


	
	There must be reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is the proceeds of an indictable offence. The relevant offences are offences against s 142 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth) and an offence contrary to s 400.9(1) of the schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (the Criminal Code), which is contained in Part 10.2 of the Criminal Code.
	
	
	These are both “serious offences” within the meaning of s 338 of the Act, which relevantly includes:
	



	
	unlawful conduct constituted by or relating to a breach of Part 10.2 of the Criminal Code (money‑laundering): paragraph (a)(ii) of the definition of “serious offence”; and
	
	
	an offence against s 142 of the Anti‑Money Laundering and Counter‑Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (conducting transactions so as to avoid reporting requirements relating to threshold transactions): paragraph (ec)(i) of the definition of “serious offence”.
	



	
	Having read the affidavit of Federal Agent Mathews, I am satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property referred in schedule 1 of the summons and to the minute of order is the proceeds of an indictable offence, or indictable offences, within the meaning of s 19(1)(d)(i).
	


Section 19(1)(e): the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer


	
	Section 19(1)(e) provides that it is a condition of the making of an order that the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that the authorised officer suspects, relevantly, that the property is proceeds of the offence. The definition of “authorised officer” in s 338 of the Act includes an AFP member if authorised by the Commissioner.
	
	
	The evidence establishes that Commissioner Negus, by authorisation dated 26 August 2013, authorised all AFP members to be authorised officers under the Act. Accordingly, Federal Agent Mathews is an authorised officer.
	
	
	The condition in s 19(1)(e) is fulfilled by the affidavit of Federal Agent Mathews affirmed 30 November 2015. He sets out the basis for his belief in paragraphs 13 to 47 to his affidavit and summarises those grounds in paragraph 48 of his affidavit.
	


Section 19(1)(f): reasonable grounds


	
	I am required to be satisfied that the officer who made the affidavit holds the suspicion on reasonable grounds. I am satisfied that the matters set out in paragraphs 13 to 47 and summarised in paragraph 48 of the affidavit provide sufficient basis, by way of reasonable grounds, for the suspicion to which Federal Agent Mathews deposes.
	


Other relevant legislative provisions

Section 26(4): application without notice


	
	Section 26(4) of the Act provides that I must consider an application such as the present without notice having been given if the responsible authority requested the Court to do so. Ms Millington, who appears on behalf of the plaintiff in the current application, requests, on behalf of the plaintiff, that I hear the application without notice. Accordingly, I am bound by section 26(4) to do so.
	


Section 21: requirement for undertaking


	
	Section 21 of the Act provides that I may refuse to make a restraining order if the Commonwealth refuses or fails to give the court an appropriate undertaking with respect to the payment of damages or costs (or both) for the making and operation of the order. Ms Millington has, on behalf of the plaintiff, given what I regard as an appropriate undertaking with respect to the payment of damages and costs for the making and operation of the order.
	


Conclusion


	
	For those reasons, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to make the orders set out in the short minute of order, which also notes the plaintiff's undertaking.
	


Orders


	
	Accordingly, I make orders as follows as sought in the short minutes of order which I will sign and date and place with the papers:
	


UPON THE PLAINTIFF PROVIDING, ON BEHALF OF THE COMMONWEALTH, THE USUAL UNDERTAKING AS TO COSTS AND DAMAGES, THE COURT ORDERS THAT:

(1)   Pursuant to rule 6.15 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) the summons filed in these proceedings be made returnable immediately.

(2)   Pursuant to s 26(4) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) (the Act) the application for relief sought in prayers 3 to 6 of these Orders be considered without notice.

Restraining Order

(3)   Pursuant to s 19(1)(b) of the Act the property specified in Schedule One of these Orders must not be disposed of order otherwise dealt with by any person except in the manner and circumstances specified.

Custody and Control Orders

(4)   Pursuant to s 38 of the Act the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (Official Trustee) is to take custody and control of the property specified in Schedule One to the Orders.

(5)   Any orders made be entered forthwith.

SCHEDULE ONE

Funds standing to the credit of Commonwealth Bank of Australia Bank Account Number 062184 11442323 in the name of Lewis Zhen Zhen Yuan, together with any interest earned thereon.

		03 December 2015",2015-11-29 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2702378,R v Dulhunty; R v Roach [2015] NSWSC 1747,"Judgment

INTRODUCTION


	
	The offender Robert Venour Dulhunty (“Dulhunty”) has pleaded guilty to an indictment alleging the following:
	


“Between about 1 May 2007 and about 12 December 2010 at Sydney in the State of NSW, and elsewhere, conspired with Ge Wu and (Roach) to commit an offence contrary to s. 1041A and s. 1311(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), namely to take part in, or carry out, either directly or indirectly, two or more transactions that would have the effect of, or would be likely to have the effect of, creating or maintaining an artificial price for trading in financial products on a financial market operated in this jurisdiction, namely the price for shares in Healthzone Limited (“Healthzone”) contrary to s. 11.5 of the Criminal Code (Cth) and s. 1041A and s. 1311 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).”


	
	The offender Peter Roach (“Roach”) has pleaded guilty to an indictment alleging the following:
	


“Between about 1 May 2007 and about 12 December 2010, at Sydney in the State of NSW, and elsewhere, conspired with Ge Wu and Robert Dulhunty to commit an offence contrary to s. 1041A and s. 1311(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), namely to take part in, or carry out, either directly or indirectly, two or more transactions that would have the effect of, or would be likely to have the effect of, creating or maintaining an artificial price for trading in financial products on a financial market operated in this jurisdiction, namely the price for shares in Healthzone Limited (“Healthzone”) contrary to s. 11.5 of the Criminal Code (Cth) and s. 1041A and s. 1311 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)” (count 1);

“Between about 13 December 2010 and about 7 November 2011, at Sydney in the State of NSW, and elsewhere, conspired with Ge Wu and Robert Dulhunty to commit an offence contrary to s. 1041A and s. 1311(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), namely to take part in, or carry out, either directly or indirectly, two or more transactions that would have the effect of, or would be likely to have the effect of, creating or maintaining an artificial price for trading in financial products on a financial market operated in this jurisdiction, namely the price for shares in Healthzone Limited (“Healthzone”) contrary to s. 11.5 of the Criminal Code (Cth) and s. 1041A and s. 1311 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)” (count 2).


	
	The charge against Dulhunty carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment, or 2000 penalty units, or both. The first of the charges against Roach carries the same maximum penalty. The second of the charges against Roach carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment, or 4500 penalty units, or both. The legislative amendment which increased the maximum penalty explains why there are two charges laid against Roach. However it will be apparent that those two charges cover one continuing conspiracy.
	
	
	The sentence hearing in respect of the co-offender Ge Wu (“Wu”) was originally listed to take place at the same time as the hearings in respect of the present offenders. However following application made by senior counsel for Wu, to which the Crown consented, those proceedings were adjourned. Wu will be sentenced at a later date.
	


THE FACTS


	
	With the consent of senior counsel for each of the present offenders the Crown tendered a lengthy statement of facts which was in the following terms (although Annexures A and B to those facts have not been reproduced in this judgment):
	


OUTLINE OF OFFENCES

1. The offences in this matter relate to a single conspiracy to commit market manipulation regarding the price for shares in Healthzone Ltd (Healthzone), contrary to s 11.5 Criminal Code (Cth) (the Criminal Code) and ss 1041A and 1311(1) Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Corporations Act).

2. Ge (also known as Michael) Wu (Wu), Robert Venour Dulhunty (Dulhunty) and Peter Roach (Roach) (together, the Offenders) were directors of Healthzone. The Offenders agreed to create or maintain an artificial price for shares in Healthzone, from time to time, as required, to support the corporate activities of Healthzone (the agreement).

3. The conspiracy commenced around six months after Healthzone became a publicly listed entity on the Australian Securities Exchange (the ASX) on 6 November 2006 and ended when Healthzone was placed in external administration on 17 November 2011.

4. After Healthzone was placed in administration, ASIC obtained a copy of the Healthzone email server, which contained extensive written communication documenting the involvement of the Offenders in the conspiracy.

5. In summary:

•   Between around 1 May 2007 and around 30 October 2008, Wu and Dulhunty used five trading accounts to carry out 142 trades, involving the purchase of 456,501 shares and an overall investment of $236,629 (the First Period of Offending).

•   Between around 10 November 2008 and around 25 June 2010, Wu, Dulhunty and Roach used eight of their own trading accounts, and used or requested third parties to operate a further 10 trading accounts, including by giving trading instructions to those persons. In total, there were 235 trades, involving the purchase of 1,340,923 shares and an overall investment of $442,846 (the Second Period of Offending).

•   Between around 9 August 2010 and 17 November 2011, Wu and Roach used or requested third parties to operate six trading accounts, including by giving trading instructions to those persons. In total, there were 260 trades, involving the purchase of 2,101,654 shares and an overall investment of $711,122 (the Third Period of Offending).

6. A summary of all trades conducted in furtherance of the conspiracy is set out in Annexure A, and a summary of the volume of shares traded and overall investment is set out in Annexure B.

7. In total, there were 637 trades, involving the purchase of 3,899,078 shares and an overall investment of $1,390,597.

HEALTHZONE LIMITED

8. Healthzone, incorporated on 8 March 2006 and originally known as Natural Health and Beauty Limited, was an Australian company engaged in the distribution and sale of various health products.

9. Between 6 November 2006 and 17 November 2011, following an Initial Public Offering (IPO), Healthzone shares were publicly listed and traded on the ASX under the code “HZL”.

10. As part of the IPO, Healthzone issued a prospectus on 21 September 2006 for an offering of 8,000,000 shares at $0.50 per share. The new shares were to rank equally with 22,923,469 shares already issued.

11. Prior to the IPO, the largest shareholders of the 22,923,469 existing shares in Healthzone were:

•   Wu: 9,948,968 shares (43.4%).

•   Guoguang Tao (the Head of China markets): 8,158,154 shares (35.6%).

•   Dulhunty’s company Development Capital Corporation Pty Ltd (DCC): 1,790,173 shares (7.8%).

12. Each of these shareholders held more than 5% of the issued share capital and were therefore ""substantial shareholders"" and subject to certain disclosure requirements in relation to changes to their shareholdings.

13. Dulhunty and numerous family members also personally held a small number of existing shares (in total approximately 50,000 shares).

14. As part of the IPO, the ASX Listing Rules required at least 400 shareholders holding a parcel of securities with a value of at least $2,000 as a condition of admission to the official list. Email correspondence between Dulhunty and Wu referred to difficulties in attaining the minimum shareholder number (or “spread”) during the IPO period.

15. Accordingly, a large number of Wu's associates and family members subscribed to the Healthzone IPO, including both Wei Wang and Huanzhong Wang, referred to in more detail below.

16. The IPO was managed and underwritten by Intersuisse Ltd (Intersuisse). Andrew Sekely worked for Intersuisse during the First, Second and Third Periods of Offending and, as the broker for Wu, Wei Wang and DCC, was referred to in various communications between the Offenders.

17. After the IPO, Healthzone on two occasions conducted acquisitions of businesses and companies where the purchase was partly funded through the issue of Healthzone shares to the vendors. Healthzone acquired Health Minders Pty Ltd (HMPL) in October 2007 and Jasham International Pty Limited in June 2008. Healthzone had the election to pay 14% of the purchase price by cash or shares. Shares were issued to vendors based on the performance of the businesses and long term weighted average price of Healthzone shares after the businesses were acquired.

18. Healthzone shares were infrequently traded and illiquid stock, and accordingly small trades could cause price movements upwards or downwards. From time to time, the price for Healthzone shares faced downward pressure from selling shareholders.

19. At various times between late 2007 and mid-2010, the Offenders referred to a belief that one such investor in particular, Russell Goodman (Goodman), was exerting downward pressure on the Healthzone share price by placing Sell orders for improper purposes.

20. [Repeat of paragraph 19].

FIRST PERIOD OF OFFENDING, MAY 2007-OCTOBER 2008: WU AND DULHUNTY

Overview

56. In the First Period of Offending, Wu and Dulhunty took action whenever they deemed it necessary to create or maintain an artificial price for Healthzone shares at a level they believed was required in the circumstances. They regularly monitored the price for Healthzone shares as listed on the ASX, often on a daily basis.

57. Wu and Dulhunty communicated with each other, first to inform the other of or to discuss the status of the current share price, and then to agree upon a strategy or plan for trading with the intention of creating or maintaining the price for Healthzone shares at an artificial level.

58. Once Wu and Dulhunty agreed upon a strategy, they would seek to ensure that the necessary trading in Healthzone shares occurred in order to create or maintain the artificial price. The trading was conducted by Dulhunty through his own trading accounts or through his DCC accounts and by Wu operating third party accounts or asking family members to trade based on his instructions.

59. Once the various instructions to buy Healthzone shares were executed, they often had the effect of creating or maintaining an artificial price for Healthzone shares, as intended by Wu and Dulhunty. On other occasions, despite their actions, the share price fell or stayed the same. The pair monitored the effects of their trades and kept in communication with each other so that each was aware of the fact that the planned trading occurred and whether the price moved towards or had reached the desired level.

60. On a number of occasions, Wu and Dulhunty sought to create or maintain an artificial price for Healthzone shares after a ""positive"" ASX announcement, for example on 8 October 2007 (HMPL acquisition), 31 October 2007 (Appendix 4C Quarterly Report), 1 November 2007 (Roach appointed as Executive Chairman), 13 November 2007 (Integration and growth update), 27 November 2007 (following reinstatement and announcement of $6 million placement), and 19 December 2007 (acquisition of Atherton International).

61. Throughout the First Period of Offending from May 2007 to October 2008 there were 142 trades conducted pursuant to the agreement, as follows:

•   Dulhunty used three trading accounts in his name or in the name his company DCC to execute 102 trades, involving the purchase of 370,000 shares and an overall investment of $162,382.

•   Wu used, or asked family members to use, by providing trading instructions, two trading accounts in the names of Wei Wang and Huanzhong Wang. There were a total of 40 trades, involving the purchase of 149,501 shares and an overall investment of $74,248.

62. Examples of the communications and trading for this period are set out below.

5 to 8 May 2007

63. Between 1 January 2007 and 3 May 2007, the price of Healthzone shares dropped from a closing price of 65 cents to a closing price of 34 cents. On 5 May 2007, Dulhunty sent an email to Wu setting out reasons why they should get the price of Healthzone shares up on Monday after a number of company announcements:

“We need to get the share price up straight away on Monday in order to:

* Make the purchase of DS shares at 50c easy for you

* Build momentum quickly upwards (versus downwards)

* Give NAB comfort

* Boost value of shares for potential scrip / mixed scrip acquisitions (MIA, HMPL, Cronulla, more Wild Food)

* Shares to be 50c within 3 weeks for roadshows

* Once shares are 50c, then HZL can use media

* Provide strong defence to any DS potential actions – evidence that the shares dropped with him and spiked upon DS resignation

* Show DS how he harmed the company to discourage DS = as above

* Make my discussions with Intersuisse from late Monday very easy and very compelling for them to get behind HZL and create a market

There’s very good reasons for people we know to buy shares on Monday (after the Wild Food and GVR announcements are posted at 9am on Monday)

* Per the last interim announcement, the FY07 forecast is at the higher end of the range (i.e. $1.9m)

* The intrinsic value of shares at a 10x to 12x PE (still big discount to 16x market) is 60c to 70c (January price)

* 3 positive announcements on Monday

* Roadshows to core brokers to commence in 2-3 weeks

* Hotel ball room roadshows (1 Sydney / 1 Melbourne) to all brokers and institutions in 6-8 weeks

* Media when shares above 50c

* There will never be a better buying opportunity

* For HZL staff and associates, will support growth

I think we can drum up $70k to $130k buying support as follows:

Low       High

DCC    $10,000    $20,000 – Me

DCC family    $10,000    $15,000 – Me

Wu    $10,000    $20,000 – You

Wu family    $10,000    $15,000 – You

Tynas    $4,000    $8,000 – Me

Roach    $10,000    $20,000 (use proceeds of $75k) – Me

Pattinson    $3,000    $6,000 – Me

Dare    $3,000    $6,000 – Me

Tao    $10,000    $20,000 – You

Other    MW to advise

Inside info:

* As long as we stick to the fundamentals outlined above, there are no issues with inside buying

* There will be regular announcements (fortnightly) which will enable people to sell shares immediately after announcements

Next

* What do you think?

* If OK, I will start drumming up people on my side to buy shares after the Monday announcements

* If OK, you start drumming up people on your side to buy shares after Monday announcements

* Hopefully, shares will get to 50c within 2 weeks""

64. Wu agreed. They then exchanged emails regarding the amount of money they could provide to support the Healthzone share price. On 6 May 2007, Wu sent an email to Dulhunty saying that he had limited cash available to trade. Dulhunty sent an email to Wu, stating: “Me too, but if we can execute 'buy' at Monday price and 'sell' at 50c, the cash should be coming back soon. WE should be doing announcements every couple of weeks so I'm hoping we will be able to sell soon. If the price goes above 50c, then will alleviate your obligation to find cash for DS shares. See what you can do. The more we do on Monday, the better for the company. If we can get some early momentum, then we should be able to get Intersuisse, Sheng Ong and others to keep the price going up...but wil need some early fast movement on Monday. PS: you better send me your account details so I can transfer the cash” Later that day, Dulhunty sent an email to Wu in which he set out what he proposed to tell Andrew Sekely of Intersuisse about purchasing HZL shares. Wu replied: “I think this looks alright but we have to make sure AS won't have a feeling that we are buying shares just because we want to lift up the price to maintain a steady trend...we need him to believe we will have lots of excited news/acquisitions happening down the track.”

65. On 7 and 8 May 2007, Dulhunty purchased Healthzone shares using his DCC accounts with Intersuisse and Tricom and his CommSec Account, causing the share price to rise on 7 May from 34c to 43c, and on 8 May from 43c to 44c, in trades having a total value of approximately $25,745.

26 to 27 July 2007

66. On 26 July 2007, the price of Healthzone shares dropped from a previous closing price of 45 cents to 38 cents.

67. During the day, Dulhunty and Wu corresponded by email about increasing the Healthzone share price, with Dulhunty stating at 10.08am: “Know anyone that could buy 1000-2000 shares at 46c?” and Wu responding: “Bernie?...joking…A bit hard because the guy I know went to Ski”. After the close of trading, Dulhunty noted ""Shares down 7c to 38c – not a good look"" and advised: ""Need someone to start the shares on a positive note to calm HMPL"". Wu replied: ""You didn't see this. Already arranged the support for 45c as an opening price!!...But he's not sure if he can be in front of computer at closed to 4pm as he'll be tied up from 1pm."" Wu and Dulhunty exchanged emails discussing arranging support for the close at 4pm, but they were not involved in any trades on that day.

68. On 27 July 2007, Wu sent an email to Dulhunty, stating: ""My mate actually bought 2000 shares today........"", confirming a trade made on a CommSec Account in the name of Huanzhong Wang which had increased the price of Healthzone shares from 38c to 41c. After this, more shares were sold by other shareholders at 38 cents and the closing price of 38 cents was 7 cents below the previous closing price of 45 cents on 26 July 2007.

8 to 9 October 2007

69. On 8 October 2007, Healthzone announced the completion of its acquisition of HMPL.

70. On 9 October Dulhunty sent out emails to Wu and others trying to find out who was selling 10,000 shares at 46c, but was not able to find out.

71. At 10:31, Dulhunty placed a Bid for 2,000 shares at 49c on his CommSec Account. It traded immediately and in full, increasing the price of Healthzone shares from 46c to 49c.

72. At 11:50 Dulhunty sent an email to Wu with the subject ""See below: 294,000 shares today: price now 45c (down 4c). Not too bad, not too good. Will buy some to get price to 49c.""

73. At 12:01, after a price fall, Dulhunty placed another Bid for 2,000 Healthzone shares at 49c on his CommSec Account. It traded immediately and in full, increasing the price of Healthzone shares from 45c to 49c, restoring the price to 49c. The trade set the closing price for Healthzone shares at 49c, which was the same as the closing price on the previous day.

74. There was no further trading in Healthzone shares after 12:01, but Dulhunty and Wu continued to watch the market and corresponded by email about Dulhunty's trade and the lack of actual volume in Healthzone shares.

75. In the evening, Goodman sent an email to Wu in which he made his first approach to Healthzone, offering to market its shares to his network of investors. He also asked if Healthzone’s major shareholders were interested in selling their shares. Dulhunty then engaged in discussions with Goodman on behalf of Healthzone. In November 2007, Goodman said that 10 million new Healthzone shares could be placed with his network at a price ranging from 60c to 75c per share. The Offenders resolved to issue 10 million shares to Goodman and his investors at 60c per share, which occurred in December 2007. Goodman also encouraged the Offenders to buy shares to prove their confidence in Healthzone.

19 December 2007 to 16 January 2008

76. On 19 December 2007 at 9:22, Healthzone announced the acquisition of Atherton International Pty Limited. At 9.45am Dulhunty sent an email to Wu and Roach and said: “RG called AGAIN this morning … Asked AGAIN if we are buying shares today.” At 11.38am, Dulhunty sent an email to Wu and Roach and said: “Can you guys buy some shares today? RG has been hassling for 2 weeks”.

77. On 21 December 2007, the previous closing price of Healthzone shares was 70 cents and the opening trade was 66 cents. Dulhunty sent an email to Wu and said: ""Share trading should be very light over the next few days. We might want to consider getting in and buying some shares with light volume to get price closer to 75c. Would be good to get it up before 31 Dec for half year accounts + AFR tables.""

78. Dulhunty traded on his CommSec Account and increased the price for Healthzone shares from 66c to 70c and set the closing price, which was the same as the closing price on the previous day.

79. At 15:31, although Wu replied to Dulhunty's email ""Ok, happy to buy some over the next few days"", it was Dulhunty who did the trading on his CommSec Account and told Wu to keep an eye on the share price.

80. On 24 December, the previous closing price of Healthzone shares was 70 cents. There were 30,000 shares sold at 60 cents. According to a subsequent analysis of trading data, the seller was an investor who was part of Goodman’s initial placement of shares, but Dulhunty and Wu were not aware of that fact at the time and did not refer to any belief at the time that the trade was associated with Goodman. There is no evidence that the investor colluded with Goodman in relation to the sale. At this time the communications between Goodman and the Offenders indicated a positive relationship and that Goodman was buying shares in Healthzone. Dulhunty entered two Bids on his CommSec Account, which traded in three lots and increased the price of Healthzone shares from 60c to 70c and then from 72c to 73c. Market participants bought 143,000 shares at prices from 70c to 73c.

81. In an email dated Sunday 23 December Dulhunty told Wu: ""Been doing some buying....now 73c."" On 3 January 2008, Dulhunty and Wu discussed further trades to raise the share price to 79 cents. Dulhunty stated: “Now just 9,000 shares will do it” and asked Wu when he would be buying shares. Wu replied: “I don't use my a/c to buy but my mate who has been instructed by me. Will follow up with him now”. On 16 January 2008, Dulhunty and Wu discussed who could be used for a further purchase of Healthzone shares, with Dulhunty stating to Wu: “UP to you. If BT, then make sure he keeps his mouth shut”.

11 February to 4 March 2008

82. On 11 February 2008, Dulhunty sent an email to Wu with the subject “Need some volume through HZL”, stating: “3-4 days a week until the shares flow by themselves. If there is no activity, people will dump…whether good news or bad news….just to get out”. Wu replied: “OK. Will try to support say up to 3 weeks (ie. 20k shares/week) but somehow can I receive some reasonable reimbursement as: during the last 6 months, I’ve been asked my mates to purchase the shares (for me but under different titles) and I’ve a large bill due to them and need to pay soon ($120k) just for these shares purchased in the past”. On 28 February 2008, Dulhunty sent an email to Wu stating: “Need to have buyers/volume lined up for Monday morning = first momentum after announcement Will need to work on it over weekend. We will also be able to buy directly then”. Wu replied: “I have been buying indirectly although not much. How many required for today? On blackberry”. On 29 February 2008 Healthzone released its half yearly results. On 2 March, a Sunday, Dulhunty sent an email to Wu and said:

""We’ll need to support shares tomorrow.

I plan to directly commit $5k to $10k

How much can your people commit?

Target = price of 65c (no less) to 70c (no more)""

83. Later Dulhunty sent details of the current sells to Wu, stating:

""Current sells are at:

0.640 2,000

0.690 11,000

0.700 10,000

0.850 32,338

I will get in early with 3000 shares to get price to 0.69.You will then need to do around 1,000 shares an hour in the 69 to 70 range (i.e. 6,000 shares). Day 1 after announcement is most important. Keep rest of ammo until the end of the day + tomorrow.""

84. Wu replied to Dulhunty’s email, stating: ""OK, will keep an eye on and standby all day tomorrow."" At 7.21pm, Dulhunty separately sent an email to Roach (who was not yet an offender), stating: “Are you able to buy $5k to $10k of HZL shares tomorrow? Day 1 after half year profit important to set momentum of the shares. If positive, then interpreted positively. Also, do you think that MB and CF would be willing to buy some shares over time with their pay rises? You’d think so and people like RG would expect management to want shares.”

85. On 3 March, the previous closing price was 64c. At 8.56am, Dulhunty sent an email to Wu, stating:

“Seller profile has changed to the following:

0.640 18,544

0.650 8,120

0.690 11,000

Suggestions:

- I buy 2,000 at 64

- you buy 1,000 each hour from 11am at market ONLY if price is 64 or more

- don’t buy any below 64

- I do the closing bid at 3.50pm.”

86. Wu responded: “Ok”. At 8.59am, Dulhunty sent an email to Wu, stating: “Put in an open bid now for 3000 shares before market at 64c I have done one at 65c”. At 9.03am, Dulhunty sent an email to Roach, stating: ""Any chance of putting in a pre-market bid order with your broker for say 2,000 to 10,000 shares at 65c. Would be ideal to have order on screen asap before market opens.” At 9:27am, Roach responded: ""I have a Sanford account. I have just been redirected to Commsec and my ID is not working and can't access my account. Problem has been logged however can't lodge a premarket bid unless fixed before 10am. Unlikely as they say there has been much issue with Sanford customers and I may have to re-register Commsec.""

87. Later that day, Dulhunty sent an email to Roach titled “shares down”, and asked: “Was there anything that RG said/indicated relevant to this?” Roach reported on a conversation with Goodman about his concerns for the operation of Healthzone and seeking more involvement in the company. Dulhunty responded: “Looks like he’s keen to find a life boat / exit. Might be better to keep RG stuck in HZL with no way out. If he is half out, then could burn price. If stuck, then will do what he can to make shares stay up.”

88. During the course of the day Dulhunty and Wu exchanged emails about when to trade.

89. Dulhunty placed Bids on his CommSec and DCC's Tricom Accounts and there were also Bids placed on the Wang Intersuisse Account, following phone calls by Wu to Intersuisse, which traded at 10:04 at 64c. After a price decrease to 60c, Dulhunty traded again on his CommSec Account with a Bid for 2,000 Healthzone shares at 64c which traded immediately and increased the price of Healthzone shares to 62c.

90. Within twenty minutes of another price decrease to 60c, Dulhunty entered another Bid for 1,000 Healthzone shares at 64c on his CommSec Account. The Bid traded immediately and in full through two price levels of orders increasing the price again from 60c to 62c. The trade set the close at 62c, which was 2c below the previous closing price.

91. After this trading Dulhunty sent an email to Wu with details of his monitoring of the Healthzone share price including:

""Just got some more to keep up at 62c. Need to keep eye on shares""; and

""Can you give me a call on 3:30pm to see what actions (how many shares) is needed as I'm not online at the moment.""

92. At the close Dulhunty sent an email to Wu telling him to “save his bullets” for tomorrow. According to a subsequent analysis of trading data, one of the sellers during the day was an investor who was part of Goodman’s initial placement of shares, but Dulhunty and Wu were not aware of that fact at the time and did not express a belief at the time that Goodman was responsible for the trade. There is no evidence that the seller colluded with Goodman in relation to the sale. At 4.16pm, Wu sent an email to Roach and Dulhunty, stating: “Are you guys happy for me to call Han Lee? RG is concerned he will start selling down and says he is big on relationship and a puppy with his questions”. Roach reported on a conversation with Han Lee, to which Dulhunty replied: “Nice work …and very funny Maybe RG needs you as a front man to build his own credibility At least our shares are still above IPO issue price + placement price despite massive share market crash Wouldn’t be the same for many other companies Need to be careful of RG. Will be seeking to exert pressure to suit his needs (i.e. not issue shares), which may be inconsistent with best interests of HZL”.

93. On 4 March Dulhunty sent Wu an email and told him: ""Put in opening order asap for 2000 shares at 62c before sellers drop price"".

94. Wu made a call to the broker Intersuisse and approximately 20 minutes later a Bid for 2,000 Healthzone shares at 62c was entered on the Wang Intersuisse Account. The Bid traded at 10:04 and decreased the price of Healthzone shares from 62c to 61.5c, due to the entry of a late Ask.

95. At 11.46am, Dulhunty sent an email to Wu, stating: “6000 at 62 would be good To prevent sell orders dropping to 60”. Wu replied “Will get my mate to get in now” and then reported “Instructed my mate to buy 6000”. At 1.15pm, Dulhunty noted “Hasn't happened...can you go direct?” Wu replied: “Done...” and six minutes later a Bid was entered on the Wang Intersuisse Account for 6,000 Healthzone shares at 62c, which traded in full through two price levels, increasing the price for Healthzone shares from 61.5c to 62c. The trade set the close and the price of Healthzone shares closed at the previous closing price of 62c.

23 to 24 April 2008

96. On 22 April 2008, the closing price of Healthzone shares dropped from 53c to 46.5c.

97. The next day, Wu sent an email to Dulhunty saying:

""I've been watching the shares today though without action yet. How many are needed to bring it back to say 55c?....Will consider this tomorrow or a better timing?....""

98. The lowest Ask was for 500 shares at 55c, which was 3.5c below the next lowest ask of 58.5c. At 15:10 Dulhunty traded on his DCC Tricom Account with a Bid for 500 Healthzone shares at 55c which increased the price for Healthzone shares from 46.5c to 55c. The trade set the close. Dulhunty sent an email to Wu which said: ""Currently 55c with 500 shares volume"" and included details of the next Asks: “Next shares - 6000 at 58.5c - 9370 at 59c – 10,104 at 59.5c”. Wu replied ""Better …I will see what I can do.""

99. On 24 April the Wang Intersuisse Account placed a Bid for 1,000 Healthzone shares at 58.5c which traded, increasing the price for Healthzone shares (set by Dulhunty the previous day) from 55c to 58.5c. The trade set the close.

100. Wu confirmed the trade on the Wang Intersuisse Account by sending an email to Dulhunty with the subject ""1000 shares ordered at 58.5c"" and Dulhunty replied: ""Good, has gone through"".

25 June to 3 July 2008

101. On 25 June 2008, at 8:22am, Dulhunty sent an email to Wu, stating: “Although the closing price of HZL shares was 50c yesterday, the opening bid if 45c and opening offer (5,000 shares) is 46c. Will need to have at least 5,000 shares ready to clear out the opening offer if someone hits the price. Suggest wait until offer is hit before buying up the shares. At 50c, whoever buys the shares today should do pretty well.” The price of Healthzone shares dropped from the previous close of 50c to 45c, then 42c. Dulhunty sent an email to Wu and said: “HZL price getting slammed + getting calls from RG mates”. Wu asked ""How many required to take it back?""

102. The lowest Ask was for 2,000 shares at 50c. Dulhunty replied with details of Healthzone share sells and suggested putting in an order at 3.50 pm. At 15:49 the Wang Intersuisse Account entered a Bid for 2,000 Healthzone shares at 50c which traded, increasing the price for Healthzone shares from 42c to 50c. This trade set the close and the price of Healthzone shares closed at the previous closing price of 50c.

103. Dulhunty sent an email to Wu which said: ""closing price 50c.""

104. On 26 June Dulhunty sent an email to Wu that said:""50c held as no trading.""

105. On 27 June Healthzone requested a trading halt and Dulhunty sent an email to Wu ""All done"".

106. On 30 June 2008 Healthzone announced the completion of contracts for the acquisition of Jasham International Pty Limited.

107. Following the announcement, 4,000 shares were sold at 54c and 31,902 shares were bought, raising the price to 56.5c. According to a subsequent analysis of trading data, the seller was Goodman, but Dulhunty and Wu were not aware of that fact at the time and did not express a belief at the time that Goodman was responsible for the trade. Dulhunty sent an email to Wu and Roach saying: “shares up 13% to 56.5c Lowest sell orders are below Would be good to see at least 60c (and more) by 4pm” and sent an email to Wu separately which said:

""See below, there’s a small batch of 6,400 HZL shares for sale at 56.5c before getting to 57c level

Are you able to buy some within 20 mins or do you want me to?

Price Quantity Number

0.565 6,401 2

0.570 30,000 1

0.600 52,000 1

0.700 10,000 1""

108. Wu replied that he was in a meeting. Dulhunty entered a Bid on his DCC Tricom Account for 7,000 Healthzone shares at market which traded and cleared all 6,400 Healthzone shares on offer at 56.5c and the residual was amended to 60c which also traded. This increased the price for Healthzone shares from 56.5c to 60c and set the close. Dulhunty sent an email to Wu with details of the trade and said:

""Just got 7,000 = price now 60c. Keep an eye on it until 4pm. If dips, be prepared to come in to hold 30 June close price at 60c. Important for published year end summaries etc""

109. Later Dulhunty sent Wu an email which confirmed the close at 60c, identified the current lowest sell orders and stated: “Hopefully will be support tomorrow as media / investors find out. We should aim for conducting roadshows in 3-4 weeks, subject to PC having numbers that we are confident about”.

110. On 1 July 2008, 10,000 shares were sold at 52.5c, and the price of Healthzone shares dropped from 60c to 52.5c. According to a subsequent analysis of trading data, the seller was Goodman, but Dulhunty and Wu were not aware of that fact at the time and did not express a belief at the time that Goodman was responsible for the trade. On the evening of 1 July Dulhunty sent an email to Wu that said the price of Healthzone shares was back down to 52.5c.

111. On 3 July Dulhunty sent an email to Wu and Roach, stating: “Lowest HZL sell prices are per below. Buying 5,000 at market could get the price back up to 60c”. Then Wu and Dulhunty exchanged emails, with Wu stating: “Couldn't work with bberry just now...is it too late to jump in now? If not, I will ring and buy”. Dulhunty replied “Same now .,.get them if can”. Wu made a phone call to Intersuisse and five minutes after the call at 12:09 the Wang Intersuisse Account placed a Bid for 5,000 Healthzone shares at 60c which traded through two price levels increasing the price of Healthzone shares by 7.5c from 52.5c to 60c. This trade set the close.

112. Wu and Dulhunty exchanged emails about the trade and the closing price of 60c for Healthzone shares.

1 to 23 September 2008 

113. On 31 July 2008, Wu and Dulhunty reported to each other and Roach on conversations they had with Goodman, in which he complained of a lack of consultation in relation to the company and warned of possible sell orders at low prices as a result. On 1 August 2008, Goodman suggested that Healthzone attend a meeting with the parent company of Athletes Foot to discuss a possible merger as they were both franchise businesses. Goodman arranged a meeting between the companies, but on 13 August 2008 Roach sent an email to Dulhunty and Wu, noting: “RG idea is that the proposed new entity would become a Franchise Super Group with the logistics provided by the HZL Group… I remain cautious of RG motivation and could be a scam to get him & others into HZL business detail – Big waste of time. What do you guys thinks? Are you available to meet?”

114. By September 2008, the relationship between Healthzone and Goodman had begun to deteriorate. On 1 September 2008, the price of Healthzone shares dropped from 53c to 36c. The previous day, Dulhunty had sent an email to Wu and Roach, expressing his concern that Goodman was intending to place sell orders at a low price.

115. On 2 September, Goodman sent an email to the Offenders, setting out his concerns with the management of Healthzone, asking for a board seat, suggesting the company should consider merging with Athletes Foot and encouraging the directors of Healthzone to buy shares. On 10 September, the price of Healthzone shares dropped from 42c to 36c. That day, Goodman sent an email to Dulhunty in which he predicted that the share price would drop to 16c by October and that there would then be a takeover bid at 25c. According to a subsequent analysis of trading data, one of the sellers during the day was an investor who was part of Goodman’s initial placement of shares, but Dulhunty and Wu were not aware of that fact at the time and did not express a belief at the time that Goodman was responsible for the trade. There is no evidence that the seller colluded with Goodman in relation to the sale.

116. On 22 September 2008, the previous closing price was 52c, as a result of four trades on 11-12 September by Dulhunty’s company DCC and the Wang Intersuisse account. Dulhunty sent an email to Wu saying:

""Good time to buy HZL shares. Market scared shitless, no activity and ASX restrictions on selling. How about you buy 10,000 shares and I buy 10,000 shares? Would get price up to 55c and people are reluctant to sell now. Would need to be done quickly (i.e. same time) with tight co-ordination between us.""

117. Wu replied he was in a meeting. Dulhunty replied “Just let me know when you’re free Timing is up to us… but needs to be at same time”, but they did not buy shares that day.

118. The price of Asks dropped to 49c. The following day Dulhunty sent an email to Wu which again stated they needed to co-ordinate buying 10,000 shares which included: ""When are you ready to buy 10,000 shares soon? Let’s co-ordinate."" Wu made a call to Intersuisse and approximately three minutes later at 12:05 the Wang Intersuisse Account placed a Bid for 12,000 Healthzone shares at 51.5c which traded through two price levels, but decreased the price by half a cent. At 12:08 Dulhunty traded on his DCC Tricom Account and placed a Bid for 12,000 Healthzone shares at 55c which traded through three price levels, increasing the price of Healthzone shares from 51.5c to 55c. This trade set the close. Dulhunty sent an email to Wu: ""Price 55c"" and Wu replied: ""Done Mine.""

1 to 30 October 2008

119. On 1 October 2008, Goodman sent an email to the Offenders in which he expressed dissatisfaction with the management of Healthzone and asked for a board seat by 3 October in order to have a say in the direction of the company, otherwise he would divest his stock holdings in Healthzone. On 3 October, the previous closing price was 55c and Goodman placed 1 million shares for sale on market, at a price of 42c. Dulhunty sent an email to Wu and Roach, stating: “He’s back: 1m shares ...we should now not be so nice. This is a message that RG will act in breach of Corps Act best interests for the company. Lets discuss after 4pm Might need a letter from B&M about corps act and manipulation”.

120. On 13 October, Goodman sent another email to Wu and Dulhunty, confirming his intention to exit Healthzone, and giving notice that he would offer around 9 million remaining Healthzone shares to the market, with two possible purchasers already expressing interest. Between 15 and 23 October 2008, Goodman placed 8.4 million shares for sale on market at 49c, and the price of Healthzone shares dropped from 55c to 35c. On 16 October 2008, Wu sent an email to Dulhunty, stating: “On reflection, I’m thinking maybe we would shoot us on the foot if we did go with “Selective Capital Reduction” on RG/Alex’s shares. Without a question these guys will fight against us to the end and they may not care by spending big $$ for legal disputes as they have big pocket and if they won, they could gain lot more!? Also, in this volatile market, it’s very hard to prove he’s manipulate the share price as everyone are dumping the shares anyway?”

121. On 24 October 2008, Dulhunty sent an email to Roach and Wu, stating:

“Just got SMS from RG.

– Hi One associate says he is about to hit a bid at 21c. What a bargain. Russ. From +61411 485 037 12:14pm 24 – OCT – 08

Really really stupid with ASX investigation going on to do this in writing and ahead of what might happen. I HOPE this occurs. It would establish a very clear audit trial … and is easy to fix.”

122. On Monday 27 October 2008, Goodman amended the Ask to 184,000 shares and dropped the Ask price of shares from 49c to 29c, which was 6c below other Asks of 35c. Dulhunty sent an email to Wu and said: “Sell order profile dropping. RG’s 3 mates still sitting there with 248k shares, but not as bad as 4 mates with 400k shares on Friday”.

123. On 28 October, Goodman emailed a presentation to Wu and Dulhunty, stating: “You will find this of interest…HZL..29c still no interest. OVERSUBCSCRIBED LOL. At least it shows me exactly what you guys think your stock is worth. 2/5ths of f all .Water always finds its true level and what goes around comes around. Good luck.” When Goodman removed his sell orders, Dulhunty said “Sell order profile has improved a lot. See below, RG mates gone.” Nearly an hour later on 28 October Dulhunty sent a further email to Wu with the pros and cons of buying, stating::

”Buy decision for:

• Can do it now without blocking tranches

• Certainty of getting price up

• Provides buffer for future reductions

• May force had of strategic seller to catch out

• May be possible to mitigate strategic sales with phone calls

• Keep up VWAP

• Make shareholders happier – Tao, franchisees, other

• Make future shareholders happier – vendors

• Better for placement discussions

• Demonstrate resilience to downturn

• Good value for buyer

• If not buy, then concerns to other buyers

• When price goes up, people wish they’d bought cheap

Buy decision against:

• Invite strategic sell down

• Potential defence by seller – H associates buy to manipulate

• Show seller that price easily recovers after attack – no long term consequences of actions

• Use up powder

Net result = buy

Timing

• 7000 at 35c at 10:20 am

• 8000 at 38c at 10:30 am

• 5000 at 42c at 10:40 am

- 2 buyers preferable

• 2 brokers preferable""

124. In accordance with a suggested Bid and time the Wang Intersuisse Account at 10:17 placed a Bid for 7,000 Healthzone shares at 35c which traded but did not move the price of Healthzone shares. Dulhunty sent an email to Wu saying: ""Now looks better.""

125. On 30 October, Dulhunty sent an email to Wu with the sell profile for Healthzone shares and a further email with the “Friday strategy”, which discussed the timing of purchases and the release of Healthzone announcements:

”Thinking about timing of 4C and purchases…

Could be an idea to:

- Lodge 4C at say 3:15pm on Friday

- Do some buying to get momentum up before Friday close

- Lodge AGM notice and annual report after 4pm

- A bit of support on Monday What do you think?”

126. Following this email the Wang Intersuisse Account over a period of 20 minutes placed two Bids: the first for 10,000 Healthzone shares at 38c traded in two lots and increased the price from 35c (set by the previous Wang trade) to 38c. After that, Wu sent an email to Dulhunty which said: ""Just done. On the other matter, while we have discussed and agreed for quite a while, I'd greatly appreciate if the 70k of 'acquisition fees' (or whatever other titles that can be capitalized) can be granted to me as this has become an serious to me. I'm only receiving $60k of director fees/year while investing 100k to 200k a year in our shares, I'm having nothing left really.... "".

127. The second Bid of 7,400 Healthzone shares at 38c on the Wang Intersuisse Account also traded and this trade set the close at 38c.

128. Dulhunty sent an email to Wu and suggested a further 2,000 at 44c but by someone other than them. Wu replied ""Still finding the mates I know"". At 4.01pm, Goodman sent an email to Dulhunty, stating: “Would you prefer I stayed out of the screen. And for your interest the ASX has no power to demand an order be taken out of the screen as long as it portrays a fair price at which the seller is prepared to sell at and is in no way trying to manipulate the market. Your call but don't say I didn't ask.” Dulhunty forwarded the email to Wu and Roach but suggested they ignore Goodman. Later that day Healthzone released three announcements as foreshadowed in an earlier email from Dulhunty.

SECOND PERIOD OF OFFENDING, NOVEMBER 2008-JULY 2010: WU, DULHUNTY AND ROACH

Overview

129. In the Second Period of Offending, the Offenders (Roach having joined the conspiracy in November 2008) took action whenever they deemed it necessary to create or maintain an artificial price for Healthzone shares at a level that they believed required in the circumstances.

130. The Offenders communicated by email to monitor the price of Healthzone shares and agree on a plan to create or maintain the price to an artificial level. They traded on their own accounts, but there was also an increased use of third parties, as some accounts previously used by the Offenders were blocked from further trading. Dulhunty in particular expressed a desire in this period for the Offenders to move to third party accounts and different brokers to assist in their continued manipulation of the price of Healthzone shares.

131. The use of third parties included Roach asking Jenkins to trade, which Jenkins did using his CommSec Account. Jenkins claims that Roach gave him trading instructions by email, face to face and over the phone. There was also trading conducted on third party accounts with CommSec in the names of Adrian Vringer and Mary Ann Harper and Andrew John Harper, with the Offenders operating and placing the trades on these accounts. Following discussions between the Offenders, Roach also asked Healthzone employees Limbert and Jinks to open CommSec trading accounts and sent details of the trading the Offenders wanted them to carry out. Roach also communicated with Pattinson, a contractor, sending him details of Healthzone shares that the Offenders wanted him to buy. Roach also used his own E*Trade share trading account number, 3201093, from 1 September 2009.

132. Throughout the Second Period of Offending from November 2008 to July 2010 there were 235 trades conducted pursuant to the agreement, of which 30 were wash trades where buy and sell orders were coordinated between the Offenders, as follows:

•   Dulhunty used five trading accounts in his name or in the name of DCC to execute 55 trades, involving the purchase of 305,500 shares and an overall investment of $100,977;

•   Wu operated trading accounts in his name and the name of his company MGR, and used or asked family members to use a trading account in the name of Wei Wang, by providing trading instructions. There were a total of 46 trades, involving the purchase of 336,860 shares and an overall investment of $108,480;

•   Roach used a trading account in his name to carry out 6 trades, involving the purchase of 31,500 shares and an overall investment of $13,032;

•   the Offenders operated a trading account in the name of Roach’s sister Mary Ann Harper and her husband Andrew Harper, and two trading accounts in the name of the husband of Roach’s personal assistant, Adrian Vringer, for which Roach had obtained the log-in details, to carry out 83 trades, involving the purchase of 397,830 shares and an overall investment of $128,938; and

•   Roach requested five other people – Jenkins, Tynas, Limbert, Jinks and Pattinson – to buy shares in Healthzone, including by giving them trading instructions. In total these five individuals and one other, Andronos, who was a friend of Pattinson but was not personally known to Roach, carried out 45 trades, involving the purchase of 269,233 shares and an overall investment of $91,420.

133. Examples of the communications and trading for this period are set out below.

5 to 17 November 2008

134. On 5 November 2008, Dulhunty sent notes of a conversation he had with Goodman to Wu and Roach, in which he reported details of Goodman’s concerns about Healthzone. Dulhunty raised with Roach and Wu his concern that the Healthzone share price was down because Goodman was selling shares. On 6 November 2008, Dulhunty sent an email to Wu, stating: “We should line up independent people to buy shares on market over the next few days for important reasons: • Get price up • Show clear impact of RG transactions on share price • Show clearly that the transaction were at below market value Ideally, we want to see a ‘V’ whenever RG traded..i.e. a sharp dip, then recovery. This will platform us for later if worst case scenario action is required”. Wu said “I will talk to my people today but many of my friends have moved to property market after the market crashed since few months ago”, and later added “The challenge is, US crashed over 400 points over night and if I asked people to buy, I would be looked odd and even lose credibility”. On 10 November 2008, the price of Healthzone shares dropped from 29.5c to 25c. Dulhunty and Wu attributed the price fall to Goodman, although it was not him.

135. Dulhunty sent an email to Wu which said: “We need someone to buy 8,000 shares at market to get the price up to 29.5c. Reasons: Get price up with V shape. We can see in a few days of RG continues dumping and trace trades. Here’s today’s sell profile. Got anyone lined up?”

136. Later that day Roach sent an email to Wu, saying: ""I want to start calling the HL Franchisees to arrange payment for their shares. Did you say you were going to arrange a friend to stand in the market to improve the SP? Let me know so I did’nt have a false start on the ring around.""

137. Wu replied and suggested to Roach and Dulhunty that they coordinate with each other, but there was no trading that day by or on behalf of Roach, Wu or Dulhunty.

138. On 11 November 2008, an opening Ask of 27c was 7.5c below the next lowest Ask of 34.5c. Dulhunty sent emails to Wu and said: ""OK to get 7,250 at 27c. Wait a few hours before the 6,500 at 34.5c"". At 10:24 the Wang Intersuisse Account bought 7,250 Healthzone shares at 27c and increased the price from 25c to 27c. This trade set the close. Wu sent an email to Dulhunty ""Done"". Although Dulhunty made further suggestions there were no further trades that day by or on behalf of Dulhunty, Wu or Roach.

139. On 12 November, at 10.26am, Dulhunty sent an email to Wu stating: “Here’s today’s sell profile. Suggest buy 7,000 at 30c”. Wu replied: “Ok. Can you talk to Roach re the timing of calling the franchisees about the options? The idea was to support the price at say 40c right before calling them so we don’t want to invest twice.” Dulhunty replied: “OK, will do. In the meantime..suggest you get working on getting the price up. Will take time and we need V shape for other purposes. HMPL will be able to send out invoices as soon as price hits 40c. It will take a few days to get there.” Dulhunty then forwarded that email chain to Roach, stating: “Agree with the approach below? I think buying on our side needs to speed up.”

140. Wu then separately confirmed in an email to Dulhunty:

""Ok. Roach, MJ2 and I discussed this strategy (getting price up at 40c before calling) and we agree to have an outside investor doing this and I told them I could find this one and all agreed HZL could pay $20k to this investor for helping this. But as you know, it's actually me who is funding this. When you talk to Roach, can you get an OK from him for paying this say next week? Something can be capitalized. But probably better not mention that I am the one who is funding shares purchase. The reason for asking this was explained to you, cash dried for continuely buying shares since IPO.""

141. At 11:28:24 the Wang Intersuisse Account bought 7,000 Healthzone shares at 30c as set out in an email from Dulhunty earlier in the day and increased the price for Healthzone shares by a further 3c to 30c, from the last trade at 27c which was executed on the Wang Intersuisse Account at 10:24:12 on 11 November 2008. Wu confirmed to Dulhunty that 7,000 Healthzone shares had been purchased.

142. Dulhunty confirmed in an email to Wu that the $20,000 “booty” had been approved and would be added to Wu's fees and to ask if he needed more. Dulhunty added: “Roach wants to get price up to 40c asap. He’s hanging to make calls to franchisees and will do as soon as price is up.”

143. Shortly afterwards Dulhunty sent an email to Wu , stating: ""Would be good to get some at 33c at around 3pm. This would platform step up to 34c. How many people / entities do you have to buy the shares? Better if different ones"" and set out the current order profile. Wu replied he would check but that many of them were on holiday.

144. Roach sent an email to Wu, stating ”After discussion with RD I have arranged $20k to be put into your account as your “Performance Bonus” payment we have been talking about”, referring to an entitlement to a bonus that was contained in Wu’s executive service agreement. Roach then sent an email to Jenkins stating that “the Healthzone board” had confirmed the payment and it should be deposited into Wu’s account.

145. Dulhunty sent a further email to Wu which said: ""Someone has come in with 8,000 at 33c. Suggest snap it up asap"" with the sell profile and within the hour sent another email which said: ""One hour to go..same profile"" and at 15:27:28 the Wang Intersuisse Account bought 8,000 at 31c. This increased the price of Healthzone shares by a further 1c to 31c, from the last trade at 30c which was executed on the Wang Intersuisse Account at 11:28:24 that morning. The trading set the closing price for Healthzone shares at 31c that day.

146. On 13 November, the previous closing price was 31c. Dulhunty sent an email to Wu, stating: “You’re going to slow with share buying. I spoke to a broker I know yesterday and he reckons there’s no reason we can’t buy shares in HZL. He says it would be a good sign to everyone else. I propose to buy up the first batch and suggest you jump on board at 34c. We need to pull our fingers out and get on with getting the price up to 40c asap”.

147. To this Wu replied that he was not in the country and was “in the trade show with customers yesterday and cannot keep looking at the bberry while talking to them Plus AS stopped me from buying that, I cant force him”..

148. Later Dulhunty bought 5,500 Healthzone shares at 31c on his Dulhunty CommSec account and a minute later a further 2,000 Healthzone shares at 33.5c on his CommSec Account. The second Bid traded immediately and in full through two price levels, increasing the price by 2c to 33c.

149. Dulhunty sent an email to Wu which confirmed the trades and said: ""I bought 7500 shares to 33c. We need to get price up. AS needs to relax. I thought you were going to be the price driver with me filling you in?""

150. Wu replied and again said he was being stopped by Intersuisse but asked how many were needed to act now and Dulhunty replied 7,000 up to 34c.

151. Wu replied: ""bought 11,000 shares from 31 to34c"" and at 11:37 the Wang Intersuisse Account bought 11,000 Healthzone shares at 34c and traded through three price levels from 31c to 34c, increasing the price from 33c to 34c. This was an increase of 1c from the last trade at 33c, which was executed on the Dulhunty CommSec Account at 10:47 earlier that morning. At 11.41am, Dulhunty sent an email to Wu, stating: “Nice work, profile now as follows” and set out the current orders. The trade set the closing price for Healthzone shares at 34c that day and the following day.

152. At 4.53pm, Dulhunty sent a further email to Wu, stating: “I suspect that when franchisees get their shares + bill to pay…some might sell to pay the bill?” and setting out the current orders, to which Wu replied: “I’m more concerned that it would probably be a big gap from now to 40c as more we bought, more sell is there = might cost big $ to get what we want?” At 5.32pm, Dulhunty sent an email to Wu stating:

“It looks like:

- For tomorrow.. do nothing until 15500 at 32 clears

- Over week, will better idea of tone and timing nee announcements Might be best to get negative announcements out of way while share price low, then build.”

153. Wu and Dulhunty exchanged emails which discussed getting the price to 40c but there was no further trading by or on behalf of Dulhunty, Roach or Wu.

154. On 17 November, the previous closing price was 34c. Roach, Wu and Dulhunty continued to discuss getting the Healthzone share price to 40c. Wu confirmed his mate could clear stock below 40c.

155. There was trading on the Wang Intersuisse Account which cleared some of this stock. A Bid for 21,050 Healthzone shares at 34c traded immediately and in full through two price levels, consuming all Healthzone shares on offer at 32c and all 5,550 Healthzone shares on offer at 34c, being the same price as the previous trade which was executed on the Wang Intersuisse Account at 11:37 on 13 November 2008. This trading set the closing price for Healthzone shares at 34c.

156. At 3.33pm, Wu sent an email to Dulhunty and Roach, stating: “32c and 34c stock have ALL been cleared up and I hope tomorrow’s sell profile can be changed a bit otherwise it will probably cost us more to get the price up to high or even mid 40s”. At 6.17pm, Dulhunty replied: “Nice work. Current sell profile. Expect someone will come in around 35c tomorrow. Might see if I can get some at 44c to get things kick started after Hilson meeting”. At 9.28pm, Roach replied: “Good result well done… as soon as we get into the 40’s I can start calling HL franchisees to lock down the share payments”. At 9.32pm, Dulhunty replied: “Might be better to wait a few days and see if the RG gang dump stock. We also need to get a negative announcement out soon.” At 9.43pm, Roach replied: “I think we need to keep pushing fwd with the SP … to pull back wasts the efforts of the day. I also think your too keen with the negative announcement.” At 9.57pm, Dulhunty replied with his reasons for an announcement, concluding: “Get ‘a’ negative announcement out soon Then build share price up again.”

10 December 2008

157. In early December, there were a series of emails between Goodman and Dulhunty, in which Goodman expressed interest in acquiring a larger stake in Healthzone, but also indicated he wanted to sell and was suspicious that the market for Healthzone shares was being manipulated. On 10 December 2008, Dulhunty and Roach approved a further $70,000 to $100,000 in fees for Wu, with Dulhunty stating: “MW seeks fees of around $70k $100k to compensate for salary and buying”. Dulhunty and Wu discussed Goodman wanting to sell Healthzone shares at 35c and who they could get to buy Healthzone shares.

158. At 11.39am, Wu sent an email to Dulhunty, stating: “If we stepped in to buy shares now, it would just make us look like admitting guilty to RG especially after his email?” Dulhunty replied: “Not sure ... We need to have some people buying shares / putting orders on screen. Sekely told me that RG didn’t have issues with people buying, was just interested in selling his shares for 35c Need 5 min plan fast to get some orders from people we know. It is OK to encourage employees, associates to buy shares”.

159. According to notes made by Dulhunty, Andrew Sekely at Intersuisse called Dulhunty, reported on a conversation with Goodman and expressed concern that there were no buyers for Healthzone shares. Wu and Dulhunty subsequently put on Bids, and provided details of the Bids to each other: ""Placed bid of 5000 shares at 28c"" and ""Just ordered 5,000 at 27c and working through another broker"".

160. The Bids traded and reduced the price for Healthzone shares from 34c to 27c. After the Bids traded, Dulhunty sent an email to Wu, stating: “Bad news…we got hit on both of our buy orders…shares down to 27c. Probably RG”. Wu responded: “90% is a trap set by RG with his previous emails…unfortunately you and I jumped onto it”. At 1.50pm, Goodman sent an email to Wu and encouraged him to consider Goodman’s proposals in relation to the company. Goodman also said he would introduce himself to “your partner in China”, a reference to Guoguang Tao, who was Healthzone’s second largest shareholder. Goodman’s email stated:

""Michael Can I just say that I can't understand your change of heart re meeting parties who can forward your ambitions it is December and you may be busy but I would be surprised if you didn't see the importance of the help I am offering you. The stock is 27c no buyer. For your own benefit I would rethink your decision. Business is not going to get any easier in these challenging times and your ebit to debt ratio is alarming. Still happy to help. I will be speaking to your partner in China shortly,via an interpreter if I need . I am sure he is wondering what is going on. I will introduce myself and tell him"".

161. Roach asked what happened with the share price and Dulhunty said: “It was me at 27c and MW at 28 Fell into RG trap. Now there are zero buyers and share price is back down to 27c”. According to notes of a conversation with Goodman which Dulhunty sent to himself, around this time Goodman expressed further concerns about Healthzone, asked for a meeting between Healthzone and a franchise company, and suggested that he would tell Tao about his concerns. Goodman later sent an email to Tao and said: “I am a holder of about 19% of Healthzone and believe you hold about the same percentage. I thought I should contact you to make sure you are aware of what is happening to HZL and its share price in Australia and also see if you have any interested in either buying more stock or selling your stock” and “I will email more detail if I can ascertain whether you are happy with your investment in the company and which way you think it should go forward. Also interested as to why you are not a director of the company”.

9 to 10 March 2009

162. On 9 March 2009, the previous close for Healthzone shares was 27 cents. Dulhunty sent an email to Wu and Roach, stating: “What are doing about the share price collapse? Did you guys get any bites from potential investors such as franchisees, staff? We should remedy this quickly to avoid issues/distractions i.e. RG, JS, GV queries, strategic dumping etc””

163. At 16:07 an amended Bid for 1,500 Healthzone shares at 38c was entered on the Wang Intersuisse Account. The Bid traded in the Closing Auction at 16:10:40, increasing the price of Healthzone shares by 11c from 27c to 38c and set the closing price for Healthzone shares that day.

164. Dulhunty noticed the trade and told Wu that the Healthzone shares price was back up to 38c. Wu confirmed “that was me” and Dulhunty replied he thought it was, and he would buy tomorrow.

165. On 10 March 2008 at 10:28:04, DCC’s CommSec account purchased 5,000 Healthzone shares at 38c and at 10:28:59 a further 5,000 at 39c. The second Bid traded immediately and in full through two price levels increasing the price of Healthzone shares by 1c to 39c, from the last trade at 38c which was executed on the DCC CommSec Account at 10:28:04 that morning. This trade set the closing price for Healthzone shares at 39c that day.

166. Dulhunty confirmed to Wu his purchases and said: ""Put through some buying today. I can now only buy through one of 3 brokers since 2 won’t let me buy HZL shares anymore...Need to get some more support from other people""

14 May 2009

167. On 14 May Wu sent an email to Roach in which he admitted:

""...just between you and me, I've been funding my mates (through their names of course) to buy HZL shares over the last 3 years for at least $250k under RD's 'instruction'...""

17 June to 2 July 2009

168. On 17 June 2009 Roach sent emails to Wu and Jenkins which set out the trades that should be placed to keep the share price at 39c and said:

""We need to keep some momentum going... After the 39c was hit yesterday another BUY for 5000 shares returned the price to 40c... I assume it may have been RG teaching us another management lesson. Profile this morning a 70,000 SELL @ 39c.

We need to put another BUY for say 2000 at 38c, 1500 at .37c FIRST THING TODAY and then watch and when they get hit take another 1000 at 39c to close the price at 39c as the 40c will be too bigger jump. With the screen pretty low on SELL we could also place a few lower BUYS at at mid 30’s that will be likely to sit... but if they get hit we can manage at the close of market to return to 39c with a late small buy. What do you think? ""

169. Roach and Wu approved a bonus to Jenkins of $10,000, in accordance with Jenkin’s executive service agreement.

170. Jenkins on the Jenkins CommSec Account placed Bids for 1,500 Healthzone shares at 37c and 2,000 Healthzone shares at 38c. On 1 July, he placed a further Bid for 1,000 Healthzone shares at 37c and on 2 July another Bid for 1,000 Healthzone shares at 38c. All these Bids traded on 2 July 2009 in full at 37c. The price of Healthzone shares decreased from 39c to 37c due to the entry of an Ask at 37c at 10:02:44 that morning.

171. Jenkins sent an email to Wu and Roach with a screenshot of the market for Healthzone shares after his Bids traded which said: ""Shares"" and Roach replied to Jenkins ""We need to get back to .39 before close... What is the profile?""

172. At 11:01 on 2 July 2009, 1,500 Healthzone shares were bought on the Jenkins CommSec Account. This trade did not move the Healthzone share price. The residual Bid for 500 Healthzone shares at 37c traded on 15 July 2009.

173. At 11:05 on 2 July 2009, 2,000 Healthzone shares were bought on the Jenkins CommSec Account. This trade increased the Healthzone shares price from 37c to 39c from the previous trade at 37c which was executed on the Jenkins CommSec Account at 11:01 that morning. The trade set the closing price for Healthzone shares at 39c that day.

174. At 11:06 Jenkins replied to Roach and copied to Wu: ""done"" and at 11:07 Jenkins sent another email to Roach and copied to Wu which said: ""Done at 39 cents"".

31 August to 1 September 2009

175. On 31 August 2009 at 16:14:23 Healthzone announced 23% growth in net profit after tax for the year to 30 June 2009.

176. On 31 August 2009 Roach sent an email to Wu and Dulhunty, stating: “$24k would close HZL at .42c tomorrow. We need to make sure this happens through support… We can show RG that the market likes what they see even if he thinks its pathetic! I asked Andre if he was a buyer based on his positive response … he said he is “always a buyer if there remains value”. Dulhunty replied ""Good stuff and who and when?""

177. Roach replied that he would ""shop his regulars for commitment.""

178. On 1 September 2009 at 7:56 Roach sent an email to Dulhunty and Wu, referring to two scenarios which would involve spending $29,000 to increase the share price to 42c or spending $15,600 to increase the share price to 40c. Wu replied, stating: “Maybe the best thing is for directors to buy, which ticks another box for RG but I suspect he won’t be pleased but only blaming market manipulation if pushing the price too high? (Eg. Over 25% jumped from 32c to 40c)”.

179. At 14:54 Roach made a small buy on his E*Trade Account of 1,500 Healthzone shares at 34c. Prior to this trade Roach had not purchased shares in Healthzone or in any other listed company on his E*Trade Account. The trade had the effect of increasing the price for Healthzone shares from 32c to 34c. Wu after being unable to purchase Healthzone shares on his Hub 24 account used his Intersuisse Account and placed a Bid for 15,000 Healthzone shares at 36c which traded immediately and in full through two price levels. This increased the price of Healthzone shares by a further 2c to 36c from the previous trade at 34c which was executed on the Roach E*Trade Account at 14:54:22 that afternoon. The trading of this Bid set the closing price for Healthzone shares at 36c for that day.

7 to 15 January 2010

180. In January 2010, the Offenders were about to commence a capital raising through the issue of shares to institutional investors, in two tranches known as “T1” and “T2”. Between 6 and 8 January 2010, the price of Healthzone shares dropped from 41c to 33c. On 7 January 2010, Dulhunty sent an email to Wu and Michael Jenkins, stating: “Shares still down. Needs immediate marketing so as not to stuff T1 and T2. Tried to fix but I cannot.” Roach then responded separately to Wu and Jenkins: “If we don’t get this price back up to .41c HZL will need to issue and xtra 385,965 shares for T1 with issue price to be 75% of the 5 day VWAP = $110,000 dilution Already potentially costing $22k per day for every day we leave at .38c for T1 issue. This is urgent and we can’t buy as Directors or EC but we need to find someone who can fast.” Roach, Wu and Jenkins discussed who might be available to trade.

181. On 8 January 2010, at 8.11am, Roach sent an email to Wu and Jenkins, stating: “We need to do something as USA raised an issue overnight…With investors watching. Potentially could go lower and need to act today and everyday to remedy. Must be someone outside I/S that can support?” At 9.09am, Dulhunty sent an email to Roach, copied to Jenkins and Wu, stating: “Guys…you need to 'market' the shares so as not to stuff the close T1 and T2. Suggest get onto it straight away I tried by am blocked”. Roach approached one associate, who did not have an online trading account, and then asked Pattinson to call him. At 12.57pm, Pattinson placed a Buy order through his wife’s account for 5,005 Healthzone shares, which traded immediately and caused the share price to increase from 31 cents to 33 cents. Pattinson then sent his wife’s bank account details to Roach. Pattinson and Roach exchanged text messages about further trading, with Roach identifying a block of $12,000 worth of Healthzone shares at 33 cents, adding: “If they ask you why tell them they have not been this cheap for ages”. At 3.57pm, Pattinson placed a further Buy order for 37,500 Healthzone shares at the market price, which partially traded before the close.

182. At 9.37am, Roach sent an email to his sister Mary Ann Harper, stating: “I used someone else yesterday and spent $15k. Would have been nice if your account! Anyway would love Andrew to be set up asap so I could use him from Monday if possible. If you can give me all the details I can handle it for you. I need to ensure stability in next month while I am on my roadshow.”

183. On 11 January 2010 Dulhunty sent an email to Roach, Jenkins and Wu which stated: “What’s happening about marketing the shares today and tomorrow? It will not be easy for the shares to rise and may require coordination of buying and selling within daily % change limited”.

184. Roach sought Pattinson to buy Healthzone shares, sending the following message: “Chasing payment advice now... Are you ready to go again to buy at .38c... Currently a 10000 share chunk... Don't buy them all. Then a jump to 50000 shares for .45c so I will get some on sale at .41c that we may get someone else to hit. I will call you when I get transfer advice from bloody accts!!”

185. Roach sent an email to Dulhunty and Wu and asked:

""I have buyer back in onto the 38c stock today. Do I get him to buy the 10,000 chunk or leave some for the next buy to pickup and lift to next level. We need some on sale at .40 to > .43c range. Last thing we want is take out the .38c and someone the put out mor lower priced to sell... better to have sellers at 41, 42 or 43 before we hit at 38.MW is on a flight now so it is up to you or I to get sellers on screen. Can you help with sellers? Best leave MJ out of these emails and use my peter@centurcorp.com address.""

186. Dulhunty replied to Roach and to Wu and said: ""Will help with the selling at 41-43c Would be ideal to take out what can as soon as can (before more sellers jump in) I suspect % movement limits may get in the way and other sellers may jump in""

187. Pattinson bought 5,500 Healthzone shares at 38c on his wife’s account, which increased the Healthzone share price from 33c to 38c. Dulhunty sent a screen-shot of the trading in Healthzone shares to Roach and Wu, noting ""Going good...38c and sell orders at 40c – 42c see below"".

188. Dulhunty placed the following Asks on his DCC CommSec Account: 3,000 Healthzone shares at 40c, 2,000 Healthzone shares at 41c and 2,000 Healthzone shares at 42c. The first Ask was cancelled on 14 January 2010. The remaining two Asks were amended and traded on 13 January 2010.

189. At 1.30pm, Roach obtained the login details for his sister and brother in law's CommSec Account and at 2.49pm a Bid of 16,000 Healthzone shares at 35.5c was placed on the Harper CommSec Account, which traded in part, increasing the price from 33c to 35c. This trade set the close. The Bid for the remaining 1,000 Healthzone shares was amended to 35c.

190. At 3.04pm, Roach sent an email to Dulhunty and Wu, stating:

“Just got another buy through but there was another seller placed 15000 shares at 35c that had to be taken out. The buyer tried to buy 16000 shares at market to get back to 38c but Commsec only allowed 15000 shares which only took the price from 32c back to 35c Should I get it hit again to take out the 38c x 15000 shares or wait? Or maybe wait until 3.55pm and buy 1000 shares to close at 38c? Now someone had just put 1000 on buy at 35c.”

191. An email from Dulhunty said ""Get some now at 38c"" but further Bids to get to 38c were not allowed by CommSec. Roach complained to Dulhunty and Wu about his failed attempts to purchase the Healthzone shares, providing details of the orders placed on the Harper Commsec account:

“Fking Commsec…Put the BUY on for 16000 at market

SELL was 15000 @ 35c and 15000 at 38c

16000 would have closed at 38c

Commsec left 1000 sitting at market for 35c

Went back in to cancel 1000 but Commsec would not allow until after market close.

So placed a new BUY at 38c for 1500 shares

Commsec left on ""Process"" then cancelled 1500 BUY leaving the 1000 sitting as BUY order at 35c

Looks like tomorrow for 38c and higher!""

192. On 12 January 108,000 shares were put up for sale on market at 35c and the closing price for the day dropped from 35c to 33c. Roach sent an email to Dulhunty and Wu, saying: “Another block … With that qty likely RG”, although it was not in fact Goodman. The Offenders discussed different approaches to the share price. At 3.36pm, Roach sent an email to Dulhunty and Wu, stating: “Surprised how popular HZL is at lower prices… What do suggest we do for close today? Ideally 10,000 share buy but Commsec wont cross both prices. So if buy the 7911 we clost at 32.5c If we leave we close at 33c Happy to buy 25,000 shares to close at 40c but Commsec want permit? Any suggestions?"" At 3.40pm, Dulhunty replied: “Options - Buy say 9,000 shares at price of up to 35c to just get back to 35c - Do nothing and wait until tomorrow Preference would be to get back up to 35c and work on growth tomorrow morning"". Ultimately, no trading occurred by or on behalf of Roach, Dulhunty or Wu.

193. On 13 January Dulhunty sent details of the opening buys and sells and suggested at 9.55am a Bid of 9,000 at 35c. Roach was in New York and could not access his computer and asked Dulhunty: ""Can you buy for me....for them?"", including account details for the Harper Account.

194. Dulhunty asked Roach for further details for the Harper Account and a minute later sent an email to Roach which said ""Done"".

195. At 9:52:11 a Bid for 9,000 Healthzone shares at 35c was placed on the Harper CommSec Account which traded at 10:04 in two trades and increased the price of Healthzone shares from 33c to 35c.

196. After the Bid had been placed Dulhunty sent an email to Roach and Wu with a screenshot of the market for Healthzone shares as at 09:53 on 13 January 2010 and a further email at 10:07:28 (once the Bid had traded) to Roach and Wu with the subject ""35c...OK for now"", containing a screenshot of the market for Healthzone shares as at 10:07:44.

197. Dulhunty then amended a number of Asks on his DCC CommSec Account and sent an email with details to Wu and Roach: ""small sells 36 to 38c runway for take off"". Dulhunty asked Roach if “Mary” was to take some up but later sent an email to Roach which told him not to worry as ""there are still more at 35c""

198. Dulhunty continued watching the market and sent an email to Roach with suggestions for “Mary” to take Healthzone shares to 36c and later to 37c, but the account did not have any funds.

199. Dulhunty sent an email to Roach which said: ""The following would be good if someone did as follows: 16,500 at 0.37 = $6105 I can’t do"" and then sent the same email to Wu and Jenkins. Roach replied to Dulhunty suggesting that he could get Pattinson to do the trade and soon after sent Pattinson a text message asking “Brett can you buy 16,500 at 0.37”. Pattinson said “OK” and Roach told Dulhunty that Pattinson would do the trade.

200. However two hours later when the trade had not been executed Dulhunty said to Roach that Pattinson “better hurry up” and Roach sent a text message to Pattinson, stating: “Hey Z, Will you be sure you can do that BUY? Don't want to leave too late”. Roach was told ""its underway"".

201. At 14:54:37 Perry Andronos placed a Bid for 20,000 Healthzone shares at 38c on his CommSec Account which traded immediately in part over four trades, three of which matched with Asks on the DCC CommSec Account. These trades increased the Healthzone share price by a further 3c (from the price of 35c set by the Harper CommSec Account earlier that morning) to 38c and set the closing price for Healthzone shares at 38c that day.

202. Dulhunty saw this trade and sent an email to Roach and Wu which said : ""Great progress : 38c ...would be good to do 2,000 at 40c at 3:55pm if still good"". Dulhunty also sent an email to Jenkins, Roach and Wu and suggested a trading halt once Healthzone shares got to 40c to give them time to deal with the announcement about the capital raising referred to as T1. In an email with the subject “Trading halt and timing”, Dulhunty stated: “This should also be soon after shares get back to 40c Might need to some firepower ready tomorrow with a small open, then keep it up until say lunchtime halt”. Wu replied: “Agree in principle but also might be better to confirm with JO today they are OK with this too”. Roach also replied: “Agree need to discuss with JO but not in context of holding price but good governance”.

203. On 14 January Dulhunty sent an email to Roach which asked about a Plan B for “Mary” in case funds did not clear and asked if Wu's network could assist.

204. Dulhunty also sent an email to Jenkins with a draft of the Trading halt announcement with suggested timing and what to say to the ASX to get the trading halt.

205. Dulhunty sent a further email to Roach with details of sells to put on the Mary Account. However, the Mary Account did not work and Dulhunty tried to find out why.

206. At 09:00:18 and 09:01:47 Dulhunty placed two Asks on his DCC CommSec Account, the first for 3,000 Healthzone shares at 40c and the second for 3,000 Healthzone shares at 41c. The first Ask traded in part at the opening on the market at 10:04:18.

207. Roach sent an email to Dulhunty which said he would get a different account and also asked Dulhunty what was required as to quantity and price. Dulhunty said 2,000 at 40c at 9.55am.

208. Roach sent a text message to Tynas, stating: “Hey day trader! Are you interested in doing some day trading for me and I dd you the bootie?”.

209. Roach then sent an email to Dulhunty which said: ""It will happen as you have described..."" and Dulhunty replied to Roach: ""OK, Should I hold off BP for dry gunpowder if needed? I assume so and plan to call BP in 5 mins"" and later confirmed to Roach: ""BP on hold for now...on standby to fire when ready""

210. At 09:57:49 Roach replied: ""No need I have made other arrangements. Just watch screen for me and update as I cannot. BP is touchy because he goes through phone order broker who is asking to many questions.""

211. At 9:59:39 a Bid for 2,000 Healthzone shares at 40c was entered on the Tynas CommSec account which traded with an Ask on the DCC CommSec Account entered earlier that morning. The trade resulted in a further increase in the price of Healthzone shares by 2c to 40c, from the last trade at 38c which was executed at 14:54:37 on 13 January 2010 on the Andronos CommSec Account and the DCC CommSec Account. The trade between the Tynas and DCC CommSec Accounts set the close at 40c.

212. At 10:46:46 Tynas entered a further Bid for 3,000 Healthzone shares at 41c on his Tynas CommSec Account which he later cancelled.

213. Dulhunty sent an email to Jenkins to proceed with the trading halt which was copied to Roach and Wu. At 11.02am, Dulhunty sent an email to Roach and Wu, stating:

“See below

- Current market profile + How we want it to look at 10am on Monday

- Need to figure out who does what before Monday…from today

- Orders can go on screen any time between now and Monday

- If build up the buy side now, then won't be taken up until Monday...and can remove before Monday

- This might bring others to the table for strong Monday open

Requirements:

- More non-related friendlies...need to start working on this and get a few accounts set up

- With cash coming in, small fees could be agreed (to be paid later)

- Some gossip with people that can invest/buy from Monday....i.e. Andre, Selim, staff etc”

214. At 11.27am, Roach sent a text message to Tynas, stating: “Well done BT ... Now to our the trading halt for the big announcement! Can you give me some acct details so I can set you up with the bootie and make good on the RD promise!” At 2.04pm, Roach sent a text message to Pattinson, stating: “Hey Z, can you text how many shares you purchased for how much each on which day and how much we owe you in total for your bonus?”

215. On 15 January 2010, at 7.39am, Dulhunty sent an email to Roach and Wu, stating: “Very important for T2: - if Monday goes well, then fast and easy - if Monday tanks, then the whole of T2 could be in doubt or take too long Have you guys got any feedback about this? Need to build up friendlies NOW and their accounts now for strong Monday open”. On 17 and 18 January 2010, Dulhunty and Roach discussed which accounts to use and the plan for the trading.

25 February 2010

216. On 24 February 2010, Goodman lodged a Form 604, a notice of change of interest of substantial shareholder, with the ASX that showed 96 sale transactions between 42c and 23c. Roach reported that Goodman was disappointed that the Form 604 did not cause a big dump of Healthzone shares.

217. Dulhunty sent an email to Wu and Roach which said: ""Should be easy to get to 35c if no interference……. MW...can you drive? Ask Roach for the codes"", and Wu replied ""We will be at EGM together so doesn't matter me/Roach to drive.""

218. At 10:11:12 on 25 February 2010 Healthzone released the ""Results of Extraordinary General Meeting"" relating to the approval of a share and warrant issue.

219. At 11:35:23 and 13:07:13 there were Bids for 10,000 Healthzone shares at 33c and 10,000 shares at 33.5c entered on the Harper CommSec Account. The Bids traded immediately. The first traded through two price levels and increased the price of Healthzone shares from 32c to 33c. The second trade increased the price a further .5c to 33.5c and set the close.

220. According to CommSec records, the orders which resulted in the Bids at 11:35:23 and 13:07:13 on the Harper CommSec Account were placed through IP address 203.51.48.91 which according to Telstra was assigned at those times and on that date to username devcap@bigpond.net.au in the name of Dulhunty.

221. After the trading Dulhunty continued watching the orders being placed in the market for Healthzone shares and sent an email to Roach and Wu with a screenshot of the market for Healthzone shares and said ""Will wait and see what happens up to 3:50"" and Roach replied: ""Are you still buying over two price brackets in the same day? This is what RG is cracking over because he said clearly ramping."" Dulhunty replied and said: “10,000 at up to 33 10,000 at up to 33.5 Not ramping… RG is full of it… its just what people do but will be careful not to do again if this buzzes RG’s bonnet bee "". After further shares were put on market at 33c, Dulhunty said: “Someone’s back at 33…RG’s gotta get a life”, although it was not in fact Goodman.

222. After the close Dulhunty sent an email to Wu and Roach informing them of the closing price of Healthzone shares at 33.5c, stating: ""Here's market close at 33.5c. Got distracted at end of day so no trumpy"".

1 March 2010

223. After its shares were suspended from trading Healthzone released its half year accounts after the close.

224. On 1 March 2010, Dulhunty sent emails to Wu and Roach that said he was going to be offline and the “Trumpy” account would need to support Healthzone shares after the suspension and company announcement and Wu would need to drive. Wu requested from and was provided by Dulhunty with the account details, usernames and passwords for the Harper (“Mary”) and Vringer (“Trumpy”) CommSec Accounts. On 2 March 2010, Dulhunty placed an order for 5,000 shares at 35 cents through the “Mary” account, which executed immediately. Dulhunty then emailed Wu, stating: “Mary just did 5k at 35c Logging off now. You'll need to watch and drive carefully today…key stabilisation day with roadshow and following results”. At 11.37am, Roach sent an email to Wu, stating: “We have used $65k to date and I have had $60k transferred to me by invoice. RD has done another trade today. It is starting to build up. I will need another deposit and I can only imagine what PC is thinking with my nose in the trough! Have you got any opportunity to provide a Mary or Trumpy? Meanwhile HZL are going to have to top me up. I will send an invoice later today but you will need to make sure MJ processes today. Also, can you arrange from Mary a range of BUY prices to make the screen look a little stronger?” Wu replied: “Shall do and will try to find some Mary and Trumpy”.

19 March 2010

225. Before the market opened Roach sent an email to Dulhunty and Wu, concerned that the “Mary” account ""is out of action for now"" and there were issues in relation to using the “Trumpy” account. Dulhunty replied and asked:

""Who is now going to sell the 2,000 at 29c? (need small seller for Trumpy to buy). RD can't buy and sell at same time. Mary possibly out of action (and prefer to keep as buyer anyway). Propose to check Trumpy buying ability closer to 10am"".

226. Wu informed Dulhunty ""Ok, shall wait your further instruction. The sell orders of mine are: 6000 at 33c and 8000 at 34c.""

227. Wu and Dulhunty exchanged emails which discussed the timing of sells which Wu placed on the Wang Intersuisse Account to be purchased by Trumpy. In one of the emails Dulhunty told Wu: ""OK, You'll need to put in sell order of 4,000 at 29c at 10:00.Trumpy will buy to meet thFis."" and Wu replied ""Done"".

228. At 9:21:11 an Ask for 4,000 Healthzone shares at 29c was entered on the Wang Intersuisse Account.

229. Dulhunty sent detailed instructions to Roach and Wu about the timing of other trades and a further email that set out the following reasons why the timing was important:

""Just for future reference...supposed to wait until 10am to do this (per email below). Reason...to stop others coming in at same level. Next time....carefully read timing instructions in email too...might be important. Have you removed the 8000 sell at 34c?""

230. However despite the planning Dulhunty informed Wu and Roach that the “Trumpy” account was prevented from buying and Dulhunty used his DCC CommSec to purchase the Healthzone shares.

231. Bids were subsequently entered and traded on the DCC Commsec and the DCC Novus accounts and resulted in Dulhunty buying 11,000 Healthzone shares on the DCC Commsec account and 71,000 Healthzone shares on the DCC Novus account, of which 10,800 Healthzone shares were sold by the Wang Intersuisse account. The trading increased the price of Healthzone shares from 26c to 35c and set the close.

232. Dulhunty and Roach discussed whether to ""just maintain 35c"" or to get to 37c and they decided to leave it at 35c. At 10.50am, Dulhunty sent an email to Roach and Wu, stating: “35 now… up 34% … a bit suss but had to do while can. In hindsight, it would have been a better idea to get some positive announcement before 10am as a basis for people buying. Looks a bit suss with 34% increase for no reason… but then again… near recent prices so ok and explainable. Next? – Just wait around and see what happens to 3pm? – At around 3.30…see if can get to 37? … might be too high”. At 2.24pm, Dulhunty sent a further email to Roach and Wu, stating: “Great. Current proposed strategy is to just maintain 35c. Can easily get to 37c at say 3.50pm with 12,000 x 35c = around $4k. Factors For: - Higher price for USA close… but only another 2c. Factors Against: - Looks suss… maybe a bit too high for one day – Potential ASX review. What would you prefer? On standby to execute.” Roach responded that it was “better to close at 35c than risk appearing dodgy”. Wu also responded that they should “maintain the price at 35c to avoid any potential “shut down” of DCC’s account or associates”.

233. During the course of the day Roach sent emails to Dulhunty and Wu which set out his concerns that the “Mary” account would be closed and the “Trumpy” account was under review. Dulhunty replied to Roach:

""Sounds suss. Tarred with Mary brush for now. Possibly RG complaints. At the end of the day, anyone is allowed to buy and sell shares at whatever price they like...because they like the company, believe in it, support its growth initiatives. It is almost impossible to prove ‘motive’ for ramping or dumping...something which RG knows well. Even if investigated, nothing happens if Trumpy / Mary just say they like the company. Insider trading is a LITTLE bit easier to prove....but there’s nothing material that isn’t already in the market... everyone’s seen market updates and everyone knows there’s a placement in progress. The more likely scenario is that RG heard that he’s stuffing the placement and he’s selling… he’d be more in the firing line than anyone. Risk of action = very low. Risk that Comsec might just freeze accounts…probable… but not much consequence ""

234. Later Dulhunty noted ""Closed at 35c...."" to which Roach replied to Dulhunty: ""Well done!""

3 to 5 May 2010

235. On 3 May 2010 Healthzone released an announcement regarding its international growth.

236. Following the announcement on 4 May Dulhunty sent an email to Roach and Wu which noted ""Someone’s offering 2500 shares at 31c Might be better to get rid of it early and get back to 32c than leave it hanging there while lobsters from the 32c group climb down to 31 Up to you guys..."" and that he would be offline from 3.30 pm but noted ""Some more low flying lobsters now...might want to think about take-out of the 31c bracket before more crawl in. Could get hard if hit 28.5c...could happen any time"".

237. Roach replied and confirmed that he would drive “Trumpy” and two Bids were then entered by the Vringer CommSec Account: one for 9,482 Healthzone shares at 30c and a further Bid for 12,400 Healthzone shares at 31c. Both Bids traded immediately and in full which increased the price of Healthzone shares from 30c to 31c and this trade set the close. Roach sent an email to Dulhunty and Wu in which he confirmed he had conducted the trades.

238. After the close Roach sent an email to Dulhunty and Wu and complained that he was prevented by CommSec from placing further trades.

239. On 5 May Dulhunty sent an email to Roach and Wu which said:

""Need a non-comsec buyer (anyone) to buy some at 10am at 32c...while can.... to stop lobsters crawling to 31. Who can do this? I can’t, because I’m being watched closely With every comsec account, they will not let anyone raise the price of HZL...even if the same person pushes the price down, then back up. What is the plan for setting up non-comsec accounts?....Been talking about it for weeks and now stuck.""

240. Roach replied to Wu that they only have “BP”, a reference to Pattinson, and “Mr X”, a reference to Tynas, as their non-CommSec options.

241. About an hour and a half later Dulhunty sent an email to Roach and Wu which said ""C’mon...can someone get in at 32 before the lobsters drop? Too slow yesterday"" and Roach tried to increase the price to 32c by trading on the Vringer Account but CommSec would not allow the Bid or the Ask. Roach informed Dulhunty and Wu about the failed Bid, stating: “Tried to buy 2000 shares at 32c and order cancelled due to ""Orderly Market"" = joke!”. Roach also informed both Vringers about the failed trading on their account.

242. Roach informed Dulhunty that he tried to contact “BP” and “BT”, a reference to Tynas, but had not received a reply, so Dulhunty asked Wu:"" MW....any chance of jumping in?""

243. Roach continued sending text messages to Pattinson and Dulhunty emailed instructions: ""C’mon guys!...can’t SOMEONE pick up 5k at 32c ?""

244. Ultimately the Frame CommSec Account purchased 5,000 Healthzone shares at 32c to increase the price for Healthzone shares from 31c to 32c (from the last trade at 31c which was executed on the Vringer CommSec Account at 15:49:13 on 4 May 2010). The trade set the close at 32c.

245. Roach informed Dulhunty ""Got it... on CommSec..."" and told Pattinson that he got someone else to do his “dirty work”.

246. Jinks sent Roach details of the Frame trade and said ""Let me know if you've lost my a/c details.""

247. Dulhunty had not been convinced they would get the trade on CommSec and continued to ask about setting up new accounts. He stated: ""OK, we’re gonna need a few at different places...i.e. 4-5 accounts If ASX is suss we’ll need a few"".

7 to 11 May 2010

248. On 7 May Roach sent an email to Wu, stating: ""We need to reimburse MJ1 for his trade. How best do you want to approach? If we pay as bonus do we have to take tax out or can it be a gross payment? Any ideas as we will be using both DL and MJ1 moving forward”.

249. At 4.13pm, Ellen Vringer sent Roach the letter from CommSec closing the Vringer (“Trumpy”) CommSec Account.

250. At 4:39pm on 11 May 2010 Roach sent an email to Trudy Potts, Wu, Jenkins and Jinks with the subject “Bonus Payment”. The email stated: ""Trudy Please arrange a $5,000 bonus payment for Matthew Jinks. Please deduct tax as required and pay balance to his normal account. Thanks, Peter Roach"".

17 to 18 May 2010

251. On 17 May Dulhunty sent an email to Roach and Wu about the closing of T2 and that there was ""Good current opportunity to get price up to 35c for $9,500. Requirement – quick buy up of block before lobsters come in” and he then set out the factors for and against: “Factors for: - Can do it.. which often can’t. – First mover momentum in the right direction… much better than responding to negative. – Make close easier if not done. – Make Singapore buyout of RG easier. – Keep investors happy. Factors against: - $9,500 cost,,, negligible in the overall scheme of things. – Might come back down… less likely to go down if heading up.” Dulhunty concluded: “I reckon it’s a goer…should also consider fodder for next announcements. Would be good to get some news/updates from executive team.”.

252. Roach sent Dulhunty's email to Wu and agreed: ""Agree it is a window of opportunity. If we use DL or MJ2 it will cost us $9.5k x 50% for tx and super. Trumpy has STG up and running but STG needs cash on account unlike CommSec where you pay 3 days later. Do you have any other options? If not suggest we get Brett to buy and he invoice HZL for $9.5k Any other suggestions?""

253. Roach sent text messages to Pattinson and asked ""How quick can you buy 29800 shares @ 32c?"" and informed Wu that he was getting “BP” to do the trade and his plan for a further trade by Jinks. Pattinson replied that he would contact his mate.

254. For some time, Roach had been discussing with Goodman the purchase of his shares by another investor. At 12.40pm, Goodman sent a text message to Roach, stating: “My stock will be put through mkt today or tomorrow. Please let me know the main things I need to see in Shanghai”. At 12.45pm, Dulhunty sent an email to Roach, stating:

""Questions:

- Is BP with Comsec or another broker?

- Have you got funds cleared into the SGB account?...electronic takes 1-2 days…need cash deposit.

- Is BT available today?

Here's what need....all needs to be done very quickly within the space of 10 minutes before lobsters crawl in.

Step 1...within 2 minutes of each other.

- Seller of 5,000 at 30c...anyone...what about Mary?

- Buyer of 5,000 at 30c...non-comsec...BT, BP, St George, MW contacts.

Step 2...within 10 minutes.

- Buyer of 29,800 at 32c... non-comsec for the step up...but can participate in band...as above

- Buyer of 5,000 at 35c...non-comsec...as above""

255. At 12.48pm, Roach forwarded Goodman’s message to Dulhunty and Wu with a suggested response. At 1.20 pm, Dulhunty sent a email to to Roach and Wu, stating: ""I guess so....what doing in HK? Is that to meet the Singapore investor? Is there any reason for RG to be in Shanghai other than to bother Tao to sell to RG? RESPONSE ....EYS would like to proceed at 30c which was the placement price, not the higher 35c that you asked since our meeting with them. This is at a premium to today's price of 27c. Would you like to proceed?"" At 1.52pm, Roach sent a text message to Goodman proposing the sale of his shares to a particular investor, based on Dulhunty’s suggestion, to which Goodman responded by asking if it was a firm bid.

256. The Offenders exchanged emails about the need to raise the price. Roach asked Dulhunty to watch the market and let him know when the trade was executed so he could action the 35c buy and Dulhunty confirmed that he would watch the market.

257. After a couple of hours Roach requested assistance from Dulhunty to move the price from 27c to 32c as “BP's mate” had been stopped from putting on the Bids and he was worried about using “DL” and “MJ” accounts as they had just purchased shares and Wu was not answering.

258. Dulhunty suggested some steps, discussed the options with Roach, watched the market and commented when nothing happened, but eventually “BP's mate” traded.

259. Andronos tried to place three Bids on his CommSec account which were rejected by CommSec. Later Andronos placed a further Bid for 5,000 Healthzone shares at 29.5 which traded with an Ask from the Frame CommSec Account. This trade increased the Healthzone share price from 27c to 29.5c and set the close. After this trade a further two Bids on this account were stopped by CommSec and did not enter the market. The closing price was 2.5c below the previous closing price of 32c.

260. After the trade Roach sent an email to Dulhunty and Wu, stating: ""Underway now... Everyone so slow!"" At the close of the market Dulhunty suggested that they needed further accounts where they can get the passwords and drive trades online and sent details of a number of brokers, stating: “Suggest get everyone to set up new accounts TOMORROW”. Dulhunty later sent an email that set out a list of potential brokers for new trading accounts.

261. On 18 May Roach and Wu exchanged emails which discussed Roach's trading plan for that day, which involved Wu managing “RG” and the market. Roach confirmed that “BP” would buy 29,800 at 32c and Wu would have to get “DL” or someone to buy 3,000 Healthzone shares at 35c, but warned him not to leave his 4pm run too late as they were really slow.

262. Dulhunty watched the market and sent reminders to Wu setting out what he should be doing.

263. Andronos entered two Bids on his CommSec Account: one at 11:11:46 for 5,000 Healthzone shares and the other at 11:13:52 for 24,800 Healthzone shares at 32c which increased the price for Healthzone shares from (the last Andronos trade) from 29.5c to 32c. The second trade at 11:13:52 set the close.

264. After that trade Dulhunty and Wu continued to watch the market.

265. After the close Pattinson sent a text to Roach stating “$11,070.85 was the total"" and Wu confirmed to Roach that he closed at 32c because the “lobsters” jumped out between 32 and 35c.

23 to 25 June 2010

266. On 23 June Dulhunty sent an email to Wu and Roach with a screenshot of the market for Healthzone shares with the subject ""Shares 25c - lowest sell at 30c"" to which Wu replied ""What would you suggest for the SP?"".

267. Dulhunty replied ""Buy any amount soon at 30c which is the current selling price ...before selling price reduces"" and Roach replied: ""We will have to ramp want we?"" Dulhunty's suggestion was: ""4k at 27.5 with seller 3k at 30.0 at market""

268. Roach asked Jinks about the delay in trading, but Jinks replied that it was ""Done. Waiting for confirmation"", although it appears the Bid was in fact blocked by CommSec.

269. There were four Bids placed on the Frame CommSec account all of which were referred to CommSec personnel and did not enter the market.

270. Roach sent Wu an email with all the details for the Vringer (“Trumpy”) Account with E*Trade and said: ""I will need you to drive as I will be with Norgate Here are the codes."" Roach also sent a text message to Wu which said: ""You will need to coordinate as I am with GN in 10 min. You would need to push Brett as he is slow. Just sent you Trumpy details"".

271. The Vringer E*Trade Account entered a Bid of 3,000 Healthzone shares at 27.5c which traded with an Ask from the Wang Intersuisse Account which was placed earlier that day and increased the price from 25c to 27.5c. This trade set the close.

272. Roach in an email to Dulhunty and Wu confirmed that further attempts to increase the price from 27.5c to 30c were blocked by E*Trade.

273. On 24 June Wu was asked by Roach to ""Please hit 30c asap before Dennis got hit on his 27.5c"" but the attempts by Limbert to lodge Bids on the Limbert CommSec Account were blocked by CommSec.

274. Ultimately the Vringer E*Trade Account purchased 2,000 Healthzone shares at 30c, with the the Bid trading immediately and in full, increasing the price of Healthzone shares by a further 2.5c to 30c from the last trade at 27.5c which was executed on the Vringer E*Trade Account at 15:32:55 on 23 June 2010. The trade set the closing price for Healthzone shares at 30c that day.

275. Roach emailed Dulhunty and Wu and said ""Done"" and Wu sent a text to Roach that said ""Done"" and said there are new sellers at 30c to watch, which Roach confirmed. Dulhunty separately sent an email to Roach and Wu suggesting that he wanted to divest his Healthzone shares, leading to an email from Roach to Wu which stated: “Clearly RD will be just another RG”.

276. On 25 June Roach sent a text message to Wu which said: ""Need to get it back asap before others drop below 30c can you drive?"" Wu replied ""I noticed, driving it now. Will need someone to bid at 28c"" and Roach replied ""Get Dennis"".

277. The Wang Intersuisse Account bought 20,000 Healthzone shares at 30c which traded through two price levels and increased the Healthzone share price from 26c to 30c and the last trade set the close.

278. Roach asked Wu to watch the market until the close and Wu confirmed that Healthzone shares closed at 30c.

29 June 2010

279. On 29 June Dulhunty and Roach discussed the fact that the Frame Account was closed by CommSec and Dulhunty asked how they were going with new accounts: “How going with accounts at other brokers? I reckon you need 4-5 others spread between a few places in case 1 or 2 lock up”. Roach replied that they had “burnt” five accounts including Dulhunty's and had “burnt” his contacts so he did not want to “play again”.

THIRD PERIOD OF OFFENDING, AUGUST 2010-NOVEMBER 2011: WU AND ROACH

Overview

280. In the Third Period of Offending, Wu and Roach took action whenever they deemed it necessary to create or maintain an artificial price for Healthzone shares at a level that they believed required in the circumstances.

281. Wu and Roach continued to communicate by email to monitor the price of Healthzone shares and agree on a plan to create or maintain an artificial price at the desired level.

282. They traded on their own accounts (Roach’s E*Trade Account 3201093; Wu’s Intersuisse Account and the MGR Hub 24 Account number, 35115) as well as by using third party accounts (the Vringer E*Trade Account) and using or requesting others to use third party accounts (the Wang Intersuisse Account).

283. By this stage the other third party CommSec Accounts had been closed or, as in the case of Limbert’s, was about to be closed.

284. Dulhunty was no longer involved in the conspiracy or Healthzone generally, since the middle of 2010.

285. Throughout the Third Period of Offending from August 2010 to November 2011 there were 260 trades conducted pursuant to the agreement, of which 4 were wash trades, as follows:

•   Wu operated trading accounts in his name and the name of his company MGR, and used or asked family members to use a trading account in the name of Wei Wang, by providing trading instructions. There were a total of 194 trades, involving the purchase of 1,882,830 shares and an overall investment of $629,316.

•   Roach used a trading account in his name to carry out 11 trades, involving the purchase of 75,999 shares and an overall investment of $30,914.

•   Both Roach and Wu at various times used the Vringer E*Trade Account to execute 54 trades, involving the purchase of 133,720 shares and an overall investment of $48,343.

•   Roach asked one other person, Limbert, to carry out one trade in this period, by giving him trading instructions, involving the purchase of 9,105 shares and an overall investment of $2,549.

286. Examples of the communications and trading for this period are set out below.

9 August 2010

287. At this time, Roach and Wu were trying to maintain the Healthzone share price in order to make Healthzone shares attractive to potential US investors at the end of a capital raise initiative. On 7 July 2010, Roach had sent an email to Wu, stating: “We need to work this again tomorrow I am going to check that 68,925 is not Roger Wells! I will put a sell order fromTrumpy at 36c and get DL to sell 2500 at 42c and see if I can get another for Trumpy of 20000 at 45c. After I check if the 32c is RW and if so he will remove by my undertaking but we will need another seller at say 33c then we need to strike early. How much fire power do you have to BUY...I know we can close the raise if I can get price to 40c = new $800k to $1.5mill”. In response to Wu indicating he had $10,000 remaining, Roach stated: “We will need to have HZL allocate as some form of bonus to achieve as we need to get this price up and the capital raise closed”.

288. On 9 August Roach asked Limbert to put on a Bid at 28.5c. Limbert entered a Bid for 9,105 Healthzone shares at 28c on his CommSec account which traded and the price for Healthzone shares decreased from 29.5c to 28c. Minutes later Limbert tried to put on a Bid for 2,000 Healthzone shares at 29.5, but CommSec did not enter the Bid into the market.

289. Within minutes of the trade Limbert sent a text message to Roach: ""9105 @ .28 and 2000 @ .295 done as requested. = $3139.40"" Roach replied: ""Yes"" and Limbert responded: ""Done"".

290. Approximately half an hour later Roach sent a text message to Limbert and asked: ""Please buy the 2000 shares @ 29.5c asap"" and Limbert replied: ""I have"".

291. At approximately 15:17:17, an Order was placed to buy 2,000 Healthzone shares at 29.5c on the Limbert CommSec Account. The order was referred to CommSec personnel and again was not entered into the market.

292. Nearly half an hour later Roach sent a text message to Wu and told him: ""CommSec will not let DL get the price to return to 29.5c can you get a mate to buy back into 29.5c in the next 20 min?"" and sent the same message again.

293. At 15:49:41, 4,000 Healthzone shares at 29.5c were purchased on the Wang Intersuisse Account. The trade increased the Healthzone share price from 28c to 29.5c and set the closing price for the day.

294. Minutes later Roach sent an email to Wu:

""The longer we leave our price unchanged the more discontent we will suffer. It may take that $100k rush to pull up to 40c and if I can convince JO to keep his guys out of the screen we could do it for a lot less. These guys may make RG look like an angel. I don't get their 5 minute logic but clearly Healthzone shares are not meeting expectations. Any idea what the Reuter report is?""

20 to 28 September 2010

295. On 20 September 2010, Roach sent an email to Wu outlining a further strategy in relation to the Healthzone share price: “We need to get some sell profile active. Trumpy have just put another 8000 shares for sale at 0.33c that have not yet shown up but the only other two sellers are also Trumpy with 10,000 @ .35c and 15,000 @ 38c So there are only two real sellers at .29c and .28c We should leave the lower prices thin but put some larger chunks in higher prices. It has been commented to me that there is simply not a seller market for the shares which is silly because we can control that”. On 24 September 2010 Jenkins sent an email to Roach and Wu which said the Healthzone share price was 26c and Roach sent an email to Wu and Jenkins that said in part: ""As soon as share price back to 30c I have a buyer for $280k preserved share balance.""

296. Roach sent a similar email to Jenkins and Wu on 27 September:

""... I am working on the share price to get the $280k outstanding in but we keep having these low flying lobsters hit the screen. We currently have 120,000 shares sub 30c which could be cleaned out with $33k buyer but other may well back in behind them at sub 30c pricing. JB and RW are both sellers and I am guessing one of them has contacted Quam to sell their block of what they have represented as 1.5% of the Company at 25c per share. I have two buyers I am working on to take the block but it is a PITA that the very actions of JB yet again are preventing cash coming into HZL!""

297. On 28 September, at 2.38pm Jenkins sent an email to Roach and Wu with subject “Share price 26 cents” containing a screenshot of the market for HZL as at 2.37pm. At 3.06pm, Roach sent an email to Wu with subject ""Shares at 25.5c... we cant let it slide!"" with details of the sell profile for Healthzone, stating ""We need to at least get back to .26c and better if we could mop up to say .29c or even 30c… so we can get that $280k out of O’Shea which he said as soon as price back to 30c has has a buy trigger for the balance of the preserved shares… which I have no idea what that is! Can you help with your boys?""

298. At 3.17pm on 28 September 2010 the Wang Intersuisse Account entered a Bid for 72,276 Healthzone shares at 28c, which traded through three price levels and increased the price from 25.5c to 28c. The third trade at 15:17:42 set the close. At 4.32pm, Jenkins sent an email to Roach and Wu with subject “Share price 28 cents” containing a screenshot of the market for HZL as at 4:31pm.

5 November 2010

299. Wu and Roach wanted to increase the Healthzone share price to 33c and Roach sent an email to Wu stating: ""First time I have ever seen a Bot working our stock... all the 4,000 bought. This is a good thing in that we are getting on the radars of market traders but bad in that they also play games with possible short selling when opportunity arises. Could be our chance today to assist… subject to movements before close”.

300. Wu replied: ""Agree. Subject to the movement and profile prior to close, we should maybe aim to ramp up to 33c if possible”. Wu questioned the ""cost column"" in Roach's email and Roach replied with an explanation and details of how much it would cost for example to get to 32c: ""Cumulative cost from all price points below plus $500 to buy into each new price break. Eg. To lift to 32c will cost all 31.5c at $4,954.64 +$500.00 into the 32c seller = $5,454.64 It will cost $23,917.14 to close at 33c with no further movement today. So do we wait and hope no larger seller gather or go straight for the 33c now... the window seems now"".

301. Wu replied at 12:04: ""Maybe wait until around 1pm or 2pm? Who can do it? Wang is in Asia at the moment and can't locate him.""

302. On 5 November 2010 at 15:51:41, 2,500 Healthzone shares at 32c were purchased on the Vringer E*Trade Account. This trade increased the Healthzone shares price from 31c to 32c and set the closing price for the day.

303. At 16:06:06 Wu sent an email to Roach which said: ""My one is not available this week as he's in Asia :("" to which Roach replied: “No worries…I used Trumpy to close at 32c on the back of 24 trades for 562,780 shares… we are a real stock now! The sweetest treat was closing VMT down 0.5c to 11.5c to get some cash to close Healthzone shares up 1c… that made me feel even better!""

1 December 2010

304. On 30 November 2010 at 9:10:14, the ASX released details of Roach's Chairman's address to shareholders and at 11:24:54 Healthzone released the results of the AGM.

305. At 11.13am, on 1 December 2010 Jenkins sent an email to Roach and Wu with the subject “Share price 32 cents” containing a screenshot of the market in HZL as at 11:12am. Soon after, the Wang Intersuisse Account sold 100,000 Healthzone shares and these trades moved the Healthzone shares price from 32c to 32.5c. A couple of hours later between 13:25:54 and 13:27:24 the Vringer E*Trade Account purchased 25,000 Healthzone shares at 34.5c with an increase of the share price 2c to 34.5c and 5,000 at 35c with an increase of a further .5c. These trades moved the Healthzone shares price from 32.5c to 35c.

306. Roach sent an email to Wu as follows: ""Time to run now... no time to lose..."" with a screenshot of the current market for Healthzone shares and said:

""I have taken out 25,000 @ 34.5c and 5,000 at 35c and then more dropped in at 35c. Can you take out the current 23,300 at 35c, 25,000 @ 36c and 5000, 12,000 @ 36.5c and then 5000 into the 37c? I am available to help as required. We also need to place some higher sell orders into the 40c region to build a higher profile. Please update asap as to your moves…""

307. An Ask for 15,000 Healthzone shares at 40c was entered on the Vringer E*Trade Account which did not trade until 20 December 2010.

308. This was followed by a Bid for 38,300 Healthzone shares at 35c entered on the Wang Intersuisse Account which traded immediately and in full at 35c. Then an additional Bid for 3,000 Healthzone shares at 36c which traded immediately and in full which increased the price by a further 1c to 36c.

1 to 3 March 2011

309. In early 2011, Roach and Wu discussed strategies for increasing the Healthzone share price. On 6 January 2011, Roach sent an email to Wu, stating: “The spread is our daily danger zone. I am sure the next round of IR activity will again build momentum but we also need to build the Seller side with more depth and volume. The 50c is Trumpy and suggest if you can would be good to get your boys to place some volume in higher prices. The Buyers side has some stupid prices so why not the Seller side maybe even up to 60c. We saw the run up a few weeks ago to 48.5c and it would not have been possible if the Sellers profile was not providing for it...” On 14 February 2011, Roach sent an email to Wu, stating: “We need to coordinate this better…Trumpy selling and Wang buying…Albeit on large volumes”.

310. On 28 February 2011 Healthzone released its half yearly results. On 1 March Roach sent an email to Wu and asked if Wang was available to buy and later another email about their US investors and said that “the yanks” would deem the half yearly results bad as the actual performance did not compare to the forecasts. He asked Wu: ""….Do you think it would be worth taking out the 43c, 46.5c and eat into a small bite of 47c?. Wang could then sell down again in coming days hopefully. Or should you and I start buying and announce?.........""

311. Although the Wang Intersuisse Account entered two Bids, one for 5,000 Healthzone shares at 42.5c at 10:17:11 and again at 10:17:34 for 5,000 Healthzone shares at 43c and purchased 10,000 Healthzone shares, the price went down from 43c to 42.5c.

312. Wu sent an email to Dulhunty which said: ""I think it's actually much powerful if you and I start buying large chunk say 60k shares each, which will not only help the share price but further positive news to be deemed by the market? …………""

313. Following a further price decrease at 15:18:15 3,500, Healthzone shares at 42.5c were purchased on the Vringer E*Trade Account. The Bid traded through two price levels and increased the Healthzone share price from 39.5c to 42.5c and set the closing price for the day.

314. After the close Roach sent an email to Wu which confirmed the “Trumpy” trade and asked about Wang as follows: ""…Lots of volume but price held with a quick Trumpy buy at the end of the day. How much was Wang? Never seen the BUY side so washed out ""

315. On 2 March Roach sent an email to Wu which said: ""Solid Buy side now… Clearly some investors think the numbers were OK. The lobster have gather at 43c as expected but the open will clear 50,000 as BUY meets SELL at 43c I think the rest of the lobster will clear in short order. We need to keep the pressure on the shallow sellers between 43c and 48c thereafter."" Later Roach sent a further email to Wu with a screenshot of the current market for Healthzone shares and said: ""PITA…Low flying lobsters Any thoughts…""

316. At 15:26:05, Wu entered a Bid to purchase 200,000 Healthzone shares at 42c on his Intersuisse Account. The Bid traded through three price levels and these trades increased the Healthzone share price from 40c to 42c and set the closing price for the day.

317. After the close, Healthzone announced Richard Eu as an Alternate Director to Ian Spence and later Roach sent an email to Wu with the subject ""Healthzone director bought on-market"" which attached a link to a press release.

318. At 12.27pm on 3 March 2011, Roach entered a Bid for 60,000 Healthzone shares at 42c on his E*Trade Account which traded at 41c and 42c and increased the Healthzone share price from 37c to 42c. Minutes later Roach sent an email to Wu and confirmed: ""Just pulled back up with 60,000 shares from 37c to 42c. Need to watch closely for close"". At 2.13pm and 3.35pm, Jenkins sent emails to Roach and Wu, noting the share price for Healthzone was 42 cents and then 41 cents, and enclosing the market depth for Healthzone shares.

319. On 4 March, 31 March, 4 April there were emails between Ellen Vringer and Roach about the payment of a bonus. Roach stated: “Unfortunately MW and I had to buy shares to support the market and HZL is to reimburse me but cannot be done through Gillian and MW agreed I should use the money that was double paid” Roach separately emailed Wu, suggesting the amount that he should be paid: “I would suggest $40k - $50k so it does not align with the $30k share buying and provides a little head space for support in the near future”.

27 April 2011

320. Before the market opened Roach sent a text message to Wu, stating:

""You should try and pull back the SP today and then you must get your 3Y lodged at close of trade. We need to be sure to only state buys in such a way that buries individual buy price.""

321. Wu replied: ""Ok to join 10am call, I will see how much is required to pull back the SP as I haven't topped up the account yet since the buy last week with $21k.""

322. At 12:06:52 an Ask 143,400 Healthzone shares at 35c was entered on the Wang Intersuisse Account. The Ask traded immediately and in full at 35c. The trading did not move the Healthzone share price.

323. Approximately two and a half hours later Roach sent an email to Wu with the subject ""SP"" and a screenshot of the current market for Healthzone shares: ""Anything we can do?""

324. Wu replied by a text message and said: ""Maybe u can buy 23000 shares at cost of around $8245 to lift up the price to 39c. Then my 3y can be announced tomorrow and yours on Friday? Or vice versa?""

325. Roach replied: ""I can only buy through St George and it will allow even a 1c increase. Can you buy now and we get a payment back to you by Friday?""

326. At 15:53:43, a Bid for 23,000 Healthzone shares at 37c was entered on the Wu Intersuisse Account. The Bid traded immediately and in part for 20,900 Healthzone shares at 35c, 36c and 37c, increasing the price of Healthzone shares by 2c to 37c, from the last traded price of 35c which was executed pursuant to the Ask entered on the Wang Intersuisse Account at 12:06:52 that morning. The trading left a residual Bid for 2,100 Healthzone shares at 37c which was amended at 15:55:55 to 2,100 at 39c, which traded immediately and in full at 39c and increased the price from 37c to 39c and this trade set the close.

327. Immediately after the trade Wu sent a text message to Roach: ""Done"" and Roach replied: ""Into 37c can we buy 1000 shares into 39c?""

328. At 15:55:55, the residual Bid for 2,100 Healthzone shares on the Wu Intersuisse Account was amended from 37c to 39c. The residual Bid traded immediately and in full increasing the price of Healthzone shares by a further 2c to 39c from the last traded price of 37c which was executed on the Wu Intersuisse Account at 15:53:43 that afternoon. The trading set the closing price for Healthzone shares at 39c that day.

329. Within minutes of trading Wu replied to Roach and said: ""I placed the order of 23000 shares on market, should lift SP to 39c"" and Roach replied: ""Done... Great""

330. After the close Roach sent Wu an email which said: ""Send me some sort of invoice for the cost. Also do you want me to review 3Y?"" and Wu replied: ""I'm working on 3y now"" and then Wu sent an email to Roach with an Appendix 3Y Change of Director's Interest Notice for Michael Wu dated 27 April 2011 for Roach to review.

18 May 2011

331. On 18 May 2011 at 8 am Roach sent a text message to Wu and said: ""Do not respond to email re shares I just sent you. Txt only""

332. Just after 11 am Roach sent an email to Wu with the subject ""SP"" and a screenshot of the current market for Healthzone shares and said: ""I would not be surprized to find RD is a seller. His usual response to our rejection. Have you bought yet? Maybe you can pull back by watching profile. VERY light buy side as a result. We must be very careful to get good news out soon or risk being crucified.""

333. Just before 3pm Roach sent an email to Wu with the subject ""Urgent"" with a screenshot of the current market for Healthzone shares which said:

""I bet this is RD! Just the pattern at which he works… Are you going to buy today? If so it would be good to pull back to 34c asap before there is any panic. If someone is playing with us it we will have to watch VERY closely to 4pm to see if anyone is trying to drag us back. Please let me know you are watching. Spoke with Phil Wiltshire and you and I are calling back juts after market close. I will call you first to brief you on my call. I am tied up now for 30 min.""

334. Immediately afterwards Roach sent a text message to Wu and said: ""Pls check my email on share price"".

335. Wu replied: ""Haven't bought but can buy 25k shares?"" and Roach replied and said: ""21024 on sell @31c and 76923 on sell @ 34c We only need to get back to 34c"". Wu responded: ""Maybe 22k on market then"" and Roach said: ""Ok"" . However nearly ten minutes later Roach told Wu: ""HZL Price has fallen to $0.300 18-05-11 15:34:09 Last:$0.300 Vol:437145 Trades:17.""

336. A minute later Roach sent a further text message to Wu: ""This is nasty SP activity please watch close closely and do what it takes as I in with Matt Jinks. If it is RD we will not win but we can't close this low"". Wu replied: ""Just lift up to 34c but I bet it's not RD as the sell profile is very strange""

337. At 15:43:54 on 18 May 2011, 5,000 Healthzone shares at 34c were bought on the Wu Intersuisse Account. These trades moved the Healthzone shares price from 30c to 34c.

338. Nearly a minute later Roach sent a text message to Wu and said: ""Still showing 30c on screen, are you on line?"" and then a further text message to Wu: ""OK back to 34c""

339. At 15:56:13, 1,000 Healthzone shares at 34c were bought on the Wu Intersuisse Account. This trade did not move the Healthzone share price and set the closing price for the day.

340. That evening Wu sent an email to Roach with the subject ""RE: 3Y"" attaching an Appendix 3Y Change of Director's Interest Notice for Michael Ge Wu dated 18 May 2011 and asking Roach for his feedback

341. Roach replied and asked Wu: ""How many did you buy today?"" and Wu replied: ""6000 today so that's why I put 100k in 3Y."". Roach responded: ""Did your boys buy as well? What is the risk of you lodging then we lodge the EGM notice and you get a please explain from ASX?"". Wu replied: ""I spoke to GR re this and he advised there's no perfect solution here and the best way is for me to lodge sooner rather than later unfortunately :(.""

342. Wu then clarified and said: ""I mean Guy Sanderson"", who was Healthzone’s corporate advisor on such matters.

2 to 9 June 2011

343. On 2 June 2011, Roach sent an email to Wu, stating: “Not sure if there is any position to do anything but easy jump to 37.5c. Could be relevant to getting EYS and balance of T1 funds quickly?” On 7 June 2011, at approximately 2.30 pm Healthzone announced its application for a NASDAQ Listing and a share issue with increased investment to 19.9% by Eu Yan Sang.

344. Roach sent an email to Wu:

""I am not sure how you are positioned with Wang and trading but if we could close today at 38c or higher it would be a big positive for completion of the balance of T1 and T2. It would cost $26k to close at 38c and $45k to close at the magic 40c. It would also be a big boost for us with CBA to see such a supportive market. HZL can pay Wang back or Wang can exit in coming weeks as we push the price. What do you think? Peter

0.36    30769       $11,076.84

0.37    15384       $ 5,692.08

0.375    23554       $ 8,832.75

0.38    25000       $ 9,500.00

0.39    20000       $ 7,800.00

0.4    112498    $ 200.00

$45,076.67""

345. At 14:53:55, a Bid for 71,000 Healthzone shares at 37.5c was entered on the Wang Intersuisse Account. The Bid traded immediately and in part through three price levels for 69,707 Healthzone shares, increasing the price of Healthzone shares from 35c to 37.5c. The trading left a residual Bid for 1,293 Healthzone shares at 37.5c which traded at 14:54:09 in full at 37.5c. The trading of the residual Bid did not move the price of Healthzone shares.

346. Roach sent a text message to Wu: ""Is Wang buying or someone else?"" and Wu replied: ""Wang"" and Roach responded: ""For a moment I thought we may have had some REAL support:(""

347. Wu replied: ""Agree and hopefully the support will come from US upon finish the nasdaq"" and Roach responded: ""Sure... Agree he has been very supportive:)"" and Wu replied: ""He’s happy to get into it now to close at 38c. we do need to compensate him""

348. At 20:00:12 on 8 June 2011 Roach received a text message from John O'Shea (US European American Equities): ""With the stock at .34. It make sense to see if maybank will buy in first round.""

349. Roach sent the text message to Wu and said: ""This from JO... With the stock at .34. It make sense to see if Maybank will buy in first round. JO""

350. Roach sent a further text message to Wu: ""Can't believe JO wants us to do all the work and he gets the commission! He gets $140k on EYS and now he wants us to do the second $2mill of T1 on our own and he gets another $100k plus his $40k retainer and $40k advisory = $320k and he has done nothing! He seems to have given up before he starts! This share price is going to cause us issues...""

351. Wu replied: ""that's bad!...it's typical JO like last time (didn't really prepare and get fired up until last minute)...you may want to have a heart-to-heart talk with him?""

352. At 08:39:05 on 9 June 2011 Roach sent an email to Wu with the subject ""Early sceen? negative"" with a screenshot of the current market for Healthzone shares and said:

""This is a worry… seller at 33c x 100,000 so clearly a large holder dumping. Hopefully it gets taken out early and we can immediately work to pull back with smaller trades. We will need to manage this process very tightly during the next month. We also need to get our next announcement out this morning. We can legitimately pump price subject to sell profile. The EGM one may then be deemed negative and I think my own will need to go in short order thereafter. Thoughts?""

353. Wu sent an email to Roach which said:

""I think the timing gap of M&A announcement and EGM notice should not be too wide, maybe within a day with hope the positive/negative effects will cancel each other? Then follow by yours shares purchase announcement (3Y and maybe short announcement in words format) before the weekend? The bottom line is, regardless of which plan we play, I think we do need to prepare to jump on the market and buy some or large quantity on screen anyway. I think once it's settled down within a day or two, it'll be back to normal like previous as I think the sellers (due to EGM) might only be short-term pattern (ie.1 or 2 days).""

354. Roach replied with a screenshot of the current market for Healthzone shares:

""Agree…Looks like the old “drag the price low then build the chunky steps trick” is in play with someone seeking to exit some large chunks. I am just doing a final edit of today’s release now for your signoff and then we lodge.""

355. Roach sent an email to Wu with the subject ""Strategy... thoughts?"" and a screenshot of the current market for Healthzone shares: ""Easy back to 35c but we have two options when the announcement goes up. 1. Buy back too high as possible subject to screen profile a. 60,000 block at 35c is a PITA 2. Wait and see how market reacts and seller or buyer profile changes. a. This will be risky if low sellers deepen up""

356. Wu replied: ""I reckon at least we bring it back to 35c as step 1 (ie. With 5000 shares) then wait and see the reaction when announcement is released."" Roach responded: ""OK… but will need to watch close from lodgement""

357. On 9 June 2011 at 2 pm Healthzone announced that it had reached agreement in relation to the acquisition of a majority shareholding of Forte Brands, the development of new brand products and retail growth of company stores and Healthy Life China.

358. After the announcement Wu sent an email to Roach: ""Let's see what happens after lodgement."" Roach replied: ""60,000 seller moved up to 36c from 35c but now a 10,000 lobster at 33c Suggest we pull back to 36c asap""

359. About an hour and a half later Wu replied to Roach: ""Can't locate Wang today as he's on road to Melbourne...anyone from your end could action?"" and minutes later Wu said: ""Left msg for Wang to ring me back.""

360. Roach replied: ""I only have Trumpy and any buy that raises the price is rejected! We really need to get it up before close and the USA wakes up...""

361. At 15:40:03, a Bid for 14,000 Healthzone shares at 34c was entered on the Wang Intersuisse Account. The Bid traded immediately and in part through two price levels for 13,000 Healthzone shares, increasing the price of Healthzone shares from 33c to 34c and leaving a residual Bid for 1,000 Healthzone shares at 34c on the Wang Intersuisse Account.

362. After the trade Wu replied: ""It's working now.""

363. At 15:46:48, the price of the residual Bid for 1,000 Healthzone shares at 34c on the Wang Intersuisse Account was amended up to 35.5c. The amended Bid traded immediately and increased the price of Healthzone shares by a further 1.5c to 35.5c from the last traded price of 34c set by the trading on the Wang Intersuisse Account at 15:40:03 that day. The trade set the closing price for Healthzone shares that day.

364. Following the trade Wu sent a text message to Roach: ""Done but I noticed a block of 55k shares at 35.5c n Wang only hit at 35.5c?"" and Roach replied to Wu: ""Any close that is up is good 35.5c good result.""

21 to 22 July 2011

365. An email dated Thursday 21 July 2011 with a time of 12:47 pm was sent from Todd Rowley (a US investor) to Roach with the subject ""Antoine"". The email said: ""Peter, I spoke to Antoine today, it seems he is hesitant at the moment. I will likely need to circle back when he returns Friday as tomorrow is a Belgian holiday.""

366. Roach replied by email and said: ""Todd Thank you for the follow-up. Was there any specific or obvious cause for his hesitation that may be addressed? I again appreciate your support and would value you follow-up again as you suggest.""

367. Todd responded ""The hurdle is the stock price isnt .38....if it were he would likely participate without hesitation.""

368. At 02:14:58 on 22 July 2011 Roach forwarded the email from Todd to Wu: ""This is immediate $500k with SP roadblock:( What can we do today? We really need to close at 38c everyday to close this offering. The deal is on the nose because we are selling above the current SP.""

369. Wu replied: ""Let's see today's profile but in last 2 days, there was a block of 130k shares at 37.5c and my boy could only hit 37.5c""

370. At 15:45:52, a Bid for 17,000 Healthzone shares at 37.5c was entered on the Wang Intersuisse Account. The Bid traded immediately and in full through two price levels increasing the price of Healthzone shares by 0.5c to 37.5c, from the previous trade at 37c which was executed on the Wang Intersuisse Account at 14:05:58 on 20 July 2011. The trading set the closing price for Healthzone shares at 37.5c that day.

371. After the trade Sekely sent an email to Wu and copied to Wei Wang: ""Gentlemen - This is to advise that after buying 17000 Healthzone shares today the outstanding balance of W Wang Account is $11753.Please settle within trade + 3 days""

9 to 10 August 2011

372. In July and August 2011, a private investment company in the United States, Renn Capital Group Inc (Renn Capital), conducted due diligence in relation to a possible investment in Healthzone. At 12:36:54 on 9 August 2011 Roach sent an email to Wu with the subject ""Important"" and a screenshot of the current market for Healthzone shares:

""Very dangerous position and need to be ready to respond… No buyer support and 4 low flyers. We will be in CBA meeting from 3pm to 4pm so must have a watch kept. Renn is going to Committee in 12 hours on the market close of today to decide progress and amount so there has not been a more critical day to close at 36.5c or higher Robert just text saying call went well and Eric just ticking boxes for tomorrow’s meeting and wanted to know more about EYS relationship and history with HZL. Robert said he gave us a good wrap.""

373. Approximately an hour and a half later Roach sent a further email to Wu with the subject ""Disaster recovery required..."" and a screenshot of the current market for Healthzone shares ""May need steps… let me know and I can place on sell some of Trumpy’s shares""

374. At 14:12:36 a Bid for 4,000 Healthzone shares at 31c was entered on the Wang Intersuisse Account. The Bid traded immediately and in full increasing the price of Healthzone shares from 28c to 31c.

376. At 15:37:35 a Bid for 29,000 Healthzone shares at 35c was entered on the Wang Intersuisse Account. The Bid traded in part at 15:37:35 and in full at 15:37:56 after the residual was amended to 35.5c. The trade at 15:37:35 decreased the price of Healthzone shares from 33.5c to 32.5c. The trade at 15:37:56 increased the price of Healthzone shares from 32.5c to 35.5c and set the closing price for Healthzone shares that day.

377. At 08:58:41 on 10 August 2011 Roach sent an email to Wu with the subject ""today"" and a screenshot of the current market for Healthzone shares: ""Also serious buy side volume is likely to be FIM. Anything that trades through Citicorp Nominees could be considered FIM. We need to pull to 38c asap if opportunity like exists now. RENN have asked me to call them Wed Dallas time (it is 4pm Tue Dallas at present) and they are just going into their committee meeting now.""

378. Wu replied and said: ""Did FIM participate T1/T2? Why they would rather buy on market instead of capital raise?""

389. At 15:34:48, 34,450 Healthzone shares at 32c were bought over two trades on the MGR Hub 24 Account. These trades did not move the Healthzone shares price and were the last trades of the day. The second trade set the close.

390. Due to the trades on the Vringer E*Trade Account and the MGR Hub 24 Account the price for Healthzone shares moved from 29c to 32c.

17 November 2011

392. On 17 November 2011, Healthzone was placed in external administration.

THE ACTIONS OF RUSSELL GOODMAN


	
	Russell Goodman (“Goodman”) was an investor in Healthzone. His involvement in the trading of shares in Healthzone, and the conduct he exhibited towards each of the present offenders, were matters upon which senior counsel for each offender applied considerable focus in the course of their respective submissions. In short, it was submitted that Goodman’s activities constituted an important part of the context in which the offending occurred, and served to significantly mitigate its seriousness. It is therefore necessary for me to summarise some of the evidence as to Goodman’s involvement. In doing so, I have incorporated references to a 70 page document tendered in the proceedings and referred to as “Annexure A”, the entirety of which I have read, and to which I was taken at length, particularly in the course of submissions made on behalf of Dulhunty.
	
	
	Goodman first approached Wu in early October 2007 offering to market Healthzone shares to investors. Following discussions between Goodman and Dulhunty, it was resolved that 10 million shares would be issued to Goodman, at 60c per share. This occurred in December 2007. From time to time Goodman thereafter encouraged both offenders to buy shares in order to demonstrate their confidence in Healthzone (Facts at [75]; Annexure A at [25]).
	
	
	On 30 December 2007 Goodman sent an email to Dulhunty (Annexure A at [84]) stating:
	


“Try 75c. Would love to see some Directors buying … I will look after the share price if you look after the profits”.


	
	On 18 January 2008 Goodman sent a further email to Dulhunty (Annexure A at [87]) stating:
	


“If you guys really believe in the company today is the day to step in or for friends to step in before my placement people lose faith. I’m back on Tuesday needs to close at 70 or better”.


	
	By March 2008, Goodman was expressing his concern about Healthzone’s operations and was seeking a greater involvement in formulating the company’s general direction (Facts at [87]). On 5 March 2008 Dulhunty reported that Goodman had said that he would “need to smack down the HZL share price to 40c” (that price being 35% below the opening price of 62c). Dulhunty also reported that Goodman wanted a seat on the Board (Annexure A at [104]).
	
	
	On 7 March 2008 Goodman wrote to Roach and Dulhunty (Annexure A at [107]) stating:
	


“The key, as I see it, is to keep me, plus my investors, happy, to get the share price as high as possible by 8 October 2008 when the cash or stock is to be issued to the Health Minders vendor”.


	
	In July 2008 Goodman continued to express his dissatisfaction at what he perceived to be a lack of consultation in relation to the operations of Healthzone. He warned of possible sell orders at a low price. In this context he made arrangements for a meeting to take place to discuss a possible merger between Healthzone and a business known as Athlete’s Foot (Facts at [113]). That merger did not proceed.
	
	
	By September 2008 the relationship between Healthzone and Goodman had deteriorated further. The price of shares in Healthzone had dropped to 36c (Annexure A at [145]). Dulhunty was expressing concern that Goodman was intending to place sell orders at a low price (Facts at [114]).
	
	
	On 2 September 2008 Goodman sent an email to the present offenders, again expressing his concerns and asking for a seat on the Board of Healthzone. He also suggested that the merger with Athletes Foot should be considered. He again encouraged the directors of Healthzone to purchase shares. He predicted a further drop in the share price (Facts at [115]; Annexure A at [148]).
	
	
	On 10 September 2008 an associate of Goodman sold 18,971 shares in Healthzone at 36c. Goodman urged Dulhunty to purchase a small parcel of shares (Annexure A at [152]).
	
	
	On 1 October 2008 Goodman again expressed his dissatisfaction with Healthzone’s operations, and repeated his request for a seat on the Board. He advised that he would otherwise divest himself of the company’s stock (Facts at [119]; Annexure A at [163]). On 3 October 2008, in circumstances where the previous closing price of Healthzone shares was 55c, Goodman placed 1 million shares for sale at a price of 42c (Facts at [119]).
	
	
	On 13 October 2008 Goodman confirmed his intention to exit Healthzone and advised that he would offer around 9 million shares to the market. Between 15 October and 23 October he placed 8.4 million shares for sale at 49c. The share price dropped from 55c to 35c. On 27 October Goodman amended the ask to 184,000 shares and dropped the ask price from 49c to 29c, which was 6c below other asks. On the following day he sent an email to Wu and Dulhunty, the general tenor of which was to suggest that Healthzone shares were worth little (Facts at [119]-[123]; Annexure A [176]-177]).
	
	
	In November 2008 Goodman expressed further concerns about Healthzone’s operations. The offenders discussed their own concerns about Healthzone’s falling share price in light of Goodman’s decision to sell (Facts at [134]).
	
	
	On 5 November 2008 Goodman wrote to Wu (Annexure A at [193]) stating that the price of Healthzone shares had gone only “one way” and that Healthzone had some “major credibility issues”. He went on to state:
	


“As much as you hope that one day it will be a great company, I really suggest you speak to me about how to speed up that process and derive the wealth it could create for you and your family in the future”.


	
	In early December 2008 Goodman corresponded with Dulhunty and expressed interest in acquiring a larger stake in Healthzone. At the same time he indicated that he wished to sell his shares, and was suspicious that the market for Healthzone shares was being manipulated (Facts at [157]-[161]).
	


THE OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENDING


	
	Section 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth.) (“the Act”) sets out a series of matters to which the Court must have regard when passing sentence. In terms of assessing the objective seriousness of an offence, these matters include:
	



	
	the nature and circumstances of the offence (s.16A(2)(a));
	
	
	if the offence forms part of a course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts of the same or similar character – that course of conduct (s.16A(2)(c));
	
	
	the personal circumstances of any victim of the offence (s.16A(2)(d)); and
	
	
	any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence (s.16A(2)(e)).
	


Submissions on behalf of Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that the principal factors relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending in the present case included:
	



	
	the nature and scope of the conspiracy;
	
	
	the overt acts of the offenders, to the extent that those overt acts were indicative of the content and duration of the conspiracy;
	
	
	the extent to which the conspiracy was an ongoing enterprise that encompassed multiple or continuing criminal objectives;
	
	
	the extent to which the objects of the conspiracy were achieved;
	
	
	the role, and involvement within the conspiratorial organisation, of each offender;
	
	
	the period of the conspiracy; and
	
	
	the period of the involvement of each offender as a participant.
	



	
	With these matters in mind, the Crown pointed to the fact that the conspiracy in the present case extended over a period of several years and involved:
	



	
	multiple trades;
	
	
	the utilisation, by each offender, of a number of separate trading accounts;
	
	
	the involvement of third parties;
	
	
	the purchase of a large amount of shares; and
	
	
	a significant overall monetary investment.
	



	
	It was submitted that the conspiracy was one that had, as its principal objective, the manipulation of the Healthzone share price. The Crown pointed to the overt acts in which the offenders engaged and submitted that such acts were planned, calculated, sophisticated, designed to avoid detection and carried out in circumstances where each offender knew that what he was doing was against the law. It was submitted that even if it were accepted that neither offender was motivated by a desire to derive an immediate profit (a matter which the Crown did not concede) it remained the case that each of them had a significant financial and personal interest in Healthzone which they each sought to support through their criminal activity.
	
	
	In terms of the involvement of each individual offender, the Crown pointed to the fact that Dulhunty was part of the conspiracy for a period of three years and one month during which there were 377 trades involving the purchase of 1,797,424 shares at an investment of $679,475.00. It was pointed out that Dulhunty personally executed at least 157 of these trades, involving the purchase of 675,500 shares at an investment of $263,359.00. It was also pointed out that Dulhunty had the log-in details of a number of third party trading accounts through which 83 trades, involving the purchase of 397,830 shares at an investment of $128,938.00, were conducted.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that Dulhunty’s activities included monitoring the Australian Stock Exchange on a daily basis, calculating the time at which action should be taken, assessing the volume of trades and the price at which those trades needed to be carried out, and arranging for their execution. It was submitted that Dulhunty was also the principal advocate for opening new trading accounts in the names of third parties to allow the manipulation of the share price of Healthzone to continue without detection.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that Roach was part of the conspiracy for a period of approximately three years, during which there were 495 trades, involving the purchase of 3,442,577 shares at an overall investment of $1,153,968.00. It was pointed out that Roach personally executed, or alternatively arranged for third parties to execute, at least 63 trades, involving the purchase of 385,837 shares at an investment of $137,915.00. It was pointed out that Roach had log-in details for, and used, third party trading accounts which were responsible for 137 trades involving the purchase of 531,550 shares at an investment of $177,281.00.
	
	
	It was submitted that once he had joined the conspiracy, Roach worked closely with Dulhunty. It was submitted that Roach largely assumed Dulhunty’s role when the latter left the conspiracy, and that Roach was instrumental in setting up new trading accounts and contacting third party associates for the purposes of conducting trades.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the principal point of distinction between the offenders, in terms of their roles and level of involvement, was that Roach joined an existing conspiracy which had been devised and implemented by Dulhunty and Wu. The Crown submitted that there was otherwise no material difference between the two offenders, be it in terms of the extent of the positions of seniority that each of them held, or the control that each of them exerted in carrying out the conspiracy.
	
	
	The Crown described as “unprecedented” the duration and extent of the collusion and co-ordination which existed between the offenders, and the level of corporate control and seniority at which each of them operated. The Crown went so far as to submit that even if it were found that the offenders were not motivated by the desire to derive immediate personal reward or profit, this was not a factor which mitigated the offending.
	
	
	For all of these reasons the Crown initially submitted that I should conclude that the objective seriousness of the offending was in the worst category. Ultimately however the Crown’s position shifted slightly, to the point where it was submitted that the offending approached, rather than fell into, such category.
	


Submissions on behalf of Dulhunty


	
	Senior counsel for Dulhunty accepted that the offending was objectively serious but submitted that in view of a number of factors it did not even approach, much less reach, the worst category.
	
	
	Senior counsel submitted that in acting as he did, Dulhunty was not motivated by a desire for immediate profit and was in fact motivated by the desire to act in what he thought were Healthzone’s best interests. In this context, senior counsel pointed to the fact that Dulhunty had worked extremely hard to build and develop Healthzone. It was further submitted that Dulhunty’s offending stemmed from a genuine belief that the company was undervalued and that these factors differentiated the present circumstances from a “typical” case of market manipulation. It was submitted that these factors, without more, removed the present case from the worst possible category of offending.
	
	
	It was submitted that the objective seriousness of the offending was further lessened by the fact that:
	



	
	Healthzone was (in relative terms) a small company, such that the potential damage to the market as a whole, or to investors in the company, was negligible;
	
	
	the offending did not include the purchase of shares at a price which exceeded their intrinsic value;
	
	
	this was not a case where shareholders had been misled by buying or selling without proper information being provided to them; and
	
	
	no false names or other methods of obfuscation were used.
	



	
	Senior counsel for Dulhunty placed considerable emphasis upon the role played by Goodman. He variously described Goodman’s behaviour as “predatory”, “bullying”, “threatening”, “aggressive”, “highly coercive” and carried out in “bad faith”. Senior counsel described as “surprising” the fact that Goodman had not been charged with any offence, although I should say that surprising or not, the fact that Goodman was not charged does not bear upon my assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending, nor upon the sentencing exercise generally. Senior counsel submitted that the evidence established that Goodman had repeatedly put pressure upon the Directors of Healthzone to purchase shares, and that the entirety of his conduct was directed towards positioning himself to be able to take over Healthzone at minimal cost.
	
	
	Senior counsel submitted that Goodman’s behaviour provided a substantial part of the context in which the offending took place, and that such context was a matter of significant mitigation. In essence, it was submitted that the pressure under which the Directors of Healthzone were placed by Goodman played a considerable part in the offending. Whilst senior counsel accepted that it was not justifiable for Dulhunty to succumb to pressure by engaging in serious criminal offending, he submitted that in all of the circumstances Dulhunty effectively had no alternative other than to do what he did. All of these matters, it was submitted, rendered the offending far less serious than had been suggested by the Crown.
	


Submissions on behalf of Roach


	
	Senior counsel for Roach also submitted that the role played by Goodman constituted an important factor which served to distinguish the present case from other cases of market manipulation. He too submitted that this factor, as well as a number of others, removed the case from one which approached the worst category. In these respects senior counsel for Roach effectively adopted the submissions made on behalf of Dulhunty.
	
	
	Senior counsel submitted that properly understood, the scope of Roach’s offending was not nearly as extensive as had been submitted by the Crown. It was pointed out, in particular, that Roach had joined an existing and operative conspiracy, as opposed to being responsible for its foundation and initial implementation.
	
	
	Senior counsel submitted that Roach had no previous experience in managing, or being on the Board of, a publicly listed company. He pointed out that Roach had no tertiary education qualifications or formal business education, had only previously been involved in small family companies, and had not, prior to this offending, traded in shares in a public company. Whilst acknowledging the caution to be exercised when evaluating an offender’s criminality in a conspiracy by examining the individual physical acts of each conspirator, senior counsel for Roach submitted that it was nevertheless relevant that Roach was involved in what was a relatively small investment when compared to the total sum expended during the entire conspiracy.
	
	
	Senior counsel also submitted that the damage to the share market brought about by the offending was negligible for a number of reasons. Firstly, he submitted that Healthzone was a small company. Secondly, he submitted that the majority of the share trades conducted during the period of Roach’s involvement in the conspiracy resulted in a minimal change to Healthzone’s share price. Thirdly, it was submitted that where trades were made to counter trades deliberately designed to damage the share price, there was no damage to the market.
	
	
	Senior counsel submitted that ultimately s. 1041A was directed towards the promotion of public confidence in the fairness and honesty of markets for financial products. It was submitted that Roach’s offending had a negligible effect upon undermining public confidence in the share market, and a similarly negligible effect upon the market’s integrity. Whilst it was acknowledged that it was possible for investors or potential investors to have made decisions about purchasing or retaining Healthzone shares based on the market price of the shares which had been manipulated, it was submitted that the risk of potential loss to investors or potential investors was in fact quite limited in light of the fact that Healthzone shares were not heavily traded.
	
	
	Whilst generally accepting that as a consequence of his offending Roach may have stood to benefit financially in an indirect way, senior counsel emphasised that the offending was not motivated by immediate financial profit or gain. It was submitted that this was a matter which significantly reduced Roach’s moral culpability, and that it operated to further remove this case from the worst category of offending.
	
	
	Senior counsel for Roach further submitted that the conspiracy was not a particularly complex one, and was sophisticated only to the extent that it involved the use of multiple trading accounts, some of which were operated by others. It was pointed out that all of these accounts were operated by real persons or entities. It was also pointed out that Roach had not attempt to hide his offending by, for example, destroying correspondence or hiding evidence of trades which had been made.
	


Crown submissions in reply


	
	In submissions in reply, the Crown took issue with the proposition that either offender was motivated by a desire to act in what were thought to be the best interests of the company. It was submitted that there was simply no evidence of what it was that motivated either offender. It was further submitted that on any rational view, manipulating the share price of a publicly listed company was not something that could possibly be regarded as being in that company’s best interests.
	
	
	The Crown also took issue with the significance which was sought to be attached by each offender to the conduct of Goodman. It was submitted that although Goodman was, at times, aggressive towards one or other of the offenders, his conduct was simply consistent with that of a person who was becoming increasingly frustrated at the operation and direction of a company in which he had significant financial interest. It was submitted that in the absence of sworn evidence from either offender, the documentary evidence, including Annexure A, exhibited little more than extreme annoyance, and periodic anger, on the part of each of the offenders towards Goodman. It was also pointed out that in the case of Dulhunty, his participation in the conspiracy commenced before Goodman’s involvement and that in these circumstances, Goodman’s actions could not provide an excuse for, or an explanation of, Dulhunty’s offending. Ultimately, the Crown submitted that Goodman’s conduct was of little significance and that irrespective of how Goodman had acted at any time, each offender obviously had available alternatives which did not involve criminal offending.
	


Consideration


	
	Where a sentencing judge is asked to take into account matters in favour of the Crown on sentence, such matters must be established beyond reasonable doubt. Matters sought to be taken into account in favour of an offender must be established on the balance of probabilities: R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [27] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ, citing R v Storey [1998] 1 VR 359 at 369. In the present case, neither offender gave sworn evidence. That was their right, and it is something from which I draw no adverse inference whatsoever. However the practical consequence is that I am left to determine the various issues which have been raised on the basis of the documentary evidence which has been tendered.
	
	
	Foremost amongst the issues raised is the conduct of Goodman, and its effect upon the offenders. It is evident from the correspondence that Goodman was someone who, to say the least, took his investment in Healthzone seriously. He had an obvious interest in the proper conduct of the company’s operations. He developed an unfavourable view of those operations. He developed a similarly unfavourable view of Healthzone’s direction generally, and the abilities of those who were guiding it. Clearly, he thought that he was far better placed to guide the company’s operations. He repeatedly sought a seat on the Board. His correspondence reflects all of these matters. Such correspondence also reflects Goodman’s general contempt for, and anger and aggression towards, the offenders.
	
	
	I am satisfied that each of the offenders was concerned about Goodman’s behaviour, about his underlying motivation, and about the overall effect that those matters might have on Healthzone. I am also satisfied that each offender is likely to have felt threatened by the tone of Goodman’s correspondence on occasions. To this extent, Goodman’s conduct provides part of the context in which the offending occurred.
	
	
	However I am not satisfied, in the absence of sworn evidence from either offender, that the effect, upon either of them, of Goodman’s conduct extended beyond that which I have described. I am therefore not satisfied that Goodman’s conduct has the significance for which senior counsel for each offender contended. Even if one accepts, in a general sense, the nomenclature adopted by senior counsel for Dulhunty to describe aspects of Goodman’s behaviour, it was no answer for either offender to respond to that behaviour by engaging in serious criminal offending. It goes without saying that there were alternatives available.
	
	
	Moreover, in the case of Dulhunty, his participation in the conspiracy commenced before Goodman became involved. Goodman’s first approach to Healthzone came on 9 October 2007 (Facts at [75]). As early as 5 May 2007, some 5 months before, Dulhunty had written to Wu setting out reasons for taking steps to increase the price of Healthzone shares (Facts at [63]). Further, in a statement tendered to the Court, Dulhunty expressly conceded that “there were times that (he) engaged in improper trading for other than defensive strategies”. In these circumstances, the significance of Goodman’s conduct is even less in Dulhunty’s case.
	
	
	As previously outlined, it was submitted that neither offender was motivated by the desire for immediate personal profit, and that each of them was motivated by what each regarded as the best interests of Healthzone. The circumstances of the offending were such that it was not likely to produce any immediate profit to either offender. It was not offending which was committed, for example, in response to a margin call. In these circumstances I am prepared to accept that immediate monetary gain or immediate personal profit did not form part of the motivation of either offender. That said, the maintenance of a high share price would obviously have been likely to produce some benefit to each offender over time and I am satisfied that this formed part of the motivation of each offender.
	
	
	Each offender is an educated and obviously intelligent person. I do not accept the proposition that either of them could possibly have thought that deliberate and sustained criminal conduct which saw Healthzone’s share price being artificially manipulated was in the best interests of the company. Moreover, even if either or both of the offenders held a view that Healthzone’s share price should have been greater than what it was, that is largely irrelevant. The fact is that each was a party to an agreement to manipulate that price.
	
	
	The offending was sustained over a considerable period. It involved multiple trades worth substantial sums of money. The conduct of each offender was calculated and planned. However I do not consider that the conspiracy was particularly sophisticated. Trading accounts which were used were held by real people or entities and to this extent, there was no deliberate obfuscation by, for example, setting up accounts in false names. That said, and as set out in the facts, some of those trading accounts were closed down. The response of the offenders to that circumstance was to move swiftly to ensure that new accounts could be set up, so as to allow the offending to continue without detection (see Facts at [279]).
	
	
	Although each offender was involved in the conspiracy at a different time, the overall period of the involvement of each of them was broadly the same, as was the role that each of them played. The Crown highlighted the fact that some difference arose from the fact that Roach joined an existing conspiracy, whereas Dulhunty was involved (with Wu) at its inception. Whilst that is strictly correct, I am not satisfied that Dulhunty in fact devised the conspiracy in the first place. In all of the circumstances, there is nothing to differentiate between the level of participation of each offender in the conspiracy, or the period over which that participation took place.
	
	
	I accept that there is no evidence which establishes the effect, if any, of the offending conduct on the stock market overall. Whilst that is a relevant consideration, s. 1041A of the Corporations Act 2001 is, by its terms, directed towards the prohibition of transactions which have, or are likely to have, the effect of creating an artificial share price, or the effect of maintaining that price at an artificial level. That is precisely the conduct to which the present conspiracy was directed. Moreover, even in the absence of evidence that the present offending had any direct adverse effect upon the market, it remains relevant to observe that members of the public who trade in shares are obviously entitled to do so in circumstances which are fair and transparent. The stock market is an indispensable component of the economy of this country. Amongst other things, it serves as a barometer of consumer confidence, and of the country’s financial state. It is essential that the market be allowed to operate, at all times, openly, and in a way which engenders confidence, not only in the minds of those who trade in it, but in the minds of the members of the wider community. Manipulative behaviour which distorts, or which threatens to distort, market integrity necessarily strikes at the heart of all of those considerations.
	
	
	In R v Jacobson [2014] VSC 592 Kaye J put the matter in this way (at [41]):
	


“The express objective of s 1041A of the Corporations Act is to promote a fair, orderly and transparent market for registered securities. As part of that objective, s 1041A is directed to ensuring that the market price for registered securities truly reflects the genuine interaction of the forces of supply and demand for those securities on a free market”.


	
	In the present case, the share price of Healthzone did not, as a consequence of the offending, reflect the genuine interaction to which his Honour referred.
	
	
	Like that of the offender in Jacobson, the conduct of the present offenders was calculated to undermine the objectives of which Kaye J spoke. It was sustained offending and occurred over a significant period of time. It had the capacity to threaten the integrity of, and public confidence in, the stock market, and to cause damage to members of the community who had invested their savings into that market. For his part, Dulhunty expressly acknowledged this in his statement to the Court, in which he accepted that his offending had “jeopardised the integrity of our financial market”.
	
	
	As a result of the offending in each case, dealings in Healthzone shares were other than open and transparent. The price of the shares was manipulated and distorted.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, and although I am unable to accept the Crown’s submission that the offending in either case falls into, or approaches, the worst possible category, it was nevertheless of considerable seriousness.
	


THE SUBJECTIVE CASES OF EACH OFFENDER

The relevant statutory provisions


	
	I have already noted that s. 16A of the Act sets out a number of factors which the Court is required to take into account when sentencing a Federal offender. From the point of view of an offender’s subjective case, those factors include:
	



	
	the degree to which the offender has shown contrition for the offence, either by taking action to make reparation for any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence, or in any other manner – s. 16A(2)(f);
	
	
	the plea of guilty – s. 16A(2)(g);
	
	
	the degree to which the offender has co-operated with law enforcement agencies in the investigation of the offending, or of other offences – s. 16A(2)(h);
	
	
	the character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition of the offender – 16A(2)(m);
	
	
	the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation – s. 16A(2)(n); and
	
	
	the probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the offender’s family or dependants – s. 16A(2)(p).
	



	
	It should be noted that the matters in s. 16A do not constitute an exhaustive list of relevant factors. As outlined below there are factors falling outside the provisions of s. 16A which are relevant in this case.
	


Evidence tendered on behalf of the offender Dulhunty


	
	Senior counsel for the offender Dulhunty tendered a large volume of subjective material. That material included a statement of 19 October 2015 of the offender, addressed to the Court, which canvassed (in part) aspects of the offending to which I have previously referred. In that statement, Dulhunty expressed his deep contrition for his offending and described his life as having been destroyed by it. He pointed to the loss of his business, life savings, career, marriage and reputation, and expressed a firm resolve not to re-offend in the future.
	
	
	Also tendered was a report of Dr Olav Nielssen, Psychiatrist which sets out, amongst other things, Dulhunty’s background. He attended Sydney Grammar Preparatory and High Schools. Following completion of the Higher School Certificate, he studied accounting and became a Chartered Accountant. He subsequently completed a Masters of Business Administration and a Law Degree. He married in 2001. He reported to Dr Nielssen that his marriage had since failed. He has two children, aged 7 and 9.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen diagnosed Dulhunty as suffering from a major depressive illness and assessed him as requiring intensive treatment by way of anti-depressant medication and cognitive behaviour therapy. Dr Nielssen concluded that Dulhunty would be a vulnerable prisoner because of his background, and that his depressive illness would render any period in custody more onerous. However, Dr Nielssen acknowledged that he would be able to seek treatment with anti-depressant medication in custody.
	
	
	A report of Dulhunty’s General Practitioner, Dr Arthur Huang, was also tendered. Dr Huang confirmed that in 2011 Dulhunty was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and had been prescribed medication to control his heart rate and rhythm. Dr Huang also reported that Dulhunty was diagnosed with thyroiditis in December 2011, although his last blood test in 2014 demonstrated satisfactory blood levels. Dr Huang further confirmed that Dulhunty had been referred for a psychiatric assessment in June 2012 and that his depression recently worsened. He is presently taking Zoloft prescribed by his treating psychiatrist, Dr Jacobson, and has suffered from insomnia since 2011. A report of Dr Jacobson which was tendered confirmed that Dulhunty remains mentally unwell and in need of ongoing medication.
	
	
	A report was also tendered from Ingrid Stengelis, Psychologist. Ms Stengelis reported that in November 2008 Dulhunty had attended for treatment to manage anxiety, and had returned for treatment in November 2011 for the same reason. She reported that in May 2014 he returned for further treatment to manage the stress caused by the current proceedings. Although Ms Stengelis has treated Dulhunty in a professional capacity, much of her report had, as its focus, matters personal to him. She described Dulhunty as having displayed genuine remorse for his actions, and reported that his focus in life had altered due to the stress arising from his offending and the associated proceedings.
	
	
	A large body of testimonial material was also tendered from persons who have become acquainted with Dulhunty in both a professional and a personal capacity. He is variously described in that material as highly motivated, principled, a man of unblemished character and a person of considerable generosity. Many of the testimonials spoke of his love for, and dedication towards, his family, and of the potential impact, upon that family, of a custodial sentence. In this regard, considerable emphasis was placed on the fact that he is the father of two young children. Reference was also made to his expressions of remorse.
	
	
	One of the testimonials tendered was from the offender’s former wife. She described the offending as being extremely out of character, and spoke specifically of Dulhunty’s generosity towards friends in need. She described the devastating consequences of the offending, both for Dulhunty personally and for their family as a whole. She spoke of his devotion to his children and his continued involvement in their lives. Consistent with the report of Dr Nielssen, she attested to Dulhunty’s depression and anxiety. Like a number of other persons who provided testimonials, she expressed the view that Dulhunty would not re-offend, and described the fact that he would not be able to resume his career as amounting to “the equivalent of a life sentence”.
	
	
	There is also evidence that Dulhunty corresponded with officers of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and, in a general sense, co-operated with the Commission’s investigation.
	


Evidence in the case of Roach


	
	A pre-sentence report of 15 October 2015 set out Roach’s background. He is one of four children and has been married for 32 years. He divides his time between assisting his elderly mother, who is in poor health, and residing with his wife. He has been unemployed, and reliant upon his wife financially, since his offending.
	
	
	Roach completed his formal education in Year 11, at which time he left to commence an apprenticeship as an aircraft engineer which he successfully completed. The author of the pre-sentence report stated that Roach acknowledged the seriousness of his behaviour, took responsibility for his actions, and expressed remorse.
	
	
	An affidavit of Roach’s wife was tendered. She and Roach have three children, aged 26, 22 and 18. Both Roach and his wife have been involved in community work with their local church for a number of years, during which Roach has been instrumental in establishing and conducting programmes to assist those who were unemployed or otherwise disadvantaged.
	
	
	Roach’s wife described the pressure, upon Roach personally and upon their family as a whole, which had resulted from the offending and the associated proceedings. She made specific reference to the impact upon members of her family as a consequence of the attendance, at her home, of police when conducting their investigation. Roach became bankrupt in 2012. As a consequence, his wife has assumed a greater level of responsibility within the family. She described the effect of all of these matters upon her children. Those effects have included their second son discontinuing his tertiary studies.
	
	
	Roach’s wife also made reference to the loss of what she described as the offender’s “impeccable business reputation and community service record”. She described him as a person of integrity who had been shamed and humiliated by his offending.
	
	
	Testimonials provided by persons who have known Roach in both a personal and professional capacity were tendered. The authors of those testimonials variously described Roach as a person of character, integrity and honesty. They expressed having been shocked upon becoming aware of the offending, and spoke of Roach’s expressions of remorse.
	


SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES

Submissions on behalf of the Crown


	
	In written submissions, the Crown argued that apart from the pleas of guilty entered by each offender, neither had otherwise expressed any contrition or remorse for the offending. These submissions were seemingly prepared without the Crown having the benefit of reading the testimonial material to which I have referred. The Crown submitted that in any event, the fact that each offender had sought to diminish his respective criminality by relying on the conduct of Goodman demonstrated that neither of them had fully accepted responsibility for the offending. It was submitted that in these circumstances, any expressions of contrition should be viewed as qualified.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that each offender had entered a plea of guilty before the Local Court. However, it was submitted that it was relevant to consider whether the plea in each case had been motivated by a willingness to facilitate the course of justice, or whether it was little more than a recognition of the inevitable, in the face of a strong Crown case. In terms of the timing of the pleas, the Crown traced the chronology of the proceedings against each offender. The Crown pointed to the fact that the charges were laid on 6 August 2014, that the pleas of guilty were not entered until 19 May 2015, and that in the intervening period a Brief of Evidence was served. Between about 10 September 2014 and 19 May 2015 there were discussions between the legal representatives of each offender and the representatives of the Crown regarding the possibility of a plea of guilty being entered, and the possibility of reaching an agreement as to the facts.
	
	
	Ultimately, the Crown’s position was that the plea in each case was “some evidence” on the part of each offender of remorse, acceptance of responsibility and a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. However, the Crown argued that the significance of each of these factors was limited by the strength of the Crown case which, it was submitted, had rendered a conviction inevitable. It was submitted that any allowance for the plea of guilty in each case should be assessed with these matters in mind.
	
	
	The Crown further submitted that general deterrence was a particularly important consideration in determining sentence in a matter of this nature, and that specific deterrence was also important.
	
	
	The Crown acknowledged that neither offender had any relevant prior convictions. However it was submitted that in the context of offending of this nature, good character and the absence of prior convictions were of less significance.
	
	
	Finally, the Crown submitted that because of the ongoing nature of the conspiracy, its sophistication and the awareness of wrong doing by the offenders, I should be cautious in concluding that either offender had positive prospects of rehabilitation. It was submitted that apart from the nature and extent of the offending conduct, other factors which bore on that consideration included, in the case of each offender, his age and the degree of available family support.
	


Submissions on behalf of Dulhunty


	
	Senior counsel for Dulhunty acknowledged the relevance of general deterrence on sentence although he did not accept that it had the significance suggested by the Crown. It was submitted that Dulhunty’s actions did not constitute undermining the integrity and efficacy of markets to any significant extent and that in these circumstances general deterrence had a lesser role to play than might otherwise be the case. It was further submitted that there was no evidence of any personal profit being derived by Dulhunty from his offending, such that this court would otherwise have an interest in imposing a sentence which would deter those from abusing markets for personal gain. In terms of personal deterrence, it was submitted that Dulhunty’s subjective intention was to protect the company from damage during the duration of the conspiracy. It was submitted that in these circumstances, personal deterrence was of little significance.
	
	
	It was submitted that Dulhunty had been co-operative throughout the investigation and that his plea of guilty was, in effect, a continuation of that co-operation. It was submitted that in these circumstances, he should receive the full benefit of that plea.
	
	
	Senior counsel made reference to the evidence of Dulhunty’s relationship with his children, and the harmful impact that a custodial sentence would have upon them. It was pointed out that within the testimonial material there was evidence that Dulhunty had structured his career so that he could spend more time with his children and that, as a consequence, he played an invaluable role in their lives. Senior counsel also relied upon Dulhunty’s prior good character and the significant contribution he has made to the community over a long period. It was submitted that in all of the circumstances, I should find that Dulhunty had shown genuine remorse, that he had good prospects of rehabilitation, and that he was unlikely to reoffend.
	
	
	Senior counsel also relied upon the fact that Dulhunty had, in effect, lost the career to which he had been dedicated and that he had little or no prospect of obtaining similar employment at any time in the future. This, it was submitted, constituted significant extra curial punishment.
	


Submissions on behalf of Roach


	
	Senior counsel for Roach submitted that Roach had shown contrition over and above that evidenced by his pleas of guilty. It was submitted that those pleas, which had been entered in the Local Court, were demonstrative of Roach’s remorse, and of his acceptance of responsibility. It was further submitted that the fact that Roach sought to reach agreement with the Crown as to the facts to be put before the Court underscored, rather than undermined, his willingness to facilitate to the course of justice. It was submitted that in all of these circumstances Roach should be given the full benefit of his pleas.
	
	
	Senior counsel for Roach also relied upon the delay which had been occasioned in bringing these proceedings. It was pointed out that an examination of Roach in relation to this matter took place in September 2012, but that it was not until 2014 that he was charged. It was submitted that the investigation was not one of great complexity but that the delay it had resulted in significant stress for the offender and had left him in a state of uncertain suspense.
	
	
	Senior counsel also cited Roach’s previous good character which, it was submitted, extended well beyond the mere absence of criminal convictions. In this regard, emphasis was placed on the content of the testimonial material to which I have referred.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, and whilst acknowledging that prior good character and a lack of criminal antecedents may be of less weight as separate mitigating features in offending of this type, senior counsel submitted that such matters remained of considerable significance, particularly when assessing the Roach’s prospects of rehabilitation. It was submitted that the evidence in the present case supported the conclusion that it was most unlikely that Roach would re-offend at any time.
	
	
	Whilst not advancing the proposition that it was exceptional, it was submitted that there was evidence that a custodial sentence would cause hardship to Roach’s family. This, it was submitted, arose from the evidence of Roach caring for his elderly mother, as well as the matters to which his wife referred in her affidavit and which I have previously summarised. It was submitted that these were necessarily matters to be taken into account as part of Roach’s general subjective case.
	


Consideration


	
	I am obviously mindful of the need to consider the case of each offender separately. However, their respective subjective circumstances are, generally speaking, common and in large measure can be dealt with together.
	
	
	I am satisfied that each offender is genuinely remorseful and contrite. That is the overwhelming effect of the testimonial material which has been tendered in each case, and to which the Crown did not object. I do not regard the position taken by the either offender in relation to Goodman as qualifying, to any significant degree, the remorse that each of them has expressed to others (and in the case of Dulhunty, to the Court).
	
	
	I am also satisfied that each offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. It is apparent that each has learned a salutary lesson. There is nothing to suggest any real prospect of re-offending in either case. In all of these circumstances I have concluded that specific deterrence has no role to play in determining sentence.
	
	
	Each offender is a person of prior good character. Apart from the absence of convictions, each has made a significant contribution to the wider community in differing ways. Each is entitled to draw upon his previous good character as a factor in mitigation of penalty. However, two observations must be made in that regard. Firstly, for the reasons I have developed further below, general deterrence remains an important factor in this case and because of that, less weight is to be given to evidence of good character: McMahon v R [2011] NSWCCA 147 at [76] per Hoeben J (as his Honour then was), Hodgson JA and Grove AJ agreeing. Secondly, and as previously outlined, the offending occurred over an extended period of time in each case. That also operates to lessen the weight to be given to the prior good character of each offender: R v Kennedy [2000] NSWCCA 527 at [22] per Howie J, Simpson J (as her Honour then was) agreeing.
	
	
	In the case of Dulhunty, there is evidence of current symptoms of a depressive illness. I have had regard to that circumstance.
	
	
	Each offender entered a plea of guilty before the Local Court. Although the pleas were entered some time after the charges were laid, it is apparent that in the intervening period discussions and negotiations took place regarding the possibility of a plea being entered, and the content of any factual material which would be put before the Court in that event.
	
	
	In Cameron v R [2002] HCA 6; (2002) 209 CLR 339 the plurality (Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ) observed at [14]:
	


“Reconciliation of the requirement that a person not be penalised for pleading not guilty with the rule that a plea of guilty may be taken into account in mitigation requires that the rationale for that rule, so far as it depends on factors other than remorse and acceptance of responsibility, be expressed in terms of willingness to facilitate the course of justice and not on the basis that the plea has saved the community the expense of a contested hearing”.


	
	Their Honours went on to say (at [22]):
	


“… leaving aside remorse and acceptance of responsibility, the operative consideration is willingness to facilitate the course of justice. And once that rationale is accepted, the respondent’s suggestion that the extent to which a plea of guilty may be taken into account in mitigation may vary according to whether it was or was not a ‘fast-track’ plea must be rejected. Rather, the issue is to what extent the plea is indicative of remorse, acceptance of responsibility and willingness to facilitate the course of justice. And a significant consideration on that issue is whether the plea was entered at the first reasonable opportunity.”


	
	In Cappis v R [2015] NSWCCA 138 Garling J (with whom Gleeson JA and Johnson J agreed) said (at [57]):
	


“The central matter which is required to be considered by the sentencing judge is the willingness of the offender to facilitate the course of justice by entering the plea. In assessing that willingness, when a sentencing court is dealing with a Commonwealth offence, a relevant consideration for the sentencing Court is the strength of the Crown case against the offender: see Tyler v R; R v Chalmers [2007] NSWCCA 247; (2007) 173 A Crim R 458 at [114] per Simpson J; Danial v R [2008] NSWCCA 15 at [28] per James J.”


	
	Recently, in DPP (Cth) v Gow [2015] NSWCCA 208 Basten JA concluded (at [28]) that the decision in Cameron had nothing to say about the operation of Commonwealth law with respect to sentencing. His Honour expressed some doubt as to whether the decision operated to limit the basis upon which a plea of guilty may be taken into account. Hamill J (at [72]) agreed that the decision in Cameron did not limit the impact of a Federal offender’s plea of guilty to an assessment of the extent to which it demonstrated a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. However, his Honour expressed a preference to leave the more general consideration of the interaction of Commonwealth sentencing provisions with the general sentencing law of New South Wales, along with the extent to which that consideration is informed by decisions such as that in Cameron, for a case when those matters were the subject of full argument.
	
	
	Based on the available documentation, the Crown case against each offender was strong. Further, the pleas were entered a considerable period of time after the charges were laid. However to use these factors as a basis for concluding that the pleas were not entered at the first reasonable opportunity, or that they were entered other than in a willingness to facilitate the course of justice, would in my view be wrong. Such an approach would ignore, in particular, the discussions which were apparently taking place over a protracted period which seemingly resulted in the pleas being entered. In my view, the fact that each offender was prepared to engage in those discussions is indicative of a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. The fact that an agreement could not be reached as to the entirety of the factual material (necessitating the tender of Annexure A) does not derogate from such willingness on the part of either offender. In all of the circumstances, I am satisfied that the plea in each case was entered at the first reasonable opportunity.
	
	
	Further, and although the documentary evidence established a strong case against each offender, and although this is a factor which has the capacity to cast some light upon the question of whether the plea of guilty was truly motivated by a willingness to facilitate the course of justice or by a recognition of the inevitable (Tyler v R; R v Chalmers [2007] NSWCCA 247 at [114] per Simpson J (as her Honour then was), Spigelman CJ and Harrison J agreeing), I am satisfied in all of the circumstances that each offender has demonstrated a willingness to facilitate the course of justice, not only by entering a plea of guilty but by endeavouring, as far as possible, to reach agreement as to the factual material to be placed before the court. Providing the guilty plea is taken into account in each case, it is not necessary for me to quantify the discount: Tyler at [112]. Each offender should have the benefit of a discount which falls at the uppermost level.
	
	
	Each offender has suffered significant extra curial punishment as a consequence of his offending. Each will be disqualified, upon conviction, from managing a corporation for a period of 5 years. The Crown conceded that this was an appropriate factor to take into account on sentence. The Crown also conceded that a person’s loss of career and reputation may amount to a form of extra-curial punishment. However, the Crown submitted that it remained open to each offender, at the expiration of the statutory disqualification period, to re-enter the corporate world in some capacity or other.
	
	
	In my view, the possibility that either offender might obtain similar employment in the future is, to say the least, remote. The nature of the offending, and the fact that it has been made public, make it difficult to envisage either offender being appointed to any position of corporate responsibility at any time in the future. Needless to say, each offender must have known of these likely consequences at the time of the offending and whilst that must be taken into account, it does not mean that extra curial punishment is of no relevance at all. I have taken it into account in determining sentence in each case.
	
	
	I accept the submissions made on behalf of each offender regarding the effect of any custodial penalty upon their respective families. I accept that such effect is likely to be significant in respect of each offender, albeit for different reasons. However, the effect is not exceptional: R v Zerafa [2013] NSWCCA 222; (2013) 235 A Crim R 265 at [93] per Hoeben CJ at CL, Latham J agreeing. It is no greater than what one might reasonably expect in a case such as this. I have taken it into account in assessing the general subjective circumstances of each offender.
	
	
	I have also had regard to the delay in the insti",2015-11-29 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2702382,Application by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police [2015] NSWSC 1817,"Judgment (EX TEMPORE – REVISED)

Introduction


	
	By summons filed on 2 October 2015, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (the Commissioner) seeks various orders under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) (the Act), including a restraining order pursuant to s 19; an order for custody and control pursuant to s 38; orders for examination under s 80; and an ancillary order pursuant to s 39(1) that sworn statements be provided.
	
	
	In support of the summons, the Commissioner, for whom Ms Millington appears, relies on the affidavit of Darren Burtenshaw sworn 1 October 2015. Federal Agent Burtenshaw deposes in paragraph one of his affidavit that he is a member of the Australian Federal Police (AFP).
	
	
	Two of the persons interested in these orders, Weili Cui and Shushan Li, appeared at today’s hearing by their solicitor, Ms Xu. They did not oppose the orders sought but foreshadowed an application for an exclusion order, which is addressed further below.
	


Background


	
	On 11 March 2015 Ms Cui was endeavouring to deposit an amount of $200,000 in cash at the World Square branch of the National Australia Bank in Sydney. She was questioned. AFP officers seized the cash as they suspected it to be proceeds of crime. The evidence reveals details of the bank accounts in the names of Ms Cui and other associates as well as declarations made when Ms Cui and others were entering Australia as to the amount of cash they were bringing into Australia. It is not necessary for present purposes to set out this evidence, which is contained in the unchallenged affidavit of Federal Agent Burtenshaw and the exhibit thereto.
	


Legislative requirements

Section 19 of the Act


	
	The legislative requirements for a restraining order are set out in s 19 of the Act, which provides that a court with proceeds jurisdiction, which includes this Court, must, if certain conditions are fulfilled, make an order that property not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person. The Court's obligation to make an order with respect to serious offences is subject to its satisfaction that an appropriate undertaking has been given: s 21 of the Act.
	
	
	I note that Ms Millington is instructed to provide the usual undertaking on behalf of the Commonwealth as to costs and damages arising from the restraining order. I regard this as an appropriate undertaking for the purposes of s 21 of the Act.
	
	
	Section 19 provides:
	


“Restraining orders—property suspected of being proceeds of indictable offences etc.

When a restraining order must be made

(1) A court with *proceeds jurisdiction must order that:

(a) property must not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person; or

(b) property must not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with by any person except in the manner and circumstances specified in the order;

if:

(c) a *proceeds of crime authority applies for the order; and

(d) there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is:

(i) the *proceeds of a *terrorism offence or any other *indictable offence, a *foreign indictable offence or an *indictable offence of Commonwealth concern (whether or not the identity of the person who committed the offence is known); or

(ii) an *instrument of a *serious offence; and

(e) the application for the order is supported by an affidavit of an *authorised officer stating that the authorised officer suspects that:

(i) in any case—the property is proceeds of the offence; or

(ii) if the offence to which the order relates is a serious offence—the property is an *instrument of the offence;

and including the grounds on which the authorised officer holds the suspicion; and

(f) the court is satisfied that the *authorised officer who made the affidavit holds the suspicion stated in the affidavit on reasonable grounds.

Property that a restraining order may cover

(2) The order must specify, as property that must not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with, the property specified in the application for the order, to the extent that the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that that property is:

(a) in any case—*proceeds of the offence; or

(b) if the offence to which the order relates is a *serious offence—an *instrument of the offence.

Refusal to make a restraining order

(3) Despite subsection (1), the court may refuse to make a *restraining order in relation to an *indictable offence that is not a *serious offence if the court is satisfied that it is not in the public interest to make the order.

Note: A court can also refuse to make a restraining order if the Commonwealth refuses to give an undertaking: see section 21.

Restraining order need not be based on commission of a particular offence

(4) The reasonable grounds referred to in paragraph (1)(d) need not be based on a finding as to the commission of a particular offence.

Risk of property being disposed of etc.

(5) The court must make a *restraining order even if there is no risk of the property being disposed of or otherwise dealt with.”


	
	The conditions the fulfilment of which entitles the Commissioner to an order under s 19(1)(a) or (b) are set out in 19(1)(c), (d), (e) and (f) of the Act. These will be considered in turn.
	


Section 19(1)(c): application made by a proceeds of crime authority


	
	The Commissioner is a proceeds of crime authority by reason of the definition in s 338 of the Act. Accordingly s 19(1)(c) is fulfilled.
	


Section 19(1)(d): reasonable grounds for suspicion


	
	Section 19(1)(d) requires that there be reasonable grounds to suspect that the property is relevantly the proceeds of an indictable offence of the Commonwealth or an instrument of a serious offence. The relevant offences are offences against s 53 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth), and offences contrary to 400.9 of the schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (the Criminal Code). Section 400.9 is contained in Part 10.2 of the Criminal Code.
	
	
	These are both serious offences within the meaning of s 338 of the Act, which relevantly includes:
	



	
	unlawful conduct constituted by or relating to a breach of Part 10.2 of the Criminal Code (money-laundering): paragraph (a)(ii) of the definition of “serious offence” in s 338; and
	
	
	an offence against s 53 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act (reports about movements of physical currency into or out of Australia): paragraph (ea)(i) of the definition of serious offence in s 338.
	



	
	Having read the affidavit of Federal Agent Burtenshaw, I am satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the property referred to in schedule 1 (to the summons and to the minute of order) is the proceeds of an indictable offence, or indictable offences, within the meaning of s 19(1)(d)(i) and (ii).
	


Section 19(1)(e): the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer


	
	Section 19(1)(e) of the Act provides that it is a condition of the making of an order that the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer, which states that the authorised officer suspects that the property is proceeds of the offence; or, if the offence to which the order relates is a serious offence, the property is an instrument of the offence; and which includes the grounds on which the authorised officer holds the suspicion.
	
	
	The definition of authorised officer in 338 of the Act includes an AFP member, if authorised by the Commissioner. The evidence establishes that Commissioner Negus, by authorisation dated 26 August 2013, authorised all AFP members to be authorised officers under the Act. Accordingly, Federal Agent Burtenshaw is an authorised officer.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the condition in s 19(1)(e) is fulfilled by the affidavit of Federal Agent Burtenshaw affirmed on 1 October 2015. He sets out the basis for his suspicion in paragraphs 11 to 87 of the affidavit, and summarises those grounds in paragraph 88 of the affidavit.
	


Section 19(1)(f): reasonable grounds


	
	I am also required, by reason of s 19(1)(f), to be satisfied that the authorised officer who made the affidavit holds the suspicion stated in the affidavit on reasonable grounds. I am satisfied that the matters set out in paragraphs 11 to 87 of Federal Agent Burtenshaw’s affidavit and summarised in paragraph 88 of that affidavit provide sufficient basis by way of reasonable grounds for the suspicion to which Federal Agent Burtenshaw deposes.
	


Conclusions

Conclusion regarding a restraining order


	
	For the reasons given above, I am persuaded that I am obliged to make an order under s 19(1)(b) of the Act with respect to the cash sum of $199,990 seized by the members of the Australian Federal Police on 11 March 2015 and banked in the AFP Reserve Bank trust account, together with any interest earned on that amount.
	


Other orders sought

Custody and control order: s 38 of the Act


	
	The Commissioner, as I have referred to above, also seeks a custody and control order of those funds. I am satisfied that it is appropriate to make an order under s 38 of the Act that the official trustee in bankruptcy is to take custody and control of the property specified in schedule one being that capital sum together with interest.
	


Examination order: s 180 of the Act


	
	Having regard to the matters in Federal Agent Burtenshaw’s affidavit, I am also satisfied that it is appropriate to make an examination order under s 180 of the Act which permits the following persons to be examined about the affairs of Weili Cui: Weili Cui; Shushan Li; Bei Jiang; and Junguo Wang. I am also satisfied that it is appropriate to make an order pursuant to s 180 of the Act that those four persons be examined about the affairs of Shushan Li.
	


Ancillary orders to provide sworn statements: s 39(1) of the Act


	
	The Commissioner also seeks an order pursuant to s 39(1) of the Act which empowers me to make orders ancillary to a restraining order. Ms Millington seeks orders under ss 39(1) (including (ca) and (da)) directing certain persons to give a sworn statement to a specified person within a specified period setting out particulars of or dealings with the property or interests in property and his or her liabilities.
	
	
	I am satisfied that it is appropriate, having regard to the apparently suspicious provenance of funds available to Ms Cui and Mr Li, that orders under s 39(1) of the Act be made in accordance with the prayers in the summons.
	
	
	Shushan Li is the sole director of Golden Forest International Pty Ltd and a director of Golden Forest Group Pty Ltd. In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that the dubious provenance of the substantial cash funds makes it desirable to make an order under s 39(1) that Mr Li, in his capacity as the sole director of Golden Forest International Pty Ltd and as a director of Golden Forest Group Pty Ltd, be directed to provide a sworn statement, the details of which are set out in the minute of order provided by Ms Millington on behalf of the Commissioner.
	
	
	Ms Cui is also a director of Golden Forest Group Pty Ltd. I am satisfied that, for the same reasons, she ought be required pursuant to s 39(1) of the Act to provide to the Commissioner a sworn statement setting out the matters which will be detailed in the orders which I shall shortly make.
	


Potential application for an exclusion order


	
	Ms Xu has foreshadowed that her clients (Ms Cui and Mr Li) wish to seek an exclusion order under ss 29 and 31 of the Act in respect of the property the subject of the restraining order.
	
	
	Ms Xu has recently served two affidavits on the Commissioner in support of the proposed application for an exclusion order. However, she acknowledged that her clients were not in a position to proceed with an application for an exclusion order. Further, because of the late notice, the Commissioner would not have been in a position to deal with them today.
	
	
	It is desirable that directions be made about any application for an exclusion order, having regard to the Commissioner's intention to apply in due course for a forfeiture order pursuant to s 49 of the Act. As there is some doubt as to when the proposed applicants, Ms Cui and Mr Li, will be ready to make such an exclusion order, I propose to allow them until 28 February 2016 to put on any such application, together with any evidence on which they wish to rely in support of that application.
	
	
	If such an application is filed, it will be given a return date by the Registry. If no such application is filed, this matter will come back before the Common Law Registrar for directions at 9am on 18 May 2016.
	


Orders


	
	For those reasons, and noting the undertaking given by Ms Millington on behalf of the plaintiff, I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 of the minute of order as follows:

		04 December 2015",2015-11-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2702392,State of New South Wales v Howard [2015] NSWSC 1811,"Judgment


	
	The plaintiff, the State of New South Wales, commenced proceedings by way of Summons filed on 31 July 2015 in which a number of orders were sought pursuant to the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (“the Act”). The Summons was subsequently amended and leave was granted to the plaintiff to proceed upon the Amended Summons dated 5 November 2015. The Amended Summons contained proposed conditions in respect of any order made pursuant to s 5C and s 9(1)(a) of the Act.
	
	
	On 24 August 2015 this Court (Button J) made a number of orders including an Interim Supervision Order pursuant to s 10A of the Act.
	
	
	A final hearing of the proceedings on the Amended Summons was held on 6 November 2015 on which occasion Mr T Hammond of counsel appeared on behalf of the plaintiff, and Mr P Coady of counsel appeared on behalf of the defendant.
	
	
	In the Amended Summons the following orders were sought by the plaintiff:
	


3.   An order:

a.   Pursuant to s 5C and s 9(1)(a) of the Act that the defendant be subject to a High Risk Sex Offender Extended Supervision Order (“the Extended Supervision Order”) for a period of 5 years from the date of the order; and

b.   Pursuant to s 11 of the Act, directing that the defendant, for the period of the Extended Supervision Order, comply with the conditions set out in Schedule A to this Summons.

4.   An order permitting any reports prepared for the purposes of Order 1 to be provided to Corrective Services NSW, any agency involved in the defendant’s supervision, and the defendant’s treating clinician(s) or health care practitioner(s) involved in the supervision of, or the psychological and/or psychiatric care and assessment of the defendant.

Evidence in Support of the Amended Summons


	
	The plaintiff relied upon the following affidavits:
	


Affidavit of Jessica Wardle sworn 31 July 2015 exhibiting “JW-1” (one folder of material);

Affidavit of Jessica Wardle sworn 13 August 2015;

Affidavit of Jessica Wardle sworn 18 August 2015;

Affidavit of Paul Yeomans affirmed 30 September 2015;

Affidavit of Sally Shrubb affirmed 15 October 2015;

Affidavit of Joyleen Nowrot affirmed 16 October 2015;

Affidavit of Danielle Matsuo affirmed 16 October 2015;

Affidavit of Myles Pulsford, 4 November 2015.


	
	The plaintiff also relied upon the reports of two independent psychiatrists who had been appointed for the purposes of the proceedings. They were:
	


Psychiatric Report of Dr Andrew Ellis dated 28 September 2015; and

Psychiatric Report of Dr Jeremy O’Dea dated 6 October 2015.

Background


	
	The defendant (“the offender”) is presently 62 years of age. He has a prolonged history of sexual offending against a broad range of female victims. He has been convicted of sexual offences on five separate occasions. The victims of the first three convictions were adult women and strangers to the offender. The victims of the fourth conviction were four or five year-old girls. The last victim was a four year-old girl whose family the offender had befriended.
	
	
	In respect of the latter offence, the offender was sentenced on 20 September 2007 by the Newcastle District Court for a total term of imprisonment of 9 years, with a non-parole period of 8 years to expire on 7 October 2014. His total sentence expired on 7 October 2015.
	
	
	The offender’s criminal history is set out in a table, a copy of which is Annexure A to the affidavit of Ms Wardle affirmed on 31 July 2015. The history of offences was summarised in the plaintiff’s written submissions as follows:
	


“2.1   The offender is a 62 year old man with a prolonged history of sexual offending against a broad range of female victims. His first sexual offence was in 1978 when he was charged with indecently assaulting a stranger on a public street whilst he was drunk. He was 25 years old.

2.2   Later in 1978, whilst on a 2 year recognizance for the first offence, he raped a woman in her car at knifepoint. She was an older woman and a stranger to him. He was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment without a non-parole period and this was later varied to provide for a head sentence of 9 years with a 4 year non-parole period.

2.3   In 1982, whilst on parole for the second offence, the offender and an accomplice forcibly kidnapped a partially-blind 17 year old girl off the street and detained her whilst repeatedly sexually assaulting her. For the crimes of abduction and sexual assault he was convicted and sentenced to 10 years and 7 years respectively, with a non-parole period of 5 years.

2.4   In 1989, the offender approached and indecently assaulted 2 young girls whilst they played with a third child. He was sentenced to 18 months periodic detention and placed on a 5 year good behaviour bond with supervision.

2.5   The index offences were committed in 2007 against a 4 year old girl. The offender’s phone was found to contain numerous images of a young child in sexually explicit poses with the offender’s genitalia. This included the child having his penis in her mouth and he performing cunnilingus on her. He was convicted of 15 counts of possessing child pornography, 11 counts of aggravated indecent assault and 2 counts of sexual intercourse with a child under 10. He received a term of imprisonment for 9 years with 8 years non-parole period.”

The Legislative Framework


	
	Section 3(1) of the Act states its primary object is to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of high risk sex offenders and high risk violent offenders so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community. Section 3(2) of the Act states that a further object of the Act is to encourage serious sex offenders to undertake rehabilitation. In that sense the legislative purpose is protective and not punitive: Attorney General for New South Wales v Gallagher [2006] NSWSC 340.
	
	
	In an application for an Extended Supervision Order (“ESO”) there are a number of threshold requirements specified in the Act which must be met. As discussed below, no issue arises in the present proceedings as the offender has conceded that all of the requirements have been satisfied. Be that as it may it is necessary to outline the statutory requirements for an application such as the present.
	
	
	The State of New South Wales may make an application for an extended supervision order only in respect of a person who is a “supervised sex offender”: s 5I(1).
	
	
	The expression “supervised sex offender” is defined as:
	


●   A sex offender who, when the application for the order is made, is in custody or under supervision while serving a sentence of imprisonment for a serious sex offence, or an offence of a sexual nature, or serving a concurrent or consecutive sentence with a sentence of this type (s 5I(2)(a)); or

●   A sex offender who, when the application for the order is made, is subject to an existing ESO or CDO (s 5I(2)(b)); and

●   Where there is no more than six months before the expiration of the offender’s total sentence of supervision (s 6(2)). (Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [4.5])


	
	The plaintiff falls within the expression “sex offender” in that he is over the specified age (18 years) and has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment following his conviction of a serious sex offence: s 4.
	
	
	The expression “serious sex offence” is defined in s 5. It includes an offence under Division 10 of Part 3 of the Crimes Act 1900, where, in the case of an offence against an adult or a child, the offence is punishable by imprisonment for 7 years or more and the offence has been committed with intent to commit an offence under Division 10 of Part 3 of the Act.
	
	
	A serious sex offence also includes an offence under s 61K and s 66EA of the Crimes Act as well as under other specified sections of the Crimes Act where an offence is stated as punishable by imprisonment for 7 years or more.
	
	
	It was submitted for the plaintiff that the Court would be satisfied that the offender is a “supervised sex offender” within the meaning of the Act and that he is therefore an offender in relation to whom the plaintiff may make an application for an ESO: Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [14.1].
	
	
	It was further submitted that the Court would be satisfied that the evidence justifies a finding that the offender poses an unacceptable risk over the next five years of committing a serious sexual offence if he is not kept under supervision and thus has the power to make an ESO: Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [14.2].
	
	
	It was further submitted for the plaintiff that the Court ought to grant the relief sought in the Summons, namely an ESO for a period of five years and that the defendant be directed to comply with the conditions sought by the plaintiff in the Amended Summons. It was further submitted that the Court would be satisfied that relief in the terms sought by the plaintiff should be granted: Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [14.3].
	
	
	The Defendant’s Outline of Submissions conveniently identifies the matters that the offender does not dispute, and those in issue. As to the latter, the principal matters contested by the offender are:
	



	
	The period of the ESO sought by the plaintiff.
	
	
	Specific conditions sought by the plaintiff for the purposes of such order (conditions 21, 23, 24, 27, and 36). In this regard I note that as at the hearing on 6 November 2015 only three conditions were contested by the offender, being conditions 21, 23 and 35 in the Schedule to the Amended Summons.
	
	
	Order 4 as sought in the Summons (extracted above).
	



	
	Part 1A of the Act, Supervision and detention of high risk offenders, contains provisions empowering the Court to make the orders sought in the present case. Section 5C is in the following terms:
	


(1)   The Supreme Court may, on application under this Act, make an order for the supervision of an offender if the offender is a high risk sex offender.

(2)   An order made under this section is an extended supervision order.

(3)   An extended supervision order made under this section may also be referred to as a high risk sex offender extended supervision order.


	
	The provisions of Part 2, Division 2, Determination of application, are central to the present application. By s 9(1) the Supreme Court may determine an application for an ESO either by making an ESO or dismissing the application.
	
	
	Section 9(3) importantly identifies a range of matters that the Court is required to take into account. That provision is in the following terms:
	


9(3)   In determining whether or not to make an extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must have regard to the following matters in addition to any other matter it considers relevant:

(a)   the safety of the community,

(b)   the reports received from the persons appointed under section 7 (4) to conduct examinations of the offender, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such examination,

(c)   the results of any other assessment prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner as to the likelihood of the offender committing a further relevant offence, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such assessment, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such assessment,

(d)   the results of any statistical or other assessment as to the likelihood of persons with histories and characteristics similar to those of the offender committing a further relevant offence,

(d1)   any report prepared by Corrective Services NSW as to the extent to which the offender can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community,

(e)   any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has had an opportunity to participate, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such programs, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such programs,

(f)   the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while on release on parole or while subject to an earlier extended supervision order,

(g)   the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 or the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004,

(h)   the offender’s criminal history (including prior convictions and findings of guilt in respect of offences committed in New South Wales or elsewhere), and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history,

(h1)   the views of the sentencing court at the time the sentence of imprisonment was imposed on the offender,

(i)   any other information that is available as to the likelihood that the offender will in future commit offences of a sexual nature (in the case of an application for a high risk sex offender extended supervision order) or serious violence offences (in the case of an application for a high risk violent offender extended supervision order).

(4)   In this section, a relevant offence means:

(a)   in the case of an application for a high risk sex offender extended supervision order—a serious sex offence, or

(b)   …


	
	Section 10 of the Act, Term of extended supervision order, states that an ESO commences when it is made or when the offender’s custody or supervision expires, whichever is the later: s 10(1).
	
	
	Section 10(1A) provides:
	


An extended supervision order expires at the end of:

(a)   such period (not exceeding 5 years from the day on which it commences) as is specified in the order, or

(b)   if the order is suspended for any period, the period specified in paragraph (a) plus each period during which the order is suspended.


	
	Part 2, Division 4 of the Act empowers the Court to specify conditions of an interim or final ESO:
	


11 Conditions that may be imposed on supervision order

An extended supervision order or interim supervision order may direct an offender to comply with such conditions as the Supreme Court considers appropriate, including (but not limited to) directions requiring the offender:

(a)   to permit any corrective services officer to visit the offender at the offender’s residential address at any time and, for that purpose, to enter the premises at that address, or

(a1)   to permit any corrective services officer to access any computer or related equipment that is at the offender’s residential address or in the possession of the offender, or

(b)   to make periodic reports to a corrective services officer, or

(c)   to notify a corrective services officer of any change in his or her address, or

(d)   to participate in treatment and rehabilitation programs, or

(e)   to wear electronic monitoring equipment, or

(ea)   to reside at an address approved by the Commissioner of Corrective Services, or

(f)   not to reside in or resort to specified locations or classes of locations, or

(g)   not to associate or make contact with specified persons or classes of persons, or

(h)   not to engage in specified conduct or classes of conduct, or

(i)   not to engage in specified employment or classes of employment, or

(j)   not to change his or her name, or

(k)   to report to police and provide information to police about the conditions imposed on the extended supervision order or interim supervision order and the offender’s residential address, or

(l)   to comply with any obligation that could be imposed on the offender under Part 3 of the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 if the offender were a registrable person within the meaning of that Act and were not the subject of an interim supervision order or an extended supervision order, or

(m)   to comply with specified requirements in connection with the offender’s access to and use of the internet, or

(n)   to provide any corrective services officer with requested information in relation to any employment or any financial affairs of the offender.


	
	Section 12 of the Act states that a person who fails to comply with the requirements of an ESO is guilty of an offence.
	
	
	The Court is empowered to vary or revoke an ESO under the provisions of s 13 of the Act.
	


Disposition of the Proceedings


	
	It is, of course, open to a defendant to adopt the position of identifying matters or issues that are not in dispute and those which are. In many cases that will be a convenient and proper course to follow.
	
	
	It does not, however, follow that the Court in determining an application for an ESO is not itself required to be satisfied that the provisions of the Act have been met. To the contrary, it is necessary that the Court is independently satisfied that the threshold requirements for the making of an ESO have been satisfied before it undertakes the task of determining whether the power under the Act to make an ESO should be exercised in the particular case and if so, the conditions that are considered to be necessary and appropriate for the duration of the ESO.
	
	
	The offender’s position, as stated in the Defendant’s Outline of Submissions was as follows:
	


“1. SUMMARY OF POSITION 

1.1   The defendant submits that the principal issue for determination will be the length and conditions of an Extended Supervision Order (ESO).

1.2   The defendant concedes the threshold issues that relate to the imposition of an ESO as contained in the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 No 7 (the Act), that is

a)   the defendant is a ‘supervised sex offender’ for the purposes of s 5I(2)(a) of the Act;

b)   the defendant meets the definition of a ‘high risk sex offender’ under s 5B;

c)   in the circumstances of this case, it is appropriate for the Court to exercise its discretion in favour of ordering the defendant be subject to an ESO under s 5C of the Act.

1.3   Accordingly, and in relation to the summons;

a)   the defendant consents to an ESO being made under Order 3a. in the summons, but submits the appropriate duration of the ESO is 3 years, rather than 5 years; and

b)   the defendant consents to the proposed conditions as set out in Scheduled A to the summons, except for proposed conditions 21, 23, 24, 27 and 36;

c)   the defendant does not consent to Order 4 in the summons.”


	
	Mr Coady in his written submissions noted the particular statutory provisions and applicable principles set out in [5.1]-[5.2] of the plaintiff’s written submissions: Defendant’s Outline of Submissions at [2.1].
	
	
	However, Mr Coady emphasised that it must be remembered that the Act operates in the context of curtailing the defendant’s liberty: Defendant’s Outline of Submissions at [2.2]. In that case reliance was placed upon the principles of the common law which are protective of the right of freedom as enunciated in Fardon v Attorney-General (2004) 223 CLR 575 per Gleeson CJ at [14], and, in a different context, by the Court of Appeal in Nikolaidis v Satouris [2014] NSWCA 448 per Barrett JA at [33]-[42] (Beazley P and Ward JA agreeing).
	
	
	The submission for the offender was:
	


“2.3   The simplest reflection of the principles just described is that the orders sought should impose no greater derogation from the foundation right of freedom than is necessary to achieve the protective and rehabilitative objects of the legislation. See also the decision of the State of New South Wales v Donovan [2015] NSWSC 1254 per McCallum J (in the context of the Act) and Attorney-General v Maguire (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 288 per Garling J at [186] (in the context of Schedule 1 of the similarly expressed Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.”


	
	It was further submitted on behalf of the offender that relevant authority suggests that the “unacceptable risk” test should take account of the effect on the personal liberty of the defendant. Reference was made to the approach taken in the application of the “balancing test” in State of New South Wales v Anthony Joseph Russell [2015] NSWSC 488 and State of New South Wales v Hill [2015] NSWSC 489. In New South Wales v Kokkotas [2014] NSWSC 1624, it was noted that this Court (Button J) acknowledged that the Attorney-General and the defendant’s representatives in that case adopted a joint position that the principles stated by Davies J in New South Wales v Richardson (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 276; (2011) 210 A Crim R 220, including the “balancing exercise” approach, were to be applied: Defendant’s Outline of Submissions at [2.4].
	
	
	In the written submissions for the plaintiff it was observed that to make a finding that the offender is a high risk offender, the Court must be satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if not kept under supervision: s 5B. If so satisfied, the Court may make an ESO for the supervision in the community of the offender: s 5C.
	
	
	Attention was drawn to the provisions of s 5B and it was noted that s 5B(1) provides that an offender can only be made subject to an order “if and only if the offender is a high risk offender”. Such a provision, it was submitted, emphasises the need for caution in the Court’s approach to the making of an order.
	
	
	It has been accepted that the test in s 5B(2) requires satisfaction to a “high degree of probability”, this being a standard of proof that is higher than the civil standard, but lower than the criminal standard: State of New South Wales v Thomas (Preliminary) [2011] NSWSC 118 at [14] per RA Hulme J citing Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWSC 605 at [27] and Cornwall v Attorney-General of New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 374 at [21].
	
	
	As noted in the written submissions for the plaintiff at [5.5] the phrase “unacceptable risk” is not defined in the Act. Section 5B(3) provides that in determining that matter the Court is not required to decide that the risk of committing a serious sex offence is more likely than not if not kept under supervision. The prediction undertaken by the Court as to the risk posed is in relation to the period for which it can make an order, namely, a period of five years: Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at [5.5].
	
	
	In [5.6] of the plaintiff’s written submissions reference was made to the observations in State of New South Wales v Darrego [2011] NSWSC 1449 by Fullerton J at [16]-[23].
	
	
	It was also noted that in ordering that a defendant be subject to an ESO the words in s 9(2) of the Act are to be given their ordinary meaning in the context in which they appear in the Act with regard being given to the objects of the Act as observed by RA Hulme J in State of New South Wales v Thomas (Final) [2011] NSWSC 307.
	
	
	It was submitted for the plaintiff in the present proceedings (at [5.20]) that the very scheme of the Act necessarily assumes that continuing detention orders and extended supervision orders will have onerous effects on the offender.
	
	
	It was also noted for the plaintiff that s 5C of the Act provides for discretion in the Court as to whether or not an order should be made.
	
	
	In relation to the power to impose conditions under s 11 of the Act it was submitted for the plaintiff that conditions may be imposed in accordance with that section which impose positive obligations as well as restrictions upon an offender, with reference made in that respect to the observations set out in Attorney-General for New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWCA 119.
	
	
	Finally, the plaintiff in relation to the applicable principles in relation to the making of an ESO referred to the following test as stated in Wilde v State of New South Wales [2015] NSWCA 28 at [53], submitting that it was the correct approach:
	


“Care always needs to be taken with use of language which is different from the statutory text. Section 11 does not require that there must be a specific demonstrated link to the past offending which is the basis of the order made under the Act. Rather, the court must be satisfied, having regard to the scope, purpose and objects of the Act, that it is appropriate to impose a particular condition so as to address the risk of future offending of the type which was the basis of the order.” (emphasis added)

The Evidence


	
	The plaintiff relied upon the Risk Assessment Report of Narcisa Sutton, Senior Psychologist, dated 27 February 2015. The report is a lengthy and very detailed one based upon a wide range of material including information obtained from an interview and a review of the documentation identified on page 2 of the report.
	
	
	Ms Sutton noted that the offender attended for interview on 20 February 2015. She observed that the offender’s intelligence had been assessed to be within the normal range and there was no evidence of symptoms of agitation or mood disorder and that his thought processes appeared logical and coherent in both form and content: Risk Assessment Report at [6].
	
	
	Ms Sutton observed that the offender had commenced the Custody Based Intensive Therapeutic (CUBIT) Sex Offender Program on 2 April 2014 and that his progress had been slow. In her view, she considered that his understanding of treatment concepts and principles appeared to be somewhat superficial: Risk Assessment Report at [48].
	
	
	She noted that he was soon due to complete treatment and that his final report would provide more insightful and comprehensive information about his participation and treatment gains: Risk Assessment Report at [50].
	
	
	Ms Sutton reported upon the actuarial assessment of static risk factors for the purposes of assessing the offender’s risk of sexual re-offending. His total score on the STATIC-99R was 5. This placed him in the moderate-high risk category relative to other male sex offenders: Risk Assessment Report at [60]. It was noted that within the normative samples, the recidivism rates of the group of offender with the same score as the offender were between 11.4% and 25.2% over five years: Risk Assessment Report at [60].
	
	
	Ms Sutton noted that the use of an instrument such as the STATIC-99R has limitations. Recidivism estimates and relative rankings provided by that measure are based on groups of individuals and therefore the estimate/rankings will not necessarily directly reflect the recidivism risk of an individual offender: Risk Assessment Report at [61].
	
	
	The report considers the range of factors embraced in what is referred to as the Risk of Sexual Violence Protocol (RSVP). These include a total of 22 static and dynamic factors grouped into five different “domains”: Risk Assessment Report at [63].
	
	
	In the summary to the report the following conclusions are expressed:
	


“Summary

73.   Mr Howard presents with some risk factors in each of the domains covered by the RSVP. This suggests that the Moderate/High Risk score in the STATIC-99R is an accurate reflection of his risk of re‑offending.

74.   Particularly salient dynamic risk factors include Mr Howard’s sexual drive, his unsophisticated understanding of consent and sexual boundaries, and his unstructured, isolated lifestyle. Although he has made some gains in treatment in terms of accepting responsibility for the offences and understanding victim harm, he still appears to hold on to the idea that the offences would not have happened if he had not been sexually frustrated, if the child had not ‘flashed’ him, and if he had not had a camera to take photographs of the abuse.”


	
	In the Risk Assessment Report Ms Sutton also reviewed “potential risk scenarios”. At [76] specific factors are identified which, if they materialised in the offender’s case it was said would result in an acute high risk scenario for him.
	
	
	The opinion was expressed that if the offender were to re-offend it would most likely be against a female child or young adolescent girl but that older vulnerable women, such as those with an intellectual disability, were also potential victims: Risk Assessment Report at [77].
	
	
	As to the future, in the event of a supervision order being made, Ms Sutton stated that consideration should be given to a number of areas as set out in [83]-[92] of the report. These included his placement or residence, obligations to participate in the community based sex offender Maintenance Program (Forensic Psychology Services, Surry Hills) and monitoring in the context of his adjustment to life in the city. It was noted that participation in drug and alcohol counselling programmes may be advisable if the offender resorted to cannabis and alcohol. A condition should be imposed to ensure adherence to weekly schedules of movement that are submitted to the supervising officer.
	
	
	In addition to these matters it was recommended that the need for intensive care management by a specialist team should be considered, with the team having ongoing access to psychologists and expertise in the treatment of sex offenders. This supervision needed to be intensive and targeted to the dynamic risk factors that have previously been identified.
	
	
	It was noted that whilst supervision needs to be intense it was important that the style of supervision should promote the offender’s autonomy by encouraging his input into the decision-making process whenever possible: Risk Assessment Report at [89].
	
	
	The report also addressed the need for a condition as to electronic monitoring with exclusion zones in place around high-risk locations. It was stated in this respect:
	


“91.   The goal of these conditions would be to encourage the development and maintenance of a stable and sustainable lifestyle, so that new habits can be formed that might endure beyond supervision.”


	
	A copy of a Risk Management Report by Joyleen Nowrot, Community Corrections Officer, dated 7 April 2015 (Annexure D to Ms Wardle’s affidavit affirmed 31 July 2015) was also relied upon by the plaintiff. The report was prepared to satisfy the requirements of s 9(3)(d)(i) and s 17(4)(d1) of the Act. It identified the sources of information which included the Risk Assessment Report referred to above and the judge’s Remarks on Sentence dated 20 September 2007.
	
	
	Ms Nowrot noted that at the time of interview the offender had been housed at the Nunyara Community Offender Support Program (COSP). It was noted that he has limited social support: Risk Management Report, p 3.
	
	
	The relevant risk factors referred to in the Risk Assessment Report were noted and it was in light of these factors that a Risk Management Plan as outlined in the Report was undertaken.
	
	
	The report identifies the various categories of risk to be managed and monitored and the nature and extent of risk management strategies as well as their limitations.
	
	
	Amongst the many matters recommended for inclusion in the risk management strategy was the need for the offender to engage in sex offender maintenance sessions with Forensic Psychology Services with a view to minimising the risk of future offending and for the purposes of community reintegration: Risk Management Report at p 8.
	
	
	It was also noted that the Risk Assessment Report prepared by Ms Sutton had stated that there was a need for the offender to be monitored in the context of his adjustment to life in the city and that participation in drug and alcohol counselling programs would be advisable. The Risk Management Report recommended that the offender would need to be subject to random drug and alcohol testing (p 9). Specific risks existing in the event of contact with children under 18 years of age were noted. As part of a management strategy, the need for a schedule of movements to be scrutinised by the Extended Supervision Order Team was recommended to ensure appropriate pro-social activities are planned in conjunction with appointments with required treatment providers. This would minimise the offender’s contact with children (p 9). The report also noted that the offender should have no contact with children under the age of 18 unless being supervised by a responsible adult approved by Community Corrections.
	
	
	The affidavit of Joyleen Nowrot affirmed 16 October 2015 contains details of her review of the relevant documentation concerning the offender as identified at [5] of her affidavit. She had been assigned (on 5 March 2015) the task of preparing the Risk Management Report preparatory to the application for the interim supervision order. The report stated that it was likely that the offender would resume receipt of the Disability Support Pension and that he had limited social supports. Accordingly, he would be encouraged to engage in pro-social support networks in the community.
	
	
	A Treatment Report dated 20 July 2015 was prepared by Ms Marie Rubio, Psychologist, CUBIT, Metropolitan Special Programs Centre and Ms Megan Donaldson, Senior Psychologist, also of CUBIT, MSPC and was marked as Annexure B to Ms Wardle’s affidavit affirmed 13 August 2015.
	
	
	The Treatment Reports states that the offender participated in the CUBIT program between 2 April 2014 and 14 May 2015. It was noted that the program is a custody-based residential therapy program for men who have sexually abused adults and/or children. The program balances risk management with a strengths-based approach to treatment for individuals with moderate to high risks/needs (p 1).
	
	
	The aim of the treatment program is to assist participants to develop skills, attitudes, values and resources identified as necessary to lead a fulfilling and offence-free life (pp 1-2).
	
	
	The report provides a detailed account of treatment progress. It noted that during the course the defendant had gained an improved level of understanding of the issues surrounding his sexual offending from openly discussing his sexual beliefs (p 5).
	
	
	Additionally, whilst he had initially demonstrated a poor understanding of the negative effects of sexual abuse on victims in general he came, through discussion, to show some remorse and his responses suggested that he recognised the seriousness of his offences (p 5).
	
	
	In relation to the subject of risk assessment, the report refers to the static and dynamic actuarial risk factors and noted factors or signs that provided possible indications of the offender having difficulty with managing the identified risk factors (p 11).
	
	
	In the conclusions and recommendations section of the report it was stated that, taking into account both static and dynamic risk factors, the risk rating of moderate/high on the STATIC-99R was considered as accurately reflecting the offender’s current risk (p 13). It was there also stated:
	


“… dynamic risk areas including sexual self-regulation, intimacy deficits and general self-regulation are ongoing areas of risk that require regular monitoring and management.”


	
	In relation to self-management plans it was noted that the offender accepted that he needs to be more mindful of his feelings, thoughts and actions and how they affect others and overall to improve his sexual self-control more effectively and consistently (p 13).
	
	
	The report then stated at p 14:
	


“… Mr Howard requires further work and ongoing emotional awareness to his sexual behaviours and attitudes; its effect on his thoughts and behaviours, and those of others. Therefore, he requires regular monitoring of his actual integration of his self-management plans into his day to day life to ensure he maintains a realistic view of his risk factors.”


	
	Finally, the report recommended that the offender participate in the Sex Offender Programs Community-Based Maintenance Program as has been noted and stated above.
	


Psychiatric Evaluations

(i) Report of Dr Andrew Ellis, Forensic Psychiatrist, 28 September 2015


	
	Dr Ellis (like Dr O’Dea) undertook a detailed review of relevant documentary material which included information concerning the offender’s past history of offending, his substance use and addiction history and his personal background and development and psycho-sexual history.
	
	
	Both consultant psychiatrists also undertook an assessment based upon an interview with the offender.
	
	
	In many respects the analysis and the conclusions made by Dr Ellis coincide with those undertaken and expressed by Dr O’Dea. The principal variance in their ultimate conclusions is the appropriate period or term for an ESO.
	
	
	Dr Ellis concluded that:
	


“The diagnosis of primary concern is paraphilic disorder (Paedophilia). He would meet criteria for a paedophilic disorder, attracted to girls. …” (p 10)


	
	Dr Ellis noted that paedophilia is “… a chronic relapsing condition” (p 11). Dr Ellis noted that the offender’s explanations for past offending were “devoid of motive” (p 11). He added “… the repeated nature of the assaults, despite parole supervision, indicates high risk taking” (p 11).
	
	
	Dr Ellis noted various aspects of the offender’s past personal history and concluded that various personality traits would meet a criteria for a diagnosis of “mixed personality disorder” (p 11).
	
	
	He also identified that there was sufficient evidence to conclude that an alcohol use disorder had existed but was in remission in the controlled environment of prison (p 11).
	
	
	On the question of the risk of further sexual offending, Dr Ellis noted the various actuarial measures that had been applied and concluded:
	


“I would concur with the most recent total score provided in the report of Ms Sutton.” (p 12)


	
	Dr Ellis further observed:
	


“Deviant sexual arousal is consistently identified as the most prominent risk factor for sexual reoffence. Mr Howard’s offence history indicates this pattern of arousal for his most recent offences with repeated sexual advances or actions towards minors. Offending continued in a repeated pattern …” (p 13)


	
	Dr Ellis noted that the offender had participated in a group sex offender treatment program and participants who complete such programs are in the group that demonstrate lower rates of recidivism (p 13).
	
	
	Dr Ellis reviewed proposals for a treatment and supervision plan and conditions and obligations arising under such plans. He considered that the usual conditions as identified at p 15 of his report were supported in order to manage the risk factors present.
	
	
	Dr Ellis concluded at p 16:
	


“From a psychiatric perspective if an ESO is applied a period of three years is considered reasonable in order to improve function in the community, and refine the appraisal of risk. Paraphilias are chronic relapsing conditions and resistant to treatment and rehabilitative efforts. His comorbid personality style impacts upon likely treatment and supervision response. It is most likely that a period of 12 months will be required to secure stable independent accommodation, maintain a stable mental state and regular meaningful social activity in the community, given the restrictions on persons subject to extended supervision orders. A further 24 months of regular treatment in a psychological program, coupled with a regular review of antilibidinal medication should they be prescribed would be necessary …”


	
	Dr Ellis stated that the period to which he referred was estimated based on the offender’s current mental state, paraphilia, personality style and current attitudes to supervision that would be unlikely to change in the short term. His relatively old age compared to other offenders, and previous ability to remain in the community without offending, Dr Ellis stated, would warrant a review of his risk profile at that point. Dr Ellis added:
	


“His psychiatric disorders are chronic and likely to persist beyond any period of supervision, but may be better internally controlled at that point.” (p 16)

(ii) Report of Dr Jeremy O’Dea, Forensic Psychiatrist, 6 October 2015


	
	Dr O’Dea in his report of 6 October 2015 set out a detailed medical and forensic history in relation to the offender as well as his history of offending.
	
	
	Dr Ellis noted that the offender had completed the CUBIT program and referred to observations that had been made by Ms Sutton as to his progress whilst attending the program: Report of Dr O’Dea at [54].
	
	
	In the Opinion section of his report, Dr O’Dea noted that the offender had a history of Alcohol Use Disorder from his early twenties that was related to at least some of the repeated sex offences (at [71]). He noted the offender’s reported high sex drive at least in younger years, his history of intoxication at the time of at least some of the sexual offences and his apparently limited insight and remorse regarding his offending behaviours.
	
	
	Dr O’Dea referred to his overall lifestyle and attitude to his offending as pointing to there being a significant anti-social component to his personality.
	
	
	Dr O’Dea also observed at:
	


“76.   On the basis of his history of repeated sex offending, his history of alcohol use disorder, his personality and lifestyle, and his response to psychological interventions to date, it would seem reasonable to assume that Mr Howard has a significant risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours in the community in the long term, including of committing a further serious sex offence, as defined in the New South Wales Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006, with this risk the appropriate focus of specific and structured risk management.”


	
	In relation to general risk issues, Dr O’Dea emphasised that caution should be used in assessing risk of future behaviours in individuals for the purposes of either treatment or supervision (at [81]). He also observed:
	


“82.   With this in mind, from a full clinical psychiatric risk management perspective, and as judged by various actuarial and more so called dynamic risk assessment instruments, Mr Howard’s risk of engaging in further offending behaviours in the community in the long term would be considered significantly high and appropriate for specific psychiatric treatment as outline above.

83.   More specifically it would seem reasonable to consider that there would be a significantly high degree of probability that Mr Howard would be likely to commit a further sex offence, including a further ‘serious sex offence’ (as defined in Section 5 of the New South Wales Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006) in the community in the long term. Whilst it is not possible, or clinically appropriate from a psychiatric perspective, to place a percentage likelihood of Mr Howard committing a further ‘serious sex offence’, the significance of this risk from a clinical perspective may be considered commensurate to the likelihood as I understand is referred to in legal terms in Tillman v Attorney General for New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 327.”


	
	Dr O’Dea finally concluded:
	


“86.   Despite his age, Mr Howard’s risk of committing a further serious sex offence would be considered as long term, and of at least 5 years duration. Therefore, from a psychiatric risk management perspective, any appropriate community risk management program implemented should be long term and of at least of 5 years duration, and should be regularly monitored and reviewed every 6 to 12 months dependent on his progress.”

Determination of the Plaintiff’s Application


	
	In determining whether or not an ESO should be made in these proceedings as sought by the plaintiff, I have had regard, so far as is relevant, to the matters specified in s 9(3) of the Act. In particular in that respect the following matters are of central importance:
	



	
	The safety of the community having regard in particular to:
	



	
	The serious and extensive nature of the offender’s past sexual offending.
	
	
	The current assessments of relevant risk factors evaluated in the Risk Assessment Report tendered in evidence.
	



	
	The analysis and conclusions of Drs Ellis and O’Dea who each conducted examinations of the defendant and both of whom were appointed under s 7 of the Act.
	
	
	The analysis and conclusions contained in the Risk Management Report tendered in evidence.
	
	
	The specific risk factors and other circumstances identified above.
	


Determination of the Term of the Extended Supervision Order


	
	In accordance with the provisions of s 10(1) of the Act an ESO commences when it is made, or when the offender’s current custody or supervision expires, whichever is the later.
	
	
	By s 10(1A) of the Act, an ESO expires at the end of such period (not exceeding 5 years from the date on which it commences) as is specified in the order.
	
	
	The evidence establishes that the defendant is a high risk sex offender within the meaning of s 5B(2) of the Act, that is to say, the evidence satisfies me to a high degree of probability that the defendant poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision.
	
	
	Mr Coady on behalf of the defendant submitted that the appropriate term for an ESO was a period of three years, whereas, as earlier noted, the plaintiff contends that the appropriate term for such an order is a period of five years.
	
	
	Mr Coady referred to State of New South Wales v Galanis [2015] NSWSC 133 in which Campbell J referred to a number of aspects that arose for consideration in that case on the question as to the duration of an ESO. As his Honour there observed, in determining the duration of such an order the determination is not to be an arbitrary one (at [62]). In that case it was determined that a period of 3 years and 6 months was adequate to achieve the purpose of an order if benefits or ‘real gains’ in terms of rehabilitation or education could be made during the period. His Honour observed at [62]:
	


“… I am not confident that they can, and if this pessimism proves well-founded, doubtless a further application will be made.”


	
	In that case, the examining psychiatrists, Dr Ellis and Dr Samuels, had both supported an order of five years duration.
	
	
	In his written submissions, Mr Coady observed that the dual purposes of protection of the community and rehabilitation of the offender must be kept in mind: Defendant’s Outline of Submissions at [3.1].
	
	
	He further submitted:
	


“3.2   It is submitted that an appropriate term of any ESO is 3 years on the basis that:

a.   3 years is a substantial period of time in the circumstances of the defendant’s case;

b.   the conditions sought (and largely agreed to) are a continuous and comprehensive restriction on the defendant’s liberty, which meet the purposes of the Act;

c.   taking the defendant’s past compliance into account, he will most likely comply with the conditions of the ESO;

d.   the conditions adequately address identified risk factors;

e.   the plaintiff has the opportunity to make applications for subsequent order.”


	
	Mr Coady further relied in his written submissions upon sentencing remarks made on 20 September 2007 in the Newcastle District Court. They were to the effect that the offender had pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity and that he had been at liberty in the community for 17 years without any convictions for sexual offences. The sentencing judge found that the defendant genuinely regretted his actions although was not accepting full responsibility for them.
	
	
	It was noted that it appeared that the offender was not granted parole but instead served his entire term: Defendant’s Outline of Submissions at [3.6].
	


“3.7   In those circumstances, it is submitted that the imposition of further restrictions on his liberty may have a punitive effect, particularly where the defendant has served more time than he perhaps should have.”


	
	This lastmentioned comment related to a question as to whether or not an appropriate ratio of non-parole period to parole period had been fixed.
	
	
	Additionally, reliance was placed upon the defendant’s compliance with prison regulations.
	
	
	Finally, it was submitted that three years was sufficient in circumstances where the defendant had completed the CUBIT course over 13 months in 2014/2015. The CUBIT Treatment Report, it was noted, referred to the defendant’s improved level of understanding of the issues surrounding his sexual offending and expression of remorse: Defendant’s Outline of Submissions at [3.9].
	
	
	In the plaintiff’s submissions a number of matters were identified as supportive of a term of five years for the ESO. Some of these have been referred to above whilst others are the subject of observations and findings set out below.
	
	
	On the basis of the evidence, and having regard to the submissions made on behalf of the plaintiff and the offender, I have determined that in the circumstances of this case a five year term for the ESO is appropriate and necessary.
	
	
	In reaching that conclusion I have had regard in particular to the following matters:
	



	
	The criminal history of the offender involving multiple and serious sexual offences committed over a lengthy period of time. Such offences reveal a certain chronicity as well as diversity in his sexual offending.
	
	
	The fact that the risk of sexual offending has been assessed as a moderate to high risk.
	
	
	The limited progress achieved by the offender in the CUBIT program. The evidence indicates that such progress as was made was “slow” and somewhat superficial. In this respect I refer to the evidence of Ms Sutton and Ms Nowrot. Their evidence establishes that the plaintiff has a superficial understanding of the concepts and principles in respect of his risk management factors as have been exposed to him in the course of his treatment.
	
	
	That, with the exception of the index offence, the defendant was on conditional liberty when he committed a number of sexual offences (either being on parole or under supervision on a bond).
	
	
	The offender’s past excessive use of alcohol as an associated risk factor and that the defendant has not engaged in any formal AOD counselling to date.
	
	
	The repeated reports by the offender as to his unusually high sex drive and the assessment of Ms Sutton that sexual arousal is a significant risk factor for him.
	
	
	The assessed risk factors, including in particular, the limited social supports available to the defendant in the community and the lack of pro-social relationships are likely to be ongoing and significant risk factors. They were in existence in his lifestyle at the time of his earlier offending.
	



	
	The above matters I consider are directly relevant to the primary object of the Act, namely, to ensure the safety and protection of the community. There is, by my assessment, no evidence that supports the proposition that the defendant has achieved a level of rehabilitation so as to justify a term for an ESO less than five years. In other words, the evidence does not, in my assessment, establish the present case as one in which a lesser duration is warranted for the purpose of promoting the offender’s rehabilitation.
	
	
	The case does not fall, in my assessment, within the category in which a lesser term is appropriate having regard to what has been referred to as the “light at the end of the tunnel” proposition (as to which see observations made by Campbell J in State of New South Wales v Galanis, supra at [62]). I was impressed by the analysis of Dr O’Dea which I consider fully justifies his assessment that the defendant’s risk of committing a further serious sex offence would be considered as long-term and of at least five years duration. On that basis, as Dr O’Dea further observed, any appropriate community risk management program could be implemented (and in my opinion, should be implemented) on a long-term basis of at least five years duration with regular monitoring and review every six to twelve months dependent upon the offender’s progress.
	


Conditions


	
	As previously noted, the Amended Summons sought an ESO with conditions pursuant to s 11 of the Act in the form set out in Schedule “A” to the Summons subject to minor amendments to conditions 42 and 47 (the reference in condition 42 to condition 35 was amended to refer to condition 40 and the reference to condition 38 in condition 47 was amended to refer to condition 37.)
	
	
	As at the date of the hearing there were three Proposed Conditions disputed by the defendant. They are:
	


Conditions 21 and 23 in Part D: Employment, finance and education, of the Proposed Conditions; and

Condition 35 in Part H, Weapons, of the Proposed Conditions.


	
	Proposed Condition 21 is in the following terms:
	


“21.   If the defendant is unemployed, the defendant must make himself available for employment, education, training or participation in a personal development program as directed by the DSO (Departmental Supervising Officer) unless he is assessed by a medical practitioner as being medically unfit to do so.”


	
	It was submitted for the offender that the inclusion of “employment” on the second line would place him under an obligation to accept employment and that the condition was excessive and was not one which addresses the risk of re-offending.
	
	
	The opportunity for a high risk offender to gain and engage in employment would generally be seen as a positive constructive step in reducing a risk of re-offending as it provides an offender with a worthwhile focus that will often offset any temptation to re-offend (as in the past) if the offender is left idle or unoccupied.
	
	
	On the other hand, any such condition ought not, in my opinion, subject an offender to an unreasonable requirement to accept employment if unsuitable, or otherwise beyond a person’s capacity or capable of producing deleterious effects. Accordingly, I have concluded that the proposed condition should read:
	


“… make himself available for employment (being employment that is reasonably suitable having regard to all relevant circumstances, including the offender’s physical and/or mental capacity to undertake such employment), education, training …”


	
	Proposed Condition 23 is in the following terms;
	


“23.   The defendant must provide any information relating to his financial affairs, including income and expenditure, if directed by his DSO.”


	
	The inclusion of this condition was supported on two bases. First, to provide a basis upon which it may be determined if monies were being expended upon objects that may be capable of being deployed in activities associated with or conducive to further sexual offending. Second, as a basis for determining whether the defendant was managing his finances so as to avoid financial stress that may undermine his ability to self-manage.
	
	
	I consider the first basis is a sufficient one for supporting the inclusion of this proposed condition. Whilst potentially being an intrusive intervention on the defendant’s privacy, on balance, I nonetheless consider that it is a justifiable one having regard to the need for the defendant to maintain a resistance to the risk of re-offending.
	
	
	Proposed Condition 35 is in the following terms:
	


“35.   The defendant must not possess or use any firearm within the meaning of s 4 of the Firearms Act 1996 or prohibited weapon as defined in s 4 and Schedule 1 of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998.”


	
	It was submitted for the offender that this condition was not necessary because the possession of a prohibited firearm was already an offence in itself. It was submitted that the condition also does not appear to address the offender’s risk of future offending.
	
	
	The plaintiff noted that the offender had, in relation to one of his sexual assaults, used a knife, that he had previously enjoyed shooting as a recreational sport and has been convicted of a firearms offence. In those circumstances it was submitted that the condition should be included. Additionally, although ordinarily a person cannot possess a firearm or prohibited weapon without committing an offence, there are some exceptions under the Firearms Act 1996. This means that a person can, in some circumstances, possess a firearm without a licence or a permit.
	
	
	The plaintiff submitted that although it is unlikely that the offender would fit within an exemption and be able to possess a firearm without contravening the legislation, the condition ensures beyond doubt that the offender is prohibited from possessing a firearm or prohibited weapon.
	
	
	I consider that the proposed condition is useful in terms of the supervision and control of the offender. Although the possession of an unregistered firearm or other prohibited weapon is an offence, Proposed Condition 35 is more specific, and operates as a direct restriction on the possession of weapons by the offender. Further I do not consider that the offender would be in any way disadvantaged by the inclusion of the condition.
	


Order 4 in the Amended Summons


	
	Order 4 sought by the plaintiff in its Amended Summons was in the following terms:
	


“4.   An order permitting any reports prepared for the purposes of Order 1 to be provided to Corrective Services New South Wales, any agency involved in the defendant’s supervision, and the defendant’s treating clinician(s) or health care practitioner(s) involved in the supervision of, or the psychological and/or psychiatric care and assessment of, the defendant.”


	
	Order 1 referred to the reports of qualified psychiatrics. As such, Order 4 applied to the reports of Drs Ellis and O’Dea.
	
	
	As stated above at [20], the offender opposed the making of an order in the terms of Order 4. Mr Coady, on behalf of the offender, submitted that the Order was too wide and that the two psychiatric reports which had been prepared in relation to the offender should only be given to any psychological or psychiatric professional involved in the offender’s ongoing care.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the hearing on 6 November 2015 I indicated to Mr Hammond my preliminary view that the plaintiff should seek to be more specific in identifying the agencies that would be entitled to the reports. I directed each of the parties to provide a further written note on this point.
	
	
	Following the hearing my Associate received communication from the parties stating that they had reached an agreement on the wording of Order 4. The offender consented to a revised order being made in the following terms:
	


“An order permitting any reports prepared pursuant to Order 1 to be provided to any Corrective Services New South Wales Community Corrections officer involved in the supervision of the defendant, and any psychologist and/or psychiatrist involved in the supervision of, or the psychological and/or psychiatric care or assessment of, the defendant.”


	
	I consider that the amended form of the order is appropriate to overcome any danger of psychiatric reports relating to the offender becoming too broadly accessible.
	


Orders


	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	An order under s 5C Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 subjecting Kevin Howard to a high risk sex offender extended supervision order for a period of five years commencing 2 December 2015.
	
	
	An order under s 11 of the Act directing Kevin Howard to comply with the conditions set out in Schedule A to these orders for the duration of Order 1.
	
	
	An order permitting the reports of Dr Andrew Ellis dated 28 September 2015 and Dr Jeremy O’Dea dated 6 October 2015 to be provided to any Corrective Services New South Wales Community Corrections officer involved in the supervision of the defendant, and any psychologist and/or psychiatrist involved in the supervision of, or the psychological and/or psychiatric care or assessment of, the defendant.

		02 December 2015",2015-11-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2702397,R v Melmeth [2015] NSWSC 1762,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	On 18 November 2015 the applicant pursued her application to be released on bail, having been charged with serious offences under the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) of wound person with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (s 33(1)(a)) and detain in company (s 86(3)). She has been in custody bail refused since her arrest on 30 May 2015.
	
	
	The applicant is next due before the Newcastle Local Court on 2 December, when the balance of the brief is due to be served. The charges involve a co-accused and a victim, on the applicant’s case another drug user, who claims to have been detained by the two accused, threatened, forced to use a drug and very seriously assaulted. The charges are defended.
	
	
	There is no issue that it is likely that there will be a very considerable further delay in the matter going to trial in the District Court. The applicant has been advised that it will not be heard before October 2016. That is not disputed.
	
	
	The Crown opposes bail.
	


The show cause obligation


	
	At common law a person seeking bail is entitled to the presumption of innocence and has a general right to be at liberty. Those remain relevant considerations when this bail application is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Bail Act 2013 (NSW).
	
	
	There is no issue that s 16B of that Act imposes an onus on the applicant to show cause why her detention is not justified. Accordingly, this application must be refused, unless the applicant satisfies that obligation. Whether that burden has been met is in issue.
	
	
	Determination of this bail application involves a two-step process, even though matters relevant to the show cause test relied on by the applicant are also relevant to the question of bail concerns which the applicant poses and the unacceptable risk test which must be considered in accordance with s 17, s 18 and s 19 of the Act, if cause is shown.
	
	
	The applicant relies on a combination of factors to satisfy the show cause requirements of s 16A. Under that section, however, the question of whether the applicant has satisfied the obligation to show cause that her detention is not justified, is not confined to matters relevant to bail concerns and the assessment of risks, which must be determined in accordance with other statutory provisions. Further, the statutory tests may not be conflated, as is discussed in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Tikomaimaleya [2015] NSWCA 83.
	
	
	The matters on which the applicant relies include evidence she has given as to her serious ill health and the ongoing problems it has caused during her first time in custody with its management, as well as other evidence as to her health and personal circumstances, and the stringent conditions of bail which she proposes in order to address the bail concerns and risks identified by the Crown, namely risks of failing to appear and of committing a serious offence (s 17(2)(a) and (b)).
	
	
	The application has to be decided on the balance of probabilities (s 32), taking into account evidence or information considered to be credible or trustworthy in the circumstances. It is not to be undertaken according to the laws governing the admission of evidence (s 31).
	
	
	The applicant is aged 30 years. Her application is supported by her parents. She has been the sole carer of her 8 year old son since he was aged 4. He has been cared for by the applicant’s mother, since she drove him home to learn from the applicant’s neighbour, that the applicant had been arrested the previous day. Her mother had received no contact from police, or any other enquiry as to his welfare. She described her concerns about the impact of the applicant’s bail refusal on the applicant’s deteriorating health, as well as on the wellbeing of her grandchild, in a letter in evidence. There is also in evidence, a letter from the applicant’s father, with whom it is proposed she would reside, if granted bail.
	
	
	The applicant is a type 1 diabetic. On 28 July, two Justice Health certificates were issued by Dr Meldrum, at the Dillwynia Correctional Centre, certifying that the applicant has poorly controlled insulin dependent diabetes, causing her to have some blurred vision and dizziness on frequent bending, as well as a past history of pneumothorax. He recommended that she have 3 blankets at night and that she be allowed regular breaks and avoid frequent bending.
	
	
	These certificates provide for custodial officers to indicate their receipt. They are, however, unsigned. The certificates also provide:
	


“This certificate lists a requirement of the Justice Health for appropriate management of the health needs of this inmate.

Local health staff are to be directly advised by custodial staff if the requirement cannot be met so that satisfactory alternative arrangements can be agreed.

In the absence of such advice, it will be assumed that the recommendations have been carried out. Custodial staff may request a review of the requirement by their clinic staff if they consider it necessary or desirable.”


	
	In a letter of 28 August 2015, Mr Connally, a registered nurse and credentialed diabetes educator at the Nepean Diabetes Service, advised Dr Meldrum that adjustments were required to manage the applicant’s diabetes. He recommended:
	


“insulin:

Novorapid 4-12 units at meals - Currently Carly states she gets her Novorapid at least 30 mins before she eats. Novorapid's onset is within 10 minutes. Then she bases her next dose on her current BGL. This is not ideal. Carly has done carb counting before where would estimate her next dose based on the carbs she was about to eat. This generally leads to better control. I would therefore recommend

•   Insulin to be given immediately with food to avoid hyoglycaemia

•   Dose decided on the carbs about to be eaten not on the current glucose level. Carly was originally having between 1 & 2 units per 15gms of carbohydrate and is able to discern this. We can always arrange a dietitian appt to confirm this if necessary. I have given Carly an insulin pen which measures in ½ units so she can try, for example, 1 ½ units per carb. This pen requires a penfill cartridge.

•   She needs to have a BGL around 2 hours after dinner to assess the effect of her dinner dose of Novorapid

Lantus 22 units at dinner - Because the slow acting Lantus is given so early i.e. 4.30 pm it has less chance of improving the fasting level often leading to increased doing and consequent hypoglycaemia in the middle of the night. I would suggest:

•   Reducing the dose to 20 units

•   Giving the Lantus at the time of testing 2 hours after dinner which will allow more of it to be working by morning”


	
	In a letter of 20 September, the applicant stated that no attempts had been made in custody to respond to this advice. The result was that daily, she was experiencing symptoms of blurred vision, slurred speech, confusion, dizziness, being off balance and sweating. She was also suffering swelling of her ankles, which she was concerned could indicate a diabetic related kidney problem. She also feared that some of these symptoms could precede a diabetic coma.
	
	
	On 10 September the applicant was transferred to Mulwala. She said that she had not received insulin before she left, or until some hours after her arrival there. She was then left in a cell, having not eaten since 8.30 am and despite using the medical emergency button, was not given insulin at the correct times, or given food until 3 pm. She requested to see a nurse, because she was feeling unwell, with blurry vision, sweating and was feeling faint. The response was that she was processed last. The applicant said that she began fearing for her life and was left begging to see a nurse. Another inmate responded to her distress, by providing her with a mintie. When she saw a nurse she was handed the wrong insulin. The result of her anger and frustration over her treatment was that she was put in a detox cell, where she was kept under camera observation in a lit room, for a week
	
	
	On 12 September, whilst at the clinic, she did not receive her long lasting insulin or prescribed medication which helped her sleep. The medical button she later used was not responded to. She also said in her evidence that her blood sugar tests in custody, which give an average reading of sugar control over a 3 month period, have gone up, indicating poor control.
	
	
	The applicant also gave oral evidence that since her September letter, there had not been anything done to improve her health. She had been kept in a cell with no food for a number of hours; she had been left there when she requested to see a nurse, even after pressing the emergency button; she had a special diabetic tester which would help monitor her diabetes, to which she was not allowed access in custody; she saw an endocrinologist on 13 November, who had provided a letter, which she understood said that the tester would improve her health and recommended what needed to be done in relation to her diabetes; the letter had been taken by Corrective Services and she had not been able to get it back.
	
	
	The applicant also said that she needed more insulin, in order to bring her sugar levels down; that she needed to receive her insulin injections at the same regular times daily; and that she also needed to be given food on a regular basis, as well as access to her diabetic tester, if her condition was to be controlled. Why she could not get a prescription for that tester in custody, had not been explained to her.
	
	
	In cross-examination the applicant agreed that Justice Health had made an appointment for her to see an endocrinologist at Nepean Hospital, although she said first, it had only made an appointment with a diabetic educator. She had then waited 3 months to see the endocrinologist.
	
	
	The applicant also said that daily she suffers symptoms of blurred vision, slurred speech, sweating and shakiness and that not receiving regular insulin could cause hypoglycaemic episodes. She agreed that insulin was not being withheld from her and that the reason she was not receiving the insulin she required, was because she was in the prison system. She also said that she regularly had to advise officers that she was an insulin dependent diabetic and that she had begged for her records to be checked, but on occasions had been laughed at and told to sit down before she fell. She said that she found her circumstances to be very distressing.
	
	
	When questioned as to the last occasion on which she did not get her insulin when she needed it, her evidence was that it was two days previously, when taken to Newcastle for court, when the truck was 2 hours late. The result was that she was on the truck for three and a half to 4 hours and had to request a muesli bar. When questioned as to whether she had complained, she said that she had raised her concerns with her solicitor and had also made a complaint to the Health Commission
	
	
	Despite this evidence the Crown’s attitude remained that the application for bail was opposed. I indicated that it seemed to me that the evidence potentially provided a basis on which it could be concluded that cause had been shown. The Crown then sought an adjournment, in order to meet the evidence which had been led in support of the application .
	
	
	A short adjournment of the hearing on 18 November was not opposed by the applicant, but the date the Court had available, 20 November, suited neither party. It was thus listed for further hearing on 24 November. The Crown then raised another difficulty in obtaining the evidence it required, by that date:
	


“LAIRD: I had a matter before McCallum J earlier this year where I asked a Justice Health to prepare a report. They refused to do a report unless directed by the Court.

HER HONOUR: I direct Justice Health produce a report.

LAIRD: And a report would normally take between four and six weeks.

HER HONOUR: I direct Justice Health produce a report for the Court to consider at the adjourned hearing of this application on Tuesday 24 November at 9.30am.

LAIRD: If no report is produced I think there is sufficient material for your Honour to have overcome the show cause issue.

HER HONOUR: You need to have an opportunity, but it needs to be a reasonable one in the circumstances. It is a question of this material being directed to the relevant person, then that person taking the time to produce the report.”


	
	In order to address the difficulty which had been raised by the Crown, the direction was made in the form of an order, which was conveyed later that day to Justice Health.
	
	
	On 19 November the order elicited a response directed to the Court Registry in these terms:
	


“Please be advised that any kind of medical report takes 4 weeks to complete, so without sufficient time we are unable to comply with this request. Even pulling out all stops (transfer of medical records, allocation of a clinical director) there simply is not enough time.

I spoke to David Laird from the ODPP regarding this matter this morning and I understand he was going to subpoena production of the medical records to Court which may resolve the matter.

As an aside, this matter seems to be a patient complaint and I would encourage the patient to use the many channels available to her should she have any concerns regarding her care or treatment provided by Justice Health. She is able to speak to the Nursing Unit Manager, Health Care complaints Commission or NSW Ombudsman should she have a complaint she wants to be investigated.”


	
	That same day on the Crown’s application a subpoena was issued to the Department of Corrective Services, requiring the production of the applicant’s Justice Health file to the Court. At the resumed hearing on 24 November, the Court’s order had not been complied with, nor had the applicant’s Justice Health file been produced to the Court.
	
	
	The resourcing difficulties with which the Department of Corrective services is currently contending, given record numbers of persons held in custody in NSW, are a matter of common knowledge. Nevertheless, the difficulty with Justice Health’s response to an order of the Court made on a bail application such as this, when a Crown application for an adjournment is granted and the order is made at its request, is patent. So is the problem with the response to the subpoena or rather the failure to respond to the subpoena. Both of these difficulties will be dealt with separately, when Justice Health appears before the Court to explain its failures to obey the Court’s order and the subpoena.
	
	
	At today’s hearing the Crown was not in a position to lead further evidence to respond to the case advanced at the earlier hearing by the applicant. A further adjournment of the release application was sought, in order for evidence to be pursued. The adjournment was opposed. It was not granted. In the circumstances, I was satisfied that the Crown had had a fair opportunity to obtain evidence to meet the case advanced on this application. In the circumstances I was well satisfied that the dictates of justice required the refusal of the adjournment application and the hearing of the bail application to finality today.
	
	
	On all of the evidence, I am satisfied that the applicant has met the obligation to show cause. That was not seriously in issue at the resumed hearing.
	
	
	Despite the seriousness of the offences with which the applicant is charged, the management of her potentially life threatening illness in custody is such that I am satisfied that given the significant further delay before any trial in the District Court, of up to a further year, that the applicant’s continued detention in custody pending the hearing is not justified. That conclusion is reinforced by the evidence before the Court as to the bizarre nature of the alleged offending, on the Crown case, offending in which the applicant was involved while adversely affected by drugs. In her evidence the applicant said that her decision to take drugs was the worst she had made in her life. That recognition, when considered together with the other evidence before the Court as to the conditions under which the applicant is kept during her first time in custody, her limited record of past offending and the stringent conditions which will be imposed on her when released on bail, made the conclusion that the applicant’s further detention prior to trial unjustified, unavoidable.
	
	
	Detention while bail refused, in this case for some 18 months before any trial, ought not give rise to such significant risks to an applicant’s health as have here been established on the evidence this applicant is being subjected to in custody, notwithstanding the seriousness of the charges which she faces and the possibility that a lengthy custodial sentence will be imposed upon her, if she is convicted.
	


Bail concerns and unacceptable risks


	
	That conclusion means that the questions of bail concerns and unacceptable risks must be considered in accordance with the statutory requirements.
	
	
	There was no real issue that the applicant posed the bail concerns identified by the Crown, given the serious offences with which she is charged, involving as they did alleged forced drug taking, serious assaults and threats to the victim’s life.
	
	
	Whether the risks which she poses in relation to those bail concerns were shown not to have been unacceptable ones, was however in issue. They have to be assessed in light of the evidence as to the relevant matters, particularly those specified in s 18.
	
	
	The Crown’s case was that given the strength of the case against the applicant; that her alleged victim was known to her; that she had invited him to the premises where she and the co-accused had subjected him to serious threats, intimidation, assaults, constraint and physical and mental torture, until he was able to escape and contact police, after telling a witness repeatedly that he had been stabbed and that the accused were going to kill him, and that he was found on examination to have been suffering stab wounds to his upper right arm and left elbow, as well as rope burns to his wrists and ankles and swelling to his face, as well as cuts and bruises, it could not be concluded that the risks which the applicant posed were not unacceptable ones.
	
	
	While it was acknowledged that the applicant’s criminal record was short, with no failures to appear, it was submitted that she had a longstanding drug addiction and on the occasion of this offending, had injected herself with an unknown substance, shortly before the events the subject of the charges had unfolded. It was also relevant that she had been on bail in relation to another offence, when those alleged offences were committed. In the result the Court could have no confidence that if released on bail the applicant would either appear, or comply with the other conditions of bail imposed on her.
	
	
	On all that was before the Court, I have concluded that given the nature and seriousness of the applicant’s diabetic illness and what its management requires, which is not being adequately attended to in custody; her personal circumstances, including her need to have access to ongoing, adequate treatment for her serious illness; her need to care for and live for her son; the very long further delay before her trial is heard; the bizarre offences which it is alleged she committed as part of a joint criminal enterprise upon her alleged victim, who on her unchallenged evidence was a former solicitor struck off for his own drug abuse, when she is alleged not only to have herself injected an unidentified drug in a syringe prepared by the victim, but then to have been present while the victim was forced by her co-accused to inject himself with that drug and having done nothing to assist the victim, other than to provide him with a bandage for his cut arm, while he was repeatedly assaulted and threatened with a gun and knives, before being bound so loosely that he was able to untie himself and escape, all the while behaving herself in an entirely irrational way; her very limited record of offending of any kind; her recognition of the very poor decisions which she made when taking the drugs which so adversely affected her; that this is her first time in custody; and the stringent bail conditions which will be imposed upon her to reside with her father, that the applicant does not pose an unacceptable risk in relation to the concerns identified by the Crown as to flight and further serious offending.
	
	
	True it is that the place where she will be bailed to live is where she assaulted her father’s former partner, an assault which resulted in a conviction and a s 9 bond being imposed upon her, it appears at a time when also drug affected. It is relevant that this relationship has ended, and it appears, otherwise on the material before the Court that the residence with her father is an appropriate one.
	
	
	Any grant of bail cannot, of course, be guaranteed to be risk free. On this application, however, I am satisfied in light of all of the matters I have discussed, that the stringent bail conditions which will be imposed on the applicant will mean that the risk which she poses, if released on bail, will not be an unacceptable one.
	


Conditions of bail


	
	The conditions of bail imposed on the applicant are as follows:
	



	
	To be of good behaviour.
	
	
	To live at X XXXX XXXXXXX, XXXXXXXX.
	
	
	To report daily to Newcastle Police Station between the hours of 8am and 6pm.
	
	
	To appear at Newcastle Local Court on 2 December 2015 and thereafter as required.
	
	
	Not to drink alcohol or enter any premises in which alcohol is sold except in the company of her father, Stephen Melmeth or her mother Erica Maree Johnston.
	
	
	Not to take any illegal or prescription drugs (other than a drug prescribed to the applicant by a doctor).
	
	
	To comply with a curfew: the applicant is not to be absent from the address at which she is required to live at XXXXXXXX between the hours of 6pm and 8am except if she is in the company of Stephen Melmeth or Erica Johnston. Otherwise she is not to be absent from that address except in their company, other than to report to police or attend court or to attend pre-arranged conferences with legal representatives or pre-arranged medical appointments.
	
	
	Not to associate or communicate or attempt to communicate by any means (except through her lawyer) with co-accused Greg Fernando.
	
	
	Not to contact, approach, harass or intimidate in any way (including via a third party) her alleged victim whose name is Steven Connelly.
	
	
	Enforcement of curfew: To present herself at the front door at the direction of any police officer to confirm compliance with the curfew condition. Such direction may only be given by a police officer who believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to do so, having regard to the rights of other occupants of the premises to peace and privacy.
	
	
	Enforcement of drug/alcohol abstention condition: To undertake any testing at the direction of any police officer to confirm compliance with the drug/alcohol abstention condition. Such direction may only be given by a police officer who believes on reasonable grounds that the applicant may have consumed drugs/alcohol in breach of the bail acknowledgment. Such testing may only be non-invasive and carried out with respect given to the applicant’s privacy.
	


Note

1    Prior to your release on bail you will have to sign and provide a copy of a bail acknowledgement of this decision to grant bail on the conditions I have explained and comply with all pre-release requirements.

2    If you breach any of the conditions imposed on you, you may be arrested, brought before a court or authorised justice and have your bail revoked.

		25 November 2015",2015-11-23 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2702414,Mikael v Regina [2015] NSWCCA 294,"Judgment


	
	MACFARLAN JA:  I agree with Hall J.
	
	
	HALL J: The appellant, Afif Mikael, was arraigned in the District Court on 29 August 2013 before her Honour Hock DCJ and a jury of twelve in relation to the following counts:
	


Count 1: Supply a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (1848.73 grams) contrary to s 25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985;

In the alternative to count 1:

2 counts of supply methylamphetamine (Counts 2 and 3);

2 counts of supply not less than a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (Counts 4 and 5);

Count 6: Supply a prohibited drug (cocaine 0.72g);

Count 7: Knowingly receive proceeds of crime, namely $6100 (s 193V(2) Crimes Act 1900)


	
	On 10 September 2013, the appellant was found guilty on Counts 1 and 7 and not guilty on Count 6. The trial proceeded over 31 days.
	
	
	The trial before Hock DCJ was the third time that the appellant had stood trial on the charges. The first two trials had been aborted on the application of the appellant due to the necessity for the defence to examine telephone intercepts.
	
	
	On 24 April 2014, the appellant was sentenced to a head sentence of 10 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 6 years 6 months.
	
	
	By Notice of Appeal dated 14 May 2015 and filed on 29 May 2015, the appellant appeals against his conviction only, on a single ground in the following terms:
	


“The trial judge erred in failing to discharge the jury.”


	
	Counsel appearing for the appellant at trial, Mr Thomas, commenced his closing address to the jury at 3:30pm on Thursday, 29 August 2013. His address continued the next morning and finished at 11:30am on 30 August 2013.
	
	
	Shortly after the morning tea break, a jury note was given to the trial judge. It was in the following terms:
	


“We have noticed in the defence closing statement two men entered the court room and the youngest was on his phone. Five of us saw a flash from his phone which was facing the jury. We would like to know if it was a photo taken. Can we ask no phones to be visible or used in the court room for our privacy. Thank you.”


	
	The trial judge discussed the note with counsel for the appellant and the Crown. Mr Thomas informed her Honour that the two men referred to in the jury note were Elias Matouk, solicitor, and a person in Mr Matouk’s company or employment. The phone in fact belonged to Mr Matouk’s associate. Mr Matouk was not the solicitor for the appellant at trial. Mr Thomas told her Honour that the flashes occurred when the mobile phone received a message. Her Honour then recalled the jury and directed them as follows:
	


“… the enquiries that I have been able to make so far reveal that one of the gentlemen is a solicitor of this court. I am told that the modern phone applications often flash when a message is received.

The phone should not have been on in court but I am reasonably confident that no photograph was taken, but when you are sent home for the day, I am going to have the solicitor contacted and make some further enquiries about the matter because it simply just should not happen. Now I am hoping that will set our minds at rest over the weekend and I will give you more information about that on Monday.

At this stage I can commence the summing up and I think unless any of you indicate that you’d rather just go now for the day, if you are concerned. Do you want to go outside and think about it or are you happy for me to go on? And, as I say, I can only assure you so far my enquiries reveal to date, no photograph has been taken of you and I will certainly be making those enquiries of the solicitor who of course will know who the gentleman was with him, the younger gentleman.”


	
	Following this direction the jury indicated to her Honour that it wished for her to proceed. Her Honour then commenced the Summing Up.
	
	
	Shortly before the luncheon adjournment the trial judge heard evidence from Mr Elias Matouk. He told her Honour that the other man was undertaking work experience and was a university student named James Ghafari. The court sheriff examined the phone and confirmed that no photographs had been taken. Mr Thomas asked the trial judge to contact the jurors to tell them that no photographs had been taken, which her Honour declined to do. Her Honour in that respect observed:
	


“I rather feel that if the members of the jury got a message from the sheriff they might be even more worried this afternoon. They didn’t seem particularly troubled once I assured them that our inquiries revealed that it was a solicitor sitting at the back of the Court. And when I asked them whether they would like me to commence the Summing Up or defer it, they all wanted me to commence. So I don’t believe that they’re particularly troubled, but I understand your sensitivity to it.”


	
	On the morning of Monday, 2 September 2013, Mr Thomas applied to have the jury discharged. The transcript records in that respect, that the application was made:
	


“… on the basis that the only rational inference that could have been drawn from the event is they considered to be the taking of a photograph would be to drive that action home to the accused as being in some way, some material and relevant way, connected with the action that had taken place in Court… The only rational and irresistible inference in my submission is that the photographer acted in some way as an agent of the accused.”


	
	Following the application, her Honour addressed the jury about the flashing phone. She told them that the young man with the phone was a law student doing work experience with a solicitor and that his phone flashed when it received messages. She told the jury that the sheriff had examined the phone and that there were no photographs taken on it. Her Honour told the jury that the young man and the solicitor had apologised to the Court and that they had no connection with the accused.
	
	
	Her Honour thereafter proceeded to send the jury out to decide whether they had any further questions, and asked whether they would like a break or for her Honour to continue the Summing Up. The jury confirmed that they wished her Honour to continue. Her Honour subsequently refused the application to discharge the jury and gave reasons as follows:
	


“I will formally record that I declined to discharge the jury on the basis that in my view there is no prejudice to the accused from the incident on Friday afternoon, given what has been said to the jury today, and also from the fact that the jury had no further request for information or concern when they were specifically invited to raise any further matters with me this morning. They were sent out but they came straight back into court and did not send a note. Of course the fact is that this is [the] third trial.

This incident occurred at the end of the case in counsel for the accused’s address but my observation was that all the members of the jury were paying close attention to counsel for the accused address which I might say was very colourful. I am not surprised that they were paying close attention to it, Mr Thomas.”


	
	The jury retired to consider its verdict before morning tea on 2 September 2013. Later that day they requested the transcript of a witness’s evidence. The jury continued its deliberations all day on 3 September 2013 and on 4 September 2013 asked for the transcript of another witness’s evidence. A little later, the jury sent a jury note in these terms:
	


“We would like the transcript of your Honour’s closing statement. Same too for Mr Thomas, his closing statement owing to potential distraction of the phone flash to five jurors.”


	
	The jury were then provided with the closing addresses for both the defence and the Crown.
	
	
	No further application to discharge the jury was made.
	
	
	The jury continued its deliberations the rest of that day and the following three days.
	
	
	On 10 September 2013 (the eighth day of the jury’s deliberations) the jury indicated that they had reached a unanimous verdict on all but one of the counts. A direction was given in accordance with Black v R (1993) 179 CLR 44. Later that morning the jury reiterated that it was hung on one count. Her Honour then gave a majority verdict direction. A few hours later the jury returned verdicts of guilty to Count 1 and Count 7 and not guilty to Count 6.
	


Submissions for the Appellant


	
	In the written submissions for the appellant dated 21 May 2015, the incident was described at [9]. In that paragraph it was stated that the student who was in the company of Mr Matouk when the incident occurred, contrary to regulations and signs that have been posted throughout the court building, took several phone calls and received several text messages after he entered the courtroom and while Mr Thomas was addressing the jury. Further, it was said that at least four text messages were received and his phone emitted numerous white flashing lights while it was pointed in the direction of the jury. The submissions continued:
	


“… Not surprisingly, several (five, it turned out) members of the jury thought that they were being photographed as they sat there attempting to hear the address from Mr Thomas. They were intimidated enough by this to fashion a note and they gave it to the trial judge.” (Appellant’s Submissions at [9])


	
	In written submissions Mr MA Robinson SC, on behalf of the appellant, supported the ground of appeal in the following terms:
	


“… Her Honour erred in that she failed to have regard or proper regard to the effect that the incident had or would have had on the jury, the intimidation they felt and the interruption to the jury being able to hear and/or understand the submissions of the applicant’s counsel. Her Honour wrongly determined that there was no prejudice to the appellant, when there plainly was. She wrongly founded her decision on whether the jury took it upon themselves to write her a note, which (at that stage) they had not done. This was an irrelevant consideration as there were many reasons why the jury might not have sent the Judge a note as to the incident."" (Appellant’s Submissions at [3])


	
	It was submitted that the trial judge had erred in law and that the conviction should be set aside.
	
	
	It was also contended on behalf of the appellant that her Honour wrongly failed to discharge the jury two days after the incident occurred in court and while the jury was deliberating on 4 September 2013. On that date, as noted above, the jury handed her Honour a note which specifically asked for copies of the transcript of the closing statement of counsel for the appellant “owing to potential distraction of the phone flash to five jurors”: Appellant’s Submissions at [5]. It was argued that it should have been apparent to the learned trial judge at that point that at least five members of the jury were in fact distracted significantly by the incident in court and that they missed a part of the defence closing arguments. It was further argued that her Honour wrongly failed to discharge the jury at that point.
	
	
	It was noted that her Honour had been satisfied that the two men involved in the incident were telling the truth, after having the phone inspected for photographs by the court sheriff. Inspection confirmed the operation of the flashing when a text is received while the phone was in the locked position. Her Honour considered the situation could be satisfactorily explained to the jury and that she did not need to discharge the jury.
	
	
	In the appellant’s submissions, it was noted that the security and safety of a jury is a paramount consideration. It was argued that the sanctity of the jury is a fundamental feature of the criminal justice system and once breached the jury should have been discharged: Submissions at [14].
	
	
	Reference was made in the appellant’s submissions to a number of case law authorities. There is authority for the proposition that no rigid rule can be adopted to govern decisions on an application to discharge a jury for an inadvertent and potentially prejudicial event that occurs during a trial. See, in particular, Crofts v R (1996) 186 CLR 427 at 440.
	
	
	Where inadvertent and potentially prejudicial events have occurred, the High Court in Crofts at [440] stated that relevant considerations will include the seriousness of the occurrence in the context of the contested issues, the stage at which the mishap occurs, the deliberateness of the conduct, as well as the likely effectiveness of a judicial direction designed to overcome its apprehended impact.
	
	
	In the course of submissions, reference was also made to the High Court’s decision in Webb & Hay v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 41, and in particular to the statements of Mason CJ and McHugh J at 53.
	
	
	It was noted that the applicable test is an objective one and does not depend upon the actual effect that the incident might have had upon the jury in question: R v Pearson (2000) 114 A Crim R 80 per Foster AJA at [32].
	
	
	Finally, emphasis was given to the fact that the jury note which was given to the trial judge on 4 September 2013 referred to the fact that transcript of the closing address of Mr Thomas was requested “owing to potential distraction of the phone flash to five jurors” on the basis of this “new information”. It was contended that it should have been apparent to the trial judge that, notwithstanding the evidence she had collected from the solicitor and the law student and the explanation that she had given to the jurors, at least five members of the jury had in fact been distracted significantly by the phone flash incident and arguably as a result had missed part of or missed entirely the defence closing arguments.
	
	
	It was contended that her Honour was wrong in law in responding by simply providing copies of the transcript of the defence and Crown closing addresses: Appellant’s Submissions at [19] and [20]. It was submitted that the foundation for the earlier reasoning had “fallen away” by that stage. The jury, it was argued, had itself now plainly indicated that it had been distracted during the course of the final address for the appellant.
	
	
	It was contended that the conviction should be set aside on the ground of appeal relied upon.
	


Submissions for the Crown


	
	The Crown in its written submissions also referred to relevant case law authorities including, in particular, the test as set out by the High Court in Webb & Hay v The Queen, supra, at 53 (Mason CJ and McHugh J). In summary, the Crown relied upon the following matters:
	



	
	An application for the discharge of a jury is pre-eminently a decision made in the exercise of a trial judge’s discretion.
	
	
	The test to be applied in determining whether an irregular incident involving a juror warrants or warranted the discharge of the juror, or in some cases the jury, is whether the incident is such that notwithstanding the proposed or actual warning of the trial judge, it gives rise to a reasonable apprehension or suspicion on the part of the fair-minded or informed member of the public that the jury or juror has not discharged or will not discharge its task impartially: Webb & Hay v R, supra, at [53].
	
	
	The jury should not be discharged unless there is a high degree of need: Crofts v R at 432.
	



	
	The Crown set out a number of submissions in relation to the application of the relevant principles in its written submissions at [20]-[26].
	
	
	The Crown contended that her Honour’s address to the jury was effective and in particular was appropriate to assuage any concerns the jurors may have had. It explained that the persons involved were a solicitor and a law student, not associated with the accused, and that no photographs had been taken.
	
	
	The jury did not request any further information or express further concern. Nor did they wish to adjourn. There was nothing that would raise a concern, apprehension or suspicion on the part of the fair-minded or informed member of the public that the jury would not discharge its task impartially: Crown Submissions at [21].
	
	
	Further, after the jury sent the further note concerning potential distraction (MFI 99) there was no application at that stage to discharge the jury that was extant. The earlier application had been dismissed and no further application had been made.
	
	
	It was submitted that there was no further application made because the atmosphere of the trial, as it appeared to trial counsel, did not indicate any concern on the part of the jury.
	
	
	Provision of the transcript to the jury, in the Crown’s submission, no doubt provided a resolution of any concern that there had been of any distraction by the incident: Crown Submissions at [22].
	
	
	Reliance was placed upon the observations in Lyndon v R [2014] NSWCCA 112 by Basten JA. In that case no objection was taken to the prosecutor’s closing address. However, on appeal it was argued that the address had caused the trial to miscarry. The relevant observations made by his Honour at [29], related to the operation of Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. His Honour indicated that the principle underlying Rule 4 can apply in relation to the question of a discharge of the jury. The principle imposed on both parties, as well as the court, obligations with respect to the running of a trial before a jury.
	
	
	The Crown further submitted that the information placed before the trial judge went no further than to suggest that a juror or some jurors were “potentially distracted” by the incident. The note, however, did not suggest an inability on the part of the jury to properly and impartially perform their duty. It was also submitted that the directions of the trial judge were sufficient to address any perceived risk: Crown Submissions at [24].
	
	
	The Crown additionally submitted that the jury note did not indicate any anxiety or inattention on the part of the jury at a level that attracted the principles enunciated in Webb & Hay v R: Crown Submissions at [25].
	
	
	In all the circumstances, including the trial directions, the Court would conclude that a fair-minded and informed observer would not have a reasonable apprehension of a lack of impartiality on the part of the jury: Crown Submissions at [26]. 
	


Principles


	
	Whether or not a jury should be discharged by reason of some incident which occurs during the course of a trial is a matter within the trial judge’s discretion: Crofts v R, supra, at 432 per Dawson J.
	
	
	The discretion is one to be exercised in favour of a discharge only when that course is necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice. It is in that sense that it has been said that the underlying principle is that of necessity and that “a high degree of need for such discharge” must appear before a discharge will be ordered: Crofts v R, supra, at 432.
	
	
	When a trial judge’s refusal to discharge a jury is called in question, it must be borne in mind that he or she is ordinarily in a better position than an appeal court to assess whether, having regard to the course which the trial has taken, and the atmosphere in which it has been conducted, any prejudice may be dispelled by a clear warning to the jury: Crofts v R, supra, at 432.
	
	
	No rigid rule can be adopted to govern decisions on an application to discharge a jury for an inadvertent and potentially prejudicial event that occurs during a trial: Crofts v R per Toohey, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ at 440.
	
	
	Much depends upon the seriousness of the occurrence in the context of the contested issues; the state at which the mishap occurs; the deliberateness of the conduct; and the likely effectiveness of a judicial direction designed to overcome its apprehended impact: Crofts v R, per Toohey, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ at 440.
	



	
	The duty of the appellate court, where the exercise of discretion to refuse a discharge is challenged, is not confined to examining the reasons given for the order but also requires it to ensure that the correct principles are kept in mind. An appellate court must also decide for itself whether the result of the refusal to discharge the jury occasioned the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice.
	


Conclusions


	
	The essential argument on behalf of the appellant was that the incident in question resulted in a prejudice to the accused arising from:
	



	
	The effect that the incident was said to have had or would have had on the jury;
	
	
	The alleged intimidation that the jurors felt; and
	
	
	The interruption caused by the incident interfering with the jurors’ ability to hear and/or understand the submissions of the appellant’s counsel.
	



	
	On the above basis the ground of appeal asserts that by reason of the fact that there was prejudice resulting to the appellant, the trial judge was in error in finding that there was in fact no prejudice to the accused.
	
	
	It is clear on the evidence that the phone flashes occupied fractions of a second or at most a few seconds in time, and though this may have occasioned momentary distraction in some of the jurors, there is no basis for a finding or conclusion that such jurors missed, either entirely or in part, the arguments presented in the closing address at the time of the incident.
	
	
	The trial judge’s judgment on the application for discharge (2 September 2013) contained an observation which suggests that there was minimal, if any, distraction to the jurors (see quote at [13] above).
	
	
	The evidence disclosed that the trial judge provided the jury with a full explanation as to the circumstances in which the phone flashes occurred (resulting from the operation of the flashing device when a text was received while the phone was in a locked position). The initial concern of the jurors was that they had been photographed. That concern was effectively dispelled by the explanation given by her Honour which assured the jurors that no photographs had in fact been taken. There was no basis for a conclusion of prejudice arising in these circumstances.
	
	
	The steps taken by the trial judge to investigate and deal with the jury note reporting the phone flashes were appropriate and effective in meeting and satisfying the concerns expressed and/or associated with the jury note.
	
	
	The provision of copies of the closing address of the Crown Prosecutor and the closing address by defence counsel, met any concern that any jurors may have momentarily missed hearing something said by defence counsel if distracted by the phone flashes. The provision of the transcripts of the closing addresses ensured that the jurors had available to them a record of the entirety of defence counsel’s address, thereby enabling any juror to be informed of any or all aspects of the defence closing address and the Crown’s closing address.
	
	
	At the time the application for the discharge of the jury was made there was no basis upon which a conclusion could be reached that there was a risk that the jury would not perform its duty to determine the issues in the case impartially. The detailed explanation given by the trial judge concerning the incident was not followed by any further request by the jury for information, or by any expression of concern even though they had been invited to make any further comment.
	
	
	Contrary to the submissions made on behalf of the appellant:
	



	
	The finding by the trial judge that there was no prejudice by the event involving the flashing mobile phone was soundly based.
	
	
	There was no error of fact or law in the trial judge’s decision to decline the application for a discharge of the jury.
	
	
	There was no substance to the basis upon which that application was made.
	
	
	The argument on behalf of the appellant, namely that jurors were distracted by the flashing from the phone such as to require the jury to be discharged, is without substance or merit. No such suggestion was made by counsel who appeared for the appellant at trial.
	



	
	I proposed the following order:
	


The appeal be dismissed.


	
	BELLEW J: I agree with Hall J.

2702422,Jacob PLUM v R (No 1) [2015] NSWDC 405,"Judgment


	
	District Court Judges hear appeals from magistrates. That includes Children’s Court magistrates. I am hearing one of those appeals. The appeal is by a young man named Jacob Plum [a pseudonym]. He is now fifteen. He has been before the Children’s Court here in Orange a number of times. He has been given good behaviour bonds but breached them. In the end the Children’s Court magistrate cancelled the bonds and sentenced young Jacob Plum to the equivalent for a juvenile of gaol. That is called a control order.
	
	
	The magistrate gave him a twelve month control order and fixed a non-parole period - during which Jacob cannot be released - of six months. The control order started on 31 October 2015 - just a few weeks ago - and the non-parole period therefore will not expire for another six months. That will happen on 30 May 2016.
	
	
	Jacob Plum, through his lawyer Ms R Pettet, has appealed against the sentence. Ms Pettet says on behalf of Jacob Plum that although the sentence itself of twelve months is understandable, there is a good argument for reducing the non-parole period from six months to something less than that so that her client can be released sooner.
	
	
	Ms Pettet called witnesses in the appeal, namely her client, Jacob Plum, his mother and a Juvenile Justice officer, Ms Roberts.
	
	
	Before saying what I propose to do with this appeal, it is important for a judge to set out just why a person has been sent to gaol or in this case a juvenile detention centre.
	
	
	Jacob Plum’s behaviour over the last 18 months or so has been more than a little out of control. The charges that he faced in the Children’s Court and which the magistrate sentenced him for started off with an aggravated break and enter into a vacant house. That happened on 8 January 2014. He and his companions also damaged the house. So the first of the two charges is aggravated break and enter. That is a serious crime. The Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) makes it an offence by s 112(2) and the damage to property is an offence against the same Crimes Act but s 195(1).
	
	
	Jacob Plum and some of his mates broke into a house in South Terrace here in Orange. It was vacant. It belonged to the Department of Housing. Once they were inside they broke the rear window and damaged some other things inside including a CCTV camera. That was all on 8 January 2014.
	
	
	Then, only a couple of months later, Jacob Plum was in trouble again. This time it involved school. It happened on 14 March 2014. He was a pupil at [school]. That is a school which caters for children with particular issues. He went to school that morning and the programme involved them working on another campus of the school - at a farm. Jacob started damaging some netting and he was told to stop. He ignored this and was told that he was going to be sent home. Then the principal was called. Jacob Plum got angry and yelled at both the principal and the other teacher in very abusive language. He was told to calm down and he became even more abusive, threatening to kick the principal. That verbal abuse was so serious that Jacob Plum was charged with a crime called intimidating a member of school staff. That is also a crime in the Crimes Act, s 60E(1).
	
	
	After threatening the school staff he picked up a timber plank and began hitting the building. That did not cause much damage, so he went around to another part of the building and started to smash a window. He bashed a colour bond gate. The school went into lockdown. He kicked the gate over. He was told to leave. He yelled at the principal again. He pulled off three grates and used them to smash every panel of the colour bond fence. Again he was charged with reckless damage to property which, as I said, is a Crimes Act offence against s 195(1).
	
	
	Jacob Plum stayed out of trouble for another six months or so, but then on 14 December 2014 he was at home and smashed his bedroom windows. He also stabbed a photograph of his own mother with a large knife. He went outside, picked up a brick and threw it into a house window. He threw more bricks into the windows. Again he was charged with the damage to the property.
	
	
	Again he stayed out of trouble for a few months but things deteriorated again earlier this year on 27 March. He had an argument with his older brother who was living at home. He smashed up his own room with a golf club. It put several holes in the wall of his bedroom. He went into the hallway and bashed a hole in the hallway. The police were called, and he abused them. In fact his mother was at home and in that behaviour he breached an apprehended personal violence order which she had against him.
	
	
	So on that occasion he was charged not only with the usual damaging property offence but another crime called knowingly contravening a prohibition in an apprehended violence order. That is where someone breaches the order. That is an offence against s 14(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 (NSW). It too is a serious offence.
	
	
	Again he was charged with an offence which occurred a few days later on 31 March 2015 - intentionally damaging property.
	
	
	So Jacob Plum had accumulated quite a few charges against him. For the offences earlier last year he came before the Children’s Court and got the benefit of a good behaviour bond. But then he breached the bond by November that year and came back before the Children’s Court but by that stage, he had also further breached the bond by the damage caused by his activity in December that year at home.
	
	
	In the meantime he came before the court for the fresh charges of what he had done at home. That was not until August this year. He pleaded guilty to the charges on 10 August and was given a control order but the Children’s Court magistrate suspended the control order. But then by a couple of months later he had not complied with the good behaviour bond that goes along with a suspension and so again there was an application to cancel the good behaviour bond and the suspended sentence. In the end the Children’s Court magistrate was left very little choice but to impose the sentences which the magistrate did.
	
	
	In fact, on one view of things the magistrate was pretty lenient with Jacob Plum. I say this because for all of these offences (and there are eight of them) the magistrate gave him only one sentence. That was the twelve months with the non-parole period of six months. One would normally expect a number of sentences for all of those offences because some of the victims were different. The sentences would sometimes overlap, or be back to back. But what the magistrate did was to roll them all up into one sentence so, as I said, it seems to me that he did pretty well in the sentence that he got.
	
	
	One often thinks in a case like this, why would a person appeal? But as I said, Ms Pettet has made out an argument for the appeal, not saying that the main sentence was out of order but that he should be given an opportunity to be released earlier.
	
	
	The documents before me - which include exhibit A from the prosecution - include a number of juvenile justice reports. They are always very helpful and this case is the same. They contain very helpful insights and information about a young offender. Jacob Plum has not been cooperating with the good behaviour bonds and the various ways that the court has been trying to get him to settle down. That is why in the end the magistrate had to effectively lock him up. Time and time again the juvenile justice reports say that he was not complying with the orders.
	
	
	There’s a helpful report from a Dr Paul Bloomfield who works at the Orange Paediatric Clinic. He has diagnosed Jacob Plum with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder as well as oppositional defiant disorder. As the doctor pointed out, it has caused problems with schooling and the authorities. It looks as though the doctor has an interest in Jacob Plum and the doctor commenced him on a medication called Concerta back in April last year.
	
	
	When Ms Pettet called her client Jacob Plum to give evidence he told me some of his background story. He is one of four boys. He is the third one. He has got a little brother who is four. He and his little brother live with their mother here in Orange. He remembers there being domestics between his mum and his stepfather and he thinks his stepfather is in a correctional centre at the moment. He is close to his grandmother, but she lives in Walgett. Also she is not well. He wants to be able to see his grandmother again sooner rather than later.
	
	
	Jacob Plum is doing year nine whilst he is in Orana Juvenile Detention Centre and he said it is better than the special school that he was at before. The plan is, he said, that his mother would like to go back to Walgett to be near his grandmother. He had an aunt looking after his grandmother, but sadly she died. But of course he is in custody at least until 30 May next year.
	
	
	He says at school he is getting back to reading and writing and he says that is important to him. He knows that the medication will help him to concentrate at school. He says that if he was released he would be more compliant this time and comply with the Juvenile Justice people.
	
	
	Jacob Plum broke down in court when he was talking about his mother. It seems to me that he has really come to appreciate how much his mother supports him and how much grief he is causing her. As he said in court, she has his best interests at heart and she has done everything for him. In fact he described her as a beautiful mum. He acknowledged that he had been stressed and was giving her a hard time.
	
	
	In cross examination by Ms K O’Keeffe who appears for the respondent to the appeal who is the Director of Public Prosecutions, he acknowledged that he needs to talk to people when he feels stressed. And he said that he had learnt some lessons about dealing with stress such as deep breathing. He wants to do his best at school and improve his education. If school does not work he would be prepared to do TAFE.
	
	
	Ms Pettet called Sonia Plum [another pseudonym], who is Jacob’s mother. She explained how she would like to go back to Walgett and would like to take Jacob with her. It is apparently a four hour drive between here and Walgett. She said her mother is really sick and she would like to have Jacob up there with her. She proved that she is a good mother by saying that she would do anything for her kids and she would back him. She said that her children should be with her. She has got the papers for an application to [a new school] and they are prepared to give him a go and she would back him and help him with his medication and she knows that he needs a counsellor.
	
	
	Ms Plum wants to keep Dr Bloomfield as his doctor and would travel back to Orange to do that. She knows that getting him back to school is very important. She actually said that Jacob seems a bit more settled and mature now, more so than he used to be.
	
	
	The Juvenile Justice officer was Naomi Roberts. Her evidence was very impressive and very helpful. She acknowledged that it was a difficult case. Jacob seems to get into trouble when he is with his mates. He seemed to put them above his family and the community. She said she had not seen him upset before like he got upset in court and that he is showing a bit more empathy towards his mother. She thinks that he is quite bright and has a lot of potential. The trouble is he has made poor decisions. Juvenile Justice would be able to do home visits at Walgett, even though they come from Bourke to do that and they would provide some transport.
	
	
	All that evidence was given last Friday on 20 November 2015. I adjourned the case to today because I wanted to obtain some more information. Ms Pettet, as I said, suggested that he be released sooner rather than later. I was not convinced of that and nor was Ms O’Keeffe.
	
	
	So the case came back before me today and Ms Pettet called Naomi Roberts again. She has been on the job since last Friday. She has spoken to the principal at Walgett. They need to get a special grant because of Jacob’s special needs and they need to put in an application. The last opportunity has just passed so it will need to happen early next year. The grant would be to have him get special support at school. The school is prepared to take him on but needs to sort out this sort of thing.
	
	
	Ms Roberts said that Jacob has just started back on the Concerta medication. I did not say that before - he has stopped and started on that - but he is back on it, and the doctors want to see how he goes on it. That usually takes about four or six weeks and then they see how he is going. The idea is that it should help him settle in class and concentrate more. But it also would help him it seems with his general behaviour and outlook.
	
	
	There is a good Aboriginal Medical Service in Walgett where there is a psychiatrist and a paediatrician and a counsellor. There are a couple of very good supportive programmes. One is run by the PCYC, another is run by Mission Australia. They seem to offer very good opportunities for somebody like Jacob Plum.    
	
	
	Ms Pettet asked Ms Roberts whether perhaps day leave might be allowed for him to see his grandmother. The answer was no because his classification is not low enough for that. He has apparently been misbehaving in custody recently. He was throwing rocks at staff and ignoring directions and using bad language and even used some graffiti. But Juvenile Justice persevere in trying to get him to comply and to help him at the school there and his classes at Orana in juvenile detention. She hopes that he will settle down and realise what the consequences of his behaviour are.
	
	
	Ms O’Keeffe asked whether these PCYC and Mission Australia programmes were available in Orange. They are but he did not go along and in re-examination Ms Pettet asked about making attendance at those courses in Walgett a condition of parole. There are counsellors available in juvenile detention and including qualified psychologists. Jacob has got himself talking to one of those psychologists about anger management. He is allowed to see that psychologist at any time.
	
	
	Ms Pettet said to me today that she knows that her client really would like to get out today so that he can be at home for Christmas but she acknowledged fairly and reasonably that that is not likely. She is right about that. She wondered whether he could be released just in time for Christmas so that he could be there for Christmas and spend the summer in Walgett until he goes back to school in mid to late February. It would give him time to take his medication.
	
	
	Ms O’Keeffe on the other hand, whilst acknowledging the importance of rehabilitation, pointed out that some of his offences - the property damage offences - were quite serious. She said that they were at the higher end. Some of them were committed in the home of the victim. That is true. He committed these offences in his mother’s home, which was his own home. He used a weapon such as a golf club. Things got out of control fairly quickly. Of course the break and enter was a very serious offence.
	
	
	Some of his misbehaviour in custody has been very recent, like only a few days ago. Ms O’Keeffe correctly pointed out the concern which the community would have about him re-offending if I let him out too soon, acknowledging, again, that age and rehabilitation were in his favour. She also acknowledged, fairly, that he was obviously remorseful.
	
	
	What I have decided to do after hearing these arguments, is this. I think to let him out now is not acceptable. He is still misbehaving and he still needs to spend time in custody for what he did. But I also think letting him out by Christmas would be too early. I do not think there would be time for the medication to work and also I am not yet convinced that he will toe the line. I think he will. He is well intentioned, but something happens to him and he goes off and misbehaves again.
	
	
	I might say I am impressed by him as a witness. He gave very impressive evidence and is obviously very upset at his own behaviour. But he needs a lot of support and I think he needs more of this support and also, as Ms O’Keeffe said, to spend more time in custody because of this spate of serious offences that he has committed. Not only one or two, but eight separate crimes.
	
	
	So what I did this morning (and I am just giving my reasons for making this decision) is that I have decided to adjourn the appeal until 22 January next year. On that day I will get an up to date report on how Jacob has been going on his medication, and if it looks as though he has been behaving himself reasonably well and has been settling down in custody, then I would be inclined to reduce the non-parole period so that he can get out in February some time in order to hopefully start at [the new school]. I might, as Ms Pettet said, let him out a few days earlier than the start of school so that he can settle in with his mother at Walgett and hopefully his grandmother. But I do think for the reasons that I have given that it is too early to release him now.
	
	
	So the order which I make now, officially, is that I adjourn this appeal to 22 January 2016.
	


HIS HONOUR: I assume bail is not applied for? No.


	
	Bail is not applied for and refused.
	


HIS HONOUR: Now should I get an up to date Juvenile Justice report?

PETTET: Yes I think so your Honour because I don’t think Ms Roberts will be able to attend because it won’t be here.


	
	I direct an up to date Juvenile Justice report to be prepared and made available to the court on or before 20 January 2016.

2702424,R v Breen [2015] NSWSC 1757,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	On 12 June 2015 Corey Alan Breen pleaded guilty on indictment to the following two charges: first, that on 29 March 2013 he murdered Paul Edward Breen; secondly, that on the same date he murdered Felicia Crawford. In addition, pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999 (“the Act”) the Court has been asked to take into account a total of nine further offences (“the Form 1 offences”) when sentencing the offender for the first of the principal offences. All the Form 1 offences were committed on 29 March 2013, and are connected with the principal offences in a manner which I will describe later. It is accordingly appropriate that I should take them into account on sentence.
	


Background of the Offences


	
	The following accounts of the offender’s background and the events of 29 March 2013 are taken from the Agreed Facts which were tendered by the Crown on sentence.
	
	
	The first victim, Paul Breen, was the offender’s father. The offender, who was born on 15 August 1986, was the oldest of three children born to Paul and Debra Breen. His parents separated in about 1994, and Paul Breen later commenced a relationship with the second victim, Felicia Crawford. In 2001 they had a son, Dane. They later terminated their relationship, and in 2005 Ms Crawford had a daughter, Rachael, to another man. Later again, Paul Breen and Ms Crawford recommenced their relationship. They were living together at Killarney Heights with the two children, Dane and Rachael, at the time of these offences. Mr Breen was 54 years old when he met his untimely death, and Ms Crawford was 45.
	
	
	It seems that Paul Breen had a difficult past. He had had a gambling problem and had been an alcoholic, although for 10 years before his death he had been going to Alcoholics Anonymous and had apparently been sober. He also had a history of violence towards his partners and children, including the offender.
	
	
	The offender himself was working as a security guard until 2010. In September of that year he was convicted in the Gosford Local Court of assault occasioning actual bodily harm for an assault he committed in July 2009 while he was at work. As a result of this conviction he lost his security licence and suffered financial hardship. He perceived that his family did not support him through this case, and he made threats to kill various members of his family, including his grandfather, Colin Breen, and his sister Ashleigh Breen.
	
	
	At that time, September 2010, the offender was living with his father and stepmother, the two victims of these offences, at their home in Playford Road Killarney Heights. A few months earlier he had met Cassandra Fenech and they commenced a relationship. In 2011 he left his father’s home and moved into Ms Fenech’s home in Gorokan. He became estranged from all members of his family, and told Ms Fenech that he blamed his father for everything that had gone wrong in his life.
	
	
	In February 2012, after the offender had displayed worrying signs of anger, Ms Fenech drove him to Wyong Hospital where he was assessed. No acute mental health issues were discerned, nor was he diagnosed as suffering from psychosis or depression. A long history of difficulty in controlling his temper and having violent outbursts was noted, which the offender attributed to his dysfunctional upbringing. He expressed feelings of hate and anger towards his parents.
	
	
	The offender was still living with Ms Fenech on 29 March 2013 when the present offences were committed.
	


Events of 29 March 2013


	
	29 March 2013 was Good Friday. In the late afternoon of that day the offender and Ms Fenech had a number of friends around to their home in Gorokan. Most of them, including the offender, were drinking alcohol. At about 6.00pm the offender and Ms Fenech had a disagreement, following which the offender assaulted her several times. This assault on Ms Fenech comprises the first of seven back up offences which are to be dismissed pursuant to s 167 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1986.
	
	
	At one point the offender armed himself with a large hunting knife. The blade was 19cm long and came to a sharp point at the end. In addition, he took out and assembled a rifle which he had been keeping in a plastic case. He walked to his car with the weapons, and then went back inside the house when he realised that he had no ammunition for the rifle. While he was inside Ms Fenech took the keys from the car. She also removed two spark plug leads, rendering the car unusable. In addition, one of the guests in the house took the rifle from the offender and then concealed it.
	
	
	At that point the offender left the house carrying the knife. He was trying to obtain a motor vehicle, and for that purpose he struck the window of an unattended parked car with the hunting knife, damaging but not breaking it. This constituted another of the back-up offences. More significantly, the offender started walking along the roadway in Dudley Street, wielding the knife. Ms Gabriala Virgona was driving along the road in the same direction as the offender. She stopped a few metres behind him, and he turned around and ran at her, holding the knife over his shoulder. She reversed her car, and ended up colliding with a car driven by Keith Bowden, who was on his way home from work. The offender then ran up to Mr Bowden’s car and stabbed him through the open window to the right side of his face. This caused a significant facial laceration, as a result of which Mr Bowden required emergency treatment at the John Hunter Hospital in Newcastle. The armed assault on Ms Virgona and the assault and wounding of Mr Bowden constitute two of the Form 1 offences which are to be taken into account under s 33 of the Act.
	
	
	Shortly afterwards the offender stole a lady’s bicycle and rode it to the Lucky 7 Convenience Store at Gorokan, hoping to obtain a motor vehicle. He arrived at about 7.10pm. Mr Peter Romanos was sitting outside the store waiting for his takeaway meal. His girlfriend’s car, which he had driven to the store, was the only vehicle there. The offender lunged with the knife at Mr Romanos, first towards his stomach and then towards his thigh. The knife penetrated his shorts but did not touch his skin. Mr Romanos then ran into the shop, followed by the offender, who was calling out “Give me your keys”. The armed assault and attempted robbery of Mr Romanos is one of the offences to be taken into account on sentence.
	
	
	One of the guests who had been at their home earlier that evening had observed some of these assaults. He went back and collected Ms Fenech, and the two of them went in search of the offender so that Ms Fenech could try to calm him down. They found him at the Lucky 7 store, where Ms Fenech ran inside calling out “Stop”. The offender then hit her in the right forearm, causing her to fall against a brick wall. This assault constituted another of the back-up offences.
	
	
	A nearby resident, Nicole Duncan, came to the shop to see what the noise was about. She saw the offender’s assault on Ms Fenech, and asked him: “Was that necessary?” In response he verbally abused her, punched her in the head and swung the knife in her direction. She suffered from headaches for a few days, but then made a full recovery. This assault occasioning actual bodily harm constituted yet another of the back-up offences.
	
	
	At that point the offender resumed his attempt to obtain Mr Romanos’ car keys. He chased him around the store, yelling “Give me your fucking keys!” Mr Romanos was pushing shelves of food stock towards the offender in order to stop him, and the offender was also pushing shelves over in an endeavour to get to Mr Romanos. After this had happened for a while Mr Romanos ran through the staff door in an attempt to escape the offender. The door had no locking mechanism, so Mr Romanos had to use all his strength to hold it shut. The offender was trying to push it open. He was shouting “Open the door!” and was stabbing at the door with his knife.
	
	
	Considerable damage was done to the Lucky 7 store, leading to another of the back-up offences.
	
	
	At 7.20pm the offender sent Cassandra Fenech’s mother a text message saying “Ur dead u filthy cunt”.
	
	
	At about this time the offender left the Lucky 7 store and rode the same bike to an address in Merrendale Street Gorokan. He knocked on the front door, professing to be from the Red Cross. The female occupant realised that something was wrong so she rang both her husband and her brother-in-law, asking them to come to the house. Her brother-in-law, Ben Greenland, who lived nearby, immediately drove his utility vehicle to the house. He parked in the driveway and walked towards the house, calling out to the occupant. The offender then approached Mr Greenland, with the knife raised and pointed at him, and said “Give me your keys”. Mr Greenland did so and the offender got into the utility and drove away. The armed robbery of Mr Greenland constitutes one of the offences to be taken into account on sentence.
	
	
	Mr Greenland and the occupant of the house immediately contacted the police, who were already searching for the offender.
	
	
	The offender then drove Mr Greenland’s utility to a house in Thelma Street, Long Jetty, where his paternal grandparents, Colin and Norma Breen, lived. He was intending at the time to murder them. He was already in their rear yard when a sensor light came on. The offender thought that his father, Paul Breen, might have come to visit them, so he – the offender – walked to the front of the house, intending to kill his father first and then his grandparents. However when he reached the front of the house he realised that it was not his father but the next door neighbours who had arrived home in their car. He went up to them, pointing the knife in their direction, and told them that he was swapping his vehicle for their car. After allowing the male to get things out of the car, the offender drove off in their Holden Commodore. This episode gave rise to three offences to be taken into account on sentence, namely the armed robbery relating to the car, and the offender’s possession of a hunting knife with intent to murder each of Colin and Norma Breen.
	
	
	The offender then drove the Commodore to an address in Robertson Road Killarney Vale, where two of his friends lived. They were recreational shooters, and one of the bedrooms in their house was dedicated to the storage of firearms and hunting equipment. The room had a combination lock on the door and four locked safes inside which contained the firearms. The offender’s purpose in going to the house was to obtain a shotgun which he was proposing to use to kill his family. One of the two residents, Kirrily Shelton, was at home at the time. The offender went into the house where he held up the knife and asked Ms Shelton to open the safe. After a couple of similar requests Ms Shelton went and obtained the keys and opened the door to the room. At the time she thought that the offender wanted to put the knife inside the room. However once the door was open he demanded that she get him the shotgun. She refused, and started to lock the room again. He took her hand with the keys in it and squeezed tightly, causing her pain. In due course he let her go and after taking her phone for a while he left. In the process he smashed the knife against a glass panel in the front door, causing it to crack.
	
	
	The offence of possessing a hunting knife with intent to intimidate Ms Shelton is another of the offences to be taken into account on sentence.
	
	
	The offender then drove to his father’s home in Playford Road Killarney Heights. His father, Paul Breen, was asleep on the lounge in front of the television. His partner, Felicia Crawford, was in her bedroom watching television. The two children, Dane and Rachael, were playing in Rachael’s bedroom.
	
	
	The offender used the butt of the hunting knife to smash through two glass panels in the front door. He did this purely for effect, as the door was unlocked. He then kicked the door open and went into the lounge room. When Paul Breen saw him he screamed: “Oh my God! Corey!” At that point the offender went up to his father and stabbed him repeatedly in the chest area. Paul Breen died on the spot.
	
	
	Dane Breen, who was then aged 12, had come out to the hallway to see what was happening, and witnessed his father being repeatedly stabbed. He ran to the rear yard of the house where he tried to get his sister Rachael to safety. Rachael would not come, so Dane ran to a neighbour’s house and told them to call the police.
	
	
	In the meantime, Felicia Crawford ran out of the house into an attached garage which had been converted into a bedroom. She tried to hide behind a door, but the offender opened the door and, having pinned her against the wall with it, he proceeded to stab her several times in the back of the chest as well as the head and neck. Felicia’s daughter Rachael, then aged 7, was present at the start of this attack on her mother. At 8.03pm Felicia’s oldest daughter, Brooke, received a call from Felicia’s mobile phone in which she could hear Rachael letting out a single scream, which was followed by relative silence.
	
	
	After the attack Felicia staggered back to her bedroom and lay on her bed. Her wounds were bleeding and blood was coming out of her mouth. In the meantime, Rachael had run around the corner until she thought that the offender was gone. She then returned to her mother’s bedroom, and was there when Felicia fell off the bed and died.
	
	
	Dane and a number of neighbours were standing outside the neighbours’ homes when they saw the offender calmly walk out to the Commodore, look at them and then drive off.
	
	
	Shortly afterwards police saw the offender’s car and started to follow him. He was reaching speeds of up to 120kph in a 70km zone, and narrowly missed colliding with other vehicles. However, after a while the Commodore’s clutch burnt out, and the vehicle slowed down and started emitting large quantities of smoke. Eventually, when the car had nearly stopped, the offender got out and tried to run away, followed by the police. The path he took ended in a dead end. The offender stopped at the dead end and faced police, holding the knife. Police called on him to drop the knife, which he did. He lay down on his stomach, allowing police to handcuff him.
	
	
	A police officer told the offender that he was under arrest for multiple stabbings and stealing a car, to which the offender replied: “Multiple murder, mate”. He also said “I achieved my mission”.
	
	
	The offender was taken to Wyong Police Station where a recorded interview took place shortly afterwards. Before discussing this interview, however, it is appropriate to say something more about the injuries sustained by the two victims, as revealed by the autopsy reports.
	
	
	The post mortem examinations were conducted by the forensic pathologist, Dr Brian Beer. He found that Paul Breen had sustained a total of 15 stab wounds. There were six wounds to the chest, four of which had entered the heart and one the left lung. These constituted the immediate cause of death. There was also a stab wound to the right forehead which had penetrated the skull, as well as a number of more superficial wounds, some of them of a defensive nature. Given that five of the chest wounds and the forehead wound had penetrated bone structures, Dr Beer concluded that severe force must have been used to inflict them.
	
	
	Felicia Crawford was found to have sustained four stab wounds to the back of the chest, two of which had penetrated the left lung. These constituted the immediate cause of death. The other two chest wounds had caused soft tissue damage only. In addition she had sustained a stab wound to the back of the neck as well as two wounds to the left side of the head, and a defensive injury to her left hand. Given that the two fatal injuries had penetrated her ribs, Dr Beer concluded that severe force must have been used to inflict them.
	
	
	I turn now to discuss the offender’s police interview.
	


The Offender’s Interview


	
	The offender was remarkably disinhibited during the course of this interview, and expressed, in no uncertain terms, his pleasure that he had killed each of the victims. He said that he had an “absolute pure hatred” of both of them. This was attributed, he said, to his “shit upbringing”, as he described it, which included his father beating him when he was a child, and was compounded by his father’s lack of support when the offender was convicted of assault in 2010. He said that when the clutch burnt out in his car he was on his way to his mother’s house, where he would probably have “knifed” her, her boyfriend, his brother and sister, and whoever else was there.
	
	
	The offender told police that he was prone to blackouts – he had been blacking out since he was a teenager. He initially said that the first thing he remembered about the evening was arriving at his grandparent’s home. But he then proceeded to describe going to a store and pushing shelves at a “big guy” and demanding his car keys. (I should interpolate here that, on all accounts, Mr Romanos was a large man). At first the offender was mistaken as to which store it was where this had happened, but later he corrected himself. In addition he remembered stabbing the driver of a car, although he said he did not recall the details. He commented, rightly, that this could have happened on his way to the store. When asked how he obtained the utility vehicle, he said that he was down a driveway near a house when the utility was driven into the driveway and the driver got out and ran towards the house. He, the offender, who was carrying the knife, demanded that the driver give him the car keys, which the driver did. This appears to be a generally accurate description of how the offender obtained the car from Mr Greenland, although the offender made no mention of having previously knocked on the door of the house, pretending to be from the Red Cross.
	
	
	In other words, the offender had a recollection of many of the events of that evening. His descriptions of the events he did remember were often quite precise. He was also surprisingly forthcoming during this interview. Indeed the evidence in relation to some of the Form 1 offences came from the offender’s own lips during the course of this interview. This is relevant to another significant issue on sentence, namely the extent, if at all, to which the offender was affected by alcohol or drugs when he committed these offences, and I will be returning to discuss this later.
	


The Offender’s Level of Culpability


	
	The Crown submits that these offences fall within the worst category of objective seriousness for murder and attract the provisions of s 61(1) of the Act. That section provides as follows:
	


“A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.”


	
	In spite of the apparently mandatory terms of this provision, the court retains an overriding discretion to impose a lesser sentence. Section 61(3) provides that “nothing in subsection (1) affects section 21(1)”. Section 21(1), provides:
	


“If by any provision of an Act an offender is made liable to imprisonment for life, a court may nevertheless impose a sentence of imprisonment for a specified term.”


	
	I turn therefore to discuss matters relevant to the objective seriousness of these offences and the offender’s level of culpability. It is appropriate to commence with the aggravating and mitigating factors which the Court is obliged to take into account pursuant to s 21A of the Act.
	


Aggravating and Mitigating Factors Under s 21A


	
	I am referring here only to the factors which are relevant to the offender’s culpability for the offences rather than those which relate only to the offender personally, which I will be discussing later. The aggravating factors which apply in this case, and are not inherent in the offence of murder, are as follows: first, pursuant to paragraph (2)(ea), the offences were committed in the presence of a child under 18 years of age. In this case the murder of Paul Breen was committed in the presence of his son Dane, then aged 12. Rachael, aged seven, witnessed the beginning of the attack on her mother and was with her when she died shortly afterwards. Associated with this, and pursuant to paragraph (2)(g), the emotional harm caused to the two children was substantial, as was the emotional harm done to other family members, as indicated by the various Victim Impact Statements. I will be referring to this matter later, as it is a significant issue in the circumstances of this case.
	
	
	The next aggravating factor, pursuant to paragraph 21A(2)(eb), is that the offences were committed in the home of the victims. Finally, pursuant to paragraph (2)(m), the offences involved multiple victims and a series of criminal acts. I will also be saying more about this later.
	
	
	There are no mitigating factors under s 21A(3) relating to the offences, although there are two mitigating factors relating to the offender personally which I shall discuss later.
	


The Offender’s Motivation and State of Mind


	
	In assessing the objective gravity of these offences, the offender’s motivation and state of mind in committing them is a highly relevant matter.
	
	
	It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to envisage any rational motive for these extraordinary offences. However it is clear that the offender harboured deep-seated feelings of resentment and anger against his family members, particularly his father, and by extension against Felicia Crawford. He had also been nursing violent fantasies for a considerable time. In August 2009 the offender wrote a letter to his mother, which included the following:
	


“…This is a true account of the mind of Corey Alan Breen. Its [sic] gone on too long to remain unsaid…I’m the kind of guy you love to be around. I’m happy, fun and would do anything for my friends. But this changes when I’m alone. I get very angry and plot out murders of people I hate. I do it all in my head. I run over it again and again refining every detail. They are always extremely horrific and extremely brutal … I’m scared someday soon the monster that I’ve kept locked away for so long will finally reach the surface. This can’t happen. Everything will change. People will die and people will suffer … I’m not stupid though. I know that all these things I ponder are wrong, very wrong. They are evil. I know this but I don’t care….I do know these violent fantasys [sic] are wrong but that’s not why I haven’t committed them. The honest answer is this. Because at the moment nothing has pushed me quite that far yet. But I do feel it is close.”


	
	This letter assumes a highly chilling quality when one considers the circumstances of these offences, more than three and a half years later.
	
	
	After receiving this letter the offender’s mother encouraged him to get psychological help. However it seems that the offender kept these thoughts to himself, and few people knew about them until they finally emerged, with catastrophic consequences, on 29 March 2013. When one looks at what the offender was doing earlier that day, it is difficult to pinpoint any particular triggering event. Certainly the offender had consumed some alcohol that afternoon. I will be referring to this later. Also he had been arguing with his partner. But neither of these was, on all accounts, particularly unusual. In his police interview, the offender said that he and Ms Fenech had been “having a shit run for a while”. That afternoon, he said, there was no one to calm him down. To use his own words, he went on to say:
	


“So it just went on from there. But it’s always sort of been … like a time bomb sitting in my head. I knew sooner or later I was going to go and fucken get my old man and the rest of the cunts. And just tonight was the night.”


	
	The offender said that when he was apprehended he was on the way to his mother’s house. If the clutch had not burnt out, he said, he would have:
	


“knifed her and her fucken boyfriend and my brother and sister and whoever else was there.”


	
	Both these offences were accompanied by an intention to kill the victims. The offender openly admitted this during his police interview. In any event, his actions in inflicting the multiple deep stab wounds on the two victims were clearly indicative of such an intention. Mr Young SC, who appeared for the offender, did not seek to argue to the contrary. Nor could he do so in the circumstances.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that both offences were premeditated, in that the offender had long contemplated killing family members. Certainly there was an element of spontaneity in the commencement of the events on 29 March 2013, but once the offender had decided that he was going to kill members of his family he set out in a determined way to achieve his aim. Dr Nielssen described his actions thereafter as “purposeful”.
	
	
	Mr Young submitted that there was no positive resolve to commit the murders before that afternoon. However he agreed that once the offender commenced this course of action, following the argument with his partner, he continued until he was stopped.
	
	
	The evidence indicates that the offences were premeditated in the sense that they were not spontaneous actions, committed on the spur of the moment or in reaction to other events. The offender’s actions in attempting to obtain weapons before he left home were indicative of his intention at that time to do harm to his family members. However I cannot find that the offender’s actions that evening were pursuant to a deliberately formed plan of action which had been hatched well in advance. To use the offender’s own words in his earlier letter to his mother, the “monster” had finally reached the surface.
	
	
	In assessing the offender’s level of culpability it is relevant also to consider his personality features at the time, and whether his actions were influenced by other factors, such as alcohol or drugs. This is potentially relevant to his prospects of rehabilitation, and therefore to the protection of the community, one of the issues to be considered under s 61(1).
	
	
	Mr Young tendered a report of the forensic psychiatrist, Dr Olav Nielssen, dated 23 July 2015. Dr Nielssen had seen all documentary material relevant to this case and had twice interviewed the offender by audio-visual link with the Long Bay Correctional Centre.
	
	
	The offender told Dr Nielssen that he had no recollection at all of the events surrounding the killings. His last memory, he said, was playing poker at home. The next thing he remembered was being in the police cells with blood all over his hands. This was after the ERISP, of which he similarly had no memory. He had been drinking heavily that day, he told the doctor, and had also taken several Venlaxafine tablets. This is an antidepressant drug which had previously been prescribed for him. Dr Nielssen gave evidence on sentence, in which he was asked about the offender’s stated amnesia for these events. The doctor said that the most common explanation would be an alcoholic blackout, but it would be unusual to have an alcoholic blackout for such a long period of time. The Venlaxafine tablets apparently taken by the offender earlier that day could also have contributed to the offender’s lack of memory he said, as well as to his uninhibited answers during the interview. He described Venlaxafine as a very potent antidepressant which has an amphetamine-like effect in high doses.
	
	
	The offender’s state of intoxication during his ERISP is a particularly relevant matter in this case. The delight he expressed in having murdered the two victims is quite chilling. Dr Nielssen expressed the opinion that the offender was affected by alcohol at the time. However the doctor had only read the interview. He had not watched the DVD of it. I have had the benefit of watching the DVD, and the offender does not appear to me to have been under the influence of alcohol. He was very precise in his answers, occasionally correcting the interviewer. Indeed there is evidence from the police officer that he could discern no sign of alcohol intoxication, from the offender’s breath or otherwise. On the other hand, the offender’s lack of judgment and inhibitions during the interview is surprising, to say the least, from an otherwise intelligent person. The offender told Dr Nielssen that not only did he not remember the interview, but “the person in the interview is not me…it sends my blood chilling”.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, I cannot escape the conclusion that the offender must have been affected by some form of drug at the time of the interview: at least by the Venlaxafine which he had reportedly taken earlier that day, and possibly also by some form of illegal drug. It is also possible that his extraordinary frankness during the interview was prompted by some form of unconscious relief that the “monster” inside him had finally emerged, so he was no longer going to have to wrestle with his internal battles.
	
	
	The offender told Dr Nielssen that he had been suffering intermittent blackouts since his teens. Various scans had been performed, but no neurological abnormalities had been detected. He had also been drinking heavily and taking various forms of illegal drugs since his late teens.
	
	
	In his report Dr Nielssen diagnosed the offender as suffering from substance abuse disorder. He considered that the offender has good prospects for eventual rehabilitation into the community. The offender is of above average intelligence, and the main issue to be addressed is his substance abuse disorder. The doctor considered that the offender would be unlikely to pose a threat to other family members if he were not affected by alcohol or drugs.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen gave evidence about these matters, which I shall discuss very shortly. Before doing so, however, it is pertinent to refer to the report of the forensic psychiatrist Dr Yvonne Skinner, dated 7 August 2015, which was tendered by the Crown. Dr Skinner had read all relevant documents relating to the case, and had viewed the DVD of the offender’s ERISP. However she had not interviewed the offender personally. She noted that a year before these events, in March and April 2012, the offender had been diagnosed by a psychologist as suffering from depression and anger management issues. The offender had had problems controlling his anger since he was a child. Dr Skinner agreed with Dr Nielssen’s diagnosis that the offender was suffering from substance abuse disorder. She also considered that he was suffering from a personality disorder characterised by anger, impulsivity and affective instability. Dr Skinner disagreed with Dr Nielssen’s opinion that the offender would be unlikely to pose a threat to other family members if he is released into the community. She said she has seen many people who return to substance abuse after long periods of enforced abstinence while in custody. In addition, personality factors are important in a person’s prospects of rehabilitation, and the offender has a long history of anger and poor impulse control. For these reasons she considered that the offender’s prospects for rehabilitation must be considered guarded.
	
	
	It was essentially in response to Dr Skinner’s report that Dr Nielssen was called to give evidence in the sentencing proceedings. He was asked by Mr Young about Dr Skinner’s diagnosis of personality disorder, and he said that he rarely makes that diagnosis because it lacks scientific reliability. It refers to maladaptive traits which are present throughout life, but longitudinal studies have shown that many people who have been diagnosed with personality disorder do not meet the criteria when they are reviewed later in life. For this reason it is an unreliable diagnosis.
	
	
	As to the offender’s prospects for rehabilitation, the key matter, Dr Nielssen said, will be his ability to control his substance abuse. In cross-examination the doctor agreed that many people who indicate their intention to refrain from substance abuse do not live up to their expectations when they are released from custody. However he commented that a long period of enforced abstinence seems to help maintain abstinence. He also said he could not disagree with Dr Skinner that a risk of reoffending exists, but it is very difficult to quantify, and the overall level, based on statistics, is low.
	


Other Relevant Matters


	
	The Crown submitted that the offender deliberately set out to instil fear and terror in the people he came into contact with. The Crown submissions pointed to the offender’s unnecessary smashing of the glass panels on the front door of his victims’ home. The offender admitted in his police interview that this was probably a scare tactic, “just to give him the fucken spooks before I killed the cunt”. In the case of both victims, Paul Breen and Felicia Crawford, there can be no doubt that this scare tactic worked. Both of them must have realised what was almost certain to follow, and their last moments must have been filled with unimaginable fear and horror. This is a highly significant matter when considering the objective seriousness of these offences.
	
	
	It is also relevant to the seriousness of each of these offences that it was not committed in isolation. As the Court of Criminal Appeal confirmed in Adanguidi v R (2006) 167 A Crim R 295 at [32], in situations where two offences are committed at essentially the same time and place and are part of the one episode of criminal conduct, the Court can have regard to the whole of the conduct in determining the level of culpability involved in each offence.
	


The Victim Impact Statements


	
	I turn to discuss the consequences of the offender’s actions on other family members. Section 28(4) of the Act provides that the Victim Impact Statements given by family members can, if the prosecution applies and the Court considers it appropriate to do so, be taken into account on sentence on the basis that the harmful impact of the primary victim’s death on immediate family members is an aspect of the harm done to the community. The Crown in this case made such an application. It was not opposed by Mr Young upon the basis that my consideration of the statements is to focus on matters relevant to the impact of the deaths on the family members concerned. This is the approach which I would have adopted in any event. It is consistent with the authorities on this subject.
	
	
	In relation to the impact on the two children, Dane Breen and Rachael Crawford, it is probably unnecessary to resort to s 28(4), given that it is already an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(ea) of the Act that the offences were committed in their presence and, under s 21A(2)(g), that the emotional harm caused by the offences was substantial. There can be no doubt that these two children have suffered the most enduring and extreme trauma as a result of witnessing the murder of their parents. The Victim Impact Statement of Dane Breen, in particular, indicates that his life has been irretrievably damaged by the events of that evening. He now suffers from anxiety and depression; he often inflicts self-harm and he harbours suicidal thoughts. These events have affected every aspect of his life. He finds it difficult to make friends or sustain friendships because of his depression and his inability to trust people. He cannot think of his parents without re-living the trauma of their deaths. Rachael similarly is suffering the effects of severe stress. She still has nightmares and is often anxious and frightened.
	
	
	The impact of these offences on the two children has therefore been devastating, and they will almost certainly continue to be affected by these events for the rest of their lives. Moreover, this was a foreseeable consequence of the offender’s actions. Had he adverted to the matter, he would have realised that the two children would probably be at home with their parents that night, and would therefore be forced to witness the slaughter which he was bent upon inflicting.
	
	
	This, in my opinion, is a very significant aggravating factor in the particular circumstances of this case.
	
	
	The other Victim Impact statements powerfully express the overwhelming trauma that the offender’s actions have inflicted on other family members. Simply listening to and reading these statements is a distressing experience in itself. The whole family has been devastated by these murders.
	
	
	Dane and Rachael are now primarily in the care of their older sister Brooke, who was aged 22 at the time of the killings. Brooke, Felicia’s daughter, described the total changes in her life as a result of these murders, as well as her own acute distress at the loss of her much loved mother and step-father. She has been diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder as well as depression and anxiety.
	
	
	Debra Breen, the offender’s mother, was intensely traumatised by the events of 29 March. She describes herself as being constantly haunted by the realisation that her son was coming to kill her. She also suffers from post‑traumatic stress, together with anxiety, nervousness, depression, doubt, guilt and hair loss. These symptoms, she says, impair her life every day, affecting her work and her personal life.    
	
	
	Ashleigh Breen, the sister of the offender and the daughter of Paul Breen, has similarly been traumatised by these events, and sees a psychologist and a counsellor in order to deal with her symptoms of anxiety and depression. Some days, she says, it is so bad that she cannot function.
	
	
	Paul Breen’s father, Colin Breen, gave a very moving statement. His wife, Norma, had been extremely distressed by the murder of her son, and died about nine months later. His life also has been irrevocably affected by these events.
	
	
	As already indicated, I treat the harm done to these family members as an aspect of the harm done to the community as a result of these offences. And it is clear from these statements that the emotional harm has been and continues to be very substantial indeed. In my view it goes well beyond what would be expected as a “normal” consequence of the crime of murder – if indeed there is such a thing as a normal consequence in relation to this offence.
	
	
	I would like to extend my own and the Court’s heartfelt sympathy to those who have suffered so extensively as a result of these offences. I know that no sentence this Court can impose could ever start to address the harm and distress that these offences have caused to many people, and will continue to cause.
	


Conclusion in Relation to s 61(1)


	
	I return now to the central question in this case, namely whether the offender’s level of culpability is so extreme as to attract the provisions of s 61(1). In this regard I refer to the judgment of Wood CJ in CL (as he then was) in R v Harris [2000] NSWCCA 469 at [84] and [85].
	


“84   The features required for qualification in the ‘worst case category’ were defined in Twala NSWCCA 4 November 1994, where it was said:

‘in order to characterise any case as being in the worst case category, it must be possible to point to particular features which are of very great heinousness and it must be possible to postulate the absence of facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime (as distinct from the subjective features mitigating the penalty to be imposed)...’

85   ‘Heinousness’ has been described as follows:

‘The adjective “heinous” which gives the noun `heinousness' its meaning has been variously defined as meaning atrocious, detestable, hateful, odious, gravely reprehensible and extremely wicked. The test to be satisfied is thus a substantial one’. R v Reginald Keith Arhurell (Hunt CJ at CL unreported 3 October 1997).’ “


	
	There is no doubt whatsoever that these two offences are of the utmost seriousness. They go almost to the top of the range of objective seriousness for murder. However there are two matters which, between them, make me conclude that the offences do not fall within s 61(1). First is the fact that, although the offender set out to kill his family members that evening, and his actions were purposeful and premeditated in that sense, nevertheless the offences themselves had not been plotted or planned in advance. Something inside the offender snapped that afternoon, and sparked off the horrendous series of events which followed. It is impossible to know precisely what it was which triggered these actions, but it was probably connected with the alcohol and drugs which the offender had earlier consumed. The second matter relates to the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation. I accept the evidence of Dr Nielssen that the offender has very reasonable prospects of rehabilitation, particularly if he can abstain from drugs and alcohol on his release. Also relevant here is the offender’s deep remorse, which I accept is genuine. I will be saying a little more about this when discussing matters relating to the offender personally, but it is also relevant here as it goes to his prospects of rehabilitation. And that in turn is relevant to the issue of community protection under s 61(1).
	
	
	In short, I consider that because of the combination of those two matters, the absence of pre-planning and the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation, this case does not quite reach the extremely high bar set by s61(1). Accordingly, I will not be imposing the maximum sentence of life imprisonment in relation to these offences.
	
	
	The offences are, however, of an extremely high order of seriousness and will attract, between them, a very lengthy sentence of imprisonment.
	
	
	It is appropriate to mention here that there are two principal guide posts in sentencing: the maximum sentence, and the standard non-parole period. I have already discussed the maximum penalty. The standard non-parole period for murder is imprisonment for 20 years. However given the extreme seriousness of the present offences, the non-parole periods will be well in excess of that standard.
	
	
	At this point I turn to discuss a few matters personal to the offender and his background.
	


Matters Personal to the Offender


	
	The offender has two previous convictions. On 11 February 2003, at Wyong Children’s Court, he was convicted of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm and was placed on a 12 month bond. The offence took place when the offender was 16 years old and resulted in his having to change schools. On 30 September 2009, at Gosford Local Court, he was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and was again placed on a 12 month bond. It was this offence which resulted in his losing his job as a security guard.
	
	
	Both these offences obviously involved personal violence on the part of the offender and therefore constitute an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(d) of the Act. On the other hand, the fact that he was placed on a bond in each case presumably indicates that the level of violence was not of a particularly high order.
	
	
	As to mitigating factors relating to the offender personally, I have already discussed his prospects of rehabilitation. In addition, pursuant to paragraphs (i) and (k) of s 21A(3), he has expressed deep remorse for his actions and has pleaded guilty to these charges. Both these matters merit further discussion.
	
	
	First, the offender’s expressed remorse: the defence tendered a document signed by the offender in which he expressed deep remorse for the inestimable damage he has done to his family members. At first I had grave doubts as to the genuineness of the offender’s expressions of remorse. It is all too easy for someone in his position to claim feelings of remorse after the event, and thereby seek a reduction of sentence on this account. But this is a most unusual case, as indicated - amongst many other things - by the letter the offender wrote his to mother nearly four years before the murders. In one sense the offender had taken on a different persona when he committed these horrific offences. Also, and very significantly on the issue of remorse, the defence tendered a letter from Rev. Peter Baines of the prison chaplaincy service. To quote the first paragraph of this letter:
	


“There is no excuse for the actions committed by Corey Breen that are the reason that he is before you. As long as I have known him, he has never sought to excuse or mitigate what he has done. He takes full responsibility for them, in a manner I find rare in my 18 years as a chaplain. Corey is horrified by what he has done and finds it difficult to accept that anyone would do other than shun him for what he has done. He defines remorse. I do not say this lightly.”


	
	In the light of this material I accept that the offender is genuinely and deeply remorseful for his actions. In one sense I have already taken this issue into account as it was relevant to the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation, one of the two factors which in my opinion took this case outside the purview of s 61(1).
	
	
	The remaining matter arises from the offender’s pleas of guilty to both charges. Section 22 of the Act provides that a court must take into account the fact that an offender has pleaded guilty and may accordingly impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise have imposed.
	
	
	The Courts have interpreted s 22 as generally requiring a reduction of sentence in recognition of the plea’s utilitarian value and in order to encourage early pleas of guilty. In the present case the offender indicated his intention to plead guilty early in the process, and in the normal course of events would therefore be entitled to a reduction in sentence. However it is now accepted that in exceptional cases of great heinousness a reduction in sentence on this account does not necessarily have to be given: Milat v R [2014] NSWCCA 29. In my opinion the present is such a case. The offender is extremely fortunate to escape a life sentence, and in my opinion it would be inappropriate, in the most unusual circumstances of this case, to allow any further reduction on account of his pleas of guilty.
	
	
	The sentences I am about to impose will obviously be very lengthy. The offender is still a relatively young man, of 29. He will be past middle age by the time he qualifies for parole, and will be elderly by the end of his sentence. He will have spent more than half his life in custody, and in many ways he is likely to be a different person by then.
	
	
	The offender will obviously be sentenced separately for each of the two murders. The sentence in relation to each of the two principal offences will be partly concurrent with and partly cumulative upon the sentence for the other offence. In this regard it is necessary to take account of the principle of totality, namely that the overall penalty is to reflect the total criminality involved in these offences.
	
	
	In this case, because the sentence for the murder of Paul Breen is to be increased by reason of the Form 1 offences, I propose to sentence the offender first in relation to the murder of Felicia Crawford, then partially accumulate the sentence in relation to the murder of Paul Breen, taking account of the Form 1 matters. If I were to sentence him in the order set out in the indictment, the additional term for the Form 1 offences would be subsumed within the sentence for the murder of Felicia Crawford.
	
	
	The offender is likely to require a lengthy period of supervision upon his eventual release from custody. However, given the length of the sentences I am about to impose, there will in any event be a substantial parole period, and therefore no special circumstances have been shown which would justify a variation of the statutory ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period.
	
	
	The offender has been in custody since 29 March 2013, and his sentences will therefore commence on that date.
	
	
	I formally convict the offender of the two offences to which he has pleaded guilty. In accordance with s 167 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 I dismiss the charges in relation to each of the listed back up offences.
	
	
	I am required to warn the offender, which I now do, of the existence of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006, and the fact that that Act applies to the offences of which he has been convicted, and for which he is about to be formally sentenced. At some future point in time, an application may be made that, notwithstanding the completion of his sentences, he nevertheless ought to be detained in ongoing custody or else ought to be the subject of an extended supervision order, impacting on his liberty.
	
	
	Corey Alan Breen, I sentence you as follows:
	



	
	In relation to the offence of murdering Felicia Crawford, I sentence you to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 26 years commencing on 29 March 2013 and expiring on 28 March 2039, with a balance of term of 8 years, commencing on 29 March 2041 and concluding on 28 March 2047.
	
	
	In relation to the offence of murdering Paul Breen, and taking into account the nine Form 1 offences, I sentence you to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 28 years commencing on 29 March 2018, and expiring on 28 March 2046, with a balance of term of 9 years, commencing on 29 March 2046 and concluding on 28 March 2055.
	
	
	The total term of imprisonment is therefore 42 years, with a non-parole period of 33 years. The earliest date on which the offender will be eligible for release on parole is 28 March 2046.

Introduction


	
	Joseph Golden, the plaintiff, challenges two decisions made by Peter V’landys, the first defendant, on behalf of Racing New South Wales (Racing NSW), the second defendant. Mr V’landys is, and was at the relevant time, the Chief Executive of NSW Racing. The first decision, made on 8 June 2011, resulted in the plaintiff’s trainer’s licence being suspended for six months. The second decision, made on 24 June 2011, resulted in the plaintiff being warned off racetracks controlled by Racing NSW indefinitely. The plaintiff also claims damages for alleged misfeasance in public office by Mr V’landys.
	
	
	In order to address the questions to be determined it is necessary to set out the regulatory framework.

The Racing NSW Board Code of Conduct


	
	The Racing NSW Board Code of Conduct provided, relevantly:
	


“3.   DUTIES OF THE BOARD

Board members are subject to a range of duties owed to Racing NSW. These are derived from the Thoroughbred Racing Act 1996, Common Law and other sources. At the most fundamental level these duties are-

The fiduciary duty of loyalty which is usually expressed as a duty to act in good faith and in the interests of the body as a whole, and -

. . .

The fiduciary duty of loyalty is owed to Racing NSW itself as a whole. The members duty of loyalty to Racing NSW as a whole is “fiduciary” that is to say it imposes the highest standard of fidelity, because the Member occupies a position of trust vis-à-vis Racing NSW. The nature of the duty is similar to that of the trustee towards the beneficiaries of a trust. The principal manifestations of this duty of a member are; -

To act bona fide in the best interests of Racing NSW as a whole.

To exercise the powers conferred by the Act for the proper purposes of Racing NSW and not for any extraneous purpose, and

Seeking to avoid being placed in a position where the member’s duty to Racing NSW as a whole conflicts or may conflict with personal interest, and if such a possibility arises disclosing the matter and handling it in the interests of Racing NSW as a whole.”

. . .

6.   CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

The Thoroughbred Racing Act 1996 and Common Law set high standards for removing conflicts of interest. Conflicts of interest are assessed in terms of the likelihood that Board Members possessing a particular interest could be influenced or might appear to be influenced, in the performance of their duties on any matter. At all times a Board Member must be able to act in the interests of Racing NSW as a whole…

Where a conflict or perceived conflict does arise, the Board Member must consider whether to refrain from participating in the debate and/or voting on the matter, whether to arrange that the relevant Board Papers are not sent, or in an extreme case whether to resign from Racing NSW. The Chairman or Chief Executive is available to discuss potential conflicts of Interest with Board Members. In any event, full disclosure of conflicts or potential conflicts must be made at the Racing NSW Board meeting, or prior in writing to the Chief Executive.”

The facts

The delegation of power in Racing NSW


	
	On 21 February 2005 the Board of Racing NSW (the Board) resolved to confer on the Chief Executive the power and authority to manage the business of Racing NSW, subject to its limitations policy.
	
	
	On 17 March 2008 the Board resolved to abolish the Licensing Committee as a sub-committee of the Board and to delegate its licensing functions to the Chief Executive.
	
	
	On 23 April 2008 the Board resolved to delegate its warning off authority, under LR 6 to the Chief Executive.
	
	
	On 15 September 2008 the Board resolved to authorise the Chief Executive to sub-delegate his functions to management and employees of Racing NSW. A Licensing Committee was established, which comprised a panel of Racing NSW managers and employees representing the Licensing, Stewards, Legal and Industry Training Departments of Racing NSW. The Licensing Committee was chaired by the General Manager-Regulatory and provided assistance to the Chief Executive in dealing with licensing matters at his or her direction.
	


The plaintiff’s background


	
	The plaintiff lives on a property at Grafton of about 45 hectares where he keeps horses. He used to own the property but, in 2013, he sold it to his daughter. He kept Brahman cross-bred cattle on the property from 1984 to 1988 but since that time he has carried out various improvements to the property for the benefit of horses.
	
	
	The plaintiff was, by occupation, an accountant but in about 2005 he reduced the time he spent on accountancy and consulting services and dedicated more of his time and energy to building up a horse breeding and racing business. In 2010 he began training his own horses.
	
	
	The plaintiff raced his horses, with mixed success. The total prize money for the 2010 financial year was $7,600 and for the following year, $10,400. He also earned money for starter’s fees (paid in respect of horses which started a race) and rebates (paid in respect of horses that finished but did not get a place). In 2010 the plaintiff’s gross income from racing horses was $11,362; in 2011 it was $20,670. In those years he made taxable losses, after deductions for expenses.
	
	
	In 2007 the equine influenza virus affected horses in Australia. In response the Commonwealth established the Commercial Horse Assistance Payment Scheme (CHAPS) to compensate horse owners and trainers.
	
	
	In 2009 the plaintiff applied for a full country training licence. He had previously held an owner/trainer’s licence but had allowed it to lapse due to his disenchantment with the way CHAPS had been administered. In January 2008 the plaintiff wrote to Kevin Rudd (the then Prime Minister), Tony Burke (the then Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) and Mr V’landys about his concerns. He spoke to local newspapers, such as the Daily Examiner, about what he saw as the abuse of CHAPS. The Daily Examiner published an article in April 2008 reporting some of the plaintiff’s allegations.
	
	
	In November 2010 the plaintiff was notified by Racing NSW that he was not to race one of his horses, Abilina, more than once a week, apparently due to its concern that more frequent racing might be detrimental to the health of the horse. By letter dated 17 November 2010 the plaintiff wrote to Mr V’landys to complain about the decision. In the letter, the plaintiff accused Mr V’landys of being responsible for an “unprofessional review”.
	


The plaintiff’s letter of 10 May 2011


	
	The plaintiff had entered Abilina in at least two races that were fewer than seven days apart. Accordingly, he became liable for scratching fees in respect of races for which Abilina was entered but was not, by reason of the directive from Racing NSW, permitted to run. The plaintiff was charged a scratching fee of $80. His request that the fee be reversed was declined.
	
	
	On 10 May 2011, the plaintiff wrote a letter addressed to the “General Manager, Racing NSW” which read:
	


“Subject:   A reply to my letter to you of 26th Feb re reversal of scratching fee for ABILINA – Race 5 Port Macquarie 1st Feb has never been replied to!!!

Dear Sir,

Your [sic] corrupt, incompetent & incapable of performing a review of the above horse CEO interfered in my racing this horse.

I should be suing RNSW for the costs, stress, inconvenience your CEO played in his interfering in this horses [sic] racing programs.

Any subsequent accounts you send to me should be hastily shoved up his arse until such time that the $80 fee is reversed.”


	
	By email of 13 May 2011 Keith Bulloch (who, as the General Manager- Regulatory, chaired the Licensing Committee) reported to Mr V’landys on the plaintiff’s letter, alleging that it contained “offensive and insulting comments”. After setting out the text of the plaintiff’s letter, Mr Bulloch said:
	


“If you agree to delegate to the licensing committee the function to issue a show cause notice and conduct a hearing there is a draft letter attached.

You could use these words by return email:

As the authorised officer with the delegated authority from the Board, I sub-delegate to the Licensing Committee my delegated power to issue a show cause notice to Mr Joseph Golden, conduct a hearing of that show cause notice and to make a recommendation to me upon the conclusion of that hearing.

Regards,

Keith”


	
	Mr V’landys accepted Mr Bulloch’s suggestion and, by return email, sub-delegated his authority from the Board to the Licensing Committee to issue a show cause notice, conduct a hearing and make a recommendation to him following the hearing.
	


The First Show Cause Notice


	
	By letter dated 16 May 2011 Mr Bulloch wrote to the plaintiff (the First Show Cause Notice) in accordance with the draft letter he had sent in the email of 13 May 2011 to Mr V’landys. The letter began with the statement that Racing NSW, as the regulator of thoroughbred racing in NSW, was duty bound to act in the interests of the industry as a whole. He referred to AR 7, LR 51 and s 14AA of the Thoroughbred Racing Act. He informed the plaintiff that he was required to attend at a hearing on 31 May 2011 to show cause why his trainer’s licence ought not be suspended or revoked on the basis that he was not a fit and proper person to be licensed as a trainer. A typescript of the substantive part of the plaintiff’s letter of 10 May 2011 was reproduced in the First Show Cause Notice. Mr Bulloch set out the plaintiff’s rights to make submissions; how such submissions could be made; and his right to legal representation.
	
	
	The notice continued:
	


“The Chief Executive Officer, Mr Peter V’landys, who is the authorised officer with the delegated authority to exercise the powers of Racing NSW has sub delegated to the Licensing Committee the function to issue this show cause notice and to conduct this hearing. Further, the functions of licensing are delegated to the Licensing Committee pursuant to LR 51(3).”


	
	The First Show Cause Notice also contained the following paragraphs:
	


“Please note that this matter is of extreme importance. You should attend to the matter immediately and consider seeking legal advice.

Please note that if you fail to appear, or do not forward a written submission in lieu of appearing, Racing NSW will proceed with the matter in your absence.”


	
	On 17 May 2011 Mr Pringle, Chairman of Stewards, handed the First Show Cause Notice to the plaintiff. The plaintiff read the notice and confirmed that he understood the contents. He told Mr Pringle that he would probably not attend the hearing; that he “is not sure whether he will undertake legal advice”; and that he would write a further letter saying that he had received the notice and indicating what his intentions were.
	


The plaintiff’s response to the First Show Cause Notice


	
	On 19 May 2011, the plaintiff wrote to Mr Bulloch and Gary Rudge (Licensing Supervisor of Racing NSW), relevantly, in the following terms:
	


“I will not be attending your meeting for 31st May.

I am not prepared to engage in legal costs to attend a ‘kangaroo court’, nor waist [sic] anybodyelses [sic] time in presenting myself (& others) before the minions of your corrupt CEO – P V’landys.

As General Manager Racing NSW (RNSW) you played an integral role in the maladministration and misappropriation of tens of millions of Australia taxpayers dollars, which suggests to me you were either party to the case or being directed & instructed by your CEO (to play ball).

I wrote to your CEO 31st January 2011 requesting a review of my horse now the subject of an $80 fee RNSW imposed on me. This fee came about as a result of your CEO trying to harass and bully me because I tried to call him to account about his role as Head of RNSW in the distribution of tens of millions of taxpayers’ dollars back in 2007-2008.

…

In the 31st Jan letter to your CEO, I requested he either not interfere with my racing program and send me addresses of the entire RNSW Board members that I could inform his fellow directors as to the level of jeopardy he was bringing upon every directions head with the decisions he made 2007-2008. (No addresses were forthcoming because his arse in (sic) on the line.)

He did not provide me with directors address (Non Druitt St) as requested, instead he handed the problem onto Mr Murrihy (and we dealt with it quite civilly and quickly). Later I received an account for $80 for this horse, wrote a letter 26th February requesting the amount be reversed, to which there was no response, and the rest is history. When the next month’s account arrived requesting insurance be paid, I then instructed RNSW to shove the account up you corrupt CEO’s arse because it is Vlandy that commenced this witch hunt on me, and then asks minions/puppets to clean up the mess. Please take all of the above into account should you be pressured into a decision about my character (and licence) with the CEO’s gun at your head(s).”

The plaintiff’s further conduct


	
	On Monday 23 May 2011 the plaintiff drove to Grafton Bridge, which is about 20kms from his property, and stationed himself at the southern end of the bridge for a period of about two hours next to a large sign which read:
	


“RACING NSW CORRUPT

CEO ROBS TAXPAYERS”

The report to police


	
	It appears that someone took a photograph of the plaintiff on the bridge on 23 May 2011 and sent it by email to Racing NSW. Mr Nicholson, Chief Racing Inspector, contacted the police. By email sent at 5.11pm on 23 May 2011, Mr Nicholson subsequently made the following report to Mr Bulloch, which was copied to Mr V’landys and to Pete Sweney, Racing NSW’s General Counsel:
	


“About 10am on Monday 23 May 2011, I spoke by telephone to Sergeant Rebecca Pipes, Grafton Police Station with the regards to the behaviour of licensed Racing NSW trainer, Joseph Golden. An earlier email received at this office depicted Golden standing on a Grafton street holding a placard with offensive wording relating to Racing NSW.

A request was made to Sergeant Pipes to speak with Golden as to his manner of behaviour and reason for this type of behaviour. The Sergeant agreed to assist but firstly to carry out certain inquiries relating to Golden.

I later spoke again with Sergeant Pipes who informed me that Golden had since moved on from the location shown in the email photograph. She was satisfied with his identity particulars and has since made a formal record of this incident. Sergeant Pipes further informed me that as Golden was conducting a ‘silent protest’ there was little the Police could do other than directing him to move along should he again behave in this way. Should he disobey such a direction, the Police would then be able to formally charge him.

Sergeant Pipes will contact me should Golden come to their attention in the future.”


	
	On 23 May 2011 by email sent at 4.15pm Mr Bulloch sent a draft delegation to Mr V’landys so that Mr V’landys could sub-delegate his authority to the Licensing Committee to amend the First Show Cause Notice to add any subsequent behaviour of the plaintiff. Mr V’landys responded by email headed “Re: J Golden – elevating matters with poor behaviour” at 6.36pm that evening, sending the sub-delegation to Mr Bulloch (in a form identical to that proposed by Mr Bulloch). The email concluded:
	


“Please advise Board and in particular my action on Stewards recommendation to stop him racing his horse 4 times in one week.

Also that his Chaps payment allegations were without foundation.”


	
	On Tuesday 24 May 2011 the local paper, The Daily Examiner, contained a story on page 5 concerning the plaintiff’s protest on the bridge. A photograph of the plaintiff holding his (clearly legible) sign was also published. The journalist reported:
	


“THREE years after the horse racing industry came to a shuddering halt through an outbreak of the equine influenza virus, one Grafton man is still fighting what he believes was a lack of accountability and rorting of the government assistance scheme introduced to help the horse industry through the crisis.

Yesterday he took that campaign to the streets with a one-man protest near the Grafton Bridge during peak hour traffic and said he would be back rain, hail or sunshine today and tomorrow to get his point across.

And if that doesn’t get the attention he believes the issue deserves, he will head to Sydney to do the same.

Joseph Golden does not like to give up.”


	
	By email sent at 8.31am on 24 May 2011 Mr Bulloch sent an email to Ken Brown and Arthur Inglis, in which Mr V’landys was copied. Mr Bulloch recounted the plaintiff’s conduct on the bridge and the fact that it had been reported in the Grafton Examiner. Mr Bulloch said in the email:
	


“He may be copycatting the guy that climbed the Harbour Bridge last week and stopped traffic.”


	
	After recounting the background to the incident Mr Bulloch wrote:
	


“We are left with little option now but to elevate [next] week’s hearing to include the latest actions and include the prospect of him facing heavier sanctions including being warned off. He has no horses racing at the moment.”


	
	On Tuesday 24 May and Wednesday 25 May 2011 the plaintiff again drove to Grafton Bridge and displayed the same sign for about two hours on each day.
	


The Amended Show Cause Notice


	
	By letter of 24 May 2011 Mr Bulloch wrote to the plaintiff and referred to the First Show Cause Notice; the plaintiff’s letter of 19 May 2011; and a copy of a photograph of the plaintiff standing next to Grafton Bridge holding a placard. Mr Bulloch informed the plaintiff that the show cause hearing scheduled for 31 May 2011 had been amended to include the insulting comments in the plaintiff’s letter of 19 May 2011 and the placard displayed on the Grafton Bridge on 23 May 2011. The plaintiff was invited to show cause why his trainer’s licence ought not be suspended or revoked on the basis that he was not a fit and proper person and why he ought not be warned off all racecourses within the control of Racing NSW on the basis that his presence was not desirable. Once again, he was invited to make submissions and appear.
	
	
	On 24 May 2011 at 4.40pm Mr Bulloch sent an email to Greg Rudolph (Deputy Chairman (Racing) in Racing NSW’s Stipendiary Stewards Department), Mr Sweney and Maurice Logue (a member of Racing NSW’s management team), which was copied to Mr Rudge, which said:
	


“Please note that the Joseph Golden show cause is set for Tue 31 May at 11am. Golden has addressed his latest correspondence/accusations [the letter of 19 May 2011] to myself (and Gary [Rudge]).

As a consequence we will stand aside and the Committee will be Greg (Chair), Pete [Sweney] and Maurice.”


	
	On 30 May 2011 Mr Bulloch sent an email to Mr Pringle which was copied to Mr Rudge, Mr Rudolph, Mr Sweney and Mr Logue, in which he raised his concern that there had been no response to the Amended Show Cause Notice. Mr Bulloch asked Mr Pringle to visit the plaintiff’s property to see if he had received it. Mr Pringle reported by email to Mr Bulloch sent later that day that he had visited the plaintiff’s property but the gate was padlocked and he could not see any sign of anyone being there. He confirmed that he had made numerous calls to his house but there had been no response.
	


The plaintiff’s further conduct


	
	On Monday 30 May 2011, the plaintiff held two placards outside the office of the Commonwealth Member of Parliament Janelle Saffin in Lismore. One read:
	


“RACING NSW CORRUPT

CEO ROBS TAXPAYERS”


	
	The other read:
	


“CHAPS PUBLIC AUDIT REPORTS $220,000,000 MISAPPROPRIATION PUBLIC INQUIRY NEEDED”


	
	There is no evidence that the plaintiff’s further conduct came to the attention of the Licensing Committee at, or prior to, the Show Cause Hearing on 31 May 2011.
	


The First Show Cause Hearing: 31 May 2011


	
	The Licensing Committee, constituted by Mr Rudolph, Mr Sweney and Mr Logue, conducted the First Show Cause Hearing on 31 May 2011. The plaintiff did not attend.
	
	
	Following the hearing, the Licensing Committee informed Mr V’landys:
	



	
	that it was satisfied that the plaintiff:
	



	
	had been adequately put on notice of the hearing by the First Show Cause Notice; and
	
	
	had failed to show cause why his trainer’s licence ought not be suspended or revoked on the basis that he was not a fit and proper person on the basis of his letters of 10 May 2011 and 19 May 2011;
	



	
	that it was not satisfied that he had received the Amended Show Cause Notice;
	
	
	that it had considered, in deciding on a recommended penalty, the plaintiff’s “complete lack of contrition or remorse” and the aggravation of the original conduct (the letter of 10 May 2011) by the sending of the letter on 19 May 2011; and
	
	
	that it recommended that:
	



	
	the plaintiff’s trainer’s licence be revoked for a period of six months; and
	
	
	the show cause hearing based on the Amended Show Cause Notice be adjourned to 24 June 2011 at which time his further conduct would be considered.
	



	
	The report of the First Show Cause Hearing was contained in a memorandum dated 6 June 2011 from the Licensing Committee to Mr V’landys. It made provision at the end of the document for Mr V’landys to agree or disagree with the recommendations. The document recorded that Mr V’landys accepted the recommendations by signing the memorandum.
	
	
	On Tuesday, 7 June 2011, a local paper, The Northern Star, published a story with the headline, “Trainer’s protest over equine flu payments”, which was accompanied by a photograph of the plaintiff outside Ms Saffin’s electorate office, beside the same sign as he had displayed on Grafton Bridge the previous week.
	


The First Determination


	
	As referred to above, Mr V’landys accepted the recommendations of the Licensing Committee. By letter dated 8 June 2011, he informed the plaintiff of the recommendations and the decision to revoke his trainer’s licence for six months (the First Determination). The letter concluded:
	


“I confirm that the decision to revoke your licence is a decision of Racing NSW and your rights of appeal are set out in the Racing Appeals Tribunal Act. In this respect, an appeal is made by lodging a written notice of appeal within 7 days of the date of notification of the decision of Racing NSW.”


	
	The plaintiff’s evidence was that when he received the notice revoking his horse trainer’s licence, he was very ill with yet-to-be diagnosed Graves’ disease. I am not satisfied that any indisposition from which he was suffering at the time was such as to compromise his capacity to lodge an appeal by sending a written notice. He seems to have been capable of sitting or standing beside large placards in prominent locations in the open air for hours at a stretch and writing letters in May and June 2011.
	
	
	Moreover, in his cross-examination, he gave as a reason for not appealing that he was still waiting for a response from Allan Brown, the Chairman of the Board. This was the same letter to which he referred in his letter of 18 June 2011 (referred to below). That he gave this reason is a powerful indication that, although he may have been in relatively poor health at the time, his health was not a material factor in his decision not to appeal during the seven-day period allowed.
	


The 8 June 2011 Show Cause Notice


	
	On the same day, 8 June 2011, Mr V’landys wrote a further letter to the plaintiff about his further conduct in displaying the two placards outside Ms Saffin’s electorate office. He invited him to make submissions, noted the “extreme importance” of the matter and warned the plaintiff that if he did not appear the Licensing Committee would proceed in his absence.
	


Instructions given to Kennedys to write to the plaintiff


	
	The defendants conceded that, at some time on 8 June 2011, they instructed Kennedys, solicitors, concerning the plaintiff’s conduct. Patrick George, a senior partner of that firm, drafted three letters which were addressed to the plaintiff; and the editors of The Northern Star and Coolum News respectively. They were in similar terms. The draft letter to the plaintiff was in the following terms:
	


“Dear Sir

DEFAMATION

We act for Racing New South Wales and its chief executive office[r], Mr Peter V’landys.

You were quoted on 7 June 2011, in the Northern Star Newspaper and the Coolum News and photographed outside the office of Federal MP Janelle Saffin holding a placard that states ‘Racing NSW Corrupt CEO Robs Taxpayers’. We further note you were standing next to the Grafton Bridge on 23 May 2011 holding a placard with the same words- ‘Racing NSW Corrupt CEO Robs Taxpayers’

The statement conveys the following false and defamatory imputations of and concerning Peter V’landys:

(i)   That Mr V’landys as the CEO of Racing NSW is corrupt.

(ii)   That Mr V’landys as the CEO of Racing NSW robs taxpayers;

Your conduct in displaying such a sign and allowing yourself to be photographed with the sign is seriously defamatory and in bad faith, particularly when you are aware that there were no grounds for an independent judicial inquiry into the administration of the CHAPS scheme. In order to minimize the harm already caused, Mr V’landys requires that you:

1   Publish a retraction and an unreserved apology in a form to be agreed by our client within 7 days of the date of this letter;

2   Take all necessary steps to avoid further repetition of such statements or anything similar;

3   Take all reasonable steps to inform any person to whom the material was published that the media statements complained of were false and defamatory of Mr V’landys and that you have withdrawn them and apologized for them in the form agreed as set out in paragraph 1.

4   Pay our client’s damages and reasonable legal costs.

We reserve our client’s rights generally.

Please confirm your agreement to our client’s demands.”


	
	By email sent at 3.43pm on 10 June 2011 Mr Sweney sent the three draft letters of demand to Mr V’landys for his approval. I infer from the fact that the plaintiff received the letter that Mr V’landys had approved of its contents and had given instructions that at least the letter to the plaintiff be sent.
	
	
	On 16 June 2011 the 8 June 2011 Show Cause Notice was served on the plaintiff by Tim Saladine, the Deputy Chairman of Stewards. The plaintiff told Mr Saladine that he would not attend any inquiry held at the offices of Racing NSW.
	
	
	At 9.27am on 16 June 2011 Mr Bulloch sent an email to Mr Sweney attaching “the summary of the Joe Golden matter that is in my monthly Board report”. The report referred to the various notices and the First Show Cause Hearing and the First Determination. There was no mention of the letter from Kennedys to the plaintiff.
	
	
	The plaintiff responded to the 8 June 2011 Show Cause Notice by a letter dated 18 June 2011 to the Licensing Committee of Racing NSW in the following terms:
	


“Subject: letters 8th June delivered 16th June

Dear Sirs,

I will not be attending 24th June meeting request.

I still await a reply from your chairman RNSW A.BROWN & V’landys in his haste has already issued penalties, which demonstrates his unprofessional conduct.

In the event that I am unable to meet with the entire RNSW Board, I will assume V’landys [sic] conduct in 2007-2008 was with the full RSNSW Board approval.

And as regards V’landys defamation solicitors [sic] letter to me, if they are silly enough to proceed with defamation charges against me, this will fall in perfectly with my plans in exposing RNSW and V’landys in misappropriating millions of taxpayers [sic] monies and supporting fraudulent criminal CHAPS claims. Please advise solicitors to proceed.

Sincerely

Joseph Golden (3372 SUSPENDED!!)”


	
	I infer from the contents of the letter set out above that Kennedys sent the letter to the plaintiff, a draft of which is set out above.
	


The Second Show Cause Hearing: 24 June 2011


	
	The Second Show Cause Hearing took place on 24 June 2011. The Licensing Committee was constituted by Mr Bulloch, Mr Sweney and Mr Rudge. Mr Nicholson was also present. The plaintiff did not attend. At the conclusion of the hearing, the transcript recorded the following decision of the Licensing Committee:
	


“Keith Bulloch:   The Licencing Committee resumes the matter of Joseph Golden. The committee has considered the evidence before it as submitted and tabled by Mr Sweeny and marked Exhibits 1-4. It is the decision of the committee to recommend to the chief executive that Mr Golden had adequate notice to appear or to show cause by the written submission why action should be taken against him. There was a written submission received. The committee decision is to recommend to the chief executive that Mr Golden has failed to show cause why action should not be taken and further that the recommended action should be that he be warned off all racecourses within the control of Racing NSW on the basis that his presence on racecourses is not desirable. The committee did give consideration as to whether there should be a fixed period for that warning off which is a matter or which is a penalty which has been handed down in recent times but it is our view and decision that the behaviour exhibited to date by Mr Golden and further the lack of remorse or contrition in the subsequent letter that he forwarded Racing NSW shows no sign that the behaviour will change and for that reason it goes back to the fundamental examples of why the penalty of warning off has been previously used so we intend to make that recommendation to the CEO and also advise if the CEO adopts that penalty that Mr Golden be advised his rights of appeal to the Racing Appeals Tribunal. That concludes the hearing.”


	
	The Licensing Committee reported its decision to Mr V’landys in a memorandum dated 24 June 2011. It recorded that it was not satisfied to the requisite standard that the plaintiff had shown cause why he should not be warned off racecourses within the control of Racing NSW. The memorandum concluded:
	


“In deciding on a recommended penalty, the Licensing Committee considered that Mr Golden’s complete lack of contrition or remorse in respect of his conduct demonstrated that it was extremely unlikely that his behaviour would change at any time in the foreseeable future. As such, it was appropriate to recommend warning off for an unlimited period of time. In making this recommendation, the Licensing Committee gave due regard to the fact that Mr Golden can apply to Racing NSW to have the warning off order lifted.

The Licensing Committee recommends that Mr Golden be warned off from all racecourses within the control of Racing NSW on the basis that his presence on racecourses is not desirable.”


	
	The memorandum made provision for Mr V’landys to agree or disagree with the recommendation. He signed the memorandum to signify his acceptance of the recommendation.
	


The Second Determination


	
	By letter dated 24 June 2011 Mr V’landys wrote to the plaintiff to inform him of the recommendation of the Licensing Committee, which he had adopted (the Second Determination). He confirmed that the decision was a decision of Racing NSW and informed him of his rights of appeal to the Tribunal and that an appeal is made by lodging a written notice within seven days of the date of notification of the decision.
	
	
	By letter dated 4 July 2011, Kennedys wrote to the plaintiff in the following terms:
	


“We refer to our letter to you dated 10 June 2011.

We note we have not received a response. We are instructed to commence legal proceedings against you, should you fail to meet our client’s demands within 7 days of the date of this letter.

Your failure to respond and/or apologize will be relied upon in aggravation.”


	
	On 13 January 2012 the plaintiff wrote to Racing NSW asking for an extension of time to appeal to the Tribunal against the revocation of his trainer’s licence and against the warning off. Racing NSW forwarded the letter to the Tribunal. The Tribunal called for submissions on whether it had jurisdiction to hear an appeal that was lodged out of time.
	
	
	The plaintiff wrote to Racing NSW by letter dated 27 February 2012 seeking “an unbiased decision in my appeal”. He described himself as a “victimised whistle blower” who was being “punished” at the hands of an “incompetent and corrupt CEO”. He did not address whether the Tribunal had power to extend time within which to lodge an appeal.
	
	
	By submission dated 5 March 2012 addressed to the Tribunal, Mr Sweney (on behalf of Racing NSW) submitted that the letter of 13 January 2012 did not constitute a “written notice of appeal” for the purposes of cl 6(1) of the RAT Regulations as it was out of time.
	
	
	On 2 April 2012 the plaintiff forwarded to the Tribunal a detailed 15-page written submission in support of his application for an extension of time. He referred to his health at the relevant time and attached a doctor’s report referring to a thyroid scan indicative of Graves’ disease.
	
	
	On 7 May 2012 the Tribunal wrote to the plaintiff enclosing its determination of his application to extend time made on 27 April 2012. The Tribunal’s conclusion appears from the final paragraphs of its reasons:
	


“24. The Tribunal finds that clause 6 requires compliance within its precise terms and such compliance is an essential preliminary to the exercise of the statutory power to hear an appeal. The Tribunal does not find that the requirements of clause 6 deal with mere procedural conditions but are essential preliminaries to a statutory power. This can be further explained on the basis that a lawful appeal must be lodged before the procedural requirements for the management of that lawful appeal are considered.

25. In the circumstances the Tribunal determines that the ‘appeal’ was lodged outside the timeframe provided by clause 6 and that there is no power in the Tribunal to extend the 7 day provided in that clause.

26. To the extent that the Tribunal may be in error in finding there is no power to extend time, it nevertheless comes to the conclusion that Mr Golden has not demonstrated any factual reason to extend any discretion, should such a discretion exist, to extend time. In particular the Tribunal does not find that an extension from 5 July 2011 to 13 January 2012 could be granted on the facts available to it.

27. In view of these findings it is not necessary for the Tribunal to determine whether the letter of 13 January 2012 was a written notice of appeal for the purposes of clause 6.

28. The effect of non-complying with an essential preliminary is that there is at law no appeal before this Tribunal and that it therefore has no jurisdiction, and cannot clothe itself with jurisdiction, to determine an appeal or an application to appeal out of time.

29. The Tribunal determines that it does not have jurisdiction to deal with the application of Mr Golden of 13 January 2012 to extend time to lodge an appeal, nor an appeal.”

The bases of the plaintiff’s claims for judicial review of the First and Second Determinations


	
	The plaintiff contended that both determinations are invalid on six grounds: actual bias; apprehended bias; improper purpose; irrelevant considerations; bad faith; and unreasonableness and serious illogicality. These bases will be considered in turn.
	


Allegations of bias: actual and apprehended


	
	The plaintiff, in his Second Further Amended Statement of Claim, set out the particulars relied on in support both of the allegation of bias, or, alternatively, apprehended bias:
	


“A.   Mr Golden had attacked Mr V’landys as being incompetent and corrupt and had done so in public;

B.   Mr V’landys in his letter of 10 June 2011 had threatened to exercise his private law rights against Mr Golden in respect of the public criticisms of Mr V’landys which were said to be seriously defamatory;

C.   Mr V’landys in his letter of 10 June 2011 had demanded the payment of damages and legal costs;

D.   Mr V’landys in his letter of 10 June 2011 had taken the opportunity to deny Mr Golden’s allegations regarding the CHAP system.”

The relevance of the process adopted to the allegations of bias


	
	No allegation is made that the Licensing Committee was either actually biased or that any matter associated with the Licensing Committee gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. Nor was it alleged that Mr V’landys had in any way interfered with the Licensing Committee’s process or deliberations.
	
	
	The narrative above indicates that it was Mr Bulloch who initiated the proposals that a show cause letter be sent to the plaintiff arising from his conduct on Grafton Bridge; and that Mr V’landys sub-delegate his power from the Board to the Licensing Committee to issue a show cause notice and conduct a show cause hearing and make a recommendation to him. Mr Bulloch’s initiative was the genesis of the First Determination. Mr V’landys merely agreed to the sub-delegation; adopted Mr Bulloch’s proposed wording; accepted the recommendation when it came to him after the hearing; signed the memorandum without comment; and signed the letter that constituted the First Determination.
	
	
	The Second Determination was made in similar manner to the first in that Mr V’landys accepted the advice of Mr Bulloch as to procedure, including the wording of the sub-delegation; accepted the recommendation of the Licensing Committee; signed the memorandum without comment; and signed the letter that constituted the Second Determination.
	
	
	Nonetheless the plaintiff submitted that, because Mr V’landys retained a discretion to accept or reject or amend the Licensing Committee’s recommendations, the conclusion was still available that his decision was affected by actual or apprehended bias, even though he did no more than accept the recommendations of the (admittedly unbiased) Licensing Committee. The plaintiff contended (in his written submissions):
	


“Needless to say, a biased decision may just as easily be made as part of an otherwise fair process as one which is otherwise unfair.”

[Emphasis in original.]


	
	The defendants, however, relied on the fairness of the process and submitted that the process Mr V’landys and Racing NSW adopted and the recommendations it produced (which were accepted without amendment) was inconsistent with bias, whether actual or apprehended.
	
	
	I consider the process adopted makes it inherently improbable that Mr V’landys was motivated by actual bias. The process he adopted, which was, in the circumstances of the present case, initiated by Mr Bulloch as Chair of the Licensing Committee, and the fact that any decision he made would be subject to an automatic right of appeal to the Tribunal pursuant to s 15(1)(d) of the RAT Act, was, in my view, inconsistent with actual bias. However, although the process was fair, it is nonetheless necessary to consider the other bases on which the plaintiff sought to establish actual bias since the fairness of the process, while indicative, is not determinative.
	


Actual bias


	
	An allegation of actual bias is a serious one. It must be shown by cogent evidence that the decision-maker’s mind was not open to persuasion: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17; 205 CLR 507 at [71], [75] and [78] per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J. It must be “distinctly made and clearly proved”: at [69]. The test for actual bias is a subjective one: Michael Wilson and Partners Ltd v Nicholls [2011] HCA 48; 244 CLR 427 at [33].
	
	
	In Minister for Immigration v Jia Legeng, Gleeson CJ and Gummow J described as “orthodox” the test for actual bias applied by French J at first instance, which they summarised at [36]-[37] in the following terms:
	


“[36]   . . . where there is a claim of actual bias involving prejudgment, the applicant must show that the decision-maker ‘had a closed mind to the issues raised and was not open to persuasion by the applicant's case’, and that actual bias exists where ‘the decision-maker has prejudged the case against the applicant, or acted with such partisanship or hostility as to show that the decision-maker had a mind made up against the applicant and was not open to persuasion in favour of the applicant’.

[37] French J found that the evidence indicated that the Minister had formed, on the basis of Mr Jia's convictions and sentence, a view strongly adverse to the conclusion that he could be described as a person of good character. However, he said, the question was whether, by his mental state, the Minister was disabled from or unwilling to have regard to other relevant circumstances. French J expressed his conclusions as follows:

‘The onus of demonstrating actual bias lies upon an applicant for judicial review and it is a heavy onus. The fact that an applicant may have demonstrated that on the decision-maker's provisional views he has an uphill job to persuade him away from those views is not enough to demonstrate actual bias. . .’”

[Footnotes omitted.]


	
	As the English Court of Appeal held in Flaherty v National Greyhound Racing Club Ltd [2005] EWCA 1117 at [28]:
	


“Bias means a predisposition or prejudice against one party’s case or evidence on an issue for reasons unconnected with the merits of the issue.”


	
	The plaintiff’s allegation of actual bias appears to be based, not on prejudgment (of which there is no evidence), but on interest. The plaintiff submitted that because of Mr V’landys concern for his reputation and his potential claim for damages for defamation against the plaintiff, he was actually biased against him when making the First and Second Determinations because he had an economic interest at stake.
	
	
	As recorded above, the defendants conceded that Kennedys had first been instructed on 8 June 2011. This was the day on which the First Determination was made. The commencement of the process that led to the First Determination had pre-dated that day by about four weeks, since it was on 13 May 2011 that Mr Bulloch had suggested a sub-delegation to the Licensing Committee arising from the plaintiff’s letter of 10 May 2011.
	
	
	Even assuming (against Mr V’landys) that he had given instructions that the Kennedys letter be sent before he made the First Determination (a matter which I do not consider to have been established on the balance of probabilities), I do not consider that any financial interest Mr V’landys might have had in the outcome of any defamation proceedings (and there is no evidence that there were any such proceedings), was such as to make him actually biased against the plaintiff.
	
	
	The question of the effect of a judge’s financial interest in the outcome of litigation arose in Ebner v Official Trustee [2000] HCA 63; 205 CLR 337. In that case, the judge was the beneficiary of a trust which owned shares in a bank which, though not party to the litigation, had an interest in the outcome. The High Court found that the judge was not disqualified from hearing the matter. The applicant argued that if a judge has a direct pecuniary interest in the outcome of a case then the judge is automatically disqualified. The High Court rejected the test proposed and said at [58]:
	


“For reasons already given, we accept that, in the practical application of the general test to be applied in cases of apprehended bias, economic conflicts of interest are likely to be of particular significance, and that, allowing for the imprecision of the concept, the circumstance that a judge has a not insubstantial, direct, pecuniary or proprietary interest in the outcome of litigation will ordinarily result in disqualification. That circumstance did not exist in either of the present cases.”


	
	Although this statement was made in the context of apprehended, rather than actual, bias, it is nonetheless useful to determine whether, in the present case, the circumstance that Mr V’landys had accused the plaintiff of defamation and demanded damages and reasonable legal costs meant that he had a financial interest in the making of the First Determination (on the assumption set out above) and the Second Determination such as to make him actually biased.
	
	
	Mr V’landys had no financial interest in the First or Second Determinations, since both resulted in disciplinary action against the plaintiff which did not benefit Mr V’landys in any direct sense. Mr V’landys had an interest in protecting his own reputation. However, his interest in protecting his own reputation was closely allied with Racing NSW’s protection of its reputation and, in turn, their common interest in protecting the reputation of the horse racing industry in New South Wales. Although the Kennedys letter demanded money from the plaintiff (for damages and reasonable legal costs), it did not quantify any sum. The letter was directed to obtaining both an apology for past conduct and an undertaking from the plaintiff not to repeat the conduct.
	
	
	The plaintiff postulated that Mr V’landys would bear him some personal animus as a result of the abuse and the alleged damage the plaintiff had caused to Mr V’landys’ reputation and that this would incline Mr V’landys to want to punish the plaintiff by revoking his licence and warning him off. This conjecture falls far short of proof. The plaintiff bears the onus of establishing actual bias; it is not for Mr V’landys to positively demonstrate its absence.
	
	
	I reject the suggestion that Mr V’landys was actually biased against the plaintiff because of his interest in protecting his reputation. A person in Mr V’landys position would expect criticism from the public. Wherever money is concerned, particularly where gains and losses may seem to be a matter of chance, emotions can run high. Criticisms of institutions, such as Racing NSW, are frequently directed at the public face of the institution, and often at the person who is seen to be leading the institution. Mr V’landys, as the Chief Executive of Racing NSW, occupied such a position. As such, it could be expected that any complaint about Racing NSW would, or might, involve a complaint about him and his administration of Racing NSW. Any individual, such as the plaintiff, who had a grievance against Racing NSW, might decide to personalise the grievance (rightly or wrongly) by criticising Mr V’landys.
	
	
	Moreover, as Mr V’landys’ delegated authority from the Board was so extensive, he could justifiably be held responsible for all manner of matters (whether directly involving him or not) including: the administration of CHAPS; a ruling as to how frequently a horse could be raced; whether a scratching fee should be refunded; whether his power ought be sub-delegated to the Licensing Committee; whether a licence ought be suspended or revoked and whether someone ought be warned off; and (presumably) whether someone who had been warned off should have the warning off annulled.
	
	
	Mr V’landys was subjected to a degree of abuse from the plaintiff. The objective reason for the action taken by Racing NSW was that the plaintiff’s conduct tended to be detrimental to horse racing because it involved the public denigration of Racing NSW and its Chief Executive, who happened at the time to be Mr V’landys, in language which was objectively offensive and crude and which was presented in a manner which was conducive neither to analysis nor discussion.
	
	
	In these circumstances, if criticism of Racing NSW and of Mr V’landys were to lead to Mr V’landys having to step aside, the system would soon reach a stage whereby individual parties could effectively remove Mr V’landys from the decision-making process entirely: cf. Ebner v Official Trustee at [20]. Although the plaintiff placed great significance on the Kennedys letter as placing the present case in a special category, I do not regard it as having that effect. Nor do I regard the circumstance that the Board does not appear to have been informed of the Kennedys letter as a material non-disclosure which leads to an inference of bias. In the circumstances of the present case, the Kennedys letter was an incidental matter. There is no suggestion, in any event, that Mr V’landys would have had to pay Kennedys himself for legal costs, since Racing NSW was also responsible for retaining them.
	
	
	This is not to suggest that the plaintiff was not entitled in the exercise of his right to free speech to express his opinions about Racing NSW or Mr V’landys in public, but rather to record that I am satisfied that there was a basis for the action taken by Mr V’landys and Racing NSW, which does not, in my view, indicate actual bias. The plaintiff has failed to establish actual bias.
	


Apprehended bias


	
	In [62] of the pleading, the plaintiff alleged:
	


“Further or in the alternative, a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably have apprehended that Mr V’landys might not have brought an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the question of whether to adopt the recommendation of the Licensing Committee that was the subject of the First and/or Second Determination.”


	
	The relevant test for apprehended bias was as stated in Re Refugee Tribunal; Ex Parte H [2001] HCA 28; 75 ALJR 982 at [28]:
	


“[whether] a hypothetical fair minded lay person who is properly informed as to the nature of the proceedings, the matters in issue and the conduct which is said to give rise to an apprehension of bias [would reach that conclusion].”


	
	The principle, as articulated in Ebner v Official Trustee at [6] (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ) is:
	


“. . . a judge [or other decision-maker] is disqualified if a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge [or other decision-maker] might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide.”

[Footnotes omitted.]


	
	Although this is the principle, it is not appropriate to approach its application without reference to the statutory context set out above since this is, properly, the starting point: McGovern v Ku-ring-gai Council [2008] NSWCA 209; 72 NSWLR 504 at [6] per Spigelman CJ. The hypothetical fair-minded observer is to be assumed to be aware of the actual circumstances of the case: Hot Holdings Pty Ltd v Creasy [2002] HCA 51; 210 CLR 438 at [68] and [76]. Thus, such a person would have been aware of the matters set out above as to the genesis of the show cause notices and hearings and how Mr V’landys’ power had come to be sub-delegated to the Licensing Committee.
	
	
	Such an observer would also have been aware that, far from desisting from the conduct the subject of the First Show Cause Notice when he received it, the plaintiff persisted in the conduct as well as responding to the notice in crude and insulting language, apparently designed to offend and disgust the recipients. The observer would also have known that the plaintiff chose not to make submissions to the Licensing Committee at either of the show cause hearings.
	
	
	The observer would also have been aware that Mr V’landys (either personally or through an agent) had, at some time on 8 June 2011, consulted solicitors regarding the plaintiff’s conduct and that by 10 June 2011 (after the First Determination but prior to the second) he had instructed them to draft a letter to the plaintiff regarding his statements to the press and his conduct in displaying the placard. I infer that the draft letter was seen by Mr V’landys on 10 June 2011, at which time he instructed his solicitor to send it.
	
	
	The so-called “two mights” test from [6] in Ebner v Official Trustee (set out above) is the first part of the inquiry into the question of apprehension of bias. The second part appears from the following extract from at [8]:
	


“[8] The apprehension of bias principle admits of the possibility of human frailty. Its application is as diverse as human frailty. Its application requires two steps. First, it requires the identification of what it is said might lead a judge (or juror) to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits. The second step is no less important. There must be an articulation of the logical connection between the matter and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the case on its merits. The bare assertion that a judge (or juror) has an ""interest"" in litigation, or an interest in a party to it, will be of no assistance until the nature of the interest, and the asserted connection with the possibility of departure from impartial decision making, is articulated. Only then can the reasonableness of the asserted apprehension of bias be assessed.”


	
	I am not persuaded that the plaintiff has been able to articulate a “logical connection” between, on the one hand, the circumstances that Mr V’landys’ title appeared on the signs and that he had alleged that the plaintiff had defamed him; and, on the other, the plaintiff’s feared deviation from Mr V’landys’ deciding whether to accept the recommendations of the Licensing Committee and make the First and Second Determinations.
	
	
	Neither the allegation of actual bias, nor of apprehended bias has been made out.
	


Improper purpose


	
	The plaintiff relied on the following in support of his submission that Mr V’landys made the First and Second Determinations for an improper purpose:
	



	
	the conduct the subject of the show cause notices did not take place on a racecourse;
	
	
	the conduct did not “concern horseracing”; and
	
	
	the conduct “did not in any way affect the control, supervision or regulation of horseracing”.
	



	
	An improper purpose will not lightly be inferred. The inference of improper purpose will only be drawn if the evidence cannot be reconciled with the proper exercise of the power: Industrial Equity Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1990) 170 CLR 649 at 672. In my view, the plaintiff’s submissions do not take adequate account of the functions and powers of Racing NSW. The functions of Racing NSW include ensuring that those licensed in various capacities in the horse racing industry (whether as jockeys, trainers, and so on) are “fit and proper persons” having regard to “the need to protect the public interest as it relates to the horse racing industry”: s 14AA(1) of the Thoroughbred Racing Act. Protection of the public interest in the horse racing industry includes protection of the reputation of the industry.
	
	
	I accept Mr V’landys’ submission that sporting and professional associations tend to have rules, such as AR 175, which empower the governing body to penalise certain conduct by participants. The purpose of these rules is to prevent participants in the sport from insulting those who administer the sport in general or who play a particular role such as umpiring a particular race or match since this conduct, if allowed to go unchecked, is said to bring the particular sport into disrepute. This rule was not relied on by Mr V’landys in support of the First or Second Determination but serves to provide an illustration of the general extent of the power under s 13 with respect to the horse racing industry.
	
	
	The First and Second Determinations can be seen to arise from a concern that the plaintiff’s public statements and the manner of their expression and publication was such as would tend to diminish the reputation of the horse racing industry. There is nothing in either of the determinations which would suggest that they were intended to achieve any purpose other than to get the plaintiff to stop making public outbursts of that nature and writing abusive correspondence to Racing NSW and, perhaps, to stop other persons who harbour a grievance against Racing NSW from believing that they could air their own views in a similar fashion with impunity.
	
	
	Thus, no inference that Mr V’landys acted with an improper purpose can be drawn about his subjective intention from the determinations themselves, since they are consistent with a proper exercise of the power.
	
	
	Mr V’landys was not required to give reasons beyond what appeared in the determinations. There is no evidence otherwise of Mr V’landys’ actual subjective intention and no proper basis for any inference as to its content: Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZGUR [2011] HCA 1; 241 CLR 594 at [66]-[68] per Gummow J. Accordingly, the ground of improper purpose has not been made out.
	


Irrelevant consideration


	
	The same matters have been raised by the plaintiff in support of this contention as were raised in the context of improper purpose. The plaintiff’s conduct was the issue: it was the matter that had a tendency to bring the industry of horse racing into disrepute. Whether he stood on Grafton Bridge or on the streets of the neighbouring town was not to the point: the point was that his utterances were such as to have a tendency to bring the horse racing industry into disrepute. He did not have to be on a racecourse to bring about that result.
	
	
	This ground has not been made out.
	


Bad faith


	
	The plaintiff submitted that in making the First and Second Determinations Mr V’landys sought to punish the plaintiff for criticising him. He accepted that he was required to prove Mr V’landys’ state of mind: SBBS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) 194 ALR 79 at [43]. The plaintiff contended that Mr V’landys’ decision not to give evidence allows me to draw an inference that nothing he could have said would have assisted him. He contended that I ought infer that the subjective motivations of Mr V’landys were, in substance, vindictive.
	
	
	The seriousness of an allegation of bad faith is not in question. In SCAS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 397 at [19] the Court (Heerey, Moore and Kiefel JJ) said:
	


“An allegation of bad faith is a very serious one. Bad faith in this context implies a lack of an honest or genuine attempt to undertake the task and involves a personal attack on the honesty of the decision maker: NAAV v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 228 at [107] - [108]. It is no less serious if it is said to arise from conduct of the type discussed by von Doussa J in SCAZ v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs. While members of the legal profession representing disappointed applicants for protection visas may often act for reasons of high principle, and on many occasions pro bono, that is no warrant for making the serious allegation if it is not justified on the material. . . .But because of the nature of the allegation of bad faith, serious questions of professional ethics arise. It should be clearly understood that an allegation of bad faith, like an allegation of fraud, should not be advanced by an advocate unless there are proper grounds for doing so.”


	
	I do not regard the allegation of bad faith as justified by the material. It ought not to have been made. No relevant inference arises from the fact that Mr V’landys did not give evidence since no foundation for the allegation has been made. I do not consider there to be any basis for the contention that Mr V’landys did not make an honest and genuine attempt in good faith to make the correct and preferable decisions when he made the First and Second Determinations, on the basis of the consideration of the Licensing Committee based on the memoranda and recommendations that had been made to him.
	


Unreasonableness and serious illogicality


	
	The plaintiff’s written submission on this ground was:
	


“The First and Second Determinations were made without evidence of any intelligible or plausible justification. Mr Golden’s conduct in standing in two public places unrelated to racetracks and making statements unrelated to horseracing, or in writing letters saying similar, could not reasonably give rise to a finding that the presence of Mr Golden on racetracks was not desirable. In this respect, the decision to warn Mr Golden off racetracks is a “glaring injustice” (Fuduche v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (1993) 45 FCR 515 at 529) of the type to which the reasonableness ground of review is properly directed.”


	
	As with several of the other grounds, the plaintiff’s submissions depend on acceptance of the proposition that what he was doing in standing on the Grafton Bridge and displaying a placard there and in the town centre had nothing to do with horse racing. For the reasons already given, I do not accept this proposition. There was, in my view, a rational connection between his conduct and the reputation of the horse racing industry.
	
	
	As was said in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Li [2013] HCA 18; 249 CLR 332 at [76] (Hayne, Kiefel and Bell JJ):
	


“Unreasonableness is a conclusion which may be applied to a decision which lacks an evident and intelligible justification.”


	
	In the present case, the justification for the First and Second Determinations is both evident and intelligible from the evidence and from the terms in which they were communicated to the plaintiff. When deciding how to stop the plaintiff’s conduct, Racing NSW had a range of methods that could potentially be used: revoking or suspending his licence or warning him off. The method of threatening revocation or suspension of his licence, which was the first method tried (as reflected in the First Show Cause Notice) did not produce the desired effect. To the contrary, the plaintiff escalated his conduct and became even more abusive. This left the threat of warning off. When the plaintiff refused to make submissions, much less to apologise or express any contrition, the Second Determination was made, with the consequence that he was warned off.
	
	
	I note that the submissions made on behalf of Mr V’landys included a submission that the warning off power was not used, as a matter of objective inference, as a deterrent to Mr V’landys, designed to chasten him into modifying his behaviour for the better, but rather to protect the race-going public from being confronted by his placards and belligerence on race day. Notwithstanding this submission, I consider the inference to be available that one purpose, which was a legitimate one, of warning off the plaintiff, was to get him to modify his conduct so that whatever criticisms he might make would be made in a more civilised way, which did not involve offensive denigration of Racing NSW or Mr V’landys. I accept that another, proper, purpose, was to protect the public from his crude remonstrance on race day.
	
	
	It is important to note that the Second Determination did not have the effect that the plaintiff was warned off racecourses (with all that such a penalty entailed) for the rest of his natural life. What it meant was that, in order to have the warning off lifted, the plaintiff would have to apply to Racing NSW. It appears from the material that there is at least some prospect of such an order being lifted if the person subjected to the warning off expresses remorse, contrition and indicates that he or she will not behave in a similar way again. Indeed, Mr V’landys’ defence specifically alleges that the plaintiff “could apply to Racing NSW, at any time, to lift the warning off order”.
	
	
	The plaintiff confirmed in the hearing that he had never made any attempt to have the warning off lifted by Racing NSW and did not propose to. In this respect, as in others, he has proved to be the author of his own predicament.
	


Discretion


	
	As none of the grounds of challenge has been made out, it is not necessary to consider the question of discretion. However, for completeness, I propose to give brief reasons for my view that, had any challenge been made out, I would not have exercised my discretion to grant relief.
	
	
	The right of appeal to the Tribunal was readily available to the plaintiff. He was amply notified of the right and of the time limit. He was not relevantly indisposed. He was able to write documents throughout the period and, had he been minded to, such documents could have included a notice of appeal to the Tribunal. He would have, in that event, had a fresh hearing on the merits before a Tribunal whose members did not include Mr V’landys. The Tribunal would have been obliged to consider whether any penalty was warranted, and, if so, what penalty.
	
	
	For the reasons given above, the plaintiff chose, through some mistaken view of his entitlement to receive a letter from the Chairman of the Board, not to activate his rights of appeal. Although the availability of a statutory appeal is no bar to relief on judicial review, it is a powerful factor against the grant of such relief: Boral Gas (NSW) Pty Ltd v Magill (1993) 32 NSWLR 501 at 508-509 per Kirby P.
	
	
	It appears that it was only in early 2012 when the plaintiff learned of the true extent of the warning off that he saw fit to challenge the decision. He may have been under the misapprehension previously that he was simply warned off racecourses, rather than that he was prohibited from all manner of activities associated with horse racing, including betting, by reason of the operation of AR 182, 182A and 183.
	
	
	Nonetheless the Tribunal did not simply refuse to consider his application although it was out of time. Although it accepted that it did not have jurisdiction to hear his appeal it addressed the merits of his application for extension and declined to grant it.
	
	
	Further, the time for which the plaintiff’s licence was revoked has long passed. The current impediment to his activities is the warning off, which remains in place at least potentially because he has taken no step to ask Racing NSW that it be lifted. His remedy is in his own hands and yet he has steadfastly refused to lift a finger to grasp it. In these circumstances I am not persuaded that it would be appropriate for this Court to exercise its discretion in his favour.
	


Misfeasance in public office


	
	For the reasons given above the tort of misfeasance in public office must fail as no misfeasance has been established. As Mr V’landys did not give evidence, there is no basis other than in the documents from which his intention could be established. Thus, I enjoy no advantage as trial judge in making a determination of his intention. Nonetheless as part of my obligation to make all relevant findings, I propose to address the elements of the tort.
	
	
	The elements of the tort of misfeasance in public office are:
	



	
	a public officer has purported to exercise power;
	
	
	the purported exercise of power is ultra vires or otherwise wrongful;
	
	
	the public officer, when purporting to exercise the power:
	



	
	was malicious, that is, was intending to injure the plaintiff; or
	
	
	did so, with actual knowledge that there was no power and that the conduct was calculated to produce the injury; or
	
	
	was recklessly indifferent to the existence of the power and the possibility that injury would be suffered; and
	



	
	the plaintiff has in fact suffered damage: Farrington v Thomson and Bridgland [1959] VR 286 at 293 per Smith J.
	



	
	(Northern Territory v Mengel (1995) 185 CLR 307).
	



	
	Of these elements, the plaintiff has established only the first. Element (2) has not been established for the reasons given above by reference to the grounds of challenge.
	
	
	The plaintiff relied on the following in support of his submission that he had established that Mr V’landys had the requisite mental element for the tort of misfeasance in public office:
	



	
	the content of the Kennedys letter, which “clearly placed Mr V’landys in a position of conflict”;
	
	
	Mr V’landys had been the Chief Executive of Racing NSW for seven and a half years at the time of the decisions;
	
	
	Mr V’landys was bound by the Code of Conduct;
	
	
	despite these requirements, Mr V’landys did not tell the Board about the Kennedys letter, which ought be regarded as a consciousness of guilt;
	
	
	Mr V’landys knew that both Mr Rudge and Mr Bulloch had stepped aside from their positions on the Licensing Committee for the First Show Cause Hearing because the earlier correspondence had been addressed to them and they, too, had been the subject of attack; and
	
	
	Mr V’landys knew that the determinations would affect the plaintiff’s livelihood as a horse trainer.
	



	
	As to (a), I do not regard the Kennedys’ letter as placing Mr V’landys in a position of conflict: his interests and those of Racing NSW were relevantly the same. They both wanted the plaintiff to stop criticising them because they regarded the abusive form of his public statements to be inimical to the public reputation of the horse racing industry in New South Wales; and they both wanted to use such legitimate means at their disposal to achieve this aim. Moreover, the reason Mr V’landys was being criticised was because he was the Chief Executive of Racing NSW.
	
	
	The matters in (b) and (c) are incontrovertible but do not take the matter further. As to (d), I do not regard the absence of a reference to the Kennedys letter in a report to the Board as suspicious or as creating any adverse inference. As to (e), it does not follow from the circumstance that Mr Rudge and Mr Bulloch saw fit to step aside, that they were required to do so, or that their decision to step aside meant that it was wrong for Mr V’landys not to step aside. I regard (e) as neutral. As to (f), it can be accepted that, if one wants to earn a living as a horse trainer, revocation of one’s licence deprives one of an opportunity of endeavouring to do so. However there is no evidence that Mr V’landys knew of the plaintiff’s particular circumstances.
	
	
	In summary, I am not satisfied that there is any basis to conclude that Mr V’landys, when he made either the First or the Second Determinations, had any of the mental elements referred to in (3)(a), (b) or (c) above.
	
	
	The fourth element has not been established. The plaintiff submitted that horse racing was his life and his livelihood and that he would not have spent so much money on the property had he not expected to earn money from it. He referred to the winnings of his horses and his prospects of success, including that he would earn money training horses on his property.
	
	
	The evidence, such as it was, showed that the plaintiff consistently made losses from horse racing. His tax returns showed that any income he received was exceeded by his expenses. I accept his evidence that a trainer is judged by results. The evidence reveals that, on many occasions (particularly from November 2010), the plaintiff’s horses finished last or second to last, despite occasional success at individual country races.
	
	
	It is not necessary to cite the actual figures to establish the plaintiff’s financial position in the years prior to the First and Second Determinations, which was both parlous and precarious. The submission that he could have turned his losses into profits but for the First and Second Determinations appears, in all circumstances, unduly optimistic.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s submission that he lost a chance (of training horses) which ought be regarded as being of some value is not enough. He had to show that the chance probably had an economic value to him. He has failed to do so.
	
	
	Accordingly, the plaintiff has failed to make out his claim for damages for misfeasance in public office.
	


The defences


	
	I accept the defendants’ submission that AR 197 applies as a matter of contract and, accordingly, the plaintiff is not entitled to make the claim for damages against either of the defendants since it falls within the description “by reason or in consequence of the imposition . . . of any penalty imposed or purporting to be imposed by the Rules”.
	
	
	Mr V’landys, in any event, has a statutory immunity by reason of s 12(1) of the Thoroughbred Racing Act as I consider that he acted in good faith.
	


Orders


	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	Judgment for the defendants.
	
	
	Unless any party makes an application for a different order in writing to my Associate within seven days, order the plaintiff to pay the defendants’ costs of the proceedings.

		17 November 2015",2015-11-16 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2702440,Nassr v R [2015] NSWCCA 284,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: On 17 April 2014 the applicant pleaded guilty to two charges brought in proceedings commenced in the Local Court. The first (count 1), which was the subject of this appeal, was of breaking and entering a house and committing a serious indictable offence therein contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) on 2 August 2013, in circumstances of aggravation. The Court Attendance Notice included the following details of that offence:
	


That [the applicant] … did break and enter the dwelling house of Gary TORR situate at … Stanhope Gardens, and then in the said dwelling house did commit a serious indictable offence, to wit, assault occasioning actual bodily harm in circumstances of aggravation, to wit, the said NASSR did maliciously inflicted [sic] actual bodily harm on Gary TORR.


	
	The second charge was of breaking and entering another house and committing a serious indictable offence therein on 7 November 2013 contrary to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	The applicant pleaded guilty to each of those charges in the Parramatta Local Court and was committed to the District Court for sentence. On 4 August 2014 M Williams SC DCJ sentenced the applicant to an aggregate sentence for the two offences of 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months, that sentence to date from 4 April 2014.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal out of time against his conviction on the first count. That appeal is brought pursuant to s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) on grounds which include (ground 2) that on the admitted and established facts, he could not in law have been convicted of the offence charged under s 112(2).
	
	
	Under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, on any appeal against conviction under s 5(1), the Court must allow the appeal if it is of the opinion that, on any ground whatsoever, “there was a miscarriage of justice”. A miscarriage of justice will have occurred if on the admitted or uncontroversial facts the applicant could not in law have been convicted of the offence charged: R v Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120 at 121-2 (per Kirby P, Grove and Newman JJ agreeing).
	
	
	The applicant also sought leave to appeal against the severity of the aggregate sentence imposed in relation to the two offences.
	
	
	On 4 November 2015, the Court made the following orders:
	


1.   Grant leave to the applicant to bring his appeal against conviction on count 1 out of time.

2.   Allow the appeal in relation to the applicant’s conviction on count 1 and quash that conviction.

3.   Grant leave to the applicant to appeal against the aggregate sentence imposed by the District Court.

4.   Set aside that aggregate sentence.

5.   Remit the matter to the District Court for determination as to sentence.


	
	The Court reserved its reasons for the making of these orders. Those reasons are set out below.
	
	
	The Crown did not oppose leave being granted to bring the appeal against conviction out of time. It conceded that there had been a miscarriage of justice because on the agreed or uncontroversial facts the applicant could not have been convicted of count 1.
	
	
	In our view that concession was correctly made. An element of the offence charged was that the applicant had committed the assault occasioning actual bodily harm on Mr Torr in the “dwelling-house” at Stanhope Gardens. The expression “dwelling-house” is defined in s 4 of the Crimes Act and includes a building or structure that is intended for or capable of occupation or is within the same curtilage as, and occupied with, a house-dwelling, or whose use is ancillary to the occupation of the house. It does not include the front or side yard of the property on which the relevant house, building or structure is erected.
	
	
	The agreed facts, on the basis of which the applicant pleaded guilty to the first count, did not disclose precisely where the assault on Mr Torr had taken place. The facts were that the applicant had broken into the premises with another person and was in the process of going through some furniture boxes inside the house when he was interrupted by Mr Torr arriving home with his young son. From evidence given at the proceedings on sentence it was clear that the applicant had broken into the premises to steal but had not in fact stolen anything because he had been interrupted. That evidence also included that the applicant had assaulted Mr Torr as part of a violent altercation which occurred outside the dwelling-house as the applicant was attempting to escape from Mr Torr’s property.
	
	
	It followed that ground 1 was made out. The appeal against the conviction on count 1 had to be allowed and that conviction quashed.
	
	
	It also followed that the aggregate sentence imposed by the District Court could not stand because that sentence could only be imposed in circumstances where the Court was sentencing the offender “for more than one offence”: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), s 53A(1).
	
	
	That being so, the applicant submitted, and the Crown accepted, that the appropriate course was for the question of sentence in respect of the applicant’s conviction on the second count (which is not the subject of any appeal) to be remitted to the District Court for determination. We agree that such an order should be made, under s 12(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act.
	
	
	There are two matters remaining to be considered.
	
	
	First, s 6(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act provides as follows:
	


Subject to the special provisions of this Act, the court shall, if it allows an appeal under section 5 (1) against conviction, quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered.


	
	That Act makes such special provisions by ss 6A, 7 and 8. None of those provisions apply in the present case. In particular this is not a case in which an order should be made for a new trial of the charge under s 112(2) for reason that the uncontroversial evidence does not support the making or prosecution of that charge.
	
	
	Accordingly, this Court is required by the language of s 6(2) to quash the conviction and enter a verdict of acquittal on the first count: R v Pedrana [2001] NSWCCA 66; 123 A Crim R 1 at [71] (Ipp AJA, Wood CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing).
	
	
	Order 2 made by the Court on 4 November 2015 should be amended to direct that a judgment of acquittal be entered in relation to count 1. The parties should also be given the opportunity to apply to set aside or vary that amending order.
	
	
	The second matter is that, on reflection, order 3 made by the Court on 4 November 2015 was unnecessary. The aggregate sentence had to be set aside as a consequence of the quashing of the conviction on count 1. There was no need to give any consideration to the separate application for leave to appeal against that sentence.
	
	
	For these reasons, the Court makes the following further orders:
	


1.   Amend order 2 made on 4 November 2015 to read:

“2.   Allow the appeal in relation to the applicant’s conviction on count 1, quash that conviction and direct a judgment of acquittal be entered in relation to that count.”

2.   Revoke order 3 made on 4 November 2015.

3.   Grant leave to the parties to apply to set aside or vary order 1 above, any such application to be made within seven days of the date of this order.

		17 November 2015",2015-11-16 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2702441,RM v R [2015] NSWDC 377,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against the severity of sentences passed by the Chief Magistrate, Henson DCJ sitting in the Downing Centre Local Court on 13 July 2015.
	
	
	The appellant pleaded guilty to 10 charges. Each was an offence contrary to s 192E(1)(e) of the Crimes Act 1900. Each of those crimes has a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. When dealt with in the Local Court, the crime carries a maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $11,000.
	
	
	The 10 offences were extremely similar. The formal charge was that at Byron Bay, on the date or dates in question, the appellant did by deception by posting a false advertisement on www.stayz.com.au, dishonestly obtain a financial advantage. The date of the first offence alleged was 3 September 2014. The date of the last offence alleged was 5 November 2014. The total amount gained in respect of all 10 offences was $20,150.
	
	
	The appellant was employed as a customer service representative with Stayz Pty Limited between 23 June 2014 until 12 September 2014. The appellant created a false advertisement for a rental property on the Stayz website. That false advertisement was created on 2 September 2014. It advertised a property for rent at 34 Cavvanbah Street, Byron Bay, the lessor of the premises being identified as Kurt Batly. That was an alias for the appellant. When rent was paid in advance for this non-existent property it was paid into a National Australia Bank account that was the appellant’s own account. After each deposit was made the proceeds were withdrawn from ATM machines.
	
	
	There were eleven persons who were the victims of the appellant’s crimes. In respect of each but one offence a natural person made an application to rent the property and paid the rent in advance. In respect of the third offence there were two applicants, a brother and sister. One might postulate that in essence there were ten families who were affected by the appellant’s fraudulent dealings, ten families who booked a holiday at Byron Bay at a non-existent property.
	
	
	The financial burden was accepted by Stayz Pty Limited and the appellant has been ordered by the Chief Magistrate to repay to Stayz Pty Limited the sum of $20,150 in total.
	
	
	The appellant pleaded guilty in respect of eight of the offences. The Chief Magistrate sentenced the appellant to perform 150 hours of community service. Those sentences were all concurrent. In respect of two offences his Honour imposed a s 9 bond for 18 months.
	
	
	Normally a person who had defrauded such a large sum of money and inconvenienced, to put it mildly, ten families would expect a full-time custodial sentence. The appellant himself acknowledges that fact.
	
	
	The appellant’s life had been disrupted, but the verb “disrupted” could properly be seen to be an understatement. The appellant’s life partner is Daniel. In February 2014 Daniel was diagnosed with HIV. The appellant remained committed to his relationship with Daniel but there were obvious strains on the relationship with reduced physical contact and therefore a reduction in affection and some distancing of the couple.
	
	
	Whilst the appellant was employed with Stayz he was bullied by a manager who was very rude and aggressive towards him and frequently used vulgar language.
	
	
	In September 2014 the appellant felt physically unwell and had to consider the likelihood of his having himself contracted HIV. He avoided being tested because he wanted to avoid being provided with an unpalatable diagnosis. He started gambling heavily and lost a lot of money. He commenced drinking heavily, and met unsuitable acquaintances at the hotel which he frequented, and started using illicit drugs. His depression worsened in October 2014 and his alcohol consumption increased and his gambling also increased. It was because of his gambling addiction and increasing indebtedness that he committed the offences now in question. He committed them in the pious expectation that he could get money back to repay those who he had, in essence, defrauded.
	
	
	As I have said earlier the last offence was alleged to have been committed on 5 November 2014. Although the offending stopped the appellant’s life was still turbulent. A cousin who had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer died in November 2014. A close friend committed suicide in the same month.
	
	
	However on 1 December 2014 the appellant commenced a new job with Entourage, an education company for entrepreneurs. In that employment his job was known as the Entrepreneur Development Manager. He held that position when he stood for sentence before the Chief Magistrate.
	
	
	In the Local Court the appellant’s solicitor sought that the appellant be dealt with under s 32(3)(a) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. He asked that the charges be dismissed and that the appellant be discharged into the care of a consultant clinical psychologist, Mr Sam Borenstein.
	
	
	Mr Borenstein apparently was a qualified expert witness. He interviewed the appellant on 1 May 2015, 8 May 2015 and 15 May 2015 before preparing a report bearing the last date. Mr Borenstein took a history which I have set out in summary form earlier in these reasons. The first part of Mr Bornstein’s opinion is this:
	


“Mr Mitic was suffering combined symptoms of depression and anxiety leading up to and during the offending period, coinciding with learning his partner of 18 months was diagnosed with HIV, in February 2014 being subjected to workplace bullying and harassment working with Stayz, in August 2014 developing symptoms of HIV which proved to be the case when Mr Mitic was formally diagnosed in December 2014.”

I should indicate that the evidence before me tells me that the formal diagnosis of HIV positivity was made by Associate Professor Boyd on 11 December 2014.


	
	The formal diagnosis by Mr Borenstein was of a chronic Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood in response to the stressors identified by both Mr Borenstein and by me earlier in these reasons. He was of the view that there was a direct nexus between the diagnosed mental condition and the stressors and the offending conduct. However, throughout the report Mr Borenstein uses the past tense in describing both the appellant’s diagnosis and symptoms.
	
	
	The appellant clearly was not a mentally ill person within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 2007. Theoretically the provisions of s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Procedures) Act 1990 were available to be used in the Local Court because the appellant had been suffering from a mental illness at the time of the commission of the alleged offences. However he was not so suffering at the time he stood for sentence.
	
	
	The appellant’s life has been changed round by the appellant himself. He is no longer mentally ill. He is no longer depressed. He is no longer anxious. He has come to grips with the existential threats that had burdened him; with the non-acceptance by his family of his sexuality; with his HIV status; with his own reluctance to reveal his HIV status to his family and to others, and he is now contributing to society.
	
	
	Section 32 requires the Court to “perform a balancing exercise; weighing up, on the one hand, the purposes of punishment and, on the other, the public interest in diverting the mentally disordered offender on the criminal justice system.” Such can be found in the judgment of Howie J in Confos v DPP [2004] NSWSC115 9 at [17]. At the time the offender stood for sentence he clearly was not a mentally disordered offender and the public interest required his crimes to be punished according to law and not dealt with under the Mental Health legislation. Furthermore as is well known to lawyers, although not to laymen, s 32 is available in the Local Court, that is, for minor offences, but it not available to judges of this Court or the Supreme Court when they exercise their sentencing powers. In other words the procedure is designed more for petty crime than serious crime. As the offender’s own solicitor pointed out in the Local Court the offender committed serious offences, offences which are prevalent in the community and for which there is a need for specific and general deterrence.
	
	
	I agree with the learned Chief Magistrate that there was no reason to exercise the Court’s discretion to use the Mental Health legislation to deal with this appellant.
	
	
	There has, however, been a significant change in circumstances since the appellant stood for sentence in the Local Court. In the last four weeks he has obtained a new role as a sales executive with a media company which deals with international clients and requires the appellant to travel throughout Australia and also overseas. The appellant works long hours in this job, including working on weekends. The job is more highly paid than that which he last held. That has enabled the appellant to pay more by instalments off the compensation that he is formally required to pay. He has voluntarily increased the amount of instalments which he is paying because of his increased earnings.
	
	
	However he has been advised by Community Corrections that they would find it extremely difficult to find community service work which the appellant could do, bearing in mind his current work commitments and the report does not believe it appropriate that a man with the appellant’s background, personal abilities and qualifications should do mere menial work such as picking up rubbish. He could contribute much to the community but Community Corrections are not in a position to assist him or the community in that regard. The appellant has however himself embarked upon charitable work, working in ACON, so he is contributing voluntarily to the community.
	
	
	Clearly the appellant acknowledges that but for the mitigating circumstances which caused him to commit these offences he would be serving a full-time custodial sentence. Clearly the Chief Magistrate also though so, as do I. However the Chief Magistrate chose to deal with the appellant more leniently but unfortunately that leniency has now become an obstacle.
	
	
	I carefully weigh all of the factors involved in the current case and come to the view it is appropriate to set aside the community service order and impose lengthy bonds pursuant to s 9. I point out to the appellant that if he should come back before me for breach of s 9 bonds that I impose that he may well find that he will be facing a full-time custodial sentence. But I am confident, bearing in mind what the evidence tells me about the appellant’s remorse and the unlikelihood that he will reoffend, that that will not arise.
	
	
	For those reasons I set aside the sentences passed by the Chief Magistrate on 13 July 2015 in respect to sequence number 1 to 5 and 7 to 9.
	
	
	[RM] in respect of each of those offences pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1990 I order that you enter into a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of four years from today. Conditions applying during the term of the bond are as follows:
	



	
	you are to appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time;
	
	
	you are to be of good behaviour;
	
	
	you are to reside at [NFP]; or,
	
	
	you are to advise the Registrar of this Court by prepaid registered post of any change of residential address during the term of the bond.
	



	
	In respect of the same offences I confirm that compensation orders made by the Chief Magistrate. I dismiss the appeal against the sentences in respect of sequences 6 and 10.

	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against the severity of sentence passed by Deputy Chief Magistrate Mottley sitting in the Downing Centre Local Court on 18 September 2015.
	
	
	The appellant pleaded guilty to a charge that on 26 July 2015 at Balmain she did by means of a statement, knowingly make to a member of the Police Force, a false representation that an act had been done, namely a common assault, which act was so represented in her statement that it called for an investigation by a member of the Police Force. Although certain things have been said by the appellant today I must deal with her on the basis that she pleaded guilty to that charge, and that she stands to be sentenced on that basis. The appellant made a representation that her ex-boyfriend had assaulted her and, by her plea, she acknowledged that that was not true.
	
	
	The appellant is currently 27 years old. At the time of the offence she was 26. She is a single mother. She came before the Local Court as a young lady of prior good character. She has been under the care of Dr Roger Dunphy, a clinical psychologist, since December 2010. According to Dr Dunphy the appellant has a complex history involving family child sexual abuse, psychological and physical abuse, and poor parenting. She has struggled with anxiety, depression and self-harm. She has been noted by Dr Dunphy to have extremely poor self-esteem and low self-worth. Dr Dunphy believed that may have been a factor in her history of partners who have perpetrated acts of violence against her. Despite the appellant’s disadvantaged background she has successfully avoided alcohol and drug addiction, as well as being of good character. Dr Dunphy believes that the appellant is breaking what he described as an “inter-generational cycle of violence and dysfunction”.
	
	
	She cares for her children. She has been working as a volunteer teacher’s aide and has career aspirations in that area, and she also told me that she has an alternative career aspiration to be a Corrective Services Officer. Her having a criminal record might interfere with her obtaining a career as a Corrective Services Officer or as a teacher.
	
	
	Reference from a friend of four years standing tells me that the appellant has been involved in volunteering with classroom reading and art projects, and has been a reliable support for that friend’s children, as well as the children of others. The appellant also assists her sister with her children, and she also assists her disabled brother.
	
	
	Despite a disadvantaged background she has contributed to our society and has aspirations which need to be acknowledged and supported. I therefore believe it is in the best interests of the appellant and community that the Court deal with the appellant, because of her prior good character, under s 10. However in view of what I have heard today I believe it appropriate that the length of the s 10 bond be 12 months.
	
	
	For those reasons I set aside the conviction recorded and sentence passed by Magistrate Mottley sitting in the Downing Centre Local Court on 2 October 2015.
	
	
	[JG], under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1990 without proceeding to a conviction but having regard to your prior good character I am satisfied that it is expedient to release you on a good behaviour bond. I order that you be released on a good behaviour bond for a period of 12 months from today. The conditions of the bond are as follows:
	



	
	you appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time during the term of the bond;
	
	
	you are to be of good behaviour;
	
	
	you at to reside at [NFP];
	
	
	you are to advise the Registrar of the Court by pre-paid registered post of any change of residential address during the term of the bond.
	



	
	APPELLANT: Thank you so much, your Honour.

2702444,KRT v R [2015] NSWDC 375,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against the severity of sentence passed by Magistrate Huber sitting in the Local Court at Waverley on 9 September 2015. The appellant pleaded guilty to a charge that on 4 July 2015 at Mascot in this State she did drive with a mid-range prescribed concentration of alcohol in her blood. The reading recorded was 0.137. The maximum penalty for this offence is 9 months imprisonment and/or a fine of $2,200. There is a mandatory license disqualification. The automatic disqualification period is 12 months; the minimum disqualification period is 6 months. Her Honour fined the appellant $1,000 and disqualified her from driving for 6 months, noting that s 225 of the Road Transport Act 2013 applied, backdating the disqualification period, in effect, to the date of the offence, 4 July 2015.
	
	
	The appellant asks me to set aside that sentence and to grant her the benefit of s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and impose upon her a bond to be of good behaviour.
	
	
	A clear objective of fact, speaking against the grant of the relief sought, is the extent of the appellant’s blood alcohol reading. As I have already indicated, it was 0.137. Mid-range commences at 0.08 and the high range commences at 0.15. The appellant’s blood alcohol reading was closer to the high range than it was to the bottom of the mid-range, let alone anywhere close to the low range. However, the s 10 is available for such offences because, in the guideline judgment for high range PCA offences, the Court of Criminal Appeal did not exclude that s 10 was available in a rare type of case. The question before me really is whether this is a sufficiently rare case.
	
	
	The appellant is 31 years old. At the time of the offence she was 31 years old. She has no prior criminal conviction. She was first granted a learner license on 26 June 2000, that is 15 years ago, and she has been a licensed driver ever since. Her driving record discloses 5 earlier speeding offences but there is no suggestion of any drink-driving. The appellant therefore comes before the Court as a lady of prior good character.
	
	
	She provided a statement to the Local Court and has given oral evidence in this Court. In her statement to the Local Court the appellant said this:
	


“I would like to make it known that I do not drink. I have a condition where I do not have a fully functioning liver, caused by contracting glandular fever and subsequent hepatitis in my late teens. [I] cannot handle the load of a normal healthy person, which has spurred my decision to not drink much or often.”

That has been confirmed by her general practitioner, Dr Liew. He confirms that the plaintiff suffered moderately severe glandular fever in 2002 which has affected her liver function. He had a history that the appellant drank less than monthly and when she drank did so “very conservatively”. He thought that her drinking and driving was “aberrant behaviour”.


	
	The appellant on Friday 3 July 2015 was working at Port Botany as a sea freight operator. She left her place of employment about 7pm and went to her home at Ramsgate Beach. She then decided to attend a housewarming party of a friend of hers, Nicki. She believed that her friend was living in premises in Liverpool Street, Darlinghurst near to Oxford Street. She drove there. She arrived about 9pm. Shortly thereafter she commenced drinking Corona beers. All told she drank 4 Corona beers.
	
	
	Nicki was a friend of the appellant’s ex-partner. The appellant and her “ex” had been together for 7 years but by 4 July 2015 had been separated for a year. However they retained many friends in common. At one stage the appellant and her “ex” and two other friends left the housewarming party to attend a nearby club. The appellant had one cocktail at that club. She knew it was “strong” from its taste. They, the party of four, then went to another club “down the road”, by which I refer she meant Oxford Street, and she consumed a further two cocktails there. All told she had 3 cocktails.
	
	
	However, after the appellant had the second bottle of Corona beer she had decided that she would not drive home that evening. Nicki told her that she could stay on the couch at Nicki’s home where the housewarming party was occurring.
	
	
	I return to the second club. The two friends that accompanied the appellant and her ex to the clubs then left the second club leaving the appellant alone with her ex-boyfriend. He then made advances towards her seeking probably to have some sexual relations with her. At first the appellant did not object but subsequently she did. They returned to Nicki’s flat and found others asleep on the couch. Nicki had vacated her own bed, leaving it to be occupied by the appellant and her ex-partner. That was not what the appellant desired and it is clear that she thought that bearing in mind the advances that had been made to her by her ex-partner, he might seek to have sexual intercourse with her.
	
	
	She told me that she felt in a “heightened emotional state”. She felt extremely uncomfortable. She made a decision to leave, which was a normal human reaction when threatened, to run away. She went to her car which was parked in a nearby cross street. She then drove towards her home at Ramsgate Beach. She drove down South Dowling Street and onto Mill Point Road. At Mill Point Road she was stopped by police for random breadth testing, which led eventually to the breathalyser test which was the subject of a certificate and the charge to which the appellant pleaded guilty.
	
	
	There was no suggestion in the police facts that the appellant’s driving was in any way erratic or that anything that she did drew the police’s attention to her. The facts tendered by the police indicated that the traffic conditions were a dry sealed bitumen road “with minimal to no other vehicles on the roadway”. Therefore she was offering probably greater danger to herself than to other motorists.
	
	
	The appellant has already served 4½ months of the suspension period imposed by the learned Magistrate, the minimum suspension period. The appellant can with the aid of friends and public transport commute between her place of residence and her workplace. There is no suggestion that the appellant’s job is in jeopardy. However, a criminal record is a matter of concern for her and concern for her in future job seeking. She has completed the traffic offender’s program at the PCYC at Daceyville. She had completed that course prior to standing for sentence in the Local Court. In her statement to the Local Court she said this:
	


“Having a criminal conviction will affect me greatly, especially in terms of future employment. I see myself as a very competent and enthusiastic worker, I am extremely worried that a criminal conviction will set me back in this regard. Not to mention the simple shame and disappointment I feel with myself for being considered a criminal.”

The appellant in her statement to the Local Court made it clear that she considered her behaviour aberrant. Other statements obtained from those who know her well indicated not only was this considered aberrant behaviour but it was highly unlikely to occur again and that the appellant was extremely embarrassed and remorseful because of what she had done.


	
	I accede to the submission put to me by Miss Richardson, on behalf of the appellant, that his crime was committed in extenuating circumstances. The appellant after having drunk 2 bottles of Corona beer knew that she should not drink further if she were to drive. Because she was enjoying the party she chose not to drive and made arrangements to stay with her friend overnight. Unfortunately those arrangements evaporated because of the attention paid to the appellant by her ex-boyfriend. She was placed in a position in which she felt uncomfortable, threatened and emotionally aroused. She elected to leave, not to stay at the place where she was to stay overnight, went to her car and then proceeded to drive homewards. Her choice was a poor one but clearly her decision making was affected by alcohol. However, that was because the arrangements made for her to stay overnight had in essence failed because of the unexpected and uninvited interest shown in her by her ex-boyfriend. In my view this is an appropriate case for the application of s 10.
	
	
	For those reasons I set aside the conviction recorded and the sentence passed by the Local Court at Waverley on 9 September 2015. [KRT], under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1990 without proceeding to a conviction but having regard to your good character and health and the extenuating circumstances of the offence, I am satisfied that it is expedient to release you on a good behaviour bond. I order that you be released on a good behaviour for a period of 18 months from today. Conditions of the bond are as follows:
	



	
	you are to appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time during the term of the bond,
	
	
	you are to be of good behaviour.
	
	
	you are to reside at [NFP],
	
	
	you are to advise the Registrar of the Court by prepaid registered post any change of residential address during the term of the bond.

2702445,Park v State Debt Recovery Office (NSW) [2015] NSWDC 391,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against a refusal by Deputy Chief Magistrate O’Brien on 21 April 2015 to grant an annulment order pursuant to s 4 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001.
	
	
	In essence the case for the prosecution was that between 11 June 2011 and 16 January 2012 the appellant was issued with 5 penalty infringement notices for either failing to produce a train ticket when requested to do so or travelling without a ticket on trains. The 5 penalty notices were unpaid. The State Debt Recovery Office (SDRO) commenced enforcement proceedings and issued penalty enforcement notices. When the appellant found out about the issuing of the penalty enforcement notices he sought to have those notices set aside.
	
	
	On 2 September 2014 the SDRO acceded to the appellant’s application and set aside the penalty notices. On the same day, in respect of each notice, the SDRO wrote to the appellant at an address in Merrylands, a letter advising him of the annulment of the enforcement order and that there was listed for hearing in the Downing Centre Local Court on Tuesday 4 November 2014 at 9.15am a charge relevant to each penalty notice. After advising of the place and date of listing the notice then provides a “note” in the following terms:
	


“On the day of mention, you will need to enter a plea. Please read the attached ‘Notice of Pleading’ in preparation for court attendance. If you are unsure how to plead, or intend to plead not guilty, you should seek legal assistance. If pleading not guilty, a further date will be set for you to attend court to present your case and witnesses, when evidence will be presented by the issuing authority. Depending on the number and complexity of matters to be determined on the day of listing, your matter may be decided at any time during the day. If you are unable to attend on this day, you should contact the Court to determine your options. The Magistrate will decide whether to hear the matter then or on another day.”

The notice then directs the appellant to contact the Downing Centre Local Court if he had any further questions.


	
	The appellant today admitted that he received this notice in respect of each of the five penalty notices. He accepted that he would have received them within a week of their being dated, that is, he would have received them in mid-September 2014. He accepted that they were addressed to him at his proper address. The appellant read them but cursorily, and took no notice of the content. He went to Victoria on or about 24 October 2014 to celebrate Halloween. He returned to New South Wales on Saturday 1 November 2014, he was then preparing to celebrate his birthday on 10 November 2014. He did not attend the Local Court on 4 November 2014 because he had not properly read the documents which had been sent to him. He had not made any note of the date. He had not properly read the letters to understand that he was required to attend at court.
	
	
	He told Deputy Chief Magistrate O’Brien the same matters and his Honour refused the application. The appellant now appeals to me against the refusal of the Deputy Chief Magistrate to grant his application. No evidence has been put before me that satisfies any of the requirements of s 8 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. For example there is no evidence that the defendant was not aware of the original Local Court proceedings. He was aware of them but mistook what was happening. There was no evidence that he was hindered by accident, illness, or misadventure, or other cause, from taking action in relation to the original Local Court proceedings. There is no evidence of any circumstance in the case which the interests of justice require that the original convictions be set aside.
	
	
	I have carefully looked at the documentation before me and the reasons proffered by the appellant but, quite frankly, I am unable to discern any arguable case that the defendant might be able to put before the Court as to why the original convictions ought be set aside. This is not a case where there is overwhelming evidence of innocence or the like. There are some arguments which might persuade a tribunal of fact of the appellant’s having some reasonable doubt as to his guilt but it would appear to me that arguments proffered from the Bar table by the appellant could easily be met by evidence that could be called from five different railway inspectors and records of the Roads and Traffic Authority, as it then was.
	
	
	Furthermore the appellant had almost two months’ notice of the matters being listed in the Local Court, he again a cursory reading to the documentation when he received it, and he appeared to do nothing thereafter to protect is own interests.
	
	
	Courts cannot operate if people ignore documentation sent to them by, or on behalf of, the Court advising them of a listing of a matter for hearing. In my view there is no evidence that properly establishes any of the matters contained in s 8(2)(c) of the Act. I therefore dismiss this application. I therefore dismiss the appeal against the decision made by the Deputy Chief Magistrate on 4 November 2014.

The applications before the court


	
	The four plaintiffs (a married couple and their two sons, aged 14 and 16) commenced proceedings on 17 October 2014 for defamation, assault, wrongful arrest and false imprisonment arising from events which occurred on 18 September 2014. On that date, they assert, police officers entered their home at Revesby, handcuffed them, searched the premises and caused property damage. Two statements made by police in the course of those events are the subject of a claim for defamation. The conduct relied upon to evidence wrongful arrest and false imprisonment is unspecified in the pleadings, but I understand that the second plaintiff, Mr Hamdi Alqudsi, has since been the subject of criminal charges.
	
	
	These proceedings were listed for hearing on 12 November 2015 for the first, third and fourth plaintiffs to show cause why these proceedings should not be dismissed for failure to comply with orders directing them to answer a request for particulars (dated 25 June 2015) by 7 October 2015. The first, third and fourth plaintiffs’ application is for the court to adjourn the show cause hearing because counsel is unavailable. When that application was refused, the plaintiffs’ counsel took no further part in the applications.
	
	
	The defendants ask the court to dismiss the defamation proceedings brought by the first, third and fourth plaintiffs (referred to hereafter as “the plaintiffs”, they being the parties affected by this application) on the “show cause” basis, as the particulars, when finally supplied on the day before this hearing, are manifestly inadequate, in circumstances where there is a prior history of non-compliance. The defendants also referred to the principles of proportionality pursuant to ss 60 and 61 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and r 12.7 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”).
	
	
	There are two preliminary points to note:
	



	
	This is not the first time an application has been foreshadowed to strike out part of the statement of claim. An application to strike out the balance of the claim was foreshadowed on 6 February 2015 on the basis that the pleading refers to the plaintiffs each suffering physical, “psychiatric and psychological” injury, but the plaintiffs had failed to comply with rr 15.12 and 15.13 UCPR or to serve medical reports. The plaintiffs met that challenge by stating that they do not intend to make any claim for personal injury of any kind, or to serve any medical reports, and orders were made to that effect. Accordingly, the claims for assault, wrongful arrest and false imprisonment remain on the record, but on that limited basis.
	
	
	There are problems with the pleadings of the claims other than defamation, such as the failure to particularise punitive damages beyond the generalised statement of “contumelious disregard”. However, defences have been filed, and the sole application before me at the present is the application to dismiss the defamation claim, following which the remaining claims can be transferred to the general list, in accordance with the second defendant’s initial request to do so, made on 6 February 2015.
	


The relevant legal principles


	
	The history and use of the “show cause” hearing under the repealed r 18.3 District Court Rules 1973 (NSW) is explained by the NSW Court of Appeal in Karabay v Carr [2014] NSWCA 143 at [5]-[6] and, under ss 56-58 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), in Vissaritis v Hatzikiriakos [2013] NSWCA 474 at [1]-[8].
	
	
	The circumstances in which a “show cause” hearing should be adjourned should take into account the general principles in relation to applications for adjournments as set out in ss 56, 58(1)(a) and 66 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW). An application by a party to adjourn proceedings where that party is already in default is a matter of some seriousness.
	
	
	The defendants’ application for summary dismissal under ss 60 and 61 and UCPR r 12.7 on proportionality principles proceeds on the same two bases as those put forward in Ghosh v NineMSN Pty Ltd [2015] NSWCA 334; namely:
	



	
	The plaintiffs have failed to conduct the defamation proceedings with expedition (Dank v Cronulla Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club Ltd [2014] NSWCA 288; Coren v Master Builders Association of New South Wales Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 244).
	
	
	The proceedings are an abuse of process, in the sense that the interest at stake is disproportionate to the resources of the Court and of the parties that will have to be expended to determine the plaintiff's claim (Bleyer v Google Inc [2014] NSWSC 897). An order of this kind would be made rarely, in the absence of factors additional to mere delay: Ghosh v NineMSN Pty Ltd at [44] per Macfarlan JA.
	


The matters complained of


	
	The alleged statements made to the first plaintiff are pleaded to be as follows:
	


“Shut up bitch”, “Get out of the fucking bed bitch”, “bitch” (Statement of Claim, paragraph 3).


	
	The imputation said to arise from each of these publications is that the plaintiff is “an unpleasant woman” (Statement of Claim, paragraph 4).
	
	
	At the same time the officers of the Australian Federal Police said of and concerning the third and fourth plaintiffs, who are 14 and 16 years of age, words to the effect:
	


“They are terrorists” (Statement of Claim, paragraph 5).


	
	The imputations pleaded are:
	



	
	The third plaintiff is a terrorist.
	
	
	The third plaintiff is a danger to the Australian public.
	
	
	The fourth plaintiff is a terrorist.
	
	
	The fourth plaintiff is a danger to the Australian public.
	


The conduct of the proceedings


	
	The statement of claim was served on the first defendant, the Commonwealth of Australia, and on 14 November 2014, the first return date, the matter was stood over to 5 December 2014. On 4 December 2014, the plaintiffs filed an Amended Statement of Claim naming the State of New South Wales as the second defendant. As the Amended Statement of Claim had not been served on the second defendant, the proceedings were stood over to 6 February 2015 for directions to enable service to occur.
	
	
	On 6 February 2015, the first of a series of timetables was made. The plaintiffs’ failure to comply with the timetable in these proceedings, for the period from 6 February 2015 up until today, is the background to the show cause application was listed for hearing.
	
	
	Only the defamation claim is the subject of delay. The other claims are ready for hearing, in that the plaintiffs have indicated they do not propose to serve any medical or other evidence in relation to the damages claimed.
	


The plaintiffs’ application for adjournment of the show cause application


	
	Mr Foster of counsel appeared for the plaintiff. He sought an adjournment of this show cause application on the basis of the ill-health of counsel with the carriage of the matter, Mr Rasmussen. He did not have instructions to appear on the show cause application. After I refused the application to adjourn, he was excused from further conduct of the proceedings. The reasons for my refusal are set out below.
	


The plaintiffs’ delays in relation to the defamation claims


	
	The delays complained of are as follows:
	



	
	The first, third and fourth plaintiffs’ failure to answer the request for particulars of the statement of claim. These answers have now been provided, and this complaint is of limited relevance to the application before me.
	
	
	The first, third and fourth plaintiffs’ failure to answer the request for particulars of the Reply (sent to them on 25 June 2015) by 7 October 2015, in accordance with the show cause orders. The defendants additionally submit that the Reply is hopelessly drafted and that the answers to particulars provided the day before this hearing are incapable of amounting to particulars of malice.
	
	
	The plaintiffs’ failure to answer the defendants’ correspondence concerning discovery, without which the matter cannot proceed further.
	


The plaintiffs’ delay in answering requests for particulars of the statement of claim


	
	A request for further and better particulars of the statement of claim was sent by the first defendant on 21 January 2015 and by the second defendant on 4 February 2015. Accordingly, orders were made by me for answers to be provided by 6 March 2015, so that the defendants could file and serve their defences on or before 2 April 2015. The proceedings were stood over to 16 April 2015 for further orders.
	
	
	There was no answer to the request for particulars by the due date of 6 March 2015 or to a follow-up letter sent by the first defendant on 12 March 2015, or to a further follow-up letter from the first defendant dated 7 April 2015. When the matter came before the court on 16 April 2015 this still had not been done. On 16 April 2015, I extended time for the plaintiffs to answer the requests for particulars to 28 April 2015 and made an order for the plaintiffs to pay the defendants’ costs thrown away by reason of the failure to answer particulars, including the costs of the appearance on 16 April 2015 and the follow-up correspondence from the solicitors for the defendants. Those particulars were provided on 28 April 2015 and as a result, on 30 April 2015 orders were made for defences to be filed and served. Those defences were served, and this delay, although regrettable, is now cured.
	


Delay in answering request for particulars of the Reply and correspondence about discovery


	
	On 30 April 2015, a timetable was made for the filing of defences and a Reply and for the proceedings to stand over to 18 June 2015. The Reply was filed in court on 18 June 2015, and consisted of the following claims:
	



	
	The second defendant’s servants or agents knew, or were wilfully blind to, or failed to make inquiries concerning, the truth or falsity of the matters (namely that the first plaintiff was a bitch and the third and fourth plaintiffs were terrorists);
	
	
	The publications were intended to injure or denigrate the plaintiffs; and
	
	
	The publications were solely motivated by ill will.
	



	
	Although not canvassed during this hearing, there are many problems with both the form and content of the Reply. These problems include:
	



	
	The need to address the issue of malice in relation to each of the plaintiffs individually;
	
	
	The undesirability of wrapping up knowledge of the falsity, wilful blindness and failure to inquire in one particular, let alone in relation to three different plaintiffs;
	
	
	The difficulties attendant upon particulars of malice in this generalised form (as to which see Harrigan v Jones [2000] NSWSC 814, where all the particulars, including several similar to those pleaded here, were struck out).
	



	
	A letter from the second defendant to the solicitors for the plaintiffs dated 25 June 2015 complained:
	


“I refer to the Reply filed on 18 June 2015 in the above matter.

It is hopelessly inadequately particularised and liable to be struck out:

1. No particulars have been provided in support of the allegation that the second defendant’s police officers knew that the matters complained of were untrue.

2. No particulars have been provided in support of the allegation that NSW police officers acted in wilful blindness of the truth or falsity of the matters complained of.

3. No particulars have been provided in support of the allegation that NSW police officers intended to injure and denigrate the plaintiffs.

4. No particulars have been provided in support of the allegation that NSW police officers were solely motivated by ill will towards the plaintiffs.

In the absence of adequate particulars being provided to support these serious allegations within 7 days, I will move to have the Reply struck out.

I further refer to your letter dated 13 May 2015, which was received on 18 June 2015.

Your response in relation to the particulars sought is inadequate. I note that the second defendant will object to any evidence being led at trial that falls outside the particulars provided.

As to your assertion about your clients’ anxiety etc, any such evidence is irrelevant and inadmissible in light of the plaintiffs’ election to not to pursue any claim for damages for personal injury. Objection will be taken to the leading of such evidence at trial.

In relation to the final paragraph of your letter, in light of the fact that no “interlocutory judgment” was signed on 29 May 2015, and that your assumption about the Defence was incorrect, I assume that the plaintiffs will not be making the foreshadowed application.

I reserve my client’s right to tender this letter, including on the question of costs.”


	
	No answer was received to this letter during the 7-day period referred to. The second defendant continued to conduct the litigation with expedition, including serving categories of documents for discovery on 2 July 2015. After much prompting, the plaintiffs served their categories of documents seven weeks late. On 26 August 2015, the second defendant wrote concerning the plaintiffs’ failure to serve their List of Documents, requesting them to relist the proceedings to seek an extension of the timetable.
	
	
	The proceedings were listed for directions on 1 October 2015 and the second defendant provided short minutes of order on 30 September 2015, asking the plaintiffs to agree to the making of those orders. The plaintiffs’ solicitors did not reply to that correspondence and did not attend on 1 October 2015.
	
	
	The show cause hearing was ordered as a result of the combined effect of the failures to comply with timetables, the complaints of inadequacy of the Reply and the failure to attend court on 1 October 2015. The plaintiffs were given an extension of a week to comply with their obligations to provide particulars of the Reply by 7 October. The plaintiffs did not do so, and did not reply to the second defendant’s letter of 15 October 2015 objecting to categories of discovery.
	
	
	On 6 November 2015 the second defendant served the affidavit of Mr Mellican, affirmed on 4 November 2015. Ms Burrows, the solicitors for the plaintiffs wrote to the second defendant requesting an adjournment of the 12 November 2015, on the basis that she was interstate and counsel unavailable. When this was refused, Ms Burrows wrote to the registrar of this court requesting an adjournment.
	
	
	On 11 November 2015 an answer to particulars of the Reply was provided. Those particulars are deficient. Although Ms Chrysanthou did not dwell on the deficiencies at length, she specifically mentioned:
	



	
	The particulars acknowledge that the second defendants had the plaintiffs under observation in their home for some time, and received intelligence reports about them. In those circumstances, any claim of “failure to inquire” was difficult to understand.
	
	
	The claim that because the third and fourth defendants were aged 16 and 14 that they were incapable of being terrorists was both unfortunate and inadequate.
	
	
	There was no attempt made to answer any but the first particular, as the other answers consisted of statements such as “the same facts… are here repeated as if set out seriatim”, when the particulars sought related to entirely different matters.
	
	
	The plaintiffs did, however, acknowledge that the inclusion of the second plaintiff in the Reply was an error, in that he was not bringing a claim for defamation.
	


The plaintiffs’ unreadiness for the show cause hearing on 12 November 2015


	
	The plaintiffs’ counsel, Mr Foster, was only briefed to seek an adjournment and to explain to the court that the plaintiffs’ failure to appear on 1 October was not intended to be a discourtesy to the court as it was the result of a misunderstanding by counsel for the plaintiff.
	
	
	Mr Foster tendered an affidavit of Ms Burrows sworn on 12 November 2015 in his chambers, and advised that she was not interstate but was nevertheless unavailable to attend. He sought an adjournment on the basis of an illness that the plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Rasmussen had contracted, at the beginning of November, adding that he would be unwell for a further one to two weeks.
	
	
	Ms Chrysanthou submitted, and I agree, that the delays in this litigation are not Mr Rasmussen’s fault as being due to his illness. The plaintiffs’ delay in the defamation claim has been at every step along the way.
	


The refusal of the plaintiffs’ request for an adjournment


	
	I am satisfied that Mr Rasmussen’s conduct is in no way to blame for the delay by the plaintiffs bringing the defamation proceedings. I fail to see how his inability to attend would constitute a basis for adjourning this application.
	
	
	If the plaintiffs bringing the defamation proceedings had acknowledged a need to replead the Reply and to provide proper particulars as soon as Mr Rasmussen was able to do so, as well as offered to pay the costs of the defendants, this would have gone a long way towards the granting of an adjournment. However, the plaintiffs were not even prepared to pay the costs of the 1 October 2015 hearing at which they were unrepresented, let alone the costs of the adjourned show cause application.
	
	
	It was for these reasons that I refused the application for adjournment.
	


Should the proceedings be dismissed for failure to show cause?


	
	Ms Chrysanthou relied upon Kang v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2015] NSWSC 893, where McCallum J dismissed defamation proceedings under a “show cause” notice issued pursuant to the Supreme Court Practice Note SC CL 4 paragraph 21, UCPR r 12.7 and ss 60 and 61 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW).
	
	
	The facts in those proceedings were different, in that the delay was longer (because of the delay in commencement of the proceedings) and at a much earlier stage of the proceedings, both of which are factors going in the favour of the plaintiffs in this litigation, as the proceedings were commenced expeditiously and have managed to get as far as the giving of categories of documents. Mr Kang’s delay resulted from his having commenced on the last day of the limitation period and appeared for himself for some time, during which time the action failed to progress. Mr Kang then retained lawyers and, when his claim still failed to progress, attempted to blame them (at [11]). McCallum J considered Mr Kang’s affidavit was “less than full and frank” (at [18]) and that Mr Kang was a “reluctant gladiator” (at [21] – [24], citing Bi v Mourad [2010] NSWCA 17). Her Honour was also critical of him for only serving the outstanding document the day before the show cause hearing (at [24]), which I note also occurred here. However, there is little other factual similarity apart from the generalised delay.
	
	
	The unacceptability of delay in litigation generally has been underlined by the many decisions referring to Aon Risk Services Australia Ltd v Australian National University (2009) 239 CLR 175.  Delay in defamation proceedings is, however, much more likely to result in the dismissal of proceedings than would be the case with other causes of action, and the principles applied by McCallum J in Kang v Australian Broadcasting Corporation are equally applicable to this case. Defamation actions raise complex questions of law and are subject to strict case management regimes which are in addition to, and not a replacement for, the requirements placed on litigants by ss 56 – 62 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW). Delays which might be acceptable in other forms of litigation are not acceptable in defamation. This is the rationale behind the one-year limitation period, the reluctance of the courts to permit repeated amendments and the requirement for parties to prosecute their claims diligently.
	
	
	That said, the real issue is not the plaintiffs’ failure to attend court or answer correspondence, or even their past defaults. The problem is the failure of the three plaintiffs bringing proceedings for defamation to identify crucial elements in their case, and to do so in accordance with extensions of timetables over some months. If the plaintiffs had provided a clear and comprehensive set of answers to particulars (and, better still, a properly pleaded Reply) I would not have considered summarily dismissing these proceedings.
	
	
	As was the case in Kang v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (at [24]), I can have no confidence in the future that the first, third and fourth plaintiffs have any intention of complying with their obligations under s 56 in providing a properly pleaded and particularised Reply, complying with their discovery obligations, or indeed conducting the defamation claims at all.
	
	
	Having regard to the hopelessness of the Reply and particulars provided, it would have to be struck out. That would raise issues as to whether the three plaintiffs suing for defamation should be granted leave to replead. Given the conduct of the case to date, the likelihood of these errors being remedied is low.
	
	
	The first defendant has not pleaded defences requiring a Reply. Should the defamation action be permitted to proceed against the first defendant only? That would be a most unfair result for the first defendant, and unlikely to enable the issues at the trial to be dealt with properly, given the first and second defendants’ joint participation in the raids in which the four plaintiffs were arrested.
	
	
	I have also taken into account the issues set out in more detail below in relation to the proportionality claims, namely the weakness of the first plaintiff’s claim, the very limited publication and the overlap of the other causes of action with the damages sought for the defamation claim.
	
	
	The first, third and fourth plaintiffs’ inadequate pleading and particularisation of vital issues in this litigation is “concerning” (Kang v Australian Broadcasting Corporation at [24]) and gives me no confidence that these proceedings can move forward. Accordingly, the dictates of justice require that the proceedings be dismissed.
	
	
	In the event that I have erred in this finding I would also strike out these proceedings on the principles of proportionality set out in Bleyer v Google Inc [2014] NSWSC 897. This was an application brought by the defendants, as opposed to the show cause order that I made. Although prior to the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) there was an “ocean of difference” (Zhao v Posa and Ors [2004] NSWCA 184 at [68]) between these two bases for dismissal of proceedings, it is arguable that the application of the same legislative provisions and principles means that this is now a distinction without a difference.
	


The proportionality argument


	
	The second basis upon which the defendants seek dismissal of the claim is that of proportionality. These closely resembled two of the three bases upon which the proceedings in Bleyer were dismissed, namely the very limited publication and:
	



	
	The plaintiff has a full remedy for the events on the night in question in the remaining causes of action; alternatively, the overlap between the claims for defamation with the claims for assault, wrongful arrest and false imprisonment.
	
	
	The limited nature of the publications, in circumstances where the only persons who heard the matters complained of would be the other plaintiffs (assuming they heard what was said) or the defendant’s servant or agent or his colleagues (assuming they heard what was said) mean that damages will be very limited.
	
	
	The success of defences such as unlikelihood of harm or, if the words spoken to the wife were heard by her husband, spousal immunity. In particular, the first matter complained of, if the words were established as having been spoken, was likely to be held to be vulgar abuse.
	
	
	The added complexity that a defamation claim brings to what would otherwise be a claim for assault, wrongful arrest and false imprisonment which is (again, noting the concession of the plaintiffs that no medical evidence will be relied upon) ready for hearing. This includes the possibility that a party will requisition a jury and the complexity of defences such as qualified privilege, in circumstances where the plaintiff’s Reply is manifestly inadequate, the imputations poorly drafted and the matter complained of incomplete.
	
	
	The plaintiffs still have a full damages remedy for the words spoken in their existing claims, and additionally have the benefit of uncapped general damages and punitive damages. They should not be permitted to “double dip” by claiming defamation damages as well.
	


The plaintiffs have a full or substantial remedy in the remaining claims


	
	The poor drafting of the statement of claim obscures the reality that the plaintiffs are, in fact, claiming damages for defamation for conduct which forms part of the wider picture of the words and actions relied upon by them in relation to the remaining claims. I particularly note:
	



	
	The pleader is required to set out the whole of the publication. If other words were spoken, such as words of arrest, or of suspicion of committing a crime, they must be included. Are these words the whole of the text of the matter complained of? If the words of arrest are the subject of the claim then there is substantial overlap with the conduct of the police officers in relation to the remaining causes of action.
	
	
	Although framed only as a claim for slander based on the words, or (since the plaintiffs were being arrested at the time) the reality of the pleading is that this is claim for a slander or slanders by conduct.
	
	
	Slander by conduct is generally pleaded as the cause of action where there is a “dramatic pantomime” of some kind (for example, in Cook v Cox [1812] 105 ER 552. Lord Ellenborough CJ gave the illustration of a person holding up an empty purse). Actions for slander by conduct, where the actions are a part of the words, are sometimes brought for what are colloquially referred to as “shoplifting cases” (Tumbarella v Kroger Co 85 Mich App 482, 271 NW 2d 284 (1978)). In Bishop v New South Wales (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Levine J, 12 March 1998, unreported), Bishop v New South Wales [2000] NSWSC 842, Bishop v New South Wales [2000] NSWSC 1042) the plaintiff brought proceedings over his portrayal in an actual pantomime, namely a theatrical performance in which he was portrayed. The point is that, if this is the real nature of the defamation, there is substantial overlap between the defamation and the remaining claims.
	



	
	A claim for damages for the words spoken clearly forms part of the pleaded claims for assault. The first plaintiff “was screamed at and humiliated” (paragraph 7) and the third and fourth plaintiffs suffered injury in seeing the police assault on their mother. The statement of claim goes on to note, in the paragraph following the claims for wrongful arrest and false imprisonment, the following particulars of that claim:
	


“9. Further and in addition the officers intimidated the Plaintiffs by aggressing [sic] calling the Third and Fourth Plaintiffs terrorists, by aggressively calling the First Plaintiff a bitch and by beating and assaulting them, wearing balaclavas and carrying firearms and weapons and their general conduct in handling and by bullying and frightening them.”


	
	In Sun Earth Homes Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1993) 45 FCR 265, Wilcox J described a series of alternate claims to defamation (such as injurious falsehood, misleading or deceptive conduct, negligent misstatement and deceit) as “unnecessary clutter”. His Honour went on to state:
	


“The causes of action just discussed have served only to clutter the case. It is not clear why they were pleaded. The applicants' significant claims arise out of the operation of the Trade Practices Act (or Fair Trading Act) and the law of defamation. There is a legal issue about the application of the Trade Practices Act and Fair Trading Act, to which I will turn in a moment. But the published material was clearly defamatory. To the extent (if any) that it made untrue imputations against any applicant, it was clearly indefensible; in which case the affected applicant would be entitled to recover damages without resort to claims for breach of contract, deceit, negligent misstatement or injurious falsehood. On the other hand, if the published material said nothing about a particular applicant, or the relevant imputations were true, that applicant's action would fail in any event. Nothing was gained by adding these other causes of action.”


	
	In the present case, the pleaded action for defamation overlaps almost entirely with the clearly more substantial claims for assault and battery, wrongful arrest and false imprisonment.
	


The limited extent of publication


	
	The statement of claim fails to identify the persons to whom the matters complained of were published but, in practical terms, the only persons present were the plaintiffs and the defendants. I have noted below the difficulties about claims for defamation for a publication about one spouse to another.
	
	
	While I note that publication about one plaintiff to another (Zarth v Williamson [2006] NSWCA 246) and by a defendant to a potential fellow defendant (Trantum v McDowell [2007] NSWCA 138) may still amount to publication to a third party, these publications must be acknowledged to have been made to at best a few persons.
	
	
	However, I do not consider that such a limited publication would only result in nominal damages. This issue came before the NSW Court of Appeal in very similar circumstances in Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd v Clarke [2013] NSWSC 272, where the plaintiff brought proceedings for defamation and false imprisonment after being stopped by store detectives. One of the store employees accused the plaintiff of stealing and eating frozen prawns. Another customer saw the events happening but did not hear the words spoken. The other employees denied hearing the words spoken. Although there was no evidence of the publication being heard by anyone other than the defendant’s employee who spoke the words (or, in fact, any third party), the Court of Appeal refused to disturb the damages award of $50,000 (at [103]). Accordingly, I do not consider that the defendants can establish that any award for defamation for the statements made would be of a nominal nature.
	


The likelihood of successful defences


	
	Although not strictly speaking a defence, the defendants submitted that the matters complained of, and in particular the statements allegedly made to the first plaintiff, would be likely to be struck out at trial as not being defamatory, on the basis that they were vulgar abuse.
	


Vulgar abuse and defamatory meaning


	
	The fact that an offensive word appears, or that the publication was made in an angry tone and voice, does not necessarily mean that the publication amounts to a mere abuse. The question is whether or not the matter complained of conveys more than just insulting words. If no defamatory act or condition is capable of being conveyed, then the matter complained of is more likely to amount to mere insult or “vulgar abuse”. It is only in those circumstances that the language will be regarded as merely offensive and vituperative and therefore not actionable: Ralston v Fomich (1992) 66 BCLR (2d) 166 at 169 (SC).
	
	
	In Mundey v Askin  [1982] 2 NSWLR 369, the first case in New South Wales to consider “vulgar abuse”, the defendant, the Premier, said about the plaintiff, during a long speech about his activities: “But don't under-estimate some of these vermin”. The jury found that the whole publication was not defamatory and Mr Mundey appealed. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge’s directions to the jury on the basis that the trial judge’s reference to “vulgar abuse” was in the context of whether or not “vulgar abuse” could damage reputation, which would have the effect of rendering a publication not being defamatory.
	
	
	The impact of “vulgar abuse” on defamatory meaning was more recently the subject of analysis in Bennette v Cohen (2005) 64 NSWLR 81; Tory v Megna [2007] NSWCA 13 and Echo Publications Pty Ltd v Tucker and Anor; Fast Buck$ v Tucker and Anor [2007] NSWCA 73.
	
	
	In Bennette v Cohen the defendant gave a speech at a fundraiser to raise funds for a person who had previously been sued for defamation by the plaintiff. The imputations included an imputation that “the plaintiff has done illegal work which severely damaged the environment”, which the jury considered was not defamatory of the plaintiff (imputations that the plaintiff was a “thug” and a “bully” were, however, found to be defamatory). In holding that the jury’s finding was within the range of conclusions reasonably available, the court noted (at [25]) that in considering whether an imputation was defamatory, it was for the jury to consider the meaning of the words and of the imputations in the context in which they were spoken, namely an address to a meeting. At [46]–[51] Bryson JA analysed the law relating to “vulgar abuse” and concluded (at [51]):
	


“In my opinion it is clear from the passage I have set out from Mundey v Askin that there is not a dichotomy between vulgar abuse (or mere vulgar abuse) on the one hand and defamatory matter on the other, and that it does not follow from establishing that the matter complained of was mere vulgar abuse that it was not defamatory. What is for decision is whether the words spoken bore a meaning that was likely to affect the reputation of the person spoken of. “Vulgar abuse” and “mere vulgar abuse” are not terms of art nor are they capable of high definition or detailed exposition; but in determining the meaning of words used and whether their meaning was defamatory it may be open to consideration whether the terms used and the context in which they were used were such that there was no likelihood of their affecting the reputation of the person spoken of; that no notice would be taken of them. This would not be the right conclusion on all statements which could accurately be described as vulgar abuse or mere vulgar abuse; much vulgar abuse is highly defamatory.”


	
	In Tory v Megna, the s 7A trial jury rejected a submission that the “rubbishy nature” of 17 anonymous newsletters, which accused the plaintiff (inter alia) of being “vermin”, meant that they were “junk mail”, incapable of conveying a defamatory meaning. The Court of Appeal (at [54]) dismissed the appeal on the facts, holding that the newsletters were “a serious attempt to communicate information.”
	
	
	In Echo Publications Pty Ltd v Tucker and Anor; Fast Buck$ v Tucker and Anor a submission that an imputation that the plaintiff was a “bully” was not defamatory was dismissed. Hodgson JA noted at [130]:
	


“Turning to imputation (h), namely that Mr Tucker was a “bully”, it seems to me that that is an imputation which, because of its vagueness, might possibly have been considered not likely to cause an ordinary reasonable person to think less of Mr Tucker or to shun or avoid him. It is true that the circumstance that something might be considered “vulgar abuse” does not prevent it from being defamation; but the circumstance that this imputation may be considered mere abuse may permit a jury to conclude that the imputation is one which in the circumstances is not likely to cause ordinary reasonable persons to think badly of Mr Tucker: cf. Mundey v Askin [1982] 2 NSWLR 369 at 371–2; Bennette at [45]–[51].”


	
	It can be seen from the above analysis that different findings as to the defamatory meaning of the words words “bully” and “vermin” have been reached. However, to make anything of this would be to ignore the warning of Bryson JA in Bennette v Cohen at [57], namely that “the nature of defamation is that there are no close analogies” and that it is dangerous, when determining whether imputations are defamatory, to have regard to other cases concerning specific words.
	
	
	For these reasons, it is necessary to be cautious about whether a word such as “bitch” is capably of conveying a defamatory meaning, as different views have been taken in cases where this word is used, depending on the rest of the context. In Piscioneri v Brisciani [2015] ACTSC 106, Burns J rejected a submission that posts in a forum headed “Bitching and Rants”, which included a series of vile insults (of which “stupid bitch” was one of the more anodyne), were mere vulgar abuse, and awarded the plaintiff damages of $82,000. However, in Wood v Branson (1952) 3 SALR 369 the word “bitch” was considered mere vulgar abuse (see also Blaser v Krattiger (1921) 99 Or 392 (“son of a bitch”), Culverhouse v Cooke Centre for Learning and Development Inc (1998) 177 Misc. 2d 365, 675 NYS 2d 776 (“rich bitch”), Travers v Shane (1995) 4 Mass L Rptr 141 (“fat, fucking, disgusting bitch”)).
	
	
	However, the distinguishing feature of this publication is that the word “bitch” is more or less all that was said. There is no context to give it flavour, or meaning, of any kind. In those circumstances, it is hard to see how any imputation, let alone the strained claim that the plaintiff is “an unpleasant woman”, could be made out. No imputation can be conveyed by the word “bitch”, for the reasons explained by Garibaldi J in Ward v Zelikovsky (1994) 136 NJ 516, 643 A 2d 972 at 982 – 983:
	


“The term ‘bitch’ is undoubtedly disparaging. But to hold that calling someone a ‘bitch’ is actionable would require us to imbue the term with a meaning it does not have. Such a holding would, in effect, say that some objective facts exist to justify characterising someone as a bitch. If calling someone a bitch is actionable, defendants must be able to raise the defence of truth. ‘Bithc” in its common everyday use is vulgar but non-actionable name-calling that is incapable of objective truth or falsity. A reasonable listener hearing the word ‘bitch’ would interpret the term to indicate merely that the speaker disliked Mrs Ward [the plaintiff] and is otherwise inarticulate. Although Zelikovsky’s [the defendant] manner of expression was very offensive, our slander laws do not redress offensive ideas.”


	
	Adopting the same approach to the findings of fact necessary for this application as those taken by McCallum J in Bleyer v Google Inc, I am of the view that the first plaintiff’s prospects of success in establishing the first matter complained of conveyed a defamatory imputation are extremely poor.
	
	
	That would leave only the second matter complained of, namely a statement made by one or more of the defendants’ servants or agents to the parents of the third and fourth plaintiffs that their sons were terrorists. Given the limited extent of publication, the circumstances of the arrest and the family relationship, a defence of unlikelihood of harm would have strong prospects of success.
	


Conclusions concerning proportionality


	
	In Ghosh v NineMSN Pty Ltd at [44], Macfarlan JA stated (although without deciding the issues) that only in rare circumstances would an action be struck out on the basis of proportionality, and that significant grounds, in addition to any history of delay, would be required.
	
	
	These proceedings have been ready for hearing for some months in relation to the assault, wrongful arrest and false imprisonment claims. The defamation case (which involves only three of the four plaintiffs) is not only extremely weak, in the case of the first plaintiff, but is holding the hearing of the other claims back.
	
	
	Furthermore, the plaintiffs have a better remedy for the words of the police officers in their remaining claims, in that they are entitled not only to uncapped general damages but also exemplary damages.
	
	
	Looking at the facts in this case through the proportionality of costs in accordance with s 60 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), the legal costs incurred in the litigating of the defamation claim are disproportionate to the result, not only for the defendants but also the plaintiffs. Where costs benefits accrue to both parties, costs economies of the kind referred to in Grizonic v Suttor [2008] NSWSC 914 (applying Jameel (Yousef) v Dow Jones & Co Inc [2005] All ER (D) 43 (Feb)) are appropriate. Given the overlap of causes of action and damages, there is no benefit to proceedings with a complex and somewhat artificial defamation claim which is “unnecessary clutter” to the issues for resolution between the parties.
	
	
	Taking all of the above into account, on the facts of this case, it is actually to the plaintiffs’ benefit for them to be able to proceed to hearing now on their remaining claims without the burden of a poorly pleaded and particularised claim for defamation delaying final resolution of the proceedings and adding to the costs in a manner wholly out of proportion to any benefit in terms of damages. Accordingly, the first, third and fourth plaintiff’s defamation claim is struck out on principles of proportionality, and pursuant to ss 60 and 61 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and r 12.7 UCPR.
	


Costs


	
	Costs should follow the event. If the defendants wish to bring an application under s 67 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) for those costs to be assessed prior to the hearing of the claims for assault, wrongful arrest and false imprisonment, they may bring such an application before the List Judge or the Judicial Registrar.
	


Orders


	
	The first, third and fourth plaintiffs’ claim for defamation in paragraphs 3-6 and 10-12 is struck out and dismissed pursuant to ss 60 and 61 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and r 12.7 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW).
	
	
	The first, third and fourth plaintiffs pay the defendants’ costs of this application and of the proceedings in relation to the first, third and fourth plaintiffs’ defamation claims.
	
	
	All plaintiffs granted leave to file an amended statement of claim in seven days deleting the claims for defamation and making such amendments to the claims for assault, wrongful arrest and false imprisonment as may accordingly be necessary.
	
	
	These proceedings transferred from the Defamation List to the Case Managed List and listed before the Judicial Registrar on 30 November 2015, on which date the parties should be ready to take a hearing date for the plaintiffs’ claims for assault, wrongful arrest and false imprisonment.

2702470,Pi v Zhou [2015] NSWSC 1644,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	Mr Zhou, the first defendant, and his wife, Mrs Zhao, the second defendant, own a property in Lakemba (the Property) on which there is a house and a one-bedroom flat. The defendants leased the flat as well as spare bedrooms in the house. In June 2010 Mr Pi, the plaintiff, agreed to rent the flat for the sum of $100 per week.
	
	
	Mr Pi occupied the flat until 12 January 2011. At about 7pm on 12 January 2011 there was an altercation between Mr Pi and Mr Zhou in the yard of the property as a result of which injuries were sustained by both of them. Mr Pi’s occupation ceased from that time.
	
	
	By statement of claim filed on 8 July 2015, Mr Pi claimed:
	



	
	Damages for breach of contract against Mr Zhou, arising from Mr Zhou’s interference with his quiet enjoyment of the flat and from his forced eviction from the Property;
	
	
	Damages against both defendants with respect to the assault on 12 January 2011; and
	
	
	Damages against Mr Zhou for conversion of a washing machine.
	



	
	The defendants deny these allegations. With respect to the assault, they admit that there was an altercation between Mr Pi and Mr Zhou on 12 January 2011 but contend that Mr Pi was the instigator and that, to the extent to which Mr Zhou used force in the exchange, he did so only in self defence. Mr Pi had originally made other claims, including in defamation. However his pleading in that respect was struck out at an earlier hearing.
	
	
	The plaintiff and both defendants gave oral evidence and were cross-examined.
	


The facts

The background


	
	The defendants purchased the Property in 2003. The house had four bedrooms. The detached flat had one bedroom. There was also a separate kitchen and bathroom behind the house which could be used by the occupant of the flat. The defendants, who at that time lived in the house, rented out the flat and at least one bedroom in their house. The tenants of the house and the flat shared the outside kitchen and bathroom.
	


The lease agreement


	
	When the flat became vacant in 2010 Mr Zhou placed an advertisement in the Chinese Daily. In June 2010 Mr Pi came to look at the flat and spoke to Mr Zhou, in Mandarin. Mr Pi told Mr Zhou that he was unemployed, had been “taking a break for around two years”, and lived on social security benefits. Mr Zhou explained that the rent was $100 per week and that he would have to share the outside kitchen and bathroom with the tenant who rented a room inside the house. Mr Pi said that he wanted to rent the flat for three months. Mr Zhou agreed to the three month term and said that, thereafter, either party would be entitled to give the other two weeks’ notice. Mr Pi agreed to these terms and, on about 14 June 2010, he moved in. He paid $100 for the first week’s rent, as well as $200 for a two-week bond. Mr Pi asked Mr Zhou if he could store building materials on the Property. Mr Zhou agreed.
	
	
	In about September 2010 Dr Lin, Mr Pi’s general practitioner, referred Mr Pi to Mei Ling, a psychologist, whom he consulted for the first time on 15 September 2010 because he was “unhappy”. I do not accept that the referral was related to any act or omission either of Mr Zhou or his wife.
	
	
	In the second half of 2010, Ms Gu was a tenant in the house on the Property. In about November 2010 she complained to Mr Zhou that Mr Pi had touched her bra. Mr Zhou reproached Mr Pi and asked him to behave himself, which he said he would do. Ms Gu complained again about a week later. Mr Zhou approached Mr Pi and told him that he would call the police if he did not behave himself. In December 2010 Ms Gu told Mr Zhou that she was going to move out because of Mr Pi’s behaviour which she regarded as insulting and rude. She moved out in late December 2010.
	
	
	On 27 December 2010 Mr Pi paid $200 rent, which covered the period to 9 January 2011.
	
	
	Between 5 and 12 January 2011 various text messages passed between Mr Pi and Mr Zhou, the content of which showed the increasing friction between them. On 5 January 2011 and 6 January 2011 Mr Pi sent a text message in which he complained that there was no internet reception and claimed that the rent should be reduced. On 6 January 2011 Mr Pi sent two text messages in which he complained that a caged bird had been hung in the vicinity of the detached kitchen area and asked for it to be removed.
	


The termination of the lease


	
	On 9 January 2011, Mr Zhou told Mr Pi that he was no longer welcome to occupy the flat and gave him two weeks’ notice. Mr Pi was upset and threatened not to pay rent for the remaining two weeks and to “cause trouble to the house”. He also made threats of violence to both Mr Zhou and Mrs Zhao.
	
	
	On 10 January 2011 Mr Zhou sent text messages to Mr Pi demanding that the rent be paid. Later that day, at 7.55pm, Mr Zhou sent a further text message saying that he still had to pay the last two weeks’ rent even though he was going to move out on 23 January 2011. Mr Zhou also said in the text that the bond would be returned after he had cleaned up the flat. At 8.39pm Mr Pi complained by text message that the rental bond had not been paid to the Consumer Trader and Tenancy Tribunal (CTTT). Mr Zhao reiterated his claim for rent. Mr Pi, in turn, responded with an accusation that Mr Zhao had “frequent made much troubles with tenants and me” and accused him of damaging his health. Mr Pi also referred in terms which are unclear to “emergency into hospital on date 7th-8th Jan 2011”.
	
	
	In a text message sent to Mr Zhou at 5.43am on 11 January 2011, Mr Pi reiterated his complaint about the lack of internet service and claimed to be entitled to a deduction from the rent.
	


The events of 12 January 2011


	
	On 12 January 2011, at about 7pm, Mr Zhou, who worked as a taxi driver, was walking from the house across the yard towards his taxi, which was parked in the street, in order to commence his night shift. Mr Pi, who was brandishing an electric drill, approached him and threatened to strike him with the drill. Mr Zhou stepped backwards to avoid being struck. He tried to get away from Mr Pi. There was an altercation between them as a result of which each man struck the other. During the altercation Mr Pi grabbed Mr Zhou’s left hand and bit into the area near the thumb. Mr Zhou called for help.
	
	
	Mrs Zhao came out of the house when she heard the commotion. She called out to Mr Pi to stop. Mrs Zhao saw Mr Pi hit Mr Zhou on the back with both his hands. She screamed for help and asked passersby to call the police. I infer that Mrs Zhao, a native Mandarin speaker, may have preferred a bystander to ring the police rather than make the call herself. During the altercation she took photographs of the two men with her mobile phone. The photographs in evidence, although somewhat blurred, show Mr Pi as the aggressor and that Mr Zhou was trying to get away. I reject Mr Pi’s evidence that the photographs were “fake”.
	
	
	Eventually Mr Zhou got away from Mr Pi and called the police. A bystander stood between Mr Zhou and Mr Pi to prevent any further physical contact between them. The police arrived not long afterwards. They arrested Mr Pi and charged him with assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
	
	
	An ambulance came to take Mr Pi to Canterbury Hospital. The ambulance records show that the ambulance was called at 7.52pm and arrived at the scene at 8.03pm. It departed the scene at 8.33pm. Mr Pi undertook triage at the hospital at 8.55pm.
	
	
	The history recorded in the ambulance records is as follows:
	


“O/A [on arrival] Police on scene. Pt [patient, Mr Pi] alleged to have been involved in incident with another male. Pt alleged to have chased other male with drill and bitten other male on hand. Pt allegedly punched in face by other male.

O/E [on examination] Pt alert on AO’s [ambulance officer’s] arrival. Pt had periods not answering AO’s questions only regarding to pain. Pt also has apparent language difficulties. Pt GCS [Glasgow Coma Score] 14, well [illegible] with swelling to mouth and bleeding from mouth and damage to teeth. Pt no apparent LOC [loss of consciousness]. Pt c/o [complains of] central neck pain. Collar applied. Pt c/o grazes to right and left knees. Pt haemodynamically stable. Pt Tx [transfer] for further Rx/ Assessment. Unable to obtain pain [illegible] – language difficulty/ assessment difficulty.”


	
	The diagram in the ambulance notes depicts abrasions to both the plaintiff’s knees and swelling and tenderness to his mouth area.
	
	
	Mr Pi gave evidence that, when he returned home in the early hours of 13 January 2011 after he had been discharged from hospital, his daughter took photographs of his mouth and bruises to his back. His daughter was not called to give evidence. I do not accept Mr Pi’s evidence that the photographs were taken at that time.
	
	
	Another ambulance came to the Property and took Mr Zhou to St George hospital where the injury to his hand, which required seven stitches, was treated. After Mr Zhou was discharged later that evening, he and his wife went to St George Police Station to provide statements about what had occurred. They arrived at the police station at about 2.40am on 13 January 2011.
	


The AVO against Mr Pi


	
	Mr Zhou applied for an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) against Mr Pi. The grounds set out in the application for the AVO recorded:
	


“Police hold fears for the PINOP [person in need of protection] due to the unprovoked nature of the assault and the willingness of the defendant [Mr Pi] to use an implement [the drill] to attack the PINOP and by biting him.”


	
	Magistrate Baker made the AVO. The police served the order on Mr Pi, who was still at Canterbury Hospital.
	


The police statements


	
	I accept the truth of what Mr Zhou said in his statement to police (which is reflected in the narrative set out above) in which he said as follows:
	


“3.   …For the past three (3) weeks I have been having problems with Mr Pi in relation to him not paying his rent which is one hundred ($100) dollars a week. On Sunday 9th of January 2011 Mr Pi threatened my wife and I. He took out his phone and took photos of my me [sic] and my wife and he said “I will send these photo’s to someone who will kill you”. I didn’t report this to the police because I wanted to keep being friendly to him I didn’t want any problems.

4.   About 7.15pm on Wednesday 12th of January 2011, I left my house through the front door and walked to my taxi which was parked outside the front of my house. Mr Pi started approaching he was about two (2) cars lengths away from my taxi. He said “You bastard I will kill you” I turned around and I said “Don’t be rude to me. You owe me rent and you need to behave yourself if you want to live here”.

5   At the time he was speaking to me he had his right hand hidden behind his back and all of a sudden his right hand has risen up and he has tired [sic] to hit me in the head with a power drill.

6.   I moved and he missed but he has done it a second time and hit me in the left side of the chest with the drill.

7.   I felt very scared I thought he was going to kill me. I pushed his right hand away and the drill has fallen to the ground and I was tiring [sic] to protect myself by covering my face with my hands. He then grabbed my left forearm and pulled it towards his mouth and bit the webbing between my thumb and first finger. He has bitten very hard causing a very deep wound I felt immediate pain I kept trying to pull away but he just kept bitting [sic] me. I started to call for help and a man I don’t know has come and stopped Mr Pi from bitting [sic] me.

8.   I managed to get my hand free from his mouth. Then I called the police and I took the drill and put it on the ground. Mr Pi has tired [sic] to get the drill off the ground to hide it. I tired [sic] to stop him at that time police came and made him sit down of the ground. I then told police what happened and I was taken to St George Hospital by Ambulance where I received sever (7) stitches in my left hand.

9.   I am very scared that he may return to my home and attack me or my wife. I am worried that I may have permanent damage to my hand.”


	
	I also accept the truth of what Mrs Zhao said in her statement to police, which is reflected in the narrative set out above. She said as follows:
	


“3.   I am currently living at [address] Lakemba with my husband Cheng ZHOU. We have been living there for three years. We rent a flat that is in our backyard to Guang Hua Pi. Guang has been living in the back flat for about six months. Over the last month or so we have been having problems with Guang over the payment of his rent. My husband told Guang he had three weeks to move out.   

4.   About 7pm on Wednesday 12 January 2011 my husband left the house to go to work. My husband is a taxi driver. I said goodbye to my husband and sit down to watch television. A few minutes later I heard yelling at the front of my house. I went to the front door to see what was happening. I saw my husband and Guang in the driveway of our house. Guang had a drill in his hand and he was pointing it at my husband’s head. My husband was standing with his hands out in front of his face waving them around trying to protect himself. When my husband was waving his hands he hit Guang in the face a few times. I scream out: “Help me call police.” My husband pushed the drill out of his hand. My husband tried to get away but Guang followed him. I saw Guang hit my husband on the back with both his hands.”


	
	Mr Pi tendered a statement of Constable Stone. No objection was taken on behalf of the defendants to this statement. I accept what Constable Stone said in the statement, as follows:
	


“4.   I took the victim [Mr Zhou] to the front porch area of the house and spoke to him and his wife. The victim’s wife is Christine ZHAO. At this time several other police arrived at the location. ZHAO said “He want to kill my husband. He have drill and put it to my husband head. He want to kill him.” I went back outside to where the accused and Constable REY were standing. The accused was pointing towards the victim and yelling “I kill you.” The accused then sat down. A short time later an ambulance arrived at the location.”


	
	I reject Mr Pi’s version of events, which is inconsistent with my findings set out above. Mr Pi’s version was that he was trying to move out of the flat on 12 January 2011 when Mr Zhou attacked him. Mr Pi maintained that he only struck Mr Zhou because he needed to defend himself.
	


The aftermath


	
	On 13 January 2011 Mr Pi sought treatment at the Sydney Dental Hospital. He reported that he had been hit on the face by his landlord on the previous evening. Dr Burleigh, who examined him, recorded that there was no evident bruising, but there was a swollen upper lip and clotted blood on his lips. Some of his teeth had been displaced and a laceration of his gum was noted. The affected teeth were repositioned. Mr Pi returned for review on 20 January 2011 and also on 27 January 2011. Because of continuing problems, Mr Pi had root canal treatment which was conducted under local anaesthesia. Dr Burleigh, recorded her conclusion as follows:
	


“In our opinion, prognosis for the injured teeth is very poor and patient may require removal of all four (4) front teeth. In that case, he will require either crowns and bridges or implants to replace his injured teeth – for aesthetic and functional reasons. The cost of this treatment, future maintenance and probable replacement (must be considered) may be up to $50,000.00.”


	
	A few days after 12 January 2011, Mr Pi’s wife and some friends returned to the Property to collect his belongings from the flat.
	


The criminal charge against Mr Pi


	
	As referred to above, Mr Pi was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm as a result of the incident. The summary proceedings commenced in the Burwood Local Court before Pierce LCM on 1 September 2011. As the proceedings did not conclude that day, the matter was stood over until 12 December 2011, and again until 13 March 2012. At the conclusion of the hearing Mr Pi applied for Pierce LCM to disqualify himself. Magistrate Pierce acceded to the plaintiff’s application. The matter was re-listed for hearing on 17 September 2012. It came before Madgwick LCM, who transferred it to Stone LCM, by whom it was ultimately heard. However, by agreement between the police prosecutor, and Mr Jawas, who appeared for Mr Pi, the oral evidence was not given again and the matter was determined solely by reference to the transcript. The legal representatives agreed that there would be no submissions but that they would simply rely on the transcript. At the conclusion of the hearing, Magistrate Stone dismissed the charge on the basis that his Honour was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the police prosecutor had excluded self defence.
	


The CTTT proceedings


	
	In September 2011 Mr Pi commenced proceedings against Mr Zhou in the CTTT. The matter was listed in the CTTT on several occasions. I accept Mr Zhou’s evidence that Mr Pi attended the CTTT on each occasion and appeared to be walking unassisted and without difficulty. On 13 September 2011, the CTTT made an order (and subsequently, on 29 September 2011, issued a certificate to that effect under s 51 of the Consumer Trader and Tenancy Act 2001 (NSW)) that Mr Zhou was to pay Mr Pi the sum of $157.14 on or before 27 September 2011. The evidence did not reveal the reasons for the order, save that it was said that Mr Zhou did not lodge the bond with the Rental Bond Services until 2011. There was reference to the sum of $157.14 being for “refund of rent” but there was no explanation as to how this was calculated. Mr Zhou’s evidence was that, in the CTTT, Mr Pi alleged that he had given money for outstanding rent to Mrs Zhao. Mr Zhou was not willing to subject Mrs Zhao to Mr Pi’s questioning in the CTTT and, accordingly, this evidence was not refuted. Although I note the result of the CTTT proceedings, I do not regard it as affecting my task of assessing the evidence before me in the present proceedings.
	


Civil proceedings in the Local Court


	
	In 2012 Mr Pi commenced proceedings in the Local Court against Mr Zhou claiming damages in respect of a washing machine. Mr Zhou told the Magistrate that Mr Pi had already claimed damages in respect of the washing machine in the CTTT. On that basis the Magistrate dismissed the claim.
	
	
	In 2012 the defendants moved away from the Property and now live in a flat in Hurstville. I accept their evidence that they moved away from the Property because they were fearful of Mr Pi.
	


Mr Pi’s claims

Claim for breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment and alleged forced eviction


	
	I do not accept Mr Pi’s evidence that Mr Zhou entered his room without his consent or that he hung a bird cage outside his kitchen in such a way as to interfere with his rights as an occupant. Nor am I satisfied that there was any issue about the internet for which Mr Zhou was responsible. I accept Mr Zhou’s evidence that he did not enter Mr Pi’s room.
	
	
	I do not accept Mr Pi’s version of what occurred on 12 January 2011. I accept that Mr Zhou gave him two weeks’ notice on 9 January 2011 and that he was, accordingly, obliged to leave on 23 January 2011. I do not accept Mr Pi’s evidence that Mr Zhou told him, on 12 January 2011, that he had to leave on that day.
	
	
	Mr Pi has failed to discharge the onus of proving this aspect of his claim.
	


Claim for damages for assault


	
	That Mr Pi was acquitted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm is no bar to a finding that he was the instigator and perpetrator of the assault or that he was not acting in self defence: Helton v Allen (1940) 63 CLR 691. The determination of who instigated an assault, particularly one as brutal as the one in the present case, requires careful consideration of the evidence in light of the gravity of the allegation: s 140(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). As Starke J said in Helton v Allen at 701 (after referring to Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR 336):
	


“Hence where the matter to be proved is a grave fraud or a crime, the tribunal [judicial tribunal in a civil case] ought not to be satisfied that it has been established unless the preponderance of evidence is so substantial as to establish it clearly.”


	
	It is enough, in the circumstances of the present case, to find that I am not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that Mr Zhou was acting other than in self defence when he came into physical contact with Mr Pi on 12 January 2011. However, I note for completeness that the evidence is sufficient to satisfy me that Mr Pi himself was the aggressor and that Mr Zhou acted in self defence.
	
	
	I accept that Mr Pi suffered some injuries as a result of the altercation with Mr Zhou on 12 January 2011. He probably damaged his mouth and teeth when Mr Zhou resisted his attempts to bite his hand, and when he actually bit his hand. I am satisfied, too, that he suffered abrasions to both of his knees and bruising to his mouth as a result of the conflict on 12 January 2011, as recorded in the ambulance notes. Aside from those injuries recorded in the ambulance notes, or the injuries to his mouth recorded by Dr Burleigh, I do not accept that Mr Pi suffered any injuries as a result of the physical contact with Mr Zhou on 12 January 2011. To the extent to which photographs taken after the event depict blood around Mr Pi’s mouth I am not satisfied that the blood was Mr Pi’s own blood, since it may well have been Mr Zhou’s blood which was shed as a result of Mr Pi biting his hand.
	
	
	As referred to above, I accept that Mr Pi suffered some physical injuries in the course of the altercation on 12 January 2011. However, I am not satisfied, in respect of any such injury, that it was inflicted by Mr Zhou other than in self defence for the unprovoked attack on him which Mr Pi had initiated. I am not satisfied that Mrs Zhao took part in the attack at all or that there was any physical contact between her and Mr Pi. She was merely a distressed witness to an assault on her husband.
	
	
	I do not consider that Mr Pi has established any liability on the part of the defendants for assault. However, for completeness, I shall address causation and damages.
	
	
	Mr Pi tendered several documents relating to his medical condition in which he sought to attribute a large number of illnesses, ailments and medical conditions, including depression, haemorrhoids, insomnia, migraine, benign prostatic hypertrophy and chronic airways limitation and cervical spondylosis to the altercation on 12 January 2011. The evidence that postulates a causal connection between these conditions and the assault is based on a history of the assault (and an absence of any other matter that might have caused the conditions) that I do not accept.
	
	
	For example, when Mr Pi saw Dr Conrad for the purposes of these proceedings on 16 February 2015 for the first time, Dr Conrad noted (in a medicolegal report of the same date) the following presenting symptoms:
	


“Mr Pi continues to have considerable depression and anxiety. He has difficulty with his memory and he has some cognitive impairment. These were amply displayed during the interview where Mr Pi appeared profoundly depressed and had great difficulty answering questions, even with the help of an interpreter. He has headaches, tinnitus, problems with his teeth and pain in his neck and pain in his back. He finds it difficult to do a lot of standing, walking and has to walk with the aid of a mechanical walker.

. . .

He says that he is living in shared accommodation but he would not give me any details as he was frightened of being attacked.”


	
	Mr Pi has made claims under various heads of damage by reason of the assault, including claims for medical expenses and economic loss. In light of my findings above, I am not satisfied that the need for medication, physical support or care has resulted from the assault on 12 January 2011. Mr Pi tendered documents which show that, since at least 2008 he has obtained prescribed medication for several kinds of drugs. The evidence does not reveal the purpose of the various medications prescribed.
	
	
	Mr Pi tendered material which shows that he held an authorised bus licence. He has also adduced evidence of ceramic art work he has created and of his drawings and paintings, as well as evidence of the regard in which he was held by at least one gallery proprietor (of the Silk Road Gallery in Kingston, Australian Capital Territory). The evidence adduced by Mr Pi also included his illustrations of the configuration of the house and the flat on the Property, as well as what he said occurred during the conflict on 12 January 2011. This evidence demonstrates his competence as an illustrator. I am not satisfied that any act or omission as alleged against either Mr Zhou or Mrs Zhao has any bearing on whether Mr Pi can engage in any occupation, whether remunerative or otherwise.
	


Claim for damages against Mr Zhou for conversion of a washing machine.


	
	It is generally an abuse of process to make a claim in one court where the same, or a similar, claim has been dismissed in the same, or another, court or tribunal. There is some evidence, referred to above, that Mr Pi commenced proceedings in the Local Court which were dismissed on the ground Mr Pi had already claimed damages in respect of the washing machine in the CTTT. Mr Pi denied that he had made any claim concerning the washing machine in the CTTT. The evidence does not permit me to determine whether Mr Zhou’s understanding of the ambit of Mr Pi’s claim in the CTTT was correct; or, indeed, what was claimed in the Local Court.
	
	
	However, it is not necessary to decide whether the same claim has already been dismissed elsewhere as Mr Pi has not adduced evidence to establish the factual elements of this claim, which is, accordingly, rejected.
	


Credibility of witnesses

Mr Pi


	
	I found Mr Pi to be a very distracted and intense witness. He was utterly convinced that his conduct was at all times justified and that he was not in any way responsible for the conflict with Mr Zhou and his wife. He was adamant that Mr Zhou had instigated the attack. His evidence was, notwithstanding the skill of his interpreter, at times hard to follow. I formed the view that his grasp on reality was not particularly strong.
	
	
	His evidence was that the attack lasted for about 40 minutes and that both Mr Zhou and Mrs Zhao had kicked him for at least 10 minutes when he was on the ground at the conclusion of the attack. Although Mr Pi may have genuinely believed in the truth of his own version, it conflicts not only with the defendants’ version but also with the circumstance that there were bystanders in the vicinity and that the police arrived relatively soon after the conflict began. It is unlikely that Mr Zhou, who was dressed for work as a taxi driver and was about to commence his shift, would initiate a physical conflict with one of his tenants who was, apparently, in the process of moving out. Motive is an aspect of probability: Onassis and Calerropolous v Vergiottis [1968] 21 Lloyds LR 403 at 431 per Lord Pearce.
	
	
	Furthermore the objective probabilities tend to suggest that Mr Pi was the one who had a grievance as he was required to leave what had been his home as he was no longer welcome at the Property. Indeed, the statement of Constable Stone (which I accept) records that Mr Pi was still pointing towards Mr Zhou and yelling, “I kill you”, after the police had arrived.
	
	
	I do not accept Mr Pi’s evidence except where admitted, corroborated or against interest.
	


Mr Zhou


	
	Mr Zhou was an impressive and articulate witness. At the time of the hearing he appeared still to be shocked by the violence of the attack on him by Mr Pi and concerned about the effect on his wife, Mrs Zhao, of proximity to Mr Pi. I am satisfied that his evidence was truthful. In particular, I accept his evidence that he had not interfered with Mr Pi’s enjoyment of the flat and that he had no interest in his tenants, except to make sure that they paid rent and did not interfere with other tenants. His conduct in going to the police station to report the attack as soon as he had been discharged from hospital demonstrated, in my view, his concern (which I accept to be honest and well-motivated) that the details of the incident be accurately recorded and that the law be enforced.
	


Mrs Zhao


	
	Mrs Zhao answered the questions put to her in cross-examination directly. She refuted Mr Pi’s account in a straightforward manner. I accept her evidence.
	


Orders


	
	For the reasons given above, I make the following orders:
	



	
	Judgment for the defendants.
	
	
	Unless either party makes an application in writing to my Associate within seven days hereof, order the plaintiff to pay the defendants’ costs of the proceedings.

		09 November 2015",2015-11-08 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2702474,Charnock v R [2015] NSWDC 361,"Judgment


	
	Cody Charnock did a very stupid thing when he was drunk on the night of 9 August this year. He had been refused entry to a local hotel here in Orange. Upset, he went and kicked a car and smashed its window. Fortunately for the car owner and unfortunately for Mr Charnock, he did this in view of the local police. They pursued him and he ran away onto a train track. That itself is also illegal. They finally arrested him and he was charged with two offences, reckless damage to property and running onto the train lines.
	
	
	The reckless damage is an offence against s 195(1)(a) of Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The railway line offence is against r 68J(1)(b) of the Passenger Transport Regulation 2007 (NSW).
	
	
	Mr Charnock was refused bail and spent two nights in custody. The second night was apparently spent in Bathurst Correctional Centre, a medium security institution. In other evidence which I will mark as an exhibit shortly, Mr Charnock - who is still only 20 and was 20 when this happened - was clearly frightened by the experience. Mr Charnock’s criminal record contains only one entry, which was driving whilst his licence was suspended and he received a fine.
	
	
	When Mr Charnock went to Court he pleaded guilty in the Orange Local Court, where Magistrate Lucas fined him $600 for the reckless damage and $200 for the train line offence.
	
	
	He appealed to this Court and originally sought leave to set aside his plea of guilty and therefore the conviction. Mr S Moore, solicitor, who appears for him, prepared a very detailed and comprehensive argument in support of that. I do not need to make any findings in respect of that application or deal with any of the submissions which are made in that application. However, the application was supported by an affidavit by Mr Charnock, which was the source of the information I have about his experience in prison.
	


HIS HONOUR: Just while I think of it the schedule of documents which was tendered and the accompanying documents tendered by Mr Moore originally on the conviction appeal I will mark as exhibit 1.


	
	Mr Moore, on behalf of his client, withdrew the conviction appeal and I have granted him leave to do so and I have dismissed the application for leave to set aside the plea of guilty. Mr Moore then proceeds to confirm his client’s plea and asks me to make an order under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	A number of factors favour that. One is the age of his client; he is only 20 and a relatively young man. Second are his antecedents; he has one minor item on his record. A third is the fact that for these two offences that would normally attract the kind of penalty the Magistrate imposed (a fine), he has served in effect two days in custody. It was a traumatising and sobering experience for the young man and amounted to more than enough deterrence I expect.
	
	
	For that reason I propose to grant Mr Moore’s application.
	
	
	The formal orders which I make are these. I grant Mr Moore leave to withdraw the application for leave to set aside the plea of guilty, and that application is dismissed. Under s 20(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), I determine the remaining appeal against sentence by setting aside both sentences. Instead of those sentences in respect of both offences, under s10(1)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, without proceeding to conviction, I find Mr Charnock guilty of the offences and I make orders directing that the relevant charges be dismissed.
	


HIS HONOUR: All right Mr Charnock you have won your appeal. Mr Moore’s very good submissions and your taking of his advice have meant that there is no conviction against you, do you understand?

APPELLANT: Yeah.

HIS HONOUR: All right good luck. Do not do anything silly like that again, okay.

		10 February 2016",2015-11-09 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2702480,R v Muir [2015] NSWDC 362,"Judgment


	
	The police charged Kim Muir with arson. They say that on 14 March 2014 here in Orange she set alight a house in Orange. The police interviewed Kim Muir and she admitted during the interview that she had in fact broken into that house at about 8.30pm the previous night. The house was indeed burnt. When the fire brigade was called at about midnight, the house was well alight.
	
	
	In the same interview where she admitted breaking into the house and stealing some items, Kim Muir firmly denied that she had anything to do with the house fire. Police maintained the charge and Kim Muir was committed for trial to the District Court. The prosecution and the defence agreed that there could be a trial without a jury, that is, a judge alone trial. It commenced this morning and has been conducted very efficiently by two very experienced counsel, Mr L Shaw, the Crown Prosecutor, and Mr W Walsh for Ms Muir.
	
	
	Mr Shaw called a series of witnesses and tendered a series of exhibits. He called members of the fire brigade who attended the scene. He called the neighbours who had witnessed the fire and he called the police, including the officer-in-charge of the investigation. He tendered statements by some of the other witnesses. There were also photographic exhibits and plans, which were very helpful.
	
	
	Mr Shaw’s case is circumstantial. The case law is clear that just because a case is circumstantial does not mean that it is weak. It is circumstantial in this case because Ms Muir does not admit that she lit the fire, no witness saw her light the fire or indeed saw her anywhere near the fire when it occurred. Ms Muir said to the police that after she broke in and stole a couple of items she went back home. She lived nearby.
	
	
	The law about proving a circumstantial case is this. Because the responsibility of the prosecution is to satisfy the tribunal, normally a jury but in this case me, of the guilt of the accused person beyond reasonable doubt, there cannot be any lingering reasonable possibility of innocence. That means in a circumstantial case that the prosecution has to exclude any reasonable possibility that somebody else was responsible for the crime. That is where the problem lies with Mr Shaw’s case.
	
	
	The evidence which he very fairly led included accounts by the neighbours. A number of the neighbours heard voices and saw people close to the scene of the fire and close to the time of the fire. Some of the witnesses heard voices about half an hour before the fire brigade was called. At least one witness, Ms Best, said there was only about ten minutes between her hearing of three men arguing near her house for about two or three minutes before things went “deadly quiet” and the arrival of either the police or the fire brigade. Another witness gave an account of a man who appeared in the street where the burning house was and, of all things, lit a cigarette and made an observation that anyone would be lucky to put the fire out before he left the scene. Yet another witness saw some men carrying something white in the vicinity. Some of these observations do not coincide exactly with the time, with the exception of Ms Best who places her observations close to the fire. Some of them are half an hour or more apart. But of course, they are all estimates. The estimates might be wrong. Mr Walsh cross-examined at least one or two witnesses about estimates being approximate and they acknowledged that.
	
	
	Mr Walsh led from one of the police officers the fact that his client had no criminal record for arson or for malicious damage. Mr Shaw very fairly acknowledged that the fact that Ms Muir admitted that she broke and entered the house was to some extent to her credit but he also appropriately pointed out that the case against her would probably mean rejecting her account that the break in was at 8.30 and putting it closer to midnight. He argued that Ms Muir had a motive to set the fire because she admittedly broke into the house by climbing in through a window. She might have set the fire to destroy any evidence of the break in or of her connection with the break in.
	
	
	As Mr Shaw very correctly and fairly acknowledges, arson is notoriously difficult to prove. I agree with him and I think it has not been proved in this case. I myself think that there remains the reasonable possibility that any of these arguing or cigarette smoking or goods carrying characters who were in the vicinity close enough to the time may have been the culprit or culprits for the arson.
	
	
	In her favour Ms Muir has the fact that she has never committed a crime like this or even malicious damage. I can weigh that in considering whether it is likely that Ms Muir was responsible for this fire.
	
	
	For those reasons I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of Ms Muir on the charge of arson and I acquit her.
	


WALSH: May it please.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Court pleases.

2702503,Turnbull v Chief Executive of the Office of Environment and Heritage [2015] NSWCCA 278,"Judgment


	
	MEAGHER JA: I agree with Button J.
	
	
	MCCALLUM J: Subject to one qualification, I agree with Button J, for the reasons his Honour has stated. I agree that no factual error is established in this case, whether one applies the traditional test (whether the finding of fact was open to the sentencing judge) or the less limited approach favoured by the majority in Clarke v R [2015] NSWCCA 232 at [25]-[36] per Basten JA; Hamill J agreeing at [133] (whilst acknowledging at [136] that the tension in the relevant authorities may be a matter best resolved in an appropriate case by a specially constituted bench of five); Garling J contra at [97]-[99]. Button J has expressed his preference for the traditional approach. As this issue was not argued in the present appeal and in light of my agreement that no error is established on either approach, I would prefer to reserve my view on that issue.
	
	
	I agree with the orders proposed by Button J.
	
	
	BUTTON J: On 19 September 2014 in the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales, Sheahan J convicted and sentenced Ian Robert Turnbull (the applicant) with regard to an offence against s 12 of the Native Vegetation Act 2003 (NSW) (the Act). That section is as follows:
	


12 Clearing requiring approval

(1) Native vegetation must not be cleared except in accordance with:

(a) a development consent granted in accordance with this Act, or

(b) a property vegetation plan.

(2) A person who carries out or authorises the carrying out of clearing in contravention of this section is guilty of an offence and is liable to the maximum penalty provided for under section 126 of the EPA Act for a contravention of that Act.

(3) It is a defence in any proceedings for an offence against this section if it is established that the clearing was permitted under Division 2 or 3 or was excluded from this Act by Division 4.


	
	Pursuant to s 126 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW), the applicable maximum penalty is a fine of $1.1 million.
	
	
	The applicant had pleaded guilty to clearing two properties in the North West of New South Wales between 1 November 2011 and 18 January 2012. That plea was entered at the stage of a directions hearing on 17 May 2013.
	
	
	The learned sentencing judge imposed a fine of $140,000. The applicant was also “ordered to pay the reasonable investigation and legal costs and disbursements of the prosecutor, as agreed, or as assessed according to law”.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 5AB of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), the applicant has sought leave to appeal against that sentence.
	
	
	This judgment explains why, in my opinion, leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal should be dismissed, except with regard to correcting a conceded slip made by his Honour in the order dealing with costs.
	


At first instance


	
	Although the applicant pleaded guilty to the offence, a number of factual matters remained in dispute, and required determination by his Honour. The proceedings on sentence extended over four days, and featured extensive oral evidence, including cross-examination of a number of witnesses.
	
	
	A particular dispute centred upon the degree of damage that was occasioned by the criminal acts of the applicant.
	
	
	I derive the following summaries of the objective features pertaining to the offence, and the subjective features pertaining to the applicant, from the combined effect of an agreed statement of facts that was placed before his Honour, and the remarks on sentence. I shall indicate which findings of fact are impugned by grounds of appeal as I summarise them.
	
	
	Objectively, the criminal conduct of the applicant consisted of clearing native vegetation on two properties associated with members of his family. Another person acted at his direction, and a bulldozer was used. Photographs were tendered that permitted his Honour to see the results of that conduct with his own eyes.
	
	
	There was a significant dispute in the proceedings on sentence with regard to the actual extent (in terms of hectares) of the consequences of the conduct of the applicant that was captured by the dates in the indictment. That dispute was resolved by his Honour in favour of the applicant, in that his Honour accepted at [110] that he should sentence on the basis that 38.7 ha were cleared, not 493.7 ha.
	
	
	There was no dispute that 3000 trees were destroyed.
	
	
	On the basis of factual findings that I shall detail later in this judgment, his Honour found at [136] that the damage caused was substantial, and regarded that as an aggravating feature of the matter. That finding is impugned by ground one.
	
	
	As to the subjective features, as I have said the applicant pleaded guilty. He did so at an early stage. However, his Honour allowed only a discount of 12.5% for the utilitarian value of that plea. That evaluative judgment is impugned by ground five.
	
	
	Despite that formal admission of guilt, the sentencing judge was not prepared to find that the applicant was remorseful.
	
	
	Aged 77 at the date of the offence, the applicant was a man of prior good character. The approach taken by his Honour to that fact is impugned by one leg of ground four.
	
	
	His Honour found that the applicant acted with a wilful disregard of the consequences of his actions. That finding was based upon the proposition that the applicant hurried to complete the clearing of the native vegetation before he was served with a stop work order. That finding is impugned by the second leg of ground four.
	
	
	There was no dispute before us that the offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty is an offence of strict liability. His Honour considered whether the aggravating feature of an intentional breach of the law about land clearing by the applicant had been established by the prosecutor beyond reasonable doubt. His Honour was not so satisfied.
	
	
	His Honour was satisfied, however, that the applicant acted recklessly in the sense that that concept is understood by the criminal law; namely, that the applicant contemplated the possibility that his actions were unlawful, but nevertheless proceeded. That finding was in turn founded largely upon the evidence of a Mr Farago, who is an environmental scientist employed by the Local Catchment Management Authority.
	
	
	The finding of fact that the applicant acted recklessly is impugned by ground two.
	
	
	Finally, his Honour also found that the offence was motivated, to some degree, by financial gain. The applicant impugns that finding of fact by ground three.
	


Grounds


	
	The grounds that were notified and pressed were as follows:
	



	
	His Honour erred in finding that the level of environmental harm caused was substantial, increasing the objective seriousness of the offence: at [136].
	
	
	His Honour erred in finding that the appellant’s conduct was a reckless breach that increases the objective seriousness of the offence: at [144].
	
	
	His Honour erred in finding that financial motivation was to be taken into account as an aggravating factor with respect to Strathdoon, so the financial cost of the penalty outweighs the likely commercial gain by offending: at [152].
	
	
	His Honour erred in finding that the appellant flagrantly disregarded the consequences of his actions by continuing clearing in knowledge that he was likely to soon receive a stop work order (at [158]) and failed to take account of the appellant’s good character as a relevant matter on sentence.
	
	
	His Honour erred in finding that the appellant should only receive a 12.5% discount for his early plea of guilty (rather than a 25% discount), as its utilitarian value was significantly diminished by the disputation of a number of factual circumstances necessitating a four day hearing: at [166].
	
	
	His Honour erred in finding that mitigation of environmental harm by the remedial directions to the landowners from the Director General and the orders made by Preston CJ on 31 July 2014 in [2014] NSWLEC112, cannot be attributed to the appellant personally and does not act as a mitigating factor in his sentencing: at [170].
	
	
	Further to ground 5, his Honour erred in ordering the appellant to pay all of the legal costs of the prosecutor and ought to have made no order in relation to the four day sentencing hearing: at [188] and Order 3.
	


Review of findings of fact at first instance by the Court of Criminal Appeal


	
	It can be seen that the majority of the grounds of appeal assert error on the part of the sentencing judge with regard to findings of fact. And there was no controversy between the parties about the basis upon which this Court will review findings of fact made by sentencing judges at first instance: it was accepted that it was incumbent upon the applicant to demonstrate that a finding was not “open”.
	
	
	After judgment was reserved in this matter, however, the decision of this Court in Clarke v R [2015] NSWCCA 232 was handed down.
	
	
	In that case, Basten JA queried whether the test of whether a finding of fact of a sentencing judge was open is the correct one. His Honour reviewed a number of authorities of the High Court of Australia and this Court, and ultimately said:
	


[34] In some circumstances, factual findings will themselves involve an evaluative judgment, of a kind similar to the exercise of a discretionary power. No doubt the appellate court should exercise restraint in interfering with such findings. However, if the court is satisfied that the sentencing judge made a mistake with respect to a particular factual finding, which was material to the exercise of the discretionary power, the court should identify error and then enter upon its own consideration of the appropriate sentence.

(footnotes omitted)


	
	Garling J, in contrast, applied the orthodox approach of asking whether the applicant had established that a finding was not open to the sentencing judge: at [99] and [104].
	
	
	Hamill J expressed a preference at [133] for the view of Basten JA, although his Honour noted that resolution of the question was not necessary to the determination of that appeal. His Honour also accepted at [134] that the approach appeared to be contrary to a long line of authority in this Court, and suggested at [136] that perhaps a five judge bench should sit to resolve any inconsistency of approach.
	
	
	Seeking to take into account those three recent judgments in my approach to this matter, I consider that it could be that, in many, if not most, applications to this Court for leave to appeal against sentence, the subtle difference in meaning between a mistake of fact by a sentencing judge that was material to sentence and a finding of fact that was not open to a sentencing judge will have no effect on the result. Certainly, that is the case here: on either formulation, I consider that the applicant has not demonstrated factual error on the part of the sentencing judge.
	
	
	But if it be the case that there is a real difference between the two formulations, I would respectfully prefer to maintain the test of asking whether the finding of fact was open to the sentencing judge. That is so for three reasons.
	
	
	First, as Hamill J said, that is a test that is long-established, and has been applied by this Court on very many occasions.
	
	
	Secondly, as recently as in AB v R [2014] NSWCCA 339, Simpson J (as her Honour then was) (with whom Meagher JA and Wilson J agreed) affirmed that test as being the correct one: at [44]-[55]. And that was in the context of the approach of this Court to review of findings of fact being fundamentally impugned by the applicant in that case.
	
	
	Thirdly, I consider that the test is a straightforward one that balances, on the one hand, the autonomy and evaluative judgments of sentencing judges, and, on the other hand, the role of this Court in ensuring that idiosyncratic or irrational findings do not go uncorrected.
	
	
	In short, I shall proceed to apply the established test - whether the applicant has established that the sentencing judge made a finding of fact that was not open - to the relevant grounds of appeal.
	


Ground one 

His Honour erred in finding that the level of environmental harm caused was substantial, increasing the objective seriousness of the offence: at [136]. 


	
	In the proceedings on sentence, a number of expert witnesses were called by the parties on the question of the extent of loss of native vegetation caused by the acts of the applicant.
	
	
	Mr Spiers is employed by the Office of Environment and Heritage as an aerial photography interpreter. He was called by the prosecution. To summarise his evidence, his position was that extensive tree removal had occurred on the two properties between November 2011 and January 2012, including 420.7 ha on the property “Colorado”, and 73 ha on the property “Strathdoon”. The total area of native vegetation cleared across the two properties was therefore, on his evidence, 493.7 ha.
	
	
	Dr Nadolny is a senior ecologist employed by the Office of Environment and Heritage. He was also called by the prosecution. To summarise his evidence, his position was that the vegetation that was cleared on the two properties was mainly native vegetation. Adopting the findings of Mr Spiers as to the area of native vegetation cleared, he found that the main species of trees cleared were the Brigalow, Belah, and Poplar Box, along with a number of other native shrubs, vines, mistletoes and groundcover plants.
	
	
	Dr Nadolny found that the clearing on both properties had resulted in significant environmental harm. He observed that the major impacts of the clearing included the loss of a significant area of vegetation; the loss of an endangered ecological community (“EEC”) (namely, Brigalow trees); the loss of significant areas of over-cleared vegetation types; and a significant loss of habitat for fauna.
	
	
	With regard to fauna, Dr Nadolny observed that the loss of habitat was likely to affect several threatened species, including the Koala and the Grey Crowned Babbler. In addition, he noted that the damage to other species of wildlife as a result of the destruction of hollow-bearing trees on the two properties was likely to be long-term, especially given that some of those trees had taken well over a hundred years to develop.
	
	
	The applicant relied on the expert evidence of two witnesses at first instance. The first, Mr Sinclair, is a senior botanist employed by an ecological consultancy. To summarise his evidence, his position was that minimal vegetation had been cleared on the two properties. In particular, he noted that the only vegetation cleared on the Colorado property was native trees, as opposed to understorey or groundcover vegetation.
	
	
	In contrast to the conclusion reached by Mr Spiers, Mr Sinclair found that 38.7 ha of native vegetation had been cleared across the two properties. As well as that, he was of the view that the observations made by Dr Nadolny regarding environmental harm could not be relied upon, as they were based on clearing that occurred outside the charge period, and did not take into account that vegetation communities may have been modified by past clearing events.
	
	
	The evidence of Mr Hall, an environmental adviser and ecologist, was also relied upon by the defendant. Mr Hall accepted the finding made by Mr Sinclair that a total of 38.7 ha of native vegetation was cleared across the two properties. He also disputed Dr Nadolny’s findings as to the environmental harm caused by the clearing. Mr Hall observed that the 38.7 ha cleared was a relatively small area of vegetation, especially when compared to the 800 ha of remnant high-value vegetation that was retained.
	
	
	As well as that, he observed that the properties still have large areas of suitable habitat remaining to support a population of Koalas and other native species at a healthy level of density. In his view, the suggestion that the environmental harm caused by the clearing was “substantial” was therefore unfounded.
	
	
	It is now convenient to set out a substantial proportion of what his Honour said in the remarks on sentence about this topic:
	


[125] As noted by Preston ChJ in Rae (at [37] - [38]):

37 The significance of the number of trees removed needs to be evaluated in the context of the vegetation type in which the trees occur. The vegetation types of woodland and open woodland, by definition, have lower average densities (numbers) of trees per hectare than forest vegetation types, and hence will have greater space between trees. Hence, removal of a particular number of trees over a given area will have materially different effects if the vegetation type is a woodland or open woodland than a forest; it may result in the total or almost total clearance of the land in a woodland or open woodland but only partial clearance in a forest.

38 The significance of the number of trees needs also to be evaluated by reference to the trees involved – their species, nature, age, ecological attributes, biological interactions and contribution to ecosystem functioning amongst other features – and the consequences caused by their removal. Mr Shelly’s evidence is that the areas cleared were woodland with relatively intact woody vegetation (apart from isolated trees) from ten of the twelve areas that were previously of woodland or open woodland tree density. 155 hectares were cleared to an extent that only 5% of the trees that were formerly there remained. The clearing increased fragmentation, reduced vegetative connectivity and removed inadequately conserved vegetation communities, native vegetation important for maintenance of biodiversity and habitat of threatened species. Taking account of all of these factors, the effect of the clearance was similar to that of broadscale clearing, an outcome which the Act was intended to prevent…

[126] Spiers opined, subject to an error factor of +/-10%, that 2708 trees were removed on Colorado and 694 on Strathdoon, and this was not disputed.

[127] According to Nadolny, the main species of trees cleared were Brigalow, Belah, Poplar Box, Western Rosewood, Wild Lime, with smaller numbers of Wild Orange, Warrior Bush, Myall and Whitewood, and they were a significant age, many cleared in Polygon 1(210ha), being original trees, which had developed significant hollows.

[128] Hall attempted to downplay the environmental significance of the removal of these trees, by reference to the amount of native vegetation that was retained on the property, but I am unconvinced that this observation significantly reduces the environmental harm caused.

[129] The fact remains that approximately a minimum of 3000 trees were removed across the cleared areas, and many, especially in Polygon 1, were environmentally significant. Such clearing removed almost all the trees from Polygon 1 and significantly altered the nature of the woodland, leaving vegetation largely inadequate for relocation for displaced native fauna.

[130] Brigalow EEC, and Koala EEC were present on the cleared areas, and both were impacted by that clearing, but I accept Sinclair’s evidence that the Brigalow was rather sparse, as a result of past thinning, making it “open woodland” rather than “open forest”, which can be found in the district.

[131] It is, however, likely that a significant Koala population was disturbed. Its primary feed tree was Poplar Box, which was significantly cleared. Some 3000 trees across 460ha were lost, and that loss of shelter and food for Koala represents an important component of the environmental harm caused in this case.

[132] Nadolny also observed the presence of the Grey-Crowned Babbler, and opined that a number of other threatened or endangered species were likely to be present within the cleared areas. His findings are grouped and summarised in the prosecutor’s submissions (at para 22). There were 26 headings in all.

[133] The removal of almost all trees within the cleared areas would have effectively removed from those areas the entire habitat of the Grey-Crowned Babbler.

[134] In respect of the likely impact on the clearing of threatened species I adopt the following comments by Preston Chj in Rae (at [38]):

The clearing increased fragmentation, reduced vegetative connectivity and removed inadequately conserved vegetation communities, native vegetation important for maintenance of biodiversity and habitat of threatened species. Taking account all of these factors, the effect of the clearance was similar to that of broadscale clearing, an outcome which the Act was intended to prevent (see s 3(b) of the Act).

[135] The prosecutor submitted that the environmental harm caused by the clearing the subject of the charge was “substantial”, and is therefore an aggravating factor to be taken into account in sentencing (s 21A(2)(g)).

[136] I find that the level of environmental harm caused was substantial, increasing the objective seriousness of the offence.

(emphasis in original)


	
	As I have said, the dispute about the extent in terms of hectares of the clearing was resolved in favour of the applicant. Nevertheless, it was not disputed that 3000 trees were destroyed by the acts of the applicant.
	
	
	It was submitted by senior counsel for the applicant before us that it was not open to his Honour to accept the opinion of Dr Nadolny. A detailed analysis of the competing evidence at first instance was provided. It was submitted that, because it was not open to accept the expert opinion of Dr Nadolny that the environmental damage was substantial, it was not open to his Honour to find that that damage was substantial, thereby aggravating the offence.
	
	
	The prosecutor submitted that the finding was well open to his Honour. Indeed, his position (not further explored, in light of the nature of the proceedings in this Court) was that some of the findings of his Honour were unduly favourable to the applicant.
	
	
	Turning to my determination, I reject the proposition that the evaluative judgment that the damage caused by the actions of the applicant was substantial was not open to the determination of his Honour. It can be seen from the remarks on sentence that that characterisation was the culmination of a review of factors that preceded it in the remarks on sentence. They were: the fact that 3000 trees were destroyed [at 129]; the fact that the habitat of koalas (which are an endangered animal) was badly affected [at 131]; and the fact that the habitat of a particular species of bird (which is a threatened species) was similarly affected [at 133].
	
	
	To my mind, the characterisation of the damage by his Honour as being substantial was not founded upon an explicit acceptance of what Dr Nadolny had to say about the topic (although it is true that the evidence about the impact upon the habitats is derived from the evidence of Dr Nadolny).
	
	
	As I have said, the destruction of 3,000 trees was not disputed. And whilst it is true that there was a dispute between, on the one hand, Dr Nadolny and Mr Spiers for the prosecution and, on the other, Mr Sinclair and Mr Hall for the applicant, about the degree of damage to the habitats, I consider that it was open to his Honour to have preferred the evidence of Dr Nadolny about that topic. It can be seen from the extract that I have provided that his Honour did not uncritically accept the evidence of the prosecution witnesses; quite the contrary.
	
	
	In short, I consider that it was open to his Honour to find that those three consequences of the actions of the applicant amounted to damage that could be judged to be substantial.
	
	
	I emphasise that I do not consider that the evaluation of his Honour was founded upon an identical evaluation by Dr Nadolny. Reading the relevant portion of the remarks on sentence as a whole, I consider that his Honour was making it clear that the determination of substantiality was made by the Court, not by the prosecution expert.
	
	
	Speaking more generally, I reject the proposition that it was not open to the sentencing judge to make his own evaluation of the degree of environmental damage in the asserted absence of expert evidence. I do so because I would also reject the analogous proposition that a judge sentencing for a crime of violence would not be entitled to describe a 15 cm wound to the head requiring 20 sutures as substantial, in the absence of expert medical evidence to that effect; or that a sentencing judge would not be entitled to describe a fraud in the sum of $2 million as substantial, in the absence of expert financial evidence to that effect. That is because it is not an evidential pre-condition of a finding by a sentencing judge that the consequences of an offence are grave, or trivial, or something in between, that there be expert evidence to identical effect.
	
	
	I would reject ground one.
	


Ground two 

His Honour erred in finding that the appellant’s conduct was a reckless breach that increases the objective seriousness of the offence: at [144]. 


	
	Again, it is convenient to set out an extract of what his Honour said on this topic in the remarks on sentence:
	


[137] Preston ChJ confirmed in Rae (at [142]), that unlawful clearing done “intentionally, negligently or recklessly will be objectively more serious than one not so committed”.

[138] [Senior counsel] for the defendant submitted (at Tp264, LL41 - 50):

Your Honour, when one looks at this, this is not a man who willfully engaged in a deliberate endeavour to contravene quite deliberately the law. Clearly mistaken. Not surprising, your Honour might think, for a man of his generation and a man of his age and my learned junior has provided your Honour in our written submissions yesterday with a very detailed overview of the native vegetation scheme going right back to the SEPP 46 and we do make the submission in our written submissions; it’s a little wonder that people, particularly people of Mr Turnbull’s generation, might be a little confused about this.

[139] Ian Turnbull’s asserted confusion as to law on regrowth is supported by the ROI (Exhibit P1, tab j at p11):

Q 73. So have I got this right that your understanding of regrowth is trees that have regrown sometime after the land was cleared regardless of when the land was cleared, would that be correct?

A. After the ground was settled.

Q 74. Sorry, what did you say?

A. I say regrowth is what – it’s regrowth since the land was originally settled.

[140] I accept that he may have been mistaken as to what regrowth was, and, therefore, what he was legally allowed to clear. So it would be incorrect to say that his clearing work was an intentional breach of the law.

[141] In Chief Executive, Office of Environment and Heritage v Rummery (“Rummery”) [2012] NSWLEC 271; (2012) 192 LGERA 314, Pepper J said, (at [126]):

An offender’s conduct will be classified as reckless where he or she is put on notice, in the sense that he or she believes or suspects, that the clearing of native vegetation may be unlawful but nevertheless proceeds to undertake the clearing without making further enquiries…

[142] The prosecutor submitted that the defendant’s conduct constituted a deliberate breach of the law, and/or formed part of a planned criminal activity (an aggravating factor – 21A(2)(n)), but I do not find that the evidence before me supports those propositions.

[143] However, Farago’s evidence satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was aware, at least in a general sense, that approval was required to clear native vegetation. Farago’s negative evaluation (see [41] above) would put a reasonable person on notice that at least some of the clearing the subject of the charge would be unlawful.

[144] That evidence, therefore, establishes that [the applicant’s] conduct was a reckless breach, a factor that increases the objective seriousness of his offence.


	
	The ground was developed at the hearing of the application by way of a detailed analysis of the evidence of Mr Farago and his “negative evaluation”. To state things succinctly, Mr Farago, who it will be recalled is an environmental scientist employed by the Local Catchment Management Authority, had had a conversation with the grandson of the applicant in the presence of the applicant. Mr Farago was speaking about whether the grandson would be permitted to clear native vegetation on particular parts of a particular property, and expressed reticence about it.
	
	
	On appeal it was submitted that, because one cannot be sure that Mr Farago was speaking of the areas (whether in whole or in part) that the applicant ultimately cleared, then it was not open to his Honour to find that the applicant behaved recklessly with regard to his own conduct on separate land.
	
	
	I reject that submission. To my mind, a reading of the paragraphs that I have extracted above shows that his Honour was not speaking of a state of mind of the applicant about any specific part of any specific property. Rather, his Honour was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant foresaw the possibility that what he was doing was generally unlawful.
	
	
	In other words, it was not a matter of the applicant being affirmatively satisfied that Mr Farago had prohibited what the applicant was doing; if that were the case, one would have expected his Honour to have found that the applicant behaved intentionally. Rather, his Honour found the lesser state of mind of recklessness, based upon the inference that, having heard what Mr Farago had said to the grandson, the applicant appreciated that there was a substantial risk that what he was doing was unlawful: see generally (in the context of reckless wounding) R v Coleman (1990) 19 NSWLR 467; (1990) 47 A Crim R 306; and Blackwell v R [2011] NSWCCA 93; (2011) 81 NSWLR 119.
	
	
	Such a reading of the remarks on sentence is supported, to my mind, by the reference at [141] of the remarks on sentence to the judgment of Pepper J in Chief Executive, Office of Environment and Heritage v Rummery [2012] NSWLEC 271; (2012) 192 LGERA 315, which speaks of belief or suspicion about what may be the case. And it is confirmed at [143] by his Honour speaking of the applicant appreciating, in a general sense, that his actions required approval before they could be undertaken.
	
	
	I consider that the finding that the applicant was aware, in a general sense, that his actions may well have been unlawful was open to the sentencing judge. Accordingly, I would not uphold ground two.
	


Ground three

His Honour erred in finding that financial motivation was to be taken into account as an aggravating factor with respect to Strathdoon, so the financial cost of the penalty outweighs the likely commercial gain by offending: at [152]. 


	
	Again, it is convenient to extract the bulk of what his Honour said on this topic (some references to exhibits are deleted for convenience):
	


[147] At the time of the clearing, the defendant was not the owner of either of the properties. However, arrangements had been made for Colorado to be purchased by his son Grant, to augment Grant’s holdings for him and his now teenaged son to operate more viably, and for Strathdoon to be purchased by his grandson, Cory, and his spouse Donna, with Ian’s financial support (a guarantee is mentioned in the ROIs). Both properties were transferred to the Turnbulls on 31 January 2012.

[148] Ian Turnbull mortgaged his own property to secure the loan for the purchase of Strathdoon by Cory, and commenced the clearing before the purchases were completed. Ian’s purpose was to help set up his son and grandsons financially, and to give them, particularly Cory, a foothold in the farming industry.

[149] Mr Alexis, argued that, as Ian Turnbull would not himself financially benefit from the clearing, this was not an aggravating factor that could be taken into account.

…

[150] I respectfully disagree with this submission. Although Ian was not the owner of the properties, there is evidence that some profits would flow to him. This is supported by the ROI between Glen Turner and Cory Turnbull:

Q 29. As Ian is the guarantor for the loan does Ian have any say in the management of the property?

A Well he’s got a vested interest so yes.

…

Q 141. So what do you mean by that, your decision making occurred when you took ownership of the property is that correct?

A No, more of my decision making occurred then, yes, but as I said it’s like a - Ian’s got a vested interest in the property so he also makes decisions regarding the property.

Q 142. So apart from being guarantor what’s the vested interest, is it the guarantor-ship?

A Yes - yes.

Q 143. Will Ian be making any profits on the property?

A Yes, he will be off his first year.

Q 144. And following years?

A No.

[151] Clearly, the clearing, which was designed to “transition” these properties to cropping, was conducted with some urgency, so that the farms could produce crops in 2012, and 2013.

[152] Accordingly, financial motivation is properly to be taken into account as a relatively minor aggravating factor in sentencing Ian, referable onto to Strathdoon, and any penalty must be of such a “magnitude or nature as to make the financial cpst to an offender outweigh the likely commercial gain by offending”: per ChJ Preston in Rae.

(emphasis in bold in original, emphasis in italics added by me)


	
	It was said on behalf of the applicant in written submissions before us that:
	


Although the sentencing Judge rejected the submission that the appellant was truly motivated by love and affection for his family, the reference to making ‘some profits’ during the first year at [150] was scant and devoid of any meaningful content from which an inference of financial motive could be drawn. Moreover, there was nothing upon which to determine the likely commercial gain to be derived by the appellant from the offence, so that it was outweighed by the penalty.

[footnotes omitted]


	
	The prosecutor submitted that the evidence of the fact that the applicant would obtain a share of the profits after the first year provided a solid basis for the finding of fact that “financial motivation” could be taken into account as a “relevant minor aggravating factor”.
	
	
	To my mind, this ground can be determined quickly. There was uncontroverted evidence contained in the recorded interview of Cory Turnbull that was tendered in the proceedings on sentence that the applicant was to benefit financially by way of profits from the first year of the operation of the property Strathdoon.
	
	
	In light of that evidence, it was well open to the sentencing judge to find that the offence had been motivated, to some degree, by a desire to achieve a financial gain, and to regard that as an aggravating factor on sentence.
	
	
	I would therefore reject ground three.
	


Ground four

His Honour erred in finding that the appellant flagrantly disregarded the consequences of his actions by continuing clearing in knowledge that he was likely to soon receive a stop work order (at [158]) and failed to take account of the appellant’s good character as a relevant matter on sentence.


	
	Again, it is convenient to set out what his Honour said on the topic:
	


[155] [Senior counsel for the applicant] submitted that, by reason of the defendant’s age – he turns 80 on 13 November 2014 – he is unlikely to re-offend, and has good prospects of rehabilitation. He also says that Ian was not “fully aware” of the consequences of his actions. These are mitigating factors under the CSP Act (ss 21A(3)(g), (h), and (j)).

[156] [Senior counsel for the applicant] also said:

There can be no serious question in this case that Mr Turnbull is not a man of good character. The character references provide overwhelming testament in support of that. They speak of a very generous man, a man that has engaged in the community during his whole life, not only when his children were at school but thereafter, mentoring other farmers who hit hard times. Your Honour, in our respectful submission, will be impressed by what your Honour reads in those references. He has no prior convictions. He should receive the benefit of the fact that he entered a plea at the earliest opportunity in this matter.

[157] Although the glowing references speak for themselves to Ian’s credit, and one says that he is “devastated” by the charge, they do not provide any evidence of contrition or remorse on his part, and no evidence was produced to show that Ian has taken responsibility for his actions, or acknowledged any damage done to the environment as a result of his clearing.

[158] On the contrary – as evidenced by the ROI – the defendant flagrantly disregarded the consequences of his actions, by continuing clearing, in knowledge that he was likely to soon receive a stop work order...


	
	Those findings were based in turn on the following portions of a recorded interview between the applicant and investigators of the Office of Environment and Heritage:
	


Q 267. So what you’re saying is you were trying to get as much done as you could before the stop work order came?

A Yeah there’s an economical equation in there that we’ve always got a deadline to meet with banks and so forth so we had to try and get somewhere, the area that we’ve cleared plus the ground that’s - that was already cleared should get them through this year until we can do some negotiating with the EPA or the Gwydir Catchment Authority otherwise the place will have to be sold to somebody else.

…

Q 287. All right. Is there anything further you wish to say about this matter?

A I’m hoping you blokes have a bit of compassion so that we can clear it up and make it a farm for these younger generation that’s about it, yeah.


	
	It was said before us by senior counsel for the applicant that it was not open for his Honour to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had “flagrantly disregarded the consequences of his actions by continuing clearing in knowledge that he was likely to receive a stop work order”.
	
	
	The prosecutor submitted, in a nutshell, that that characterisation of the conduct of the applicant was open to his Honour on the evidence. That is because the applicant had acknowledged in his record of interview that he was trying to clear as much land as possible before the arrival of the stop work order because of financial pressure.
	
	
	I do not accept the submission of senior counsel for the applicant. To my mind, in the recorded interview, the applicant was admitting that he had hurried to complete as much of the clearing as he could before he was served with the stop work order, which he correctly believed to be imminent. It is significant that the first word of the answer to question 267 is the word “Yeah”, which accepts the correctness of the assertion in the question. The admission by the applicant of that conduct with that state of mind provided a sound basis for the finding that the applicant acted in flagrant disregard of the consequences of his actions.
	
	
	The second, and conceptually separate leg of this ground, is the proposition that his Honour did not take into account the good character of the applicant on sentence. But it can be seen that his Honour referred to that very topic without demur at [157] when he said that “the glowing references speak for themselves to [the applicant’s] credit, and one says that he is “devastated” by the charge”. That reference shows that his Honour accepted, and took into account, the undisputed evidence about the prior good character of the applicant.
	
	
	I would reject both bases of ground four.
	


Ground five

His Honour erred in finding that the appellant should only receive a 12.5% discount for his early plea of guilty (rather than a 25% discount), as its utilitarian value was significantly diminished by the disputation of a number of factual circumstances necessitating a four day hearing: at [166].


	
	The submission of senior counsel for the applicant in support of this ground may be summarised as follows. Although the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty was objectively reduced by the need for a four-day hearing to resolve a number of factual disputes, the fact that those matters were resolved substantially in favour of the applicant meant that there should have been no reduction in that discount. Reliance was placed upon the well-known decision of R v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310 for the proposition that there are limited circumstances in which a full discount should be given, even if a plea of guilty has not had fully advantageous utilitarian consequences, if the responsibility for the loss of the utilitarian benefit cannot be laid at the feet of the offender.
	
	
	So much may be accepted. But I do not accept that the substantial majority, or even a majority, of the matters that were in dispute and required resolution by these extended proceedings on sentence were determined in favour of the applicant.
	
	
	To state the position concisely, the remarks on sentence, when read in light of the written submissions at first instance, demonstrate that there were disputes before his Honour about a large number of matters. They included the size of the area that had been cleared; the nature of the vegetation cleared; the extent of vegetation cleared; the impact of the clearing on the environment; the urgency with which the land was cleared before the applicant was served with a stop work order; the motivating factors behind the clearing; the demonstration of contrition of remorse by the applicant; and the extent of mitigation of environmental harm undertaken by the applicant. And yet the only issue that was clearly determined in favour of the applicant was the issue of the number of hectares that had been cleared by him. In those circumstances, the principle in Oinonen is inapposite.
	
	
	Speaking more generally, it is well established that the question of the discount that should be afforded to an offender for the utilitarian value of his or her plea of guilty is a matter of evaluative judgment very much reposed in sentencing judges: see R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, 419, and the recent reference by Simpson JA (with whom Fagan J and I agreed) in De Angelis v R [2015] NSWCCA 197 at [59], to the “essentially discretionary judgment” of a sentencing judge. Because of that, it is also well established that this Court will be slow to intervene.
	
	
	Again, I consider that the discount provided was soundly open to the evaluation of his Honour, in all of the circumstances of this case.
	
	
	I would not uphold ground five.
	


Ground six

His Honour erred in finding that mitigation of environmental harm by the remedial directions to the landowners from the Director General and the orders made by Preston CJ on 31 July 2014 in [2014] NSWLEC 112, cannot be attributed to the appellant personally and does not act as a mitigating factor in his sentencing: at [170]. 


	
	Again, it is convenient to extract a substantial portion of that part of the remarks on sentence that dealt with this topic. At [169] – [170] his Honour said:
	


[169] I earlier referred to Preston ChJ’s determination of the Class 1 appeals brought by Gant, Cory and Donna, in respect of the remediation directions issued by the OEH for the cleared areas. Those appellants were partially successful in their appeals (see [11] above), but the remediation areas the subject of His Honour’s directions are substantially outside the cleared areas the subject of this charge, and require the exclusion of all stock, invasive species control, and replanting within that area.

[170] Although I accept that this remediation work is likely to rectify much of the environmental harm caused by the offence, the defendant is not the owner of the properties the subject of the remediation directions, and, therefore, any such mitigation of the environmental harm caused by the offence cannot be attributed to the defendant personally, and does not act as a mitigating factor in his sentencing actions (s 21A(3)(i)(ii))).


	
	Before us it was submitted that his Honour had failed to appreciate that remedial work had been ordered to be done, albeit not by the applicant. It was said that that erroneous approach caused his Honour to fail to regard the offence as objectively less serious, because its consequences, in the long term, would be less profound.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that remedial work had only been contemplated as a result of the pronouncement of remedial directions by the Office of Environment and Heritage, which required the owners of the properties to repair and rehabilitate the cleared land. It was said that those remedial directions did not require any work to be done, or any sacrifice to be made, by the applicant personally. Accordingly, his Honour was not required to take reparation into account as a mitigating factor on sentence.
	
	
	I reject the submission that the aspect of sentencing that his Honour was discussing in the extracted portion was the question of the long-term consequences of the offence. That is because his Honour explicitly referred to s 21A(3)(i)(ii) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). That subsection is as follows:
	


(3) Mitigating factors

The mitigating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows:

…

(i) the remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if:

(i) the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and

(ii) the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both),

…


	
	To my mind, in this part of the remarks on sentence, his Honour was not discussing the objective feature of the degree of damaged caused by the actions of the applicant. Rather, his Honour was discussing the subjective feature of whether or not the applicant was remorseful, had accepted responsibility for his actions, and either acknowledged the damage he had caused or made reparation for the damage he had caused. The completed or envisaged actions of other persons, pursuant to a direction, were not relevant to the question of whether the applicant himself had shown remorse.
	
	
	Accordingly, to my mind, there was no error demonstrated in the approach taken by his Honour to this question. I would reject ground six.
	


Ground seven 

Further to ground 5, his Honour erred in ordering the appellant to pay all of the legal costs of the prosecutor and ought to have made no order in relation to the four day sentencing hearing: at [188] and Order 3. 


	
	This final ground to do with costs was explained by senior counsel for the applicant as being founded upon success with regard to ground five.
	
	
	In other words, it was submitted that, if this Court were to find that the applicant had been successful with regard to the majority of the disputes that were resolved by his Honour, we should also find that costs of the extended proceedings on sentence should not have been ordered against him.
	
	
	Counsel for the prosecutor invited our attention to the fact that, at first instance, a concession was made on behalf of the applicant that costs should be ordered against him. That concession was not contingent, he submitted, upon the applicant failing with regard to the areas of factual dispute before his Honour.
	
	
	But in any event, that procedural aspect need not be explored further. That is because I consider that it cannot be said that the applicant enjoyed substantial success with regard to the matters placed in dispute in the proceedings on sentence. In that regard, I repeat the analysis provided at [79] of this judgment.
	
	
	Finally, it was conceded before us by counsel for the prosecutor that his Honour had erred in ordering costs as extending to the reasonable investigation costs of the prosecutor. That concession included the proposition that his Honour had no power to order such costs. Counsel for the prosecutor made it clear that no steps would be taken by his client to seek to enforce that part of the costs order; nevertheless, for abundant caution, I consider that that order should be altered by this Court.
	


Conclusion 


	
	All of the grounds were fully argued. None of them were unarguable. In my view, leave should be granted, but none of them call for intervention, save for the last.
	
	
	The applicant read an affidavit updating subjective matters, as against the contingency that any ground of appeal were upheld. Because of my opinion that no substantive ground should be successful, there is no need for me to detail the contents of that affidavit.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	The order with regard to costs is amended so that it reads as follows:
	


The defendant is ordered to pay the reasonable legal costs and disbursements of the prosecutor as agreed or assessed.


	
	Appeal otherwise dismissed.

2702518,R v Alqudsi [2015] NSWSC 1615,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	Hamdi Alqudsi’s trial on indictment for various offences contrary to s 7 of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 (Cth) (now repealed) is listed for hearing with a jury commencing on 2 February 2016.
	
	
	There are three issues for determination:
	



	
	The validity of the indictment.
	
	
	Whether certain search warrants and warrants for telephone interception were unlawful.
	
	
	Whether evidence obtained as a result of any warrant found to be unlawful ought be admitted pursuant to s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	



	
	The parties asked me to defer the third issue until after judgment has been delivered on the first two issues.
	


The facts


	
	On 26 August 2013 Federal Judge Pascoe, on the application of the Australian Federal Police (AFP), issued a warrant pursuant to s 49 of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (Cth) which purported to authorise the interception of communications made to or from any telecommunications service that the accused was using or was likely to use. Judge Pascoe relevantly stated that he was satisfied, on the basis of information given to him by the AFP, that information obtained from the interception would be likely to assist in the AFP’s investigation of “the following serious offences in which the named person [the accused] is involved”.
	
	
	Of present relevance, one of the offences that followed this preamble was described in the following terms:
	


“(iii)   Preparations for incursions into foreign states for the purposes of engaging in hostile activities, contrary to section 7 of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978.

The alleged offence is a serious offence for the purposes of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979, under section 5D(2)(a) in that it is an offence against section 7 of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978, punishable by imprisonment for 7 years.”


	
	Warrants were also issued under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act in respect of others: Wassim Fayad and Amin Mohamed. Relevantly the same descriptions of offences against s 7 of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act were included in each warrant.
	
	
	On 2 December 2013 Federal Agent (FA) Gategood went to the Downing Centre Local Court with FA Cole to apply for search warrants pursuant to s 3E of the Crimes Act in connection with an operation known as Operation Rathlin which was being conducted by the Joint Counter-Terrorist Team at the Sydney Office of the AFP.
	
	
	The warrants issued on that day included four warrants issued by Stephen Lister, the issuing officer, to Steven Gategood, the executing officer, for the following premises or vehicles:
	



	
		
			
			Number
			
			
			Premises/ Vehicle
			
		
		
			
			2371
			
			
			4 Merrin Close, Helens Park
			
		
		
			
			2372
			
			
			19 Creswell Street, Revesby
			
		
		
			
			2378
			
			
			Silver Nissan Pulsar [registration number supplied]
			
		
		
			
			2380
			
			
			Red Ford Festiva [registration number supplied]
			
		
	



	
	Later, on 2 December 2013, FA Gategood attended an operational briefing with respect to the proposed execution of the warrants the following day. On that occasion a decision was made as to which officer would be the executing officer for each warrant.
	
	
	In respect of some of the warrants, FA Gategood followed his, and what he understood to be the, usual practice of: striking out his own name on the warrant; inserting the name of the officer who was to be the executing officer and; handing the endorsed warrant to the named executing officer. In accordance with this practice, FA Gategood endorsed warrant 2371 with the name of Michael Wallosceck before handing it to him.
	
	
	However, of the three warrants he handed to FA Cole, FA Gategood had endorsed only one (2378) with FA Cole’s name; the other two (2372 and 2380) had not been endorsed. Thus, warrants 2372 and 2380 continued to show FA Gategood as the executing officer when FA Cole received them. When FA Cole, who understood that he was to be the executing officer in respect of warrants 2372 and 2380, saw that his name did not appear as executing officer on those warrants, he struck out FA Gategood ’s name and inserted his own.
	
	
	At about 7.00am on 3 December 2013 FA Cole entered the premises at 19 Creswell Street, Revesby with nine other officers, including FA Gategood, to execute warrant 2372. As executing officer, FA Cole performed the role of “warrant holder”. He provided the accused with a copy of warrant 2372 and a document setting out the rights of an occupier.
	
	
	FA Cole later handed the accused a copy of warrants 2378 (Silver Nissan Pulsar) and 2380 (Red Ford Festiva). He observed FA Gategood placing the accused under arrest.
	
	
	It was common ground that no evidence was obtained from the Red Ford Festiva. Accordingly, warrant 2380 need not be considered further. Evidence that assists the Crown case was obtained pursuant to the other warrants referred to.
	
	
	On 17 July 2014 George Brandis, Commonwealth Attorney-General, signed a document which is relevantly in the following form:
	


COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA

CRIMES (FOREIGN INCURSIONS AND RECRUITMENT) ACT 1978

CONSENT TO INSTITUTION OF COMMITTAL PROCEEDINGS

I, GEORGE BRANDIS QC, Attorney-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, hereby consent pursuant to subsection 10(1) of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 to the institution of proceedings for the committal of Hamdi ALQUDSI for trial on indictment for offences against the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 particulars of which are set out below.

The challenge to the indictment


	
	The accused contended that the Attorney-General’s consent was not valid because it was headed “Consent to the Institution of Committal Proceedings”.
	
	
	Section 10(1) of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 provided:
	


“10 Consent of Attorney-General required for prosecutions

(1) Proceedings for the commitment of a person for trial on indictment for an offence against this Act, or for the summary trial of a person for an offence against this Act, shall not be instituted except with the consent in writing of the Attorney-General.

(2) Notwithstanding that a consent has not been given in relation to the offence in accordance with subsection (1):

(a) a person may be charged with an offence against this Act;

(b) a person may be arrested for an offence against this Act, and a warrant for such an arrest may be issued and executed; and

(c) a person so charged may be remanded in custody or on bail;

but no further step in proceedings referred to in subsection (1) shall be taken in relation to the offence until such a consent has been given.”


	
	Section 68 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) makes applicable those State laws and procedures, including for the examination and commitment for trial on indictment of persons charged with offences, that apply generally in the State. Thus, a Magistrate has power to conduct criminal proceedings for Federal offences: Bagshaw v Carter [2006] NSWCA 113. The Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) relevantly applied to the accused’s commitment for trial, which took place in New South Wales. Section 47 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides that “committal proceedings” are to be commenced by the issue and filing of a court attendance notice. Such proceedings are taken to have commenced on the date of such filing: s 53. Committal proceedings are to be conducted by a Magistrate (s 55) and heard in open court (s 56). If the Magistrate is of the opinion that there is a reasonable prospect that a reasonable jury, properly instructed, would convict the accused person of an indictable offence, the Magistrate must commit the accused person for trial: s 65. The trial for which the accused is committed is trial on indictment.
	
	
	The accused submitted that the consent given by the Attorney-General did not comply with s 10(1) of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act because it referred to “committal proceedings” in the heading rather than “the commitment of a person for trial on indictment”. The flaw in the accused’s argument is that, in this context, “committal” and “commitment” are one and the same. The slight difference in language derives from the circumstance that the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act refers to “commitment” for trial and the Criminal Procedure Act, while it uses the verb “commit”, uses the noun “committal” rather than “commitment”. The accused’s argument must be rejected having regard to the terms of s 68 of the Judiciary Act.
	
	
	For these reasons, the accused’s challenge to the validity of the consent has not been made out.
	


The challenges to the warrants

The warrants under Division 4 of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979


	
	The accused challenged the warrants for telephone interception on two bases:
	



	
	the first page of the warrant in respect of the accused was not signed and it was therefore invalid under s 49(1) of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act; and
	
	
	the description of the offence under s 7 of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act in each of the warrants did not comply with s 49(7) as there are eight separate offences covered by s 7.
	



	
	The Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act relevantly provides:
	


“46   Issue of telecommunications service warrant 

(1) Where an agency applies to an eligible Judge or nominated AAT member for a warrant in respect of a telecommunications service and the Judge or nominated AAT member is satisfied, on the basis of the information given to the Judge or nominated AAT member under this Part in connection with the application, that:

(d) information that would be likely to be obtained by intercepting under a warrant communications made to or from the service would be likely to assist in connection with the investigation by the agency of a serious offence, or serious offences, in which:

(i) the particular person is involved; or

(ii) another person is involved with whom the particular person is likely to communicate using the service; and

. . .

the Judge or nominated AAT member may, in his or her discretion, issue such a warrant.

. . .

49   Form and content of warrant

(1) A warrant shall be in accordance with the prescribed form and shall be signed by the Judge or nominated AAT member who issues it.

. . .

(7) A warrant shall set out short particulars of each serious offence in relation to which the Judge or nominated AAT member issuing the warrant was satisfied, on the application for the warrant, as mentioned in:

. . .

(b) otherwise—paragraph 46(1)(d) or 46A(1)(d), as the case requires.”


	
	An offence is a “serious offence” if its maximum penalty is at least seven years: s 5D(2)(a) of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act.
	
	
	The Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Regulations 1987 prescribe forms for warrants under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act. It was not suggested that there was any non-compliance with the relevant forms prescribed.
	
	
	The accused could not point to any requirement of either the Act or the Regulations that required each page of the warrant to be signed. It is not for a court to impose any additional formal requirement on such a document. Accordingly, this challenge has not been made out.
	
	
	The second challenge raises the question whether the description of the offence in the warrants is sufficient to comply with the requirement for “short particulars of each serious offence” in s 49(7).
	
	
	The authorities referred to by the Crown establish that what is required is that the offence be identified in a “conceptual sense” and, further, that it be sufficiently identified to enable the determination to be made whether the offence is a “serious offence” as required by s 49: R v Solomon [2005] SASC 265 at [26]-[27] per Doyle CJ (Duggan and Sulan JJ agreeing); Flanagan v Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (1996) 60 FCR 149 at 197 (Beaumont, Ryan and Lindgren JJ). Particulars such as would inform the person concerned of the factual ingredients of the offence are not required. Search warrants are important tools to be used in the investigation of suspected criminal conduct. Operational realities are to be taken into account: Hart v Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police [2002] FCAFC 392 at [68] per French, Sackville and Nicholson JJ. To require more particularity than is necessary to identify the offence in a conceptual way and to qualify it as a “serious offence” would be to substantially undermine the purpose and utility of search warrants.
	
	
	Accordingly, the second challenge has not been made out.
	


The warrants under 3E of the Crimes Act


	
	Section 3E of the Crimes Act makes provision for the issue of search warrants where there are reasonable grounds to suspect there will be evidence on premises. Section 3E(5) relevantly provides:
	


“(5) If an issuing officer issues a warrant, the officer is to state in the warrant:

(a) the offence to which the warrant relates; and

. . .

(d) the name of the constable who, unless he or she inserts the name of another constable in the warrant, is to be responsible for executing the warrant; and

. . .”


	
	Section 3C of the Crimes Act contains the following definitions.
	


“constable assisting, in relation to a warrant, means:

(a) a person who is a constable and who is assisting in executing the warrant; or

(b) a person who is not a constable and who has been authorised by the relevant executing officer to assist in executing the warrant.

. . .

executing officer, in relation to a warrant, means:

(a) the constable named in the warrant by the issuing officer as being responsible for executing the warrant; or

(b) if that constable does not intend to be present at the execution of the warrant—another constable whose name has been written in the warrant by the constable so named; or

(c) another constable whose name has been written in the warrant by the constable last named in the warrant.

. . .

issuing officer, in relation to a warrant to search premises or a person or a warrant for arrest under this Part, means:

(a) a magistrate; or

(b) a justice of the peace or other person employed in a court of a State or Territory who is authorised to issue search warrants or warrants for arrest, as the case may be.

premises includes a place and a conveyance.

. . .

serious offence means an offence:

(a) that is punishable by imprisonment for 2 years or more; and

(b) that is one of the following:

(i) a Commonwealth offence;

(ii) an offence against a law of a State that has a federal aspect;

(iii) an offence against a law of a Territory; and

(c) that is not a serious terrorism offence.”


	
	The Crimes Act also relevantly provides:
	


“3F The things that are authorised by a search warrant

(1) A warrant that is in force in relation to premises authorises the executing officer or a constable assisting:

(a) to enter the warrant premises and, if the premises are a conveyance, to enter the conveyance, wherever it is; and

(b) to search for and record fingerprints found at the premises and to take samples of things found at the premises for forensic purposes; and

(c) to search the premises for the kinds of evidential material specified in the warrant, and to seize things of that kind found at the premises; and

(d) to seize other things found at the premises in the course of the search that the executing officer or a constable assisting believes on reasonable grounds to be:

(i) evidential material in relation to an offence to which the warrant relates; or

(ii) evidential material in relation to another offence that is an indictable offence; or

(iii) evidential material (within the meaning of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002) or tainted property (within the meaning of that Act);

if the executing officer or a constable assisting believes on reasonable grounds that seizure of the things is necessary to prevent their concealment, loss or destruction or their use in committing an offence; and

(e) to seize other things found at the premises in the course of the search that the executing officer or a constable assisting believes on reasonable grounds to be seizable items; and

(f) if the warrant so allows—to conduct an ordinary search or a frisk search of a person at or near the premises if the executing officer or a constable assisting suspects on reasonable grounds that the person has any evidential material or seizable items in his or her possession.

. . . .

3G Availability of assistance and use of force in executing a warrant

In executing a warrant:

(a) the executing officer may obtain such assistance; and

(b) the executing officer, or a person who is a constable and who is assisting in executing the warrant may use such force against persons and things; and

(c) a person who is not a constable and who has been authorised to assist in executing the warrant may use such force against things;

as is necessary and reasonable in the circumstances.

3H Details of warrant to be given to occupier etc.

(1) If a warrant in relation to premises is being executed and the occupier of the premises or another person who apparently represents the occupier is present at the premises, the executing officer or a constable assisting must make available to that person a copy of the warrant.

(2) If a warrant in relation to a person is being executed, the executing officer or a constable assisting must make available to that person a copy of the warrant.

(3) If a person is searched under a warrant in relation to premises, the executing officer or a constable assisting must show the person a copy of the warrant.

(4) The executing officer must identify himself or herself to the person at the premises or the person being searched, as the case may be.

(5) The copy of the warrant referred to in subsections (1) and (2) need not include the signature of the issuing officer or the seal of the relevant court.”


	
	Section 3J of the Crimes Act confers additional powers on constables executing the warrant. These powers are conferred alike on the executing officer and a constable assisting.
	


Warrant 2371: 4 Merrin Close, Helens Park


	
	The accused challenges this warrant on four grounds:
	



	
	It does not bear the signature of FA Gategood.
	
	
	It was assigned from FA Gategood to FA Wallosceck without FA Gategood’s signature having been endorsed on the change.
	
	
	It did not comply with s 3E(5)(d) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	The issuing officer did not nominate FA Wallosceck as executing officer. The warrant required the signature of FA Gategood to validate the change to FA Wallosceck as executing officer.
	



	
	The evidence established that FA Gategood, who was the original executing officer, struck though his own name and inserted that of FA Wallosceck. Accordingly, FA Wallosceck became the executing officer for the warrant and, as such, the constable responsible for executing the warrant: s3E(5) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	There is no requirement in the Crimes Act for the original, or any subsequent, executing officer, to sign the warrant or the endorsement of the change. It is not for a court to impose any additional formal requirement on such a document.
	
	
	No allegation of illegality or impropriety has been made out in respect of warrant 2371.
	


Warrant 2378: silver Nissan Pulsar


	
	Challenges were made to this warrant along the same lines as were made to warrant 2371.
	
	
	The evidence established that FA Gategood, who was the original executing officer, struck though his own name and inserted that of FA Cole. Accordingly, FA Cole became the executing officer for the warrant and, as such, the constable responsible for executing the warrant: s3E(5) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	For the reasons given in respect of warrant 2371, no allegation of illegality or impropriety has been made out in respect of warrant 2378.
	


Warrant 2372: 19 Creswell Street, Revesby


	
	Challenges along the lines of those made about warrants 2371 and 2378 were made in respect of warrant 2372. For the reasons given above, those challenges have, with the exception addressed below, not been made out.
	
	
	The evidence established that FA Gategood, who was the original executing officer, handed the warrant in its original form to FA Cole. FA Cole, when he noticed that FA Gategood’s name was still on the warrant, struck through “Steven Gategood” and inserted his own name. Accordingly, the process for appointing a new executing officer pursuant to s 3E(5)(d) of the Crimes Act was not complied with. The accused argued that the warrant was, accordingly, invalid as there was no validly appointed executing officer and the original name (FA Gategood) had been deleted.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that, given that the original executing officer, FA Gategood, did not endorse the warrant to FA Cole, the endorsement was invalid. Accordingly, it contended that FA Gategood remained the executing officer. It argued that, as FA Gategood was present throughout the execution, there was no illegality or invalidity associated either with the warrant or its execution. Moreover, the Crown relied on the apparent lack of distinction between “executing officer” and “constable assisting” in terms of the actions the respective officers were authorised to undertake. The Crown further submitted that, even if the warrant was not strictly in accordance with the Crimes Act, the deficiency was not such as to render the warrant either improper or illegal for the purposes of s 138 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	I note for completeness that the Crown eschewed the argument that FA Cole could be regarded as FA Gategood’s agent for the purposes of endorsing the warrant when he struck out FA Gategood’s name and inserted his own.
	


R v Pettit


	
	The most closely analogous case to the present to which I was referred was R v Pettit [2015] TASSC 14. Of present relevance, in R v Pettit, warrants were issued under s 3E of the Crimes Act which named Pallot as the executing officer. However, on the day on which they were to be executed, Pallot was indisposed. Poly, another officer, signed over the warrants to Hall. The warrants were executed. Pallot was not present at their execution.
	
	
	Justice Tennent said:
	


“[36] When the AFP officers arrived at 42 Anfield Street, Hall’s name appeared on the face of the warrant purportedly as the executing officer. He could not fulfil that position because the warrant had not been lawfully signed over to him by Pallot. To all intents and purposes, when the AFP officers arrived at 42 Anfield Street, Pallot remained the executing officer even though he was not there. . . .

[41] In the present case, the executing officer in respect of the warrant in relation to 42 Anfield Street was Pallot. He was not present at the search, and he did not sign the warrant issued to him over to any other constable. He therefore remained the executing officer. What Poly did in purporting to substitute Hall for Pallot as the executing officer was not authorised by the Act and could have no lawful effect. There was, in the circumstances, no executing officer present at the search.

[42] It is accepted that there is no provision in the Act which requires in plain terms that an executing officer in respect of a warrant should be present at any search conducted pursuant to that warrant. However, the fact that there are alternative meanings for the term “executing officer“ which deal with a situation where the executing officer named in the warrant is not going to be present at the search, when combined with the ordinary meaning of the words “responsible for executing the search“, can lead to only one conclusion, namely that the intention behind the Act is that the executing officer, whether he or she be that originally named in a warrant or one substituted for that officer, must be present at a search and responsible for the execution of the warrant. If any other interpretation were to be contended for, one would have to ask rhetorically, why have an executing officer for the purpose of a warrant in the first place unless that person has a specific role, that is, to be present at and responsible for the execution of the warrant. The phrase, being responsible for the execution of the warrant, clearly connotes taking an active role in overseeing the execution.”

[Emphasis added.]


	
	Pettit argued that the consequences of Poly’s unauthorised act and the absence of an executing officer when the search was conducted were that the search was unlawful and the evidence unlawfully obtained.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that Pallot remained the executing officer under the warrant. However, the Crown argued that the search was lawful as the powers of an executing officer and constables assisting could operate independently of each other and that, even though Pallot was not present at the search, any person who came within the definition of constable assisting who was present could carry out all powers of search and seizure under the Crimes Act, having regard to s 3F. It submitted further that the officers who were present were assisting Pallot. Accordingly, it submitted that, although Pallot was not present, the warrant and the consequential search were nonetheless valid. There were several other issues raised with the validity of the warrants and the lawfulness of their execution which are not relevant for present purposes.
	
	
	Justice Tennent rejected the Crown’s submissions and decided that the search of the premises and the seizure of material were unlawful as the search had been conducted in circumstances where there was no executing officer, or constable assisting that officer, present.
	
	
	The passage I have highlighted in the extract from Tennent J’s judgment in R v Pettit set out above would, thus, seem to provide some support for the Crown’s argument that FA Gategood was, and remained, the executing officer, as no valid endorsement had been made to the warrant. However, in R v Pettit, his Honour was not required to determine whether Pallot remained the executing officer since both parties accepted that he did. Moreover, in R v Pettit, there was what might be regarded as a more substantial illegality than in the present case in that Pallot had not only not endorsed the warrant to Hall or been privy to its assignment to Hall (for which Poly had been responsible) but he had also not been present for its execution. Accordingly, the correctness of the parties’ acceptance that Pallot was the executing officer, as no other executing officer had been validly appointed, did not need to be considered.
	


Telstra Corporation Ltd v Seven Cable Television Pty Ltd


	
	The Crown also relied on Telstra Corporation Ltd v Seven Cable Television Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1160; 102 FCR 517 in support of its submission that FA Cole’s endorsement of his name on the warrant was invalid as it was not in accordance with s 3E(5)(d) of the Crimes Act and should therefore be disregarded ab initio. The Crown referred, in particular, to what the Court (Beaumont, Moore and Gyles JJ) said at [97]:
	


“While there may be a question as to whether an administrative act is void or voidable, and as to the significance and effect of such an act pending a declaration of invalidity by a court (for example, being able to appeal: Collector of Customs (NSW) v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd (1979) 24 ALR 307 ; 2 ALD 1; Calvin v Carr [1980] AC 574 at 590), it is fundamental that the purported exercise of a statutory power which does not accord with the statute is of no effect and may be disregarded — it does not impose duties or create rights. For certain (interlocutory) purposes, an administrative act may be presumed regular until set aside: F Hoffman-La Roche & Co AG v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1975] AC 295 at 365; R v Wilks [1998] AC 92 at 115G. Once a court has declared the invalidity, then it follows that the act is voided ab initio (Forbes v New South Wales Trotting Club Ltd (1979) 143 CLR 242 ; 25 ALR 1 at CLR 277 per Aickin J), like a statute which is declared invalid if it is beyond power: South Australia v Commonwealth (1942) 65 CLR 373 per Latham CJ at 408. A possible exception to this principle is the so-called de facto officers doctrine, which has no relevance here: G J Coles & Co Ltd v Retail Trade Industry Tribunal (1986) 7 NSWLR 503 at 519–20, 525–7; Re Governor Goulburn Correctional Centre; Ex parte Eastman (1999) 165 ALR 171 ; 73 ALJR 1324 at 1357.”


	
	Telstra Corporation Ltd v Seven Cable Television Pty Ltd concerned the validity of a declaration made by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in purported exercise of a power to declare that a specified eligible service is a “declared service”. There was no power to make the declaration without revoking or varying a deeming statement, for which statutory provision was made. However, as the deeming statement was invalid ab initio, it presented no impediment to the validity of the declaration.
	


The principles relating to search warrants


	
	In my view, the principal difficulty with the Crown’s submission in the present case (that FA Gategood was, and remained the executing officer) is that it does not take sufficient account of the nature and importance of search warrants.
	
	
	In George v Rockett (1990) 170 CLR 104 the High Court outlined the relevant principles in the following passage at 110-111:
	


“A search warrant thus authorises an invasion of premises without the consent of persons in lawful possession or occupation thereof. The validity of such a warrant is necessarily dependent upon the fulfilment of the conditions governing its issue. In prescribing conditions governing the issue of search warrants, the legislature has sought to balance the need for an effective criminal justice system against the need to protect the individual from arbitrary invasions of his privacy and property. Search warrants facilitate the gathering of evidence against, and the apprehension and conviction of, those who have broken the criminal law. In enacting s679, the legislature has given primacy to the public interest in the effective administration of criminal justice over the private right of the individual to enjoy his privacy and property. The common law has long been jealous of the prima facie immunity from seizure of papers and possessions: see Holdsworth, A History of English Law, vol.10, (1938), 668-672. Except in the case of a warrant issued for the purpose of searching a place for stolen goods, the common law refused to countenance the issue of search warrants at all and refused to permit a constable or government official to enter private property without the permission of the occupier: Leach v Money (1765) 19 State Tr.1001; Entick v Carrington (1765) 19 State Tr.1029. Historically, the justification for these limitations on the power of entry and search was based on the rights of private property: Entick, at 1066. In modern times, the justification has shifted increasingly to the protection of privacy: see Feldman, The Law Relating to Entry, Search and Seizure, (1986), 1-2.

State and Commonwealth statutes have made many exceptions to the common law position, and s679 is a far-reaching one. Nevertheless, in construing and applying such statutes, it needs to be kept in mind that they authorise the invasion of interests which the common law has always valued highly and which, through the writ of trespass, it went to great lengths to protect. Against that background, the enactment of conditions which must be fulfilled before a search warrant can be lawfully issued and executed is to be seen as a reflection of the legislature's concern to give a measure of protection to these interests. To insist on strict compliance with the statutory conditions governing the issue of search warrants is simply to give effect to the purpose of the legislation.”

Consideration


	
	By s 3E of the Crimes Act, the Commonwealth Parliament has conferred a substantial power on the executive to invade the privacy of individuals and to intrude on their property rights. The accused, as the occupier of the premises, was entitled to know the name of the executing officer of the warrant at the time of its execution. Section 3E requires the issuing officer to name the executing officer. The executing officer is the only person who can appoint a substitute. This must be done under the hand of the executing officer. The warrant showed that FA Cole was the executing officer since he was named as such. He had not been validly appointed. FA Gategood’s name had been deleted; accordingly, he was no longer shown as the executing officer. Proper compliance with the requirements of s 3E(5)(d) is all the more significant when, as here, the person whose rights are affected by the warrant is in no position to know whether any endorsement was made by the original executing officer and, accordingly, whether the named executing officer was validly appointed.
	
	
	Although there are provisions in other statutes that authorise warrants to be issued other than to named persons, s 3E is not one of them. It would have been open to Parliament to include in the Crimes Act a section permitting irregularities to be overlooked or forgiven. The Crown did not identify any such section. Provisions of that nature are to be found in other statutes, such as s 75 of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act or s 76 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (NSW), the latter of which provides:
	


“Defects in warrants

A search warrant is not invalidated by any defect, other than a defect which affects the substance of the warrant in a material particular.”


	
	Nor is there any provision in the Crimes Act that regulates the consequences of alterations or deletions in a warrant, such as, for example, s 14(1) of the Succession Act 2006 (NSW), which provides that an alteration to a will after it has been executed is not effective unless the alteration is executed in the manner in which a will is required to be executed.
	
	
	The Crown’s submission that FA Cole’s endorsement can be simply disregarded appears to be based on the assumption that a warrant ought to be treated in a similar way to other legal documents, such as a will or a deed where an amendment, if irregular, is, in some circumstances, simply treated as of no effect, leaving intact the original document. For the reasons given above, although R v Pettit appears to support that proposition, it only arose per incuriam.
	
	
	I do not regard such an approach as appropriate in the context of a warrant. Concepts which apply to the construction of other legal documents ought not be assumed to apply to warrants: see King v The Queen [1969] 1 AC 304 at 312 per Lord Hodson. The Crown’s argument, if correct, would subvert the requirement of certainty. As was said in Taikato v The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 454 at 466 (Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ):
	


“The operation of the criminal law should be as certain as possible. If the interpretative choice is between making a value judgment and applying a rule, a court exercising criminal jurisdiction should prefer the rule.”

Conclusion


	
	I reject the Crown’s submission that, notwithstanding that FA Cole had not been validly appointed as an executing officer, the warrant was nonetheless legal. The authority to enter the accused’s premises, conduct a search there and seize items located there derived from the warrant. A warrant that does not comply with the law is an illegal warrant. As was said in George v Rockett at 110:
	


“The validity of such a warrant is necessarily dependent upon the fulfillment of conditions governing its issue.”


	
	For the reasons given above, warrant 2372 did not comply with s 3E of the Crimes Act and its execution was, accordingly, illegal. It did not authorise the search and seizure at 19 Creswell Street, Revesby. Accordingly, the evidence obtained as a result of its execution was unlawfully obtained and s 138 of the Evidence Act applies.
	
	
	It could reasonably be said that the breach was a purely technical one, which resulted from ignorance rather than disregard for the law; did not have any particular effect; and gave the APF no advantage in obtaining evidence as both FA Cole and Gategood were present throughout. However, these matters relate, not to the question of legality, but to the question whether the evidence obtained as a result of the search and seizure pursuant to that warrant ought be admitted under s 138 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	The accused was not in a position to address me on s 138. Moreover, the Crown had neither tendered, nor otherwise described, the evidence obtained through the execution of warrant 2372. Accordingly, I cannot make the judgment required by s 138 since the probative value and importance of the evidence are mandatory relevant considerations in the decision whether to admit the evidence (s 138(3)(a) and (b)). Thus, it is necessary to address that question at a further pre-trial hearing. Although the evidence of the three federal agents called in this hearing (FA Gategood, FA Cole and FA Gill) was also relevant to matters germane to those listed in s 138(3), I propose to defer making findings on such matters until after the further pre-trial hearing when I have heard submissions from the parties on all relevant matters.
	


Orders


	
	I make the following directions:
	



	
	Direct the Crown to serve on the accused and provide to my Associate on or before 4pm 6 November 2015 a document setting out the evidence sought to be relied upon in the Crown case that was obtained by the execution of warrant 2372.
	
	
	Confirm 9 November 2015 at 9.15am as the next mention date, at which time a date for hearing of the voir dire in respect of the issue whether the evidence identified in (1) ought be admitted under s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) will be allocated and any further pre-trial directions will be made.

2702520,McDonald v R [2015] NSWCCA 280,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	ADAMS J: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: Jaron Angus McDonald (""the applicant"") was found guilty by a jury in the District Court at Lismore of four offences contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) on 22 February 2013. He was sentenced by her Honour Judge Murrell SC (as her Honour then was) on 3 June 2013.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against his convictions on two grounds relating to the admissibility of certain evidence. (Leave is required as the grounds raise questions of mixed law and fact: s 5(1)(b) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).) He also applies for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on four grounds.
	
	
	The details of the offences and the sentences imposed are as follows:
	



	
		
			
			Count
			
			
			Offence
			
			
			Crimes Act provision and maximum penalty
			
			
			Sentence
			
		
		
			
			1

	The grounds of appeal against conviction are as follows:
	


1.   Her Honour erred by allowing the prosecution to adduce evidence of post-offence conduct.

2.   Her Honour erred by allowing the DNA evidence to be admitted into evidence.

The respective cases at trial

The offences


	
	There was no dispute that the offences had been committed. The only issue was whether the applicant was the offender.
	
	
	The victim was a woman aged in her early sixties who worked as a cleaner at the Byron Bay Beach Café adjacent to Clarkes Beach in Byron Bay. She commenced her duties on 20 August 2008 at about 2.30 am. She parked her car in the adjacent car park. At about 4.00 am she made herself a cup of coffee while she was waiting for floors to dry and she went to an outside dining area. The offender approached her. He was wearing a balaclava and a pair of gloves and was holding long wooden stake.
	
	
	The victim reached forward towards the stick but the offender told her to get back inside, pushing her in that direction. She said, “please don’t hurt me.” He asked for the whereabouts of the cash registers and then requested tools to open them. The victim provided him with tools which included a screwdriver and a pair of snub-nosed pliers which he used to loosen the drawers of two cash registers. He became frustrated because he was having difficulty and asked the victim for a cigarette. She gave him one and at his request she held it with her fingers while he smoked it. She said it burnt down to her fingers and she dropped it on the floor. He grabbed a drinking glass and put the butt into it; making the comment that he was “not so stupid as to leave my DNA lying around.” He placed the glass as well as the screwdriver and pliers into a plastic bag (a small bin liner).
	
	
	The offender treated the victim in a physical way, pushing her at times with the wooden stake. The victim felt unable to leave. At one stage he told her that if she went to the police he would come back and kill her and come after her family. Over a period of possibly ten to fifteen minutes, the victim was required to remain in the presence of the offender, no more than a few feet away from him.
	
	
	The offender seized a quantity of alcohol and he made the victim help him to carry the alcohol and the cash registers to her car. He put the bag containing the cigarette butt and other items on the floor behind the driver's seat. The victim asked the offender to put down the timber stake as it was frightening her and he did so. He told her, ""don't you ever tell the police that I used this"". The offender snatched the car keys from the victim. He insisted that she move into the passenger seat, pushing her and telling her to ""hurry up"".
	
	
	The offender drove through several streets in the Byron Bay area. At one point he stopped the car. He told the victim that he was horny and asked her to suck his penis. She was crying and pleading with him not to do anything to her. He grabbed her left breast and pulled at it in a very forceful fashion, causing considerable pain. This behaviour continued for some minutes.
	
	
	The offender then drove further to a slightly more isolated area at Ocean Street adjacent to bushland where he stopped and told her to get out of the car. He began taking the stolen items out of the back seat area. She heard the sound of breaking glass. The offender then started pulling and fondling her breasts and genitals through her clothing. This continued for a matter of minutes. The victim was terrified, fearing that she would never again see her family, including her great-grandchildren. The offender then told her to get into the driver’s seat and leave. However, he warned that if she went to the police he would kill her and come after her family.
	
	
	The victim drove directly to her son’s home and he took her to the Byron Bay Police Station where the matter was reported.
	


The investigation


	
	An investigation was commenced by officers including Senior Constable Bridget Wisemantel. (She was unavailable to give evidence at the trial due to ill-health, a matter relevant to Ground 2.) She had taken the victim back to the café and then to the Ocean Street location where the incident with the offender had concluded. Ms Wisemantel's notebook entry was before the jury which was to the effect that at 6.40am at Ocean Street she collected exhibits including ""3 x cigarette butts"" and ""1 x glass piece"".
	
	
	The relevant page from the police station exhibit book was also before the jury. It indicated that, amongst other things, three cigarette butts and a piece of clear broken glass had been entered into the exhibit records at 7.20am on 20 August 2008. The entry was signed by Ms Wisemantel and countersigned by Leading Senior Constable Anthony Bordin. The entry was said to relate to an aggravated break and enter and an abduction for which the offender was ""unknown"".
	
	
	Ms Wisemantel had been on night shift and concluded her duty that morning at 7.30 am.
	
	
	Meanwhile, at about 7.00 am, police found the applicant sleeping face down in the grass in a location not far from Ocean Street. He was offered a lift home but he declined and walked away.
	
	
	At about 8.30 am, Senior Constable Kelly Rampling, a crime scene officer, attended the Byron Bay Beach Café with Senior Constable Rachelle Adams to carry out an examination. Nothing was found that would assist in identification of the offender.
	
	
	At about 11.35 am, Ms Rampling and Ms Adams went to a holding yard near the Byron Bay police station and examined the victim's car. It was of significance that on the rear floor behind the driver's seat there was broken glass and a cigarette butt. (The victim gave evidence that she had thoroughly cleaned her car, inside and out, the previous day.) Photographs were taken and the butt was collected for later examination.
	
	
	Ms Rampling said that Ms Adams collected the butt and she, Ms Rampling, put it in a paper exhibit bag which was then sealed with exhibit tape. The same procedure was followed in relation to another item that was seized (not presently relevant). The pair then went to the police station where the exhibit bags were handed to Mr Bordin in order for him to make entries in the exhibit book. They left this task to him as they had to attend another crime scene.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Ms Rampling confirmed that the cigarette butt had been photographed where it had been found before being collected and placed in an exhibit bag. Counsel asked questions directed to having the officer confirm that all procedures to guard against contamination and to ensure continuity of the item had been followed. No inquiry was made of her as to the possibility of anything untoward having occurred. There was no suggestion of any misconduct.
	
	
	At about 11.40 am, three police officers attended a location on Ocean Street following a radio broadcast. They walked along a track through bushland towards Tallows Beach and came across the applicant and another man, Joshua Chubb. Mr Chubb had a backpack and when asked what was in it the applicant replied, ""Beach stuff, we were going for a swim"". The backpack was found to contain a number of bottles of alcohol. The applicant said they had found them in the bush. Mr Chubb said that he had found the items when he went into the bush to go to the toilet. He showed police the location where it could be seen that there were items covered with beach towels. The pair were arrested (for goods in custody) and taken to the police station. The applicant was interviewed that afternoon and then released without charge.
	
	
	Ms Rampling, with Ms Adams and Senior Constable Thompson, went to the bushland area off Ocean Street at about 1.15 pm. Various items taken from the Byron Bay Beach Café were found under the beach towels: for example, cash register drawers, bottles of alcohol and receipts in the name of the café.
	
	
	On 26 August 2008, Detective Senior Constable Duncan King seized a number of items from the applicant, including a silver flat link neck chain. The victim said that the offender had worn a silver neck chain and, referring to it, he said to her, “You didn’t see this”. She described the chain to police and when subsequently shown the chain seized from the applicant she identified it as the one worn by the offender.
	
	
	Ms Mary Gardner, the owner of the house where the applicant was living at the time of the offence, gave evidence that she found a pair of pliers after he moved out shortly after the offence. It was the Crown case that these were of similar appearance to those the victim said had been used by the offender to try and loosen the drawers of the cash registers.
	
	
	On 31 October 2008 an order was made pursuant to the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000 (NSW) for the applicant to attend the Byron Bay police station on 7 November 2008 to provide a DNA sample and submit to being photographed. He failed to attend.
	
	
	A DNA sample was eventually obtained from the applicant after he was arrested on 25 November 2010. Subsequent analysis revealed that his profile was the same as that found on one of the cigarette butts found at Ocean Street at 6.40 am on 20 August 2008 by Ms Wisemantel and that found on the cigarette butt found in the victim's car by Ms Rampling and Ms Adams at about 11.35 am that day.
	


The Crown's circumstantial case


	
	The Crown's case was based upon circumstantial evidence involving (primarily) the following components:
	



	
	The offender wore a distinctive silver chain necklace of similar appearance to one which the applicant wore.
	
	
	Pliers used by the offender in his attempt to break open the cash registers were of similar appearance to a pair found at the home where the applicant lived.
	
	
	Ms Gardner's evidence that the applicant was not at home at the relevant time.
	
	
	An inference of consciousness of guilt arose from the applicant lying about being home at the relevant time.
	
	
	The applicant was found in Ocean Street about 2½ hours after the theft of a quantity of alcohol and he was in a condition consistent with being affected by alcohol.
	
	
	The applicant was found at about 11.30 am the same day in the vicinity of the stolen property.
	
	
	An inference of consciousness of guilt arose from the applicant failing to comply with a court order to attend a police station to provide a DNA sample.
	
	
	The applicant's DNA profile matched those found on the cigarette butts found in the back of the victim's car and in the vicinity of where the offender had left her in Ocean Street.
	


Ground 1 – error in allowing evidence of post-offence conduct

Background


	
	The applicant was charged on 8 October 2007 with unrelated offences of robbery in company; assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company; assault occasioning actual bodily harm (x 2); assault; and larceny. He was remanded in custody until he was granted bail by the Supreme Court on 4 February 2008.
	
	
	In respect of the present matters, the applicant was arrested on 20 August 2008 but released later that day without being charged.
	
	
	On 22 August 2008 the applicant was charged with unrelated offences of assault, offensive behaviour, larceny, damaging property and failing to quit licensed premises. He was remanded in custody. He was conditionally discharged in respect of these matters pursuant to s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) on 13 October 2008, whereupon he was released from custody.
	
	
	The charges preferred against the applicant in October 2007 were finalised on 29 October 2008. Two charges were no-billed, three culminated in not guilty verdicts and there was a conviction for assault. A sentence of 3 months imprisonment was imposed but it was backdated to the date of arrest, meaning that the applicant remained at liberty.
	
	
	Returning to the present matters, after the applicant failed to attend for the forensic procedure on 7 November 2008 he went to live in Queensland. Police caused a warrant for his arrest to be issued but it was not executed until he was found in Byron Bay on 25 November 2010. The failure to attend the forensic procedure constituted the post-offence conduct the subject of this ground.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor did not open on this issue. She simply mentioned that police obtained an order permitting the taking of a DNA sample from the applicant and that there was a long delay between obtaining the order and obtaining the sample.
	
	
	When the officer in charge of the case, Detective Senior Constable King, was giving evidence the prosecutor asked him if on 31 October 2008 he made an application for a forensic procedure order. An objection was taken by counsel for the applicant.
	


Submissions to the trial judge


	
	In submissions made in the absence of the jury, counsel argued that in explaining why his client did not attend the police station and absented himself for two years it would be necessary to disclose other matters which had brought involvement by his client in the criminal justice system at around the same period and subsequently. It was foreshadowed that the applicant’s explanation for not attending for the forensic procedure was that he felt he was being persecuted by the police as he had been in the recent past. Counsel submitted, ""His reason for fleeing is inextricably linked to the … recent criminal history"".
	
	
	Another matter raised by counsel for the applicant was that in explaining his absence from the jurisdiction for about two years it would be necessary to refer to another serious matter (causing grievous bodily harm with intent) for which a warrant was issued for his arrest sometime in 2009 or 2010. He was subsequently tried for that matter in 2012 and acquitted.
	
	
	Counsel relied upon the authority of R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 as supporting his contention that the evidence was not admissible pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) on the basis that its probative value (which was conceded) was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the evidence would not require the applicant to disclose anything about his other involvement in the criminal justice system in that it would not include any mention of the length of time he had been “on the run” (some two years) and would be limited to the fact that he failed to attend for the forensic procedure.
	


Ruling on admissibility


	
	The trial judge gave a judgment in which she referred to the provision in s 137; summarised the competing submissions; and discussed the authority upon which the applicant relied. She identified the “unfair prejudice” asserted by the applicant as “the need by the accused to adduce evidence of his criminal history in order to explain apparently incriminating conduct”. R v Cook was distinguished on the basis that in that case the applicant’s explanation for the consciousness of guilt evidence required disclosure of criminal conduct described as “disturbingly close” to the alleged conduct the subject of the trial.
	
	
	Her Honour considered that the probative value of the evidence in the present case was “high” in that the forensic procedure was directed, in part, to obtaining DNA evidence that might link the applicant with the offences in question.
	
	
	As to the danger of unfair prejudice, her Honour noted that it was unnecessary for the applicant to disclose his criminal history in order to explain his failure to attend for the forensic procedure. He was not wanted by police in respect of any outstanding matters at the relevant time (although he was later). It was unnecessary for him to raise his criminal history because there was no relevant criminal history; the applicant had been acquitted of the relevant matters, unlike the situation in R v Cook. (No attention appears to have been given by anyone to the fact that the applicant had been convicted and sentenced on 29 October 2008 for an offence of assault. The applicant did not place any specific reliance upon it in this Court.)
	
	
	Her Honour acknowledged that there was a danger of unfair prejudice where a person has been charged in the past but considered that in this case the danger was not the same as where a person had been convicted; the applicant had in fact been acquitted. She concluded:
	


“So when I weigh the probative value which is high against the danger of unfair prejudice which is not particularly significant, it is my view that the test in s 137 is not satisfied and so the evidence will be admitted.”

The evidence before the jury


	
	The evidence which was then placed before the jury was confined as follows:
	


""Q. Detective King yesterday when we broke off in your evidence, we got to a

stage where you had started talking about a forensic procedure order?

A. Yes.

Q. Now an order was made on 31 October 2008 that required the accused to

submit for a forensic order, specifically the taking of his DNA?

A. Yes that’s correct.

Q. The accused was aware of that order?

A. Yes the accused was present when that order was made.

Q. He failed to attend - the order required that he attend on 7 November 2008, correct?

A. To present by 5pm on 7 November.

Q. On or before 7 November 2008?

A. Yes that’s correct.

Q. He failed to attend in accordance with that order?

A. That’s right.

Q. At a later time the accused - a DNA sample was taken from the accused?

A. Yes it was.""

Submissions in this Court


	
	Counsel for the applicant in this Court (who did not appear at the trial) submitted that the evidence concerning the failure to attend for the carrying out of the forensic procedure should have been excluded on the basis that it had ""minimal relevance"". This was on the basis that it was not ""proximate to the offence""; it related to an order made by a court; and it could readily be explained by a number of factors not necessarily consistent with a consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	It was submitted that in order for the applicant ""to properly meet the evidence he had to give evidence and introduce evidence that he [had] previous and significant dealings with the police"". For this reason, the evidence was ""clearly prejudicial"" and should have been excluded pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	It was also contended that her Honour further erred ""by not giving the proper direction to the jury about the evidence"".
	
	
	The written submissions were only amplified in oral argument by a claim that the relevance of post-offence conduct is greater when it is more contemporaneous with the offence in question. Where it is more remote, there is a greater possibility of explanations aside from consciousness of guilt. Counsel conceded that there had been no complaint made at trial concerning the directions the trial judge had given the jury about the use of this evidence.
	


Consideration


	
	The complaint about jury directions may be immediately rejected. No error in the directions was identified and nor is any apparent. They included the usual caution about people not always acting sensibly when accused of serious offences; that there may be possible innocent explanations for the conduct such as panic, fear of unjust accusation, or reasons aside from consciousness of guilt of the offences in question. Counsel's concession that no complaint was raised at trial is fatal to this aspect of the argument.
	
	
	The complaint about relevance may also be rejected. The time that had passed between the commission of the offences and the requirement for the applicant to attend for the DNA procedure had little, if anything, to do with relevance. To the extent that a passage of time might have been relevant, it was from when the applicant became aware of the interest of the police in obtaining his DNA and his failure to appear for the procedure (a period of a week). Moreover, counsel at trial conceded that the evidence had probative value and confined his argument to the danger of unfair prejudice. The trial judge found that the probative value was high. That finding was open to her.
	
	
	For the applicant to succeed in establishing that her Honour was in error in not excluding the evidence pursuant to s 137, he must demonstrate that she was incorrect to find that the probative value of the evidence outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice: R v Cook at [38] (Simpson J, as her Honour then was).
	
	
	The trial judge allowed for the possibility that the applicant might want to disclose that he had recently been charged by police with various offences but then acquitted. She accepted that there would be a degree of prejudice in this but not to the extent of outweighing the probative value of the evidence. I cannot see error in this assessment for the reasons which follow. (As it turned out, the applicant provided an explanation which did not involve reference to any other criminal proceedings.)
	
	
	In R v Cook, the appellant had been tried for an offence of threatening to inflict actual bodily harm by means of an offensive weapon with intent to have sexual intercourse. The Crown led evidence that he evaded police when they attempted to locate and arrest him. The appellant had objected to the evidence on the basis that there was unfair prejudice inherent in his explanation for the conduct: he would be required to disclose previous violence towards women and breach of an apprehended violence order.
	
	
	Counsel for Mr Cook submitted: “Where the explanation involves revealing further offences generally the discretion should be exercised in favour of exclusion.” Simpson J considered authorities relied upon for this proposition and concluded:
	


""[47] In my opinion none of the authorities to which reference has been made support the proposition advanced on behalf of the appellant. There is no general principle that, when the explanation for flight involves revealing other offences, the evidence should be rejected. Indeed, it is part of the conventional direction in relation to evidence indicative of a consciousness of guilt (whether of lies, or flight, or otherwise), that the jury be alerted to the possibility that the accused person has undertaken that course of conduct by reason of consciousness of guilt, not of the offence charged, but of some other offence or discreditable conduct.""


	
	However, her Honour then (at [48]) referred to the fact that the proposed explanation by the appellant not only involved disclosure of other offences, but that such offences had a ""disturbingly similar relationship with the offence with which he was charged"". This involved prejudice which was unfair which outweighed the probative value of the flight evidence which should have been excluded.
	
	
	The circumstances in R v Cook illustrate the extent of prejudice that may be inherent in an explanation for post-offence conduct relied upon by the prosecution as founding an inference of consciousness of guilt. But the prejudice in that case was substantially greater than in the present case. The gist of the applicant's explanation was that he feared being falsely accused. Putting aside the plausibility of such a claim, the trial judge was correct to conclude that this did not require disclosure of past criminal proceedings to an extent that would involve unfair prejudice that outweighed the high probative value of the evidence. I am not persuaded that there was any error in the decision to admit the evidence.
	
	
	The directions given to the jury appropriately highlighted the need for consideration of whether the conduct was explicable by consciousness of guilt as opposed to some alternative explanation. The jury were also directed that even if they did conclude the explanation was consciousness of guilt, it was simply one aspect of a circumstantial case and could not possibly prove any of the offences on its own. There was no danger of the jury misusing the evidence or giving it greater weight than it deserved.
	
	
	A fundamental misconception underlies this ground. There was never any attempt made by the applicant to place evidence before the trial judge on the voir dire to establish that his failure to appear for the DNA procedure had anything to do with other unrelated offences with which he had been charged. What was put on his behalf was that the other matters which he did not wish to have to disclose to the jury provided ""the reason for fleeing"" and for his absence from the jurisdiction for an extended period. But the Crown did not rely upon ""flight"" at all.
	
	
	I would refuse leave in respect of this ground as it is entirely without substance.
	


Ground 2 – erroneous admission of DNA evidence


	
	The trial commenced on Monday 11 February 2013. The Crown informed the court that Ms Wisemantel was not available to give evidence due to ill-health until at least 28 February. The applicant did not seek an adjournment. Rather, an application was made for a permanent stay of proceedings; alternatively that all of the DNA evidence be excluded pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	One of the theories underpinning the defence case was that, because the applicant was innocent, something must have gone awry with the DNA evidence that implicated him. There must have been either inadvertent contamination of the exhibits either whilst they were in police custody or at the analytical laboratory, or there had been deliberate tampering in order to falsely incriminate him.
	


Submissions to the trial judge


	
	Counsel for the applicant contended that he would be denied the opportunity to cross-examine the officer and thereby raise matters said to be relevant to her credibility. Her Honour summarised these matters in her judgment, which I will refer to shortly. (There was no suggestion that there was anything inaccurate about the summary, or that her Honour had omitted reference to anything material.)
	
	
	The purpose of the proposed cross-examination of the officer was explained at quite some length in the submissions of counsel. In essence, it was to establish that the officer had a motive to lie, to tamper with evidence, and generally to falsely incriminate the applicant. Continuity of custody of relevant exhibits was also an issue.
	


Judgment of the trial judge


	
	The judge refused the application for a stay and ruled that the evidence was admissible.
	
	
	Her Honour acknowledged that the DNA evidence was an important, but not the only, aspect of the Crown's case. She noted that the applicant wished to raise three matters in relation to the contention that there was a possibility of deliberate tampering with the evidence, two of which depended upon the officer being available for cross-examination.
	
	
	The first matter concerned an incident in 2004, not involving the applicant, where a person was at a police station and Ms Wisemantel alleged that he had conducted himself in an intimidating fashion towards her. The person was charged with intimidation but the proceedings were discontinued. There was a suggestion that this was likely because CCTV footage was inconsistent with the officer’s version. Her Honour observed that nothing other than hearsay material by way of background to the incident was before her (a letter by a solicitor containing a submission that the prosecution be discontinued). It was not known with any certainty why the proceedings were discontinued. Nor was it known whether there had been any adverse finding made against the officer.
	
	
	The second matter concerned the applicant having assaulted and resisted Ms Wisemantel and another officer in the course of their duty. An appeal against his conviction for these offences was heard and determined on 15 August 2008. The appeal was dismissed. Her Honour said that the issue in those proceedings was whether the applicant’s arrest was lawful and therefore whether the officers were acting in the course of their duty. The credibility of Ms Wisemantel did not appear to have been an issue.
	
	
	The judge said that nothing was put to suggest why these events might have motivated the officer to lie about matters the subject of the present proceedings. The prosecution had been successful in that the applicant had been convicted and an appeal had been dismissed.
	
	
	The third matter the applicant wished to raise was a question of whether the sequence of certain events in Ms Wisemantel’s statement was correct. She said she went to the café where she collected the timber stake carried by the offender, returned to the police station and then went to Ocean Street where the cigarette butts and other items were seized. Other evidence suggested that she may have proceeded directly from the café to Ocean Street before returning to the police station. The judge acknowledged that the officer’s account of the sequence may be wrong. But she could not see how an erroneous recollection of a seemingly unimportant sequence of events supported an argument that she was willing to fabricate evidence.
	
	
	The judge was not satisfied that there was any evidence that Ms Wisemantel had any opportunity or means to deliberately tamper with evidence associated with the DNA issue. Her Honour adequately summarised the basis upon which a permanent stay of a criminal trial may be granted on the basis for which the applicant contended: where the court is satisfied that no fair trial could be held; any prejudice to an accused person could not be cured by an appropriate direction to the jury; and the circumstances need to be exceptional: see, for example, Jago v The District Court of New South Wales [1989] HCA 46; 168 CLR 23. Her Honour was not satisfied that a basis had been established and the application was rejected.
	
	
	Her Honour then referred to an authority upon which the applicant relied for exclusion of the DNA evidence pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act: R v Sing [2002] NSWCCA 20; 54 NSWLR 31. That was a case in which there was no explanation or justification for the Crown not calling important witnesses on a DNA issue. Her Honour distinguished it from the circumstances of the present case where the absence of the witness was explained and justified. She also noted that Ms Wisemantel had no involvement in the second of the two items providing DNA evidence, the cigarette butt found by other officers in the victim’s car.
	
	
	Her Honour concluded that the cross-examination of Ms Wisemantel that the applicant was denied the opportunity to pursue “was very speculative indeed” and she was “not satisfied that having regard to the manner in which the defence wants to conduct its case, the probative value of admitting the DNA evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice”.
	
	
	There was a further matter the applicant wished to raise and that concerned whether Leading Senior Constable Bordin, who entered in the exhibit book some of the items seized on 20 August 2008, was the same person with that surname who had been the subject of some criticism concerning a statement he had made supporting a false claim made by a fellow officer in 1988. Her Honour noted that whether he was the same officer or not was not clear. I note that Mr Bordin was called to give evidence and her Honour refused to allow the cross-examination on the basis that it could not ""substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of the witness"" (it was too remote in time and different in nature) and, alternatively, on the basis that the evidence would be ""misleading, confusing and a terrible waste of the court's time"" (ss 103 and 135 Evidence Act).
	


Submissions in this Court and response


	
	Despite the assertion in the statement of the ground that the trial judge erred in admitting the DNA evidence, the written submissions for the applicant failed to articulate the nature of the error asserted. They repeated the assertions that the DNA was an important aspect of the prosecution case and that it was necessary for the defence to discredit it.
	
	
	The submissions included reference to Ms Adams not having been called to give evidence in relation to the finding of the cigarette butt in the back of the victim's car. That had nothing to do with the decision of the trial judge to admit the evidence. It is notable as well that Ms Rampling gave direct evidence of locating and recovering that cigarette butt which was not challenged.
	
	
	The submissions included a complaint about Ms Wisemantel's collection of cigarette butts at Ocean Street that was based upon an erroneous understanding that those butts were said to be associated with the location of the stolen goods (AWS [29]). The butts were found in the area where the victim said the offender unloaded the stolen goods from her car and allowed her to leave. The stolen goods were found elsewhere, secreted in nearby bushland.
	
	
	It was also contended that there was ""an evidentiary hole in the Crown's case"" in that there was no evidence that the three butts collected by Ms Wisemantel were collected from the road (AWS [31]) – but the respective cases at trial were conducted upon an acceptance that they were recovered from the vicinity of where the car had stopped in Ocean Street. (The applicant's evidence was that he was in the habit of traversing that area when walking to and from the beach and he was in the habit of dropping cigarette butts.)
	
	
	There were other matters raised in the written submissions of the same nature. They were directed to the strength of the evidence on the DNA issue, not its admissibility, and certainly not directed to establishing error in the ruling of the trial judge.
	
	
	The oral submissions for the applicant included an attempt to challenge whether Ms Wisemantel was ""unavailable"" for the purposes of s 65 of the Evidence Act. But it was accepted that the applicant made no such challenge at trial. His counsel appears to have been content to accept that she was ""physically unable to give the evidence and it is not reasonably practicable to overcome that inability"" (cl 4(1)(c), Pt 2 of the Dictionary to the Evidence Act). The applicant’s counsel informed the trial judge that there was ""a medical certificate suggesting the officer was unavailable until 28 February"". On the third day of the trial, counsel informed the judge that the Crown was proposing to tender the officer's notebook as well as the relevant exhibit book entries and said: ""I won’t be opposing the tender of those documents on the basis that the maker’s unavailable"".
	
	
	Despite there having been no issue as to unavailability raised at trial, counsel maintained that there was no hurdle to his reliance upon this argument on appeal on the simple basis that there had been objection to the admissibility of the DNA evidence. That proposition runs counter to what was said about raising an entirely new argument as to admissibility of evidence on appeal in Bin Sulaeman v R [2013] NSWCCA 283 at [133]-[143] and Poniris v R [2014] NSWCCA 100 [51]-[56]. In the latter, Macfarlan JA held that r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies in such a situation.
	
	
	I would refuse the applicant leave to rely upon the contention that it was not established that Ms Wisemantel was unavailable. It was completely contrary to the position he took at trial and no attempt was made to provide this Court with any evidence to establish that the officer could have been available to attend and give evidence.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant also sought to raise for the first time a complaint that Ms Adams was not called. I would refuse leave to rely upon this point as well, particularly in light of the fact that the evidence of Ms Rampling was not challenged.
	
	
	Before leaving this ground I make the observation that there is no merit in the general assertion of the applicant that the DNA evidence was marred by the possibility of contamination or deliberate tampering. There is nothing that gives cause for any unease about the evidence of the police locating and collecting the relevant items. The evidence established a complete chain of custody of the items from finding through to analysis at the laboratory. And, according to the evidence of the senior forensic biologist, Mr Clinton Cochrane, the possibility of contamination in the laboratory was so remote as to not be a realistic possibility at all.
	
	
	A further observation should be made. There is an air of unreality about the applicant’s complaint that the unavailability of Ms Wisemantel for cross-examination by the applicant about her possible male fides towards him gives rise to a question about the integrity of the DNA evidence. The involvement of the officer was confined to the recovery of exhibits at the café (the wooden stake) and at Ocean Street (the butts and piece of glass) prior to her going off duty at 7.30am on the morning of the offences. This was well before the police had any inkling that it may have been the applicant who was the offender. How she could have, and why she would have, done anything at that early stage to manipulate or fabricate evidence against the applicant was never explained.
	
	
	I would refuse leave in respect of this ground as well.
	


Application for leave to appeal against sentence


	
	There are four grounds of appeal against sentence:
	


3   Her Honour erred by incorrectly applying the principles of Henry’s case in sentencing the applicant.

4   Her Honour erred by taking into account the use of violence and/or the use of a weapon as an additional aggravating feature.

5   The sentence imposed by her Honour for detain for advantage was manifestly excessive and as such her Honour erred.

6   Her Honour failed to have proper regard to the special circumstances of the applicant during sentence.

Ground 3 – incorrect application of Henry


	
	It was contended that the sentencing judge erred in her comparison of the case at hand with the typical case described in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 by finding the present case was more serious because the applicant was armed and used some level of violence. It was noted that the use of a weapon and violence are included in the features of the typical case in Henry. The submission was to the effect that her Honour had used the Henry guideline as a “starting point” and thereby erred by regarding those two features as operating in aggravation.
	
	
	This was clarified at the hearing of the application. The contention is that, given one of the factors in the typical case described in R v Henry is “limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof”, it amounted to double counting for the judge to regard this case as more serious because it included as an aggravating feature the actual use of violence.
	


Consideration


	
	The relevant passage of the sentencing remarks is:
	


“In relation to the aggravated robbery, in addition to the aggravating feature that forms an element of the offence, that is depriving the victim of her liberty, other features that tend to aggravate the offence are that a weapon was used, albeit a relatively makeshift weapon, the wooden stake. There was actual violence in the sense that the offender at times pushed the victim and pushed the wooden stake against her. There is no evidence of anything other than very limited planning, but some level of planning must have been involved because the offender was wearing a balaclava, or an item that had been made to serve the purpose of a balaclava. The deprivation of liberty that is the aggravating feature lasted for the period that the offender and the victim were at the café, possibly a period of about ten or fifteen minutes.

In sentencing the offender for the robbery matter, the Court has regard to the Henry guideline judgment. Many of the features that characterised the typical case described in Henry are present in this case. The offender was a young man with a relatively limited criminal history. The victim was a vulnerable person as she was in a relatively isolated location by herself, and from time to time went outside the premises so had no protection. There was a limited degree of planning. However, the duration of the robbery and the aggravating features to which I have referred make this a worse case than the typical case described in Henry.”


	
	Later, in the context of referring to comparative cases, her Honour added:
	


“[I]t must be borne in mind that in the case of Henry, the discount received by the typical offender that resulted in a sentence of four to five years reflects a significant discount for a plea of guilty from the starting point for sentence. In this case there is no discount to be applied for any plea of guilty.”


	
	Although R v Henry was directly related to an offence of robbery whilst armed, contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act, it has been held to be relevant to sentencing for an offences of aggravated robbery contrary to s 95: R v Tortell; R v Tsegay [2007] NSWCCA 313 at [14] (McClellan CJ at CL). See also Azzi v R [2008] NSWCCA 169 at [37] where Hall J referred to Henry being a “relevant reference point” in relation to sentencing for an offence against s 95.
	
	
	It would be clearly wrong to use a sentencing guideline as a starting point in the assessment of sentence. As was made clear by Spigelman CJ in R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; 55 NSWLR 252 at [113], a guideline is a matter to be “taken into account” only as a “check” or “sounding board” or “guide”.
	
	
	I cannot discern that her Honour erred by using the guideline as a “starting point”. It seems that she used it in the correct manner as described in R v Whyte. She concluded that the present case was worse than that described in Henry. Her Honour raised that as a possible finding with counsel for the applicant who responded in terms that it was difficult to argue with that proposition.
	
	
	I do not accept that there was any “double counting” involved in her Honour’s assessment of the robbery offence being more serious than that described as the typical case in R v Henry. There may have been some infelicity of expression in her Honour’s ex tempore judgment but the conclusion was one which counsel then appearing for the applicant accepted could be reached and, in my view, was appropriately reached. The applicant was a person with a not insignificant criminal history who was up and about at 4.00 am in the morning and who, whilst disguised with a balaclava and gloves and armed with a makeshift weapon, bailed up a cleaner over a fairly sustained period so as to break in to cash registers at a café and otherwise steal property worth a not inconsiderable sum of money. There was also, of course, the absence of the final feature of the typical case: a plea of guilty.
	
	
	There is no merit in this ground.
	


Ground 4 – error in taking into account use of violence and/or use of a weapon as aggravating features


	
	Under this ground it was submitted that her Honour had erred in another way by taking into account the use of violence as an aggravating feature. This was said to be erroneous because “the use of violence is an element of a s 95(1) offence where the aggravating feature is depriving the victim of their liberty”. The authority for that proposition was said to be R v Mauai [2005] NSWCCA 207. It was also said to be erroneous for her Honour to take into account the use of a weapon as an aggravating feature because, being the method used to restrict the liberty of the victim, that constituted corporal violence.
	


Consideration


	
	Section 95 is in the following terms:
	


“95 Same in circumstances of aggravation

(1) Whosoever robs, or assaults with intent to rob, any person, or steals any chattel, money, or valuable security, from the person of another, in circumstances of aggravation, shall be liable to imprisonment for twenty years.

(2) In this section,

""circumstances of aggravation"" means circumstances that (immediately before, or at the time of, or immediately after the robbery, assault or larceny) involve any one or more of the following:

(a) the alleged offender uses corporal violence on any person,

(b) the alleged offender intentionally or recklessly inflicts actual bodily harm on any person,

(c) the alleged offender deprives any person of his or her liberty.”


	
	In the present case the indictment averred the circumstance of aggravation as being the deprivation of the victim’s liberty. In a case where there was also the use of corporal violence, or the intentional or reckless infliction of actual bodily harm, those factors would operate in further aggravation. Accordingly, it was entirely correct for her Honour to have regard to the use of a weapon and actual violence as aggravating features in this case.
	
	
	It may be accepted that in R v Mauai it was held that a sentencing judge had erred by taking into account the actual or threatened use of violence as an aggravating feature in sentencing for a s 95(1) offence. This was said to be on the basis that the essence of robbery is that violence is done or threatened, citing R v Foster (1995) 78 A Crim R 517 at 522. However, in Hamze v R [2006] NSWCCA 36, after referring to R v Foster, Giles JA said:
	


“[26] Accordingly, while either threatened use of violence or actual use of violence is necessary, actual use of violence is not necessary. The victim may be threatened and thus submit to the theft; perhaps unusually, force may be used against the victim to effect the theft without a preceding threat, as by a striking from behind. Where the victim is threatened with the use of force, and the force is then used, there is more to the offence, which is more serious than if there is a threat of force alone. The present case is of this kind. The limitation in regard to an aggravating factor is not to be applied mechanically, but to give effect to the common law preclusion of double counting by increasing the offender’s punishment because of something already taken into account by virtue of the conviction (after trial or on a plea of guilty). It was sufficient for the applicant’s conviction that there was the threat of violence, and I do not think it correct to say that in this case actual violence was an ingredient of the offence for the purposes of the limitation in s 21A(2).

…

[28] However, it would be an error in this case to take threatened use of violence into account in aggravation of the offence. R v Street [2005] NSWCCA 139 at [32]-[34] appears to have turned on the judge’s failure in explanation, without necessarily accepting the submission that the matters in paras (b) and (c) were elements of the offence of armed robbery. In R v Ibrahimi [2005] NSWCCA 153 threatened violence had been taken into account as one of the matters under s 21A, and it was accepted at [18] that there was error (although with reference to “some threat of force or actual force” as the element of the offence). The judge’s reference to “actual violence against Mr Kalib” related only to count 1, and from “they” and “indeed” the preceding reference to the threatening use of violence related to both count 1 and the robbery offence on the Form 1. In my opinion, the judge did take into account as an aggravating factor the threatened use of violence, and was in error in doing so.”


	
	In the present case the judge did not take into account the “threatened use of violence” only the “actual violence”. Moreover the impact upon the assessment of sentence must have been extremely minimal given that her Honour immediately noted that what was involved was mere pushing of the victim. This ground is not established.
	


Ground 5 – sentence for count 2 (detain for advantage) is manifestly excessive


	
	It was submitted under this ground that the detain for advantage offence did not contain any significant additional criminality to the robbery offence. That was because the latter included as its aggravating feature that the applicant had deprived the victim of her liberty. The judge regarded this offence as “an unplanned extension of the robbery offence” (ROS 8.1).
	
	
	The applicant also relied upon the finding that there was no planning; the period of detention was not long; and that it could not be said that the emotional trauma suffered by the victim which the judge took into account was specific to this offence as distinct from the other offences. It was submitted that when factors relevant to the other offences were excluded from consideration, the gravity of the conduct of the applicant in relation to this particular offence should have been viewed as being less.
	
	
	In oral submissions it was contended that the detain for advantage offence “contributed no additional criminality”.
	


Consideration


	
	The sentencing judge’s assessment of the seriousness of the detain for advantage offence appears in the following passage of her remarks:
	


“In relation to the kidnapping offence, some of the factors that the Court needs to take into account when assessing the objective seriousness of the matter are the factors described in R v Newell [2004] NSWCCA 183 at [32], including the period of the detention, the circumstances of the detention, the person being detained and the purpose of the detention. In this case, the period of the detention was not overly long but nor was it a short period. It is difficult to estimate the period of the detention but somewhere in the vicinity of fifteen minutes to half an hour provides an approximate estimate of the duration of the detention.

The circumstances of the detention are that the offence of kidnapping in effect was an unplanned extension of the robbery offence. It appears that having become frustrated with his inability to remove the cash drawers and obtain goods that were readily portable, the offender decided that he would utilise the victim’s vehicle and he would thereby achieve the advantage of avoiding police detection, and having a means of conveying items from the premises. The victim’s circumstances are that she was vulnerable. Apart from being in a relatively isolated location in the early hours of the morning, she is a petite, older woman, and the offender is a very large and fit young man. As I have mentioned, it is my view that there was a very low level of planning associated with this offence.”


	
	There was additional criminality inherent in this offence. It is one thing to say that the victim was traumatised by the circumstances of the robbery at the café but such trauma was considerably exacerbated by her being taken away in her own car by a violent offender who threatened her and her family if she reported the matter to the police. Particular regard should be had to the fact that the victim had no way of knowing for how long she was going to be detained or where the applicant was intending to take her. Her trauma must have also been enhanced by the fact that the applicant indecently assaulted her on two occasions and she had no means of knowing what else was going to befall her.
	
	
	The applicant had the benefit of the judge ordering that the sentence for the detain for advantage offence be entirely subsumed within the sentence imposed for the other offences. This was a generous approach as some level of partial accumulation would have been appropriate to reflect the additional criminality: Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at [27] (Howie J).
	
	
	This ground must be rejected.
	


Ground 6 – failure to have regard to special circumstances


	
	Counsel for the applicant explained at the hearing of the application that by “special circumstances” he was not referring to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) but to the subjective circumstances of the offender.
	
	
	In written submissions counsel identified the relevant matters as being the applicant’s age; the period of delay and the extent of rehabilitation in the intervening period; that there had been two periods of custody with a significant intervening gap; and the fact that the applicant appeared to have a drug and alcohol problem at the time of the offending and had a mental illness including depression. The ground was further developed at the hearing in regard to the last matter. Reference was made to the report of Dr Furst which had been tendered to the sentencing judge. It was submitted that the applicant had “a significant history of mental illness” and there was reference in the report to him having been prescribed antipsychotic medication. The overall submission made by counsel for the applicant in relation to this issue was to the effect that greater weight should have been given by the judge to the content of the report.
	
	
	Otherwise it was submitted that the applicant was aged 19 at the time of the offence and 24 at the time of sentence and in the intervening period he had taken certain steps towards rehabilitation including having completed courses, qualifying as a gym instructor and he had family support. It was acknowledged that the judge had noted those matters but I take the submission to have been that they were deserving of greater weight.
	


Consideration


	
	Dr Richard Furst, forensic psychiatrist, interviewed the applicant in May 2013 and reviewed documents including reports by other mental health professionals who had had contact with the applicant when he was in custody from 22 August to 13 October 2008. The historical material set out in Dr Furst’s report included that the applicant had been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and had been prescribed antidepressant medications in his early teens. Drug use, particularly cannabis, had been a feature of his teenage years. Excessive consumption of alcohol had taken over in his latter teenage years and continued. When he was in custody in 2008 he had been prescribed a combination of antipsychotic medications.
	
	
	A clinical nurse consultant who examined the applicant on 25 August 2008 was of the opinion that he exhibited symptoms suggesting psychosis and major mood disorder. A psychiatrist who assessed him on 2 September 2008 thought he was suffering from a mild, residual drug induced hallucinosis. There was an increase in his antipsychotic medication in September and he was transferred to the Mental Health Screening Unit on 24 September after an apparent threatened suicide. However a psychiatric registrar did not identify any objective signs of psychosis. He was regarded as narcissistic with possible antisocial traits but treatment with antipsychotic medication was continued.
	
	
	Dr Furst expressed the opinion that the applicant had “early behavioural and attentional problems”, probably meeting the criteria for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Oppositional Defiant Disorder. He said that he probably met the criteria for Major Depressive Disorder on various occasions in the past. He agreed with a doctor who had seen the applicant in August 2008 that his reported auditory hallucinations over the past several years were atypical. There were few other outward signs of a serious psychotic illness such as schizophrenia.
	
	
	Dr Furst said that the applicant “may well have been experiencing auditory hallucinations at the time of the offences in question … as they were noted after his arrest by Dr Ian Korbel and other psychiatrists in custody. However, ‘the voices’ in question are more likely to be part of drug or alcohol-induced hallucinosis … rather than a feature of a more serious psychotic illness”.
	
	
	Dr Furst was of the opinion that the greatest clinical concern was the applicant’s history of heavy drinking over several years and substance abuse. Under the heading “psychiatric and psychological mitigating factors”, he wrote:
	


“In my opinion, the most salient influences on his mental state were his drinking, effects of alcohol on his mood and behaviour, and general instability of mood by virtue of either a depressive disorder and/or his borderline personality disorder. He was also hearing negative ‘voices’, as described above.

His judgment may well have been affected by those experiences and his tendency towards low mood, notwithstanding he maintains he was not responsible for the offences in question. He was probably suffering from some symptoms of depression in residual form, which can make people more impulsive and irritable, especially when intoxicated.”


	
	The sentencing judge referred to the report of Dr Furst and in particular to the various diagnoses that had been attributed to the applicant over the years. She also referred to the history of alcohol and drug abuse. Later in her remarks she said that there did not appear to be any evidence of the applicant being intoxicated or affected by mental illness at the time of the offences, having regard to the description of his behaviour which was not consistent with somebody who was highly intoxicated or in the throes of psychosis or hallucinations or anything of that nature. The judge concluded on this subject as follows:
	


“The offender, as I have mentioned, has not received any specific diagnosis of mental illness in any event, and for the reasons I have indicated it cannot be suggested, and indeed it has not been suggested, that the offences were causally related to any mental illness from which he suffered. The only matter that has been raised and that could properly be raised in that regard is that the offender has a background of difficulties in the nature of ADHD and depression and substance abuse which provide a context or background to his behaviour. Unfortunately, that does not place him in any special position whatsoever as is typically the case with persons who commit these types of offences.”


	
	I am not persuaded that any error is disclosed in the manner in which her Honour had regard to the psychiatric report. Nor am I persuaded that her Honour failed to have regard to any other features of the applicant’s subjective case, all of which were carefully, albeit succinctly, reviewed in the course of her reasons.
	


Conclusion


	
	The proposed grounds of appeal against conviction have no merit. Leave to appeal should be refused.
	
	
	In relation to the application for leave to appeal against sentence, I have found no merit in any of the grounds and would refuse leave.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1.   Leave to appeal against conviction refused.

2.   Leave to appeal against sentence refused.

		02 November 2015",2015-11-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2702540,R v Xi [2015] NSWSC 1575,"Judgment


	
	Yiqong Xi makes a release application under the Bail Act 2013 (NSW) as amended in 2014. He stands charged with 6 offences under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (Drug Act) and one offence of participating in a criminal group under s 93T(1A) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The offences allegedly took place between November 2014 and May 2015. Three of the offences under the Drug Act involve the alleged supply of a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. The amounts relating to those charges are approximately 1 kg, 2 kg and 4 kg respectively. There are two further charges of supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (998 and 317 grams respectively).
	
	
	Because the applicant is charged with offences involving the commercial supply of drugs, the 2014 amendments to the Bail Act mean that he is required to show cause why his detention is not justified: see sections 16A and 16B(1)(f) Bail Act.
	
	
	In DPP v Tikomaimaleya [2015] NSWCA 83, the Court of Appeal held that the question of whether an applicant has shown cause under s 16A as to why his or her detention is not justified is to be considered separately from a consideration of bail concerns and unacceptable risk under ss 17-19. The Court of Appeal held at [20] that the show cause requirement should be considered first and at [25] that the two tests should not be conflated. The Court acknowledged at [24] that “matters that are relevant to the unacceptable risk test will also be relevant to the show cause test and that, if there is nothing else that appears to the bail authority to be relevant to either test, the consideration of the show cause requirement will, if resolved in favour of the accused person, necessarily resolve the unacceptable risk test in his or her favour as well.”
	
	
	However, that last proposition is not universally true and in the case of Mawad [2015] NSWCCA 227 a majority of the Court of Criminal Appeal (Gleeson JA and Beech-Jones J; Adams J dissenting) found (at [44]) that the accused had shown cause but went on (at [48]) to resolve the unacceptable risk test against him. See also DPP v Botswain [2015] NSWCCA 185 at [26] and [29] (RA Hulme J).
	
	
	What is clear is that satisfaction of the unacceptable risk test is not sufficient (of itself) to satisfy the requirement in s 16A if for no other reason than that the show cause issue is to be considered in the light of “all of the evidence or information the bail authority considers credible or trustworthy in the circumstances (s 31(1)) and not just by a consideration of those matters exhaustively listed in s 18 required to be considered for the unacceptable risk assessment”: DPP v Tikomaimaleya at [25].
	
	
	In JM v R [2015] NSWSC 978 Garling J undertook a careful and helpful analysis of the relevant provisions and I adopt his Honour’s observations in that case and in particular the comments at [33]-[43] regarding principles that remain of general application.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant puts forward a combination of factors, including the lengthy delay in obtaining a trial date, in arguing that the applicant has shown cause why his detention is not justified. He relies on the same matters to contend that bail should be granted in spite of bail concerns that have been raised by the prosecutor. While taking care not to conflate the two questions that arise under the Bail Act, I will now set out in general terms the matters relevant to the applicant’s release application.
	


Delay


	
	The applicant was taken into custody on his arrest on 25 May 2015 and has been incarcerated since that time. The case is still before the Local Court and subject to an order that the brief of evidence be served by the prosecution on or before 5 November 2015. It appears that the brief will not be served by that time, and that the police will not comply with the brief service orders. However a letter from the officer in charge of the police investigation suggests that the outstanding parts of the brief will “be served prior to December 2015” and that “three quarters of the brief” has already been served.
	
	
	In view of what is known of the lists in the courts in which the committal proceedings and trial will take place, it is unlikely that the applicant will receive a trial date before the second half of 2016. If bail is refused, the applicant will spend well in excess of one year in custody pending the resolution of these criminal proceedings. It may be that the remand period will approach 18 months or 2 years.
	
	
	That is a significant delay and one which bears upon the question of whether the applicant has shown cause pursuant to section 16A. Nothing in the many reforms to the bail legislation since 2001 changes the force of the remarks of Sperling J in Cain (2001) 121 A Crim R 365:
	


“The prospect that a private citizen who has not been convicted of any offence might be imprisoned for as long as two years pending trial is, absent exceptional circumstances, not consistent with modern concepts of civil rights”.


	
	See also his Honour’s comments in Iskandar [2001] NSWSC 7; 120 A Crim R 302.
	
	
	The delay is also a relevant consideration if I come to consider the bail concerns raised by the Crown and whether those concerns are “unacceptable risks” for the purpose of s 19 of the Bail Act. The length of time that an applicant for bail is to spend in custody is a matter specifically referred to in the exhaustive list of factors to be considered in deciding whether any bail concern identified under s 17 constitutes an unacceptable risk under s 19: see section 18(1)(h) Bail Act.
	


The applicant’s disabled son


	
	A significant matter raised on behalf of the applicant concerns the fact that he has a seven-year-old son [Child’s name - Redacted] who suffers from severe disabilities resulting from a medical condition known as spastic dystonic quadriplegia cerebral palsy. A body of evidence concerning this matter was tendered at the bail hearing. He also suffers from epilepsy and it seems an intellectual disability. The applicant’s father (Zhongyuan Xi) provided an affidavit in which he indicated that the applicant was the “almost exclusive” carer for [Child’s name - Redacted]. Mr Xi also deposed that the child’s mother “packed up and left for China almost 2 years ago”. Before she left she made no secret of the fact that she was not coping with the mounting pressure of looking after [Child’s name - Redacted]. There is another son [Child’s name - Redacted] who was diagnosed with autism. The applicant’s wife took [Child’s name - Redacted], but not [Child’s name - Redacted], with her when she left for China.
	
	
	The applicant’s father says that the child, in spite of his severe disability, recognises his father and is suffering as a result of his absence. For example, he used to eat very well when fed by the applicant. However he has lost his appetite since the applicant was taken into custody. The applicant’s parents are caring full time for [Child’s name - Redacted]. They have had some medical issues of their own. The father had a stroke in 2006 and has polyps in his gallbladder and colon. The mother has had a series of medical conditions including hypertension, fainting and palpitations. Medical reports from a Dr Lin describe the applicant as the main carer for his parents. Neither of the applicant’s parents has a driver’s licence. This makes it difficult to transport [Child’s name - Redacted] to the many medical appointments that he is required to attend. Mr Xi says that they have significant problems bathing [Child’s name - Redacted] and have to do this together whereas the applicant was able to bathe the child without difficulty on his own. This was a task always undertaken by the applicant prior to his incarceration.
	
	
	The medical records, doctor’s reports and Mr Xi’s affidavit speak eloquently to the fact of the condition, the difficulties which have attended its treatment and the extremely onerous circumstances thrust upon the applicant’s parents since the applicant was arrested.
	
	
	On the hearing of the bail application, the child was present in court in a purpose-built wheelchair. This was presumably done to demonstrate the nature and extent of his disability. This was hardly necessary given the extent of the documentation setting out the detail of his medical condition and his grand-father’s affidavit. I trust that bringing [Child’s name - Redacted] to the court had no harmful effect on him. I was able to observe that the child is greatly loved by his grandparents. When, at times, he appeared to be in distress, his grandfather was able to settle him, and calm him, in the gentlest way. The child is fortunate to have such loving and devoted grandparents.
	
	
	There are occasions when it is necessary for a tribunal of fact to observe the nature of an injury or disability. This happens, often enough, in personal injury and criminal cases where the nature and extent of the injury or disability is a fact in issue. When this is necessary, the appropriate course is to make it clear and explicit that a demonstration is taking place. This enables a proper record to be kept, ensures procedural fairness and dispels the appearance that an attempt is being made to engender sympathy in the tribunal.
	
	
	The police facts sheet indicated that the applicant travelled to China recently (relative to the date of the charge). This was not challenged and there is no evidence as to whether the child went to China and, if not, who was looking after him during that time. Nor is it clear who was taking care of the child when, on various occasions during late 2014 and early 2015, the applicant was subject to police surveillance.
	
	
	However, there is no doubt that the disability suffered by the child is an extreme one and I accept the evidence of the applicant’s father as to the difficulties surrounding the care of the child in the applicant’s absence. The child would be far better off if his father were not in custody and if the applicant was available to share what is undoubtedly a heavy burden of caring for a child with such a severe disability.
	
	
	In R v Mawad, Beech-Jones J (with whom Gleeson JA agreed) concluded that cause had been shown because of the “particular vulnerability of his family in [the applicant’s] absence”. However, bail was refused because the majority considered there to be unacceptable risks of further offending (see para [48]). Adams J (dissenting in the outcome) would have refused the detention application and granted bail largely for the reasons that I gave in granting a release application while sitting in the bail court: see R v Mawad [2015] NSWSC 1237. The family circumstances in the present case are easily as compelling as those that existed in R v Mawad.
	


The strength of the prosecution case


	
	A second factor urged upon me by counsel for the applicant concerned an assessment of the strength of the prosecution case. In that regard the prosecution tendered as part of exhibit A an 18 page statement of facts. I accept the applicant’s submission that the extent of the applicant’s involvement is not made entirely clear by that statement of facts. However, it is clear (and appears not to be disputed) that he was present from time to time with other persons allegedly involved in the drug transactions.
	
	
	On 27 November 2014, the applicant was observed to drive two other accused men to and from a location where they met with an undercover operative and exchanged a bag containing around 1kg of “ice” for $170,000.
	
	
	In the course of a number of days in January 2015, negotiations were taking place between (at least) two co-accused men and undercover officers concerning the supply of 10kg for $1.6 million. During the course of those discussions, one of the apparent principals was seen at the applicant’s home. On 16 January 2015, the co-accused were shown $1.6 million of “pre-recorded buy money” and there was discussion of the possible delivery of the drugs in 5 x 2kg lots. On that day the applicant was seen to carry a bag to a meeting with the co-accused at premises in Bankstown and to leave without the bag. Some time later he returned and left with the bag. The prosecution will ask the jury to infer that he had delivered 2kg of Ice to the co-accused for the purpose of the proposed transaction. It seems those supplying the drugs withdrew from the arrangement and that no actual supplies took place.
	
	
	After his arrest, the applicant’s bedroom was searched. There was a backpack containing 1kg of methylamphetamine found in a heat sealed foodsaver bag. There were also electronic scales, a heat sealing device and a “cream wafer tin” said to be “identical” to a tin that had been used back in November 2014 to transport 25 grams of “Ice” provided to a “civilian participant” by a co-accused at the beginning of the series of transactions. Certain pages of the 24-25 May 2014 edition of the Australian Chinese Daily were found – ie pages 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18. On the same day, a search of premises in Balmain uncovered 317.6 grams located in a heat sealed food-saver bag along with pages 9 and 12 of the 24-25 May 2014 edition of the Australian Chinese Daily. The prosecution will ask the tribunal of fact to draw an inference that the applicant supplied the drugs found at Balmain.
	
	
	Mr Lange mounted an argument that it may be possible to raise what is sometimes referred to as a “Carey defence”: see, for example, Carey (1990) 20 NSWLR 292; R v Frazer [2002] NSWCCA 59; 128 A Crim R 89. In those cases, it was held that holding drugs with the intention of returning the drugs to their true owner did not meet the description of “supply”. I do not understand the applicant ever to have suggested that this was his intention and there is no evidence in the material before me to give rise to such an inference. Even allowing for the onus and burden of proof, these submissions strained credulity. While I accept that there may be a lively issue as to the precise role of the applicant and the extent of his knowledge, I do not accept that the factual material before me gives rise to an argument that the applicant was no more than an innocent holding onto drugs to return to the true owner.
	
	
	However, the fact remains that the applicant is presumed to be innocent and that none of the provisions in the Bail Act does violence to that fundamental premise at the cornerstone of the criminal justice system: see for example JM v R [2015] NSWSC 978 (Garling J) at [34].
	
	
	I accept that the statement of facts may be thought to show that the applicant’s involvement was such that arguments could be raised as to the state of his knowledge. However, my assessment of the limited material available is that the prosecution case is a strong one. This is especially so in relation to the drugs found in his room (1 kg) and the drugs found at the premises of Nguyen in Balmain (317.6 grams). It is not as strong in relation to the actual supply (998g) on 27 November 2014 and the proposed supplies totalling 10 kg discussed by the principals between December 2014 and January 2015. However, even in those instances where the prosecution case is less compelling, it could not be described as weak.
	


Mitigation of the risk of non-appearance


	
	The applicant concedes that the seriousness of the charges, strength of the case and the applicant’s connection to China give rise to concerns that he will not appear. It is also accepted that this is a very relevant consideration in determining the show cause issue. However, it is contended that a number of factors working together make it likely that he will appear and that this, in combination with the other factors, support the proposition that he has shown cause why his detention is not justified. Further, it is submitted that the strength of the bail conditions that can be imposed mitigate the risk of non-appearance and that (for the purpose of s 19) it is not an unacceptable risk.
	
	
	I re-iterate that in dealing with this matter in this order, I am not falling foul of the Court of Appeal’s entreaty that the two tests (show cause under s 16A and unacceptable risk under s 19) not be conflated. An assessment of the likelihood of appearance must form an important part of an assessment as to whether or not an applicant has shown cause why the detention is not justified.
	
	
	The applicant contends that he has strong ties to Australia and specifically refers to the fact that his disabled son and his parents are resident in Australia. The son is under the care of specialist doctors in Australia and is enrolled in a special school designed to meet his needs.
	
	
	Mr Lange submitted that bail conditions could meet the concerns that the applicant may take flight. Those conditions include the surrender of his passport, a curfew condition amounting to house arrest subject to various exceptions, daily reporting conditions, self-surety (without security) of $15,000 and a surety by way of $150,000 cash deposit by an acceptable person.
	


Electronic monitoring


	
	In addition to those conditions, the applicant puts forward the somewhat novel proposition that he be subject to electronic monitoring. The condition proposed was that:
	


“Prior to being admitted to bail, the applicant is to be fitted with an electronic monitoring system.”


	
	For reasons that I will identify, that is not an available condition under the terms of the Bail Act. However, that is not to say that the concept of electronic monitoring might not, in an appropriate case, form part of the conditions that mitigate the risk of flight.
	
	
	Such technology is not new to this court. Electronic monitoring is often used as part of a court imposed supervision order for serious sex and violent offenders: see Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) and, for example, State of New South Wales v Anderson [2015] NSWSC 1515 at [40] and [43]. However the nature of the jurisdiction under the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act is very different to the jurisdiction exercised under the Bail Act. Further, in the high risk offender cases, the State is the moving party and undertakes the setting up and monitoring of the electronic monitoring equipment. Accordingly, there is no issue surrounding the imposition of conditions on third parties. The Bail Act makes various specific provisions as to the nature of conditions that can be imposed.
	
	
	Nevertheless, under the Bail Act 1978 (NSW), this Court has made bail conditional upon the applicant being subject to electronic monitoring. In R v Medich [2010] NSWSC 1488, Price J included the following conditions:
	


“(n) He is to submit to electronic monitoring to be undertaken by Abakus ElmoTech Pty Limited monitoring device to be fitted by the authorised representative of Abakus ElmoTech Pty Limited prior to accused being released from custody.

(o) Abakus ElmoTech is to notify any mobile number or electronic email address nominated by the Office of the DPP of any breaches of bail conditions (c) and (e).”


	
	Conditions (c) and (e) included a curfew to his home address and a requirement that he stay within certain geographical boundaries by reference to a map annexed to the conditions.
	
	
	Counsel was unable to take me to any case under the 2013 Act where electronic monitoring was imposed. The restrictions on the imposition of bail conditions in the 1978 Act (see ss 36-37 as they existed in 2010 when R v Medich was decided) are in different terms to those that exist under the current legislation (see ss 20A, 23-30). However, with one exception, there is no prohibition in either statute on the imposition of the kind of condition fashioned by Price J in R v Medich. The one exception is that s 29 of the current Act would not permit the requirement for electronic monitoring to be fitted prior to release. Section 29 permits four specified requirements (“and no other requirements”) to be imposed as pre-release requirements. I would also be reluctant to impose a condition such as (o) on a third party and doubt whether such a condition is available under the Act.
	
	
	I was referred to the comments of Beech-Jones J in R v Ebrahimi [2015] NSWSC 335:
	


“31. An unusual aspect of this application is that the applicant puts forward, as a possible bail condition, his preparedness to not only comply with a system of electronic monitoring but to supply that system and meet its cost. Evidence was received from Mr Paul Keen. Mr Keen is a director of a company that is the distributor for an electronic monitoring and tracking system which is specifically designed for the criminal justice system. He explained in some detail the use of the systems in jurisdictions outside of New South Wales. He stated that, if bail was granted and the system was implemented, it would involve one of the representatives of his company attending at the gaol from which the applicant would be released and placing on his ankle or wrist a watch-like device. Under this system the applicant would also be required to carry a device that was effectively a modified mobile phone.

32. Mr Keen explained that the monitoring system can be calibrated so as to set off an alarm if the applicant either moved outside a specified inclusion zone or moved into a specified exclusion zone. Mr Keen explained that, if a so-called violation event occurred, then an electronic message would be automatically generated and sent to an officer of his company as well as any police officer who was listed with this company as responsible for the supervision of the applicant's bail. It was apparent from Mr Keen's evidence that a person who has a monitoring device can easily remove it. However, any attempt to do so or to tamper with the device generates a message of the kind that I just referred to. One potential technical limitation of the device is that the system of monitoring is dependent upon the adequacy of the local mobile phone coverage and GPS satellite system.

33. The Crown tendered a letter from an Assistant Commissioner of Police. The Assistant Commissioner expressed some concerns about the use of untested monitoring devices in bail applications. One matter noted was the lack of any legislative scheme to enable this to occur. The legal context in which this is being considered is, as I have stated, the Bail Act. The Bail Act does not authorise the Court to impose obligations on third parties. However, it is not unknown in bail applications that the Court will make its own assessment as to the willingness and capacity of some third parties to provide supervision of persons on bail. The most obvious example of this is residential rehabilitation services. Otherwise there is nothing in the Bail Act that precludes the Court from concluding, in a particular case, that persons providing electronic monitoring systems are both honest and have the capacity to provide some degree of comfort as to the whereabouts of an applicant for bail and their compliance with bail conditions.

34. In this case, the approach I take is that the electronic monitoring proposal put forward by the applicant mitigates the risk of him absconding. However, it certainly does not eliminate it. If a person on bail was determined to abscond and had the means to arrange it, then the delay between the notification of any violation event as referred to by Mr Keen and action being taken by the relevant members of the police force to apprehend them is such that they might be able to leave the jurisdiction.”


	
	In the present case (like R v Ebrahimi) evidence was provided by Mr Paul Keen. Mr Keen was previously the Director of Abakus, the company nominated to conduct the electronic monitoring in the case of R v Medich. Mr Keen explained that the cost to the applicant to have the system installed for a 12 month period is $18,000 and explained the way in which the system is installed and the method of monitoring. He explained the nature of the technology available to ensure that a person such as the applicant remains within certain geographical zones. If the applicant was to move outside of those zones, or if he was (for example) to approach within a certain distance of an international point of departure, the electronic tracking system would notify the “central monitoring system” for investigation. If a breach occurs a nominated police officer will be informed. The police would also receive a daily report of the person’s movement and compliance in the 24 hour period.
	
	
	Initially, counsel suggested that such electronic monitoring would be or could be a pre-release requirement. This submission is contrary to the limitations in s 29 Bail Act (which articulate four specific conditions that may be imposed as pre-release requirements). The section does not contemplate the attachment of an electronic monitor. Further, at a practical level, it is difficult to see how any order made by a bail authority could require a corrective services facility to allow for such equipment to be brought into a gaol or police station prior to release. Mr Keen’s affidavit suggests that this can be done by pre-arrangement and that was what was required in the case of Medich.
	
	
	I agree with the observations of Beech-Jones in R v Ebrahimi. It is open to the Court to accept the integrity of Mr Keen and the intentions of the company. It would certainly do great harm to Mr Keen’s business model if the company failed to notify the police if a breach occurred. Mr Keen says that “every client monitored by my company as part of their bail conditions has appeared in Court as required.” However, there is no evidence as to how many such clients there have been or the precise terms of the conditions that were imposed in those cases. I accept that conditions might be fashioned as part of a broader set of conditions calculated to ensure that the applicant’s risk of flight is ameliorated to as great a degree as possible.
	
	
	Even allowing for the fact that electronic monitoring does not eliminate the risk of flight, I remind myself that no grant of bail is risk free: Williamson v DPP (2001) 1 Qd R 99; Dale v DPP [2009] VSCA 212; Application of Haidy [2004] VSC 247 and R v Lago [2014] NSWSC 660.
	


Has the applicant shown cause why his detention is not justified?


	
	I agreed with the observation of Garling J in JM v R at [40] that “the inclusion of a requirement to show cause does not mean that the legislature has declared an intention that bail will not ordinarily or normally be granted where a show cause requirement exists”. Nevertheless, the cases that have been decided by appellate courts show that the show cause requirement establishes a significant hurdle to an applicant seeking bail when s 16A is engaged.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the medical condition, severe disabilities and special needs of the applicant’s son, taken in combination with the other matters to which reference has been made, satisfies the show cause requirement. While [Child’s name - Redacted]’s grandparents are doing their best, it is clear that they are struggling and that the applicant is the person in the best position to care for the child.
	
	
	In reaching the conclusion that the applicant has shown cause, I have taken into account the strength of the Crown case, the inevitability of a substantial full-time gaol sentence if any of the charges are established and risks that the prosecution has identified in granting the applicant bail.
	


Is there an unacceptable risk that the applicant will fail to appear or commit serious offences?


	
	The prosecutor has only identified one bail concern under s 17, namely the risk that the applicant will fail to appear. The prosecutor submits that this is an unacceptable risk for the purpose of the application of s 19. This submission was based on the seriousness of the charges, the strength of the prosecution case and the high likelihood of a gaol sentence if the applicant is convicted. This combination of factors provides a great incentive for the applicant to flee. Further, the applicant has family ties in China and one of his sons, and his estranged wife, are living in that country.
	
	
	The prosecutor did not submit that any of the other bail concerns identified in s 17 arose or that there was an unacceptable risk of those matters for the purpose of s 19. That is, it was not submitted that there was an unacceptable risk that the applicant would commit a serious offence, endanger the safety of victims, individuals or the community or interfere with witnesses or evidence.
	
	
	Nevertheless, because of the strength of the case indicating the applicant’s association with the principals of what appears to be an organised criminal syndicate involved in substantial drug supply, I have concluded that there may be a bail concern under s 17 concerning the risk that the applicant will commit serious offences.
	
	
	I have considered the following matters pursuant to s 18(1):
	



	
	The accused has no criminal history, is from a supportive family and has ties to the Sydney community. He also has ties to China. As the officer in charge of the police investigation contends, this gives rise to risk of flight.
	
	
	The offences are extremely serious and involve the distribution of a notoriously dangerous drug.
	
	
	The Crown case, in relation to some of the charges, is strong.
	
	
	The applicant has no history of violence.
	
	
	The applicant has not previously been on bail or breached bail.
	
	
	There is no history of non-compliance with any form of conditional liberty.
	
	
	The facts of the present offences suggest the accused has criminal associations although the extent of those associations is not known. I gather the co-accused men are in custody but it is likely that others remain in the community.
	
	
	The accused is likely to spend in excess of 1 year and possibly 18 months to 2 years in custody if bail is refused.
	
	
	A custodial sentence is extremely likely, perhaps inevitable, if the applicant is convicted.
	
	
	The applicant is presumed to be innocent and has not been convicted.
	
	
	The applicant has no special vulnerability of the kind contemplated by s 18(1)(k).
	
	
	The applicant has a need to be at liberty to prepare for his defence although this need is no greater than all applicants charged with serious offences.
	
	
	The applicant has a lawful need to be at liberty to care for his severely disabled son.
	
	
	There is no evidence of any conduct by the applicant towards any victim of the crimes with which he stands accused.
	
	
	There is no evidence of the attitude of any victim of the offence. I have considered the views of the officer in charge, insofar as they are relevant: see Mawad at [34]-[39].
	
	
	The bail conditions that may reasonably be imposed are stringent and comprehensive and mitigate to a substantial degree the risk of flight.
	



	
	Having considered all of those matters, which obviously pull in different directions, I have concluded that the bail concerns that I identify under s 17 (the risk of non-appearance and the risk of the commission of serious offences) are not unacceptable risks for the purpose of s 19.

		26 October 2015",2015-10-25 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2702550,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Koh [2015] NSWLC 24,"Judgment


	
	The defendant is before the court to be sentenced on two charges of Dealing with Property suspected of being the Proceeds of Crime. Each charge is brought pursuant to section 193C (1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for each offence is imprisonment for two years or a penalty of $5500 or both. Each offence is a Table 2 offence for the purpose of section 258 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The charges are to be dealt with summarily before the Local Court. The defendant entered a plea of guilty to each charge on 13 October 2015.
	
	
	The facts are somewhat convoluted. They have a sense of being less than the full narrative. Nonetheless for the purpose of this sentencing exercise the Court will endeavour to reduce them to a simpler account.
	
	
	The defendant is a Singapore national. The facts assert he arrived in Australia on 27 April 2015. It is clear he did so in order to facilitate criminal conduct within New South Wales. He signed the usual declaration to the effect that he did not have more than $10,000 in Australian dollar value on his person. That assertion may or may not have been true.
	
	
	Within 8 days of arrival he deposited $299,650 in cash in a so called ""safe keeping account"" at Star City Casino. This type of account is essentially a safety deposit box secured within the casino. The following day he deposited $703,000 in cash into the same safety deposit box. Although not clear as to when and in what manner records at the Casino indicated some gambling activity on the part of the defendant and withdrawal of a significant portion of cash by him. Police were contacted, presumably by the Casino, and they attended the Casino on 7 May 2015 at 3.00 p.m.
	
	
	The defendant was residing in a hotel next door to the Casino. Within half an hour police attended his hotel room. The defendant told police that the $700,000 deposit came from his Aunt Jin Xiu Sun in Newcastle, was the proceeds of a brothel business and was intended to be given to her ex-husband living in China. He said that in February/March 2015 he had been asked by his ""aunt"" to come and pick up luggage containing the money and put it into safekeeping. He asserted that he attended his aunt's premises, she was not home, he entered the premises through an unlocked back door, found a suitcase in his aunt's bedroom, and took a suitcase he found and left. He said he did not look inside the suitcase.
	
	
	He says that after depositing the contents of the suitcase, $703,000, he subsequently transferred $100,000 to his uncle in China using a money remitter in Chinatown. The defendant gave no explanation for the source of the $299,650. It is implicit in the plea that he knew the cash money was the proceeds of criminal activity. He gave police permission to obtaining the remaining moneys in the safety deposit at Star City Casino. Police removed $600,230 in cash. There is no explanation in the facts for the movement of over $400,000. Police recovered a receipt for the removal of $200,000 on 6 May. In excess of $200,000 appears to be unaccounted for to any plausible detail.
	
	
	Subsequent inquiries by police establish that the ""uncle"" in China does not exist. Contact with the purported source of the $703,000 and her partner, a Gordon Bennett establish that the defendant visited their premises in Newcastle on 28 and 29 March 2015. These are dates that pre-date his arrival in Australia. It is assumed, subject to evidence to the contrary, that where the statement of facts says March it means April. The essence of inquiries of Mr Bennett and Ms Sun establish the defendant is not related to Ms Sun. She denied being the source of $703,000. Whether that is true in fact is unknown.
	
	
	In the course of sentencing proceedings a lengthy affidavit under the hand of a Police Officer Cook was tendered to the Court. The basis of the tender is section 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Sentencing Act). This provision deals with the imposition of a lesser sentence for an offender who provides assistance to authorities.
	
	
	Without disclosing greater detail of the contents of the affidavit it discloses that on the basis of information provided by the defendant some $1.59 million in tainted money has been confiscated and two persons charged with money laundering type offences. The affidavit also asserts the defendant actively participated in controlled conduct on behalf of police that led to the arrest and prosecution of the two persons charged. It is not known to this court whether either or both of the persons in question have been convicted of any offence. I will return to the vexed issue of assistance to authorities shortly.
	
	
	The defendant comes before the Court as a Singapore national. His family remain in Singapore. He is currently detained in Australia on a criminal justice visa. He has no prior record in the Commonwealth. No details of any criminal record elsewhere have been placed before the Court. In that context he is to be sentenced as a first offender and is entitled to rely on previous good character to mitigate the severity of the sentence.
	
	
	Little is known about the offender other than his nationality and the assertion that is expressed within the report of Mr Borenstein dated 7 October 2015. The personal information therein is as one might expect, largely provided by the offender himself. Within that report the defendant asserts that he is employed within the motor vehicle import business and that it was his ""boss"" who sent him to Australia to collect money and send it to China. He says his principle reason for being in Australia was to source the purchase of motor vehicles. There has been no evidence put before this Court to support this assertion. Given the defendant's conduct and intention to facilitate the laundering of a considerable amount of cash money the product of criminal activity within the community it is difficult and certainly unwise to accept that he came to Australia with any legitimate business activity in mind.
	
	
	The plea of guilty entered by the defendant is to be regarded as a plea at close to the first available opportunity. Mindful of the fact that he could have indicated a plea to both charges when first charged in June 2015 and having regard to the principles of general application point 9 set out in the decision of R v Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32], there will be a minor adjustment to the commonly applied discount for a plea of guilty at the first available opportunity. The discount will be 22.5%.
	
	
	The discount for assistance to authorities is more problematic. The affidavit from Officer Cook describes the defendant's willing involvement in controlled transactions. As indicated, the offender's role facilitated the arrest and charging of two persons and the confiscation of some $1.59 million dollars in moneys believed to be tainted. It is not known as at the date of sentencing what future role, if any the offender will need to play or is prepared to undertake in terms of prosecutions. Nonetheless where there is a ""promise"" of future assistance. Section 23(4) requires the court to quantify the discount in the exercise of its discretion. Apart from the statutory recognition set out in s 23 of the Sentencing Act the principles behind the adjustment of a sentence on the basis of assistance to authorities is well settled.
	
	
	In R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 at 252-253 the court observed:
	


It is clearly in the public interest that offenders should be encouraged to supply information to the authorities which will assist them to bring other offenders to justice, and to give evidence against those other offenders in relation to whom they have given such information. In order to ensure that such encouragement is given, the appropriate reward for providing assistance should be granted whatever the offender's motive may have been in giving it, be it genuine remorse (or contrition) or simply self-interest.

… The information which he gives must be such as could significantly assist the authorities. The information must, of course, be true….


	
	There is a reasonable inference to be drawn on the affidavit tendered in these proceedings that the information provided to the authorities is true. The confiscation of such a significant sum of money and the charging of two persons infers that but for the offenders willingness to assist these two arrests and the confiscation of a large sum of money would not have occurred. The Court is prepared, despite the unpredictability as to whether he will be needed to give evidence or is willing to give evidence, to give recognition to the purpose of s 23(4) by further discount to the sentence otherwise appropriate to each charge.
	
	
	This does not mean that each sentence is to be reduced to the point where it becomes unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offending or based on the inherent likelihood the offender will be deported and thereby becomes an outcome of convenience intended to facilitate deportation as opposed to reflecting the seriousness of the offending. What happens to the offender at the culmination of these proceedings is a matter for federal authorities. It is not determinative in the resolution of the charges before this Court.
	
	
	In R v M [2005] NSWCCA 224 at [21]-[22] the approach in determining the level of discount is set out and noted. In R v Holland [2011] NSWCCA 65 at [42] the Court noted that the combined discount should not exceed 50% other than in exceptional circumstances. These proceedings do not fall within that categorisation. It is the view of the Court that the combined discount should not exceed 40%. The question is invariably posited- 40% of what. The resolution of this issue involves not just the quantification of the sentence but also the identification of the type of sentence the court considers commensurate with the objective seriousness of the conduct within the commission of the offence and those provisions of section 21A (2) and (3) of the Sentencing Act that aggravate or mitigate the conduct.
	
	
	Mr Ang of counsel, who assisted the offender on sentence in the fine traditions of the Bar through the Duty Barrister scheme, urged the Court to deal with the charges on the basis of a suspended sentence. Mr Ang drew the court's attention to the particular subjective circumstances of the offender. He is currently at large within the community on a criminal justice visa. It is beyond speculation that he will be deported to Singapore in the not too distant future. The offender asserts his life and that of his family will be in jeopardy if the assistance he has provided becomes known to those who controlled his part in the money laundering enterprise. That may or may not be so.
	
	
	The overall thrust of arguments in favour of the offender being dealt with by way of a suspended sentence suggests that the defendant be regarded as different from citizens of Australia on a basis that he will suffer the consequences of imprisonment more significantly than others because it will entail separation from his family as opposed to available access to a member of the wider community and that this in some way should be taken into account as justification for not imposing a sentence of full time imprisonment. I acknowledge that reality but do not accept it as a reason why there should be a differing approach on sentence to that taken in relation to ordinary members of the community.
	
	
	Ms Dewhurst for the Director has helpfully provided the Court with the decision in Chi Sun Tsui v R (1985) 1 NSWLR 308. The decision is authority for a number of principles but for the purpose of these proceedings, confirmation of the view that sentencing of an offender who may be deported is to be undertaken in a manner no different from that taken in respect of a citizen of Australia and that the relationship between immigration laws and the criminal justice system are two distinct environments where the issue of deportation can have no part to play in respect of sentencing for laws intended to protect the community.
	
	
	Returning to subjective factors there are areas of vagueness in the offender's narrative that are not capable of resolution within these proceedings. Given the level of dishonesty associated with the offender's conduct it would be an unwise court that gave undue emphasis to what might be factual circumstances without better evidence being placed before it. Speculation on subjective issues postulated by the person who has the most to gain from their unexplored acceptance is problematic. This is particularly so when it is clear the defendant's version of his involvement is contradicted to an extent by other persons who may or may not have been engaged in the criminal enterprise.
	
	
	It is important also not to lose sight of the fact that there was a significant degree of planning involved in the defendant's criminal conduct. This attracts a finding of aggravation by reason of s 21A(2)(n). Laundering of ill-gotten gains is serious criminal offending behaviour. The amount of money involved raises the objective seriousness of the conduct. General deterrence is of significant importance. The offender may be able to rely on his prior good character and a degree of accepted remorse and he may have reasonable prospects of rehabilitation however those mitigating factors together with the discount for the plea and assistance do not convince this court that it is appropriate to adopt at face value Mr Ang's suggestion that the offender be given a suspended sentence.
	
	
	Counsel's submission is predicated on an acceptance that the offender's conduct passes beyond the point highlighted in s 5 of the Sentencing Act whereby there is no appropriate alternative than the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment. That threshold view is correct. The nature of the conduct, its capacity to facilitate and maintain criminal offending on a significant scale to the detriment of the community and the amount of money involved all point towards a sentence of condign punishment.
	
	
	In ordinary circumstances the objective seriousness of the conduct and high level of moral culpability that must be found to exist when a foreign national travels to this country in order to carry out criminal activities to the potential benefit of other criminals and to the detriment of Australian law and the Australian community points towards a penalty towards the upper end of the available sentencing options. The maximum penalty in relation to each offence of 2 years imprisonment and/or a fine is the marker set by Parliament in terms of the objective seriousness of the individual offences. Absent the combined discount for the utilitarian value of the plea and assistance to authorities this Court would have been inclined to impose a sentence close to the statutory maximum.
	
	
	Mindful however of the summary disposition of the offences a sentence for each after application of the discount of 40% must logically be significantly less, but not to the extent of being unreasonably disproportionate. Section 23(3) is a clear direction so far as this proposition is concerned.
	
	
	The appropriate sentence for the offence involving the $703,000 would have been 20 months imprisonment before application of the discount. The appropriate sentence for the offence second in time involving $299,650 would have been 15 months. After application of the discount of 40% the head sentences become ones of 12 months and 9 months respectively. At this point in the 3 step process identified in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 I return to the suggestion the sentences should be suspended. To adopt this suggestion for no greater apparent reason than that the offender would be removed from Australia to return to his place origin and perhaps inspire others to take the risk seems to this Court to be a contrivance that would do little to assist in combating this type of activity within our national borders.
	
	
	The nature of this type of offending and its prevalence highlight the need for general deterrence. The relationship between criminal offending behaviour that produces such significant sums of ill-gotten gains and the involvement of facilitators who knowingly engage in what may be described commonly as “money laundering”, particularly through licensed premises such as a Casino is a relationship and course of conduct that operates to the detriment of the whole community. General deterrence and particular deterrence are both to be pursued in the course of sentencing.
	
	
	As was said by Wood J in R v Taylor [2000] NSWCCA 442 at [49]:
	


Suspended sentences provide little, if anything by way of general deterrence


	
	They would certainly provide no deterrence to those involved in organised crime conducted on a transnational basis such as exhibited in these proceedings. The ability for persons to enter Australia from overseas, facilitate the washing of money through a casino and leave before the agencies of law enforcement are aware of their presence and conduct is such that the need for general deterrence is paramount. I decline to deal with these matters by way of a suspended sentence.
	
	
	The defendant is convicted on each charge. On Sequence 2 and after application of the discount of 40% he is sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum period of 9 months with an additional period of 3 months, a total head sentence of 12 months. On Sequence 4 after application of the discount he is sentenced to a minimum period of 5 months and an additional period of 2 months, a total head sentence of 7 months. The relationship between the two offences in terms of time persuades the Court that the sentences should be served concurrently. Given the short parole period and the fact of the defendant's nationality I decline to order supervision on parole if released. Each sentence is to commence forthwith. The moneys seized are forfeited.
