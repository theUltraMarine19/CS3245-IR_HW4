GROUNDS OF DECISION
This Originating Summons was taken out in relation to the question of the custody of two infants, one Phang Min Chuan, male, born on 7 November 1981 and the other Peng Xiao Su, female, born on 30 December 1983. The plaintiff, aged 32, is the mother and the defendant, aged 39, the father. The parties were married on 15 July 1980 at the Registry of Marriages. The plaintiff is a clerk and the defendant, a tour-coach driver.
The parties gave different versions of the causes of the break-up of the marriage. Each party also asserted that he or she was better able to take care of the children. At the request of both parties I directed the Child Welfare Service of the Ministry of Community Development to inquire into the background of the case and put up a report. Upon giving due consideration to the affidavits of the parties and the welfare report, I decided to grant custody of the two children to the defendant. I ordered that the plaintiff shall have weekly access to them between 5.00pm Saturday and 5.00pm Sunday. Furthermore, I also gave the plaintiff additional access to the children during the school vacations; she is to have access during the first half of the periods of the school vacations in June and in November/December each year. The plaintiff is dissatisfied with my rulings and has appealed to the Court of Appeal.
In her first affidavit the plaintiff said that the defendant was always finding fault with her and the children. He had more interest in playing mahjong than in the welfare of the children. In her second affidavit she alleged that the defendant pampered the children and has a violent disposition. The defendant denied that he was a person who did not care for the plaintiff and the children. He gave examples of what he did for them to illustrate that he cared. While he admitted that he sometimes play mahjong (infrequently he said) with his colleagues, he alleged that the plaintiff was herself a habitual gambler, and on occasions would gamble the whole night through. He also alleged that the plaintiff is associating rather closely with another man, one Tan Swee Lim. I would note that this allegation was not denied by the plaintiff in her second affidavit though she refuted a lot of other things. The defendant averred that the plaintiff is not a concerned mother.
Matters came to a head on 31 March 1990 when the plaintiff left the matrimonial home bringing with her the two children. She brought the children to her mother's home. The mother helped the plaintiff to take care of them until about 10 May 1990 when the defendant took them away. The defendant explained that he was quite prepared to accept that arrangement and let the plaintiff have the children until he discovered that the plaintiff herself was not staying with her parents and that she had simply left the children with her parents. On this aspect the plaintiff, while admitting that the children were left with her mother, explained that she did that because she feared for their safety in the event that the defendant should confront them as the defendant is a person of ""violent disposition"". The plaintiff said that she was then staying with her younger sister. However, I would add that there is hardly any real evidence to show that the defendant was violent towards his children or would harm them.
The children have remained with the defendant since 10 May 1990. This OS was not taken out by the plaintiff until 29 January 1991 and it was not served until 8 May 1991. I should also add that while the parties were living together, the two children were cared for mainly by the maternal grandmother.
On 2 June 1990 there was an altercation at the house of the defendant which led to an application by the plaintiff for a Summons for a Personal Protection Order against the defendant. The summons was later withdrawn on the advice of the learned magistrate.
From the welfare report it would appear that the couples' separation was apparently due to the fact that the defendant had lent their car to a friend without the plaintiff's knowledge, when she needed the car. The defendant asked her to take a taxi. She said that she was very angry with his inconsiderate attitude. I had no doubt that there must have been considerable friction between them prior to that event. The car incident might well be the proverbial ""last straw"".
The plaintiff's parents' home is a four-room HDB flat (three bedrooms and a sitting room) at Serangoon Ave 4. The plaintiff and her youngest sister (unmarried) share a room. Her eldest brother and her father occupy one room. Her mother and another sister's child occupy the third room. The flat is quite congested though well maintained. There would appear to be no or limited room available for the two children. While it is true that she could, if she was given custody of the two children, apply for an HDB flat for herself and her children to live, the problem then would be that there would be no adult in the home when the plaintiff goes to work, unless some other arrangements are made.
The home condition of the defendant's parents is better. It is a two-storey semi-detached house with four bedrooms, a study room and a living room. The defendant and his two children occupy a room. The defendant's two unmarried brothers occupy a room each and the defendant's parents take the fourth room. Home environment is spacious and cosy.
Min Chuan, aged 10, appears to be a sensible boy. He indicated that he loves both parents but would choose to be with his father. Xiao Su, though younger (seven coming to eight at the time of interview) also expressed that she would like to stay with her father. Both the children relate well to paternal grandparents.
The welfare officer also had an opportunity to observe the children when their mother came to see them in school. They were quite happy with her. But there are indications that they also fear her. That may be a reason why they prefer to live with their father, the defendant.
Case law would appear to suggest that in respect of very young children, everything being equal, there is a tendency on the part of the court to lean in favour of granting custody to the mother - see Re B (an infant) < 1962 > 1 All ER 872; Koh Teng Lam v Elsie Koh Chen Chee and anor < 1976 > 1 MLJ 103 at 117; Kades v Kades < 1961-2 > 3 AJLR 251; Shanta Kumari v Vijayan < 1986 > 2 MLJ 216; and Re W (a minor) < 1983 >4 FLR 16. But it is clear that we are not here dealing with very young children. On the date when I made the order the son was ten years' old and the girl was coming to be eight. They need parental guidance but certainly not of the sort of care which a todler will require and which a mother is better able to give. I think this passage of Evershed MR in Re B (an infant) (at p. 873) set out the position correctly:-
""For my part I do not believe that in those cases there is any such thing as a rule. Every case must plainly be determined on the particular circumstances affecting the case, though it is, of course, true to say that as a matter of human sense a young child is better with its mother and needs a mother's care.""
In terms of care and concern for the children, it seems to me that there is very little to choose between the two parents. Each was obviously trying to paint a darker picture of the other. On this count I would treat them both as equal - equally concerned for the children. As regards care arrangement, I would say both sides are just as satisfactory. The plaintiff's mother is willing to care for the children when the plaintiff is at work. The defendant's parents are also happy to care for the two grandchildren. While some doubts were cast by the plaintiff whether the defendant's parents are in a healthy state to care for the children, this was not borne out by the welfare report.
While physical accommodation for the children is not necessarily an important consideration, it is nevertheless a consideration which the court is entitled to take into account in the overall assessment. On this score the balance is in favour of the father.
Next is the question of the wishes of the children. Their preference is unquestionably with the father. Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act requires the court, in determining custody, to regard the welfare of the child as the ""first and paramount consideration."" Section 119 of the Women's Charter also provides that in deciding the question of custody the paramount consideration is the welfare of the child but it goes on to say that, subject to that, the court shall have regard to the wishes of the child where he or she is of an age to express an independant opinion. Though s. 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act does not refer to the wishes of the child, I think there cannot be any doubt that the court, even apart from s. 119 of the Women's Charter, is entitled to have regard to that.
Having weighed all the relevant factors and bearing in mind that the paramount consideration is the welfare of the children, and here I should like to add that I was conscious that ""paramount"" does not mean exclusive: see Re L (infants) < 1962 > 3 All ER 1, I felt that the scale tilted in favour of the defendant and decided that the father should have custody of the children. The children are clearly happy where they are and there is nothing to indicate that the father is unsuitable to care for them or that insufficient care arrangements have been made for them. They want to remain there. They have care, comfort and attention. The father seems to be giving them the security they need. The children had stayed with their father for almost a complete year before the OS herein, taken out earlier, was served on their father. In my judgment it would be in their best interest to remain where they are. I did not think there was anything to warrant moving them. Indeed, in my view, it might be contrary to their well-being to make any change. I am glad to note no one has suggested that the two children should be separated.
As the children are schooling, access would necessarily have to be over the weekend. Thus, I ordered that the plaintiff shall have weekly access to the children between 5.00pm, Saturday and 5.00pm, Sunday. I also ordered that she should have additional access during the school vacations as indicated earlier.",1992-01-31 00:00:00,SG High Court
